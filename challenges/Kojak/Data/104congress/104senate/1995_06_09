Under the previous order, the Senate will \nnow resume consideration of S. 652, the telecommunications bill, which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 652) to provide for a pro-competitive, \n     deregulatory national policy framework designed to accelerate \n     rapidly private sector deployment of advanced \n     telecommunications and information technologies and services \n     to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to \n     competition, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Dole amendment No. 1255, to provide additional deregulation \n     of telecommunications services, including rural and small \n     cable TV systems.\n       Dorgan modified amendment No. 1264, to require Department \n     of Justice approval for regional Bell operating company entry \n     into long distance services, based on the VIII(c) standard.\n       Thurmond modified amendment No. 1265 (to amendment No. \n     1264), to provide for the review by the Attorney General of \n     the United States of the entry of the Bell operating \n     companies into interexchange telecommunications and \n     manufacturing markets.\n       Hollings/Daschle amendment No. 1266, to clarify the \n     requirements a Bell operating company must satisfy before \n     being permitted to offer long distance services.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n  Amendment No. 1265, as Modified, to Amendment No. 1264, as Modified\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, we now resume the discussion of S. 652, in \nparticular the amendment before us, which is, as I understand it, the \nsecond-degree amendment offered by the Senator from South Carolina to \nthe amendment from the Senator from North Dakota; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KERREY. I have not yet read, or we have not yet seen the \namendment from the distinguished Senator from South Carolina. But I am \ngoing to make some presumptions here that I understand in general terms \nwhat it is about. I think in that amendment, there is a possibility of \na compromise here, something that could satisfy both sides and get us \nto a point where we have a bill where we are going to get large numbers \nof people rather than a relatively smaller number of people supporting \nthe legislation.\n  I believe that S. 652 in its current form, unamended, is not good for \nthe American consumer. I will make it [[Page S8056]] clear on that. I \ndo not believe the American consumer will enjoy the full benefits of \ncompetition with S. 652 in its current form. The reason I believe that \nis that competition will not bring the kinds of benefits to the \nAmerican consumer unless that competition comes from the bottom up, \nfrom entrepreneurs who have a chance to come to our households--100 \nmillion households total in the United States of America--and offer us \npackaged information services through two alternative lines coming into \nour home--a telephone line and a cable line.\n  If they have an opportunity to come into that environment and say, \nwell, Mr. Kerrey, we would like to sell you a packaged service of \nvoice, video, or text; you are purchasing services today of $120 to \n$150 a month, and we can sell that to you for $75, $80, or $90 a month, \nin that kind of a competitive environment, the prices will come down \nand the quality is going to go up in the four big areas where \nhouseholds tend to see services.\n  No. 1, the price is going to go down for the switching services; that \nis, the movement of the bundled data from household to household or \nfrom household to business or vice versa.\n  We will see reductions in the cost of the manufactured hardware that \nis used in the home, regardless of what that hardware is, as the market \ntries to give better and better service.\n  We will see prices come down in the content--that package I described \nearlier--and we will see prices come down and quality come up in a \nrange of services that household services buy.\n  My fear is that in a good faith effort to produce a means to replace \nthe VIII(c) test--I apologize for getting a little technical--what the \ncommittee did in a good faith effort to replace the VIII(c), test which \nI believe 18 members of the committee last year voted for in S. 1822 \nthat was tied up late last fall, to replace that test, the committee \ncame up with 134 individual things that the ARBOC, the local telephone \ncompany, has to have before they are allowed into long distance \nservice.\n  That is kind of a summary, I believe, the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina last evening gave as to how those 14 items did, in fact, \nreplace this old test that was S. 1822, a bill that was supported by 18 \nmembers of the Commerce Committee last year.\n  The reason I say with respect that I do not feel that is adequate is, \nagain, the Justice Department has the expertise of managing \nunprecedented movements from a monopoly situation to a competitive \nsituation. We need that. That is a service that the people of the \nUnited States of America need. That is what this whole bill is about.\n  If we look at the title, title I is ``Transition to Competition''; \ntitle II, ``Removal of Restrictions to Competition''; title III, ``An \nEnd to Regulation.''\n  Mr. President, the only people in the U.S. Capital, the people's \nCapital, with experience in all these three of those areas is the \nAntitrust Division of the Department, approximately 800 people. We will \nnot fall into the illusion that this is an enormous bureaucracy over \nthere just busting at the seams with all sorts of people. It is \napproximately 800 people that run the Antitrust Division at Justice, \nand they managed the movement from a monopoly, AT, to our current \ncompetitive environment we have in long distance.\n  We are talking about doing the same thing with local telephone \nservice. It seems to me, Mr. President, for those who want to survive \nthis vote, who want to not just get a pat on the back as we walk out of \nhere on final passage from those folks in industry that are out there \nhoping we vote the right way, whichever way that is, if we hope to get \na pat on the back by our consumers, by our citizens, by our voters--and \nI would argue that is, in the end, the ultimate test--then we need to \ngo to that agency that has experience in managing an unprecedented \nevent, a movement from a monopoly situation at the local telephone \nservice to a competitive environment.\n  This is going to be an extremely difficult thing to do. As I \nunderstand it, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina has \nproposed an amendment. I have not seen that amendment yet. He has \nproposed an amendment that might, in fact, solve problems that people \nhave about having dual authority here. As I understand it, it may \nreduce the role of the FCC while giving the Department of Justice some \nadditional authority. It seems to me that that is the right direction \nto go.\n  I want to walk through a little bit here this morning, and I will \nstop and yield afterward to anyone else that wants to talk on this \nissue.\n  There is, I think, legitimate concerns about what this will mean in \nterms of the time that is taken. In a time we are trying to get rid of \nregulation, which we are trying to do, we ought not have any \nunnecessary regulation.\n  I am prepared to support any person that has an amendment that says, \nhere is something we will regulate that does not add any value at all; \nall it does is slow things down. I am prepared to vote for the \nelimination of any regulation that still is in the bill that might be \nunnecessary and that might add unnecessary costs.\n  The procedures for a Bell operating company entering into long \ndistance--under the amendments proposed, the underlying Dorgan \namendment, the Bell operating company would file an application to get \ninto long distance. The Department of Justice and the Federal \nCommunications Commission would review and proceed simultaneously. \nTheir reviews go forward at the same time. We do not go to one and then \nto the other. We go to both simultaneously and each reviews something \ndifferent. The Bell operating company has an answer within 90 days \nafter application in accordance with a date certain established by \nCongress.\n  For Members that are wondering about how this will all work out and \nwhether or not this is going to delay things, the language of the \nDorgan amendment provides a date certain for an answer to be given by \nthe Department of Justice to the Bell operating corporation applying \nfor permission to get into long distance. The procedure is fast--90 \ndays. It is fast.\n  We can set into the Record, with people who are experienced with how \nthe courts work, if we need stronger colloquies filed so the courts \nunderstand that 90 days means 90 days, then we will do that and make \ncertain that the time will be 90 days and that extensions are not \ngranted for this particular procedure.\n  The standard for DOJ is clear, Mr. President. There is not ambiguity \nhere. It is based on a well-established law applying both the Clayton \nAct and, by the way, the VIII(c) test under MFJ. The procedure will \nreduce litigation. Make no mistake about it. In my estimation, the \nexisting law as written will encourage litigation and prolong the \nprocess. If Members believe it will do the opposite, come and say that \nit will do the opposite.\n  I am saying that my concern, as one Member that has one vote here, is \nthat we come here and try to satisfy citizens--in this case, citizens \nas consumers--and I say that the existing law, in my judgment, will \nproduce consumer confusion, it will produce consumer dissatisfaction, \nand it will produce problems that are going to cause Members who vote \nfor it in its current form to say, well, I did not realize it would do \nthat. Maybe we can come back in afterward and fix it with an amendment. \nUnfortunately, it is likely to be the very amendment we are considering \ntoday.\n  I said at the beginning that somewhere in the mix, somewhere in the \nmix, and I appreciate what we are basically doing is trying to figure \nout some way to continue the work that the senior Senator from Nebraska \ncame up with this compromise language in committee. He is the one that \nhas taken the lead on this. I understand the committee had a difficult \ntime balancing and getting this stuff done.\n  Somewhere in the mix is a way for Members to give DOJ a role, perhaps \nlimit and reduce some of the regulation that is at the FCC, and give \nthose Members who are concerned about how we will manage this \ntransition from monopoly to competition, give those Members that have \nthat kind of concern some satisfaction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I wanted to inquire, if the regular order is \ncalled for, it is my understanding that the amendment I offered would \nbe pending; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. That would be subject to a second-degree amendment? \n[[Page S8057]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. I am not certain when we can agree on a vote. I know for \nthe Senator from North Dakota, this is a central issue, the one we are \ndebating now. I am not trying to crowd anyone. I want to try to make \nsome headway this morning. If Members believe that Friday is Friday and \nwe do not vote on Friday, nobody will ever be here on Friday.\n  We are going to have votes this morning, and I would like to \naccommodate everybody's request. I wonder if there is any objection--\nand I do not want to offend anyone--to calling for the regular order.\n  As I understand, the Senator from Pennsylvania has a second-degree \namendment to my amendment. We are still trying to work out my amendment \nand the Daschle amendment, so we do not have one leader getting his \nadopted, the other not. We are trying to work that out.\n  Is there any objection if we proceed on that basis?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No objection.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending amendment \nfor Senator Santorum to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Reserving the right to object, I do not believe I intend \nto object. As I understand, the Senator is asking to proceed to the \nSantorum amendment with no agreement as to how long we will debate the \nSantorum amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes, we will lay aside the big amendment that the Senator \nis concerned about, Senator Dorgan's, and my amendment--just go ahead \nand offer it, period. That is all right.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object. I would like to speak for \na moment on the Department of Justice amendment, after which I have no \nobjection to setting it aside and going to the Santorum amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending amendment \nfor the Senator from Pennsylvania to offer an amendment with the \nunderstanding the Senator from North Dakota is going to be first \nrecognized for a moment to make a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized for a moment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Nebraska, appropriately \nframed the issue of the role of the Department of Justice in the \ntelecommunications legislation--or more appropriately put, the role the \nDepartment of Justice does not yet have in the telecommunications \nlegislation and the reason many of us believe the legislation should be \namended. For those who have not been involved in studying this \nlegislation, I want to describe, again, why I think a role for the \nJustice Department is central to telecommunications legislation.\n  In 1934, when the Telecommunications Act was written originally, the \nissue was regulating a monopoly. Why must you regulate a monopoly? If \nyou do not regulate a monopoly, a monopoly will do whatever it chooses \nto do to the American citizens and to the consumers. Regulating a \nmonopoly was important in 1934.\n  Mr. President, we are rewriting that telecommunications law today in \nthe Senate. The issue is no longer reregulating or regulating a \nmonopoly; the issue is deregulation and competition. That requires a \ndifferent legislative approach.\n  The breakup of AT into the regional Bell operating companies and \nthe long distance companies, has created a substantially different kind \nof telecommunications network in our country.\n  In the long distance area we have robust, healthy, vibrant \ncompetition. Literally, hundreds of companies are involved in \ncompetitive efforts to market long distance services. These competitive \nefforts bring choice to consumers, generally at lower prices. We have \nseen a very substantial drop in charges for long distance services.\n  We have not seen similar circumstances in local service. This \ntelecommunications bill must provide conditions under which local \nservices will also have competition. The Bell operating companies are \nnot now free to go out and compete with the long distance companies \nbecause they have a monopoly in most places in local service. It is not \nfair for the Bell operating companies to have a monopoly in local \nservice, retain that monopoly and get involved in competitive \ncircumstances in long distance service.\n  Most of the Bell companies want to get involved in the long distance \nbusiness and this piece of legislation establishes the conditions under \nwhich that will occur.\n  The question before us is, When is competition in local service \nsufficient so that the Bell companies will be freed to provide long \ndistance service? The piece of legislation before us establishes a role \nfor the Federal Communications Commission to evaluate or to judge when \nthat competition exists. Traditionally, that judgment role would be \nmade at the Department of Justice. That is what the Justice Department \ndoes. That is their background and expertise. The Justice Department \nevaluates competition. It is the agency that deals with antitrust, \nmonopoly, and competition issues.\n  The role of the Justice Department was, I assume, deliberately left \nout of this legislation for a number of reasons. I assume some people \nwanted there to be less aggressiveness in determining whether there is, \nin fact, real competition at the local level before the Bell operating \ncompanies are allowed to compete in the long distance area. One \ninteresting point, last year, when the Senate Commerce Committee passed \nthis legislation, and last year when the House of Representatives \npassed this legislation with 420 votes, a role for the Justice \nDepartment was in the telecommunications bill.\n  Last year the Justice Department was to have a full role in \nevaluating whether competition exists. This year, it does not. The \nquestion is, Why? What has changed? Nothing has changed. Consumers \nstill need protection. Our responsibilities to make certain consumers \nare served the way they should be served has not changed. If we are \nmoving from a period where we talked about regulated monopolies to a \nperiod where we are talking about deregulated competition, why should \nthose who talked the loudest about deregulation not also be those who \nare most aggressive in making sure that competition really exists? \nBecause competition, it seems to me, is the linchpin of a free market \nsystem.\n  If you have less competition, then your free market system does not \nwork very well; it is not very free. If you have broader competition, \nrobust, healthy competition, that is when the free market system works. \nIn this legislation, the role of the Justice Department is to make sure \nthat there is real competition before we release the Bell operating \ncompanies to get involved in long distance services.\n  I think a Department of Justice role is the most important issue we \nwill deal with on the floor of the Senate in this legislation. It deals \nwith literally hundreds of billions of dollars. The consumers are at \nsubstantial risk if we make the wrong decisions. I believe if we think \nour way through this issue as we construct this legislation on the \nfloor of the Senate, we will reach the right result. And the right \nresult clearly is for the Department of Justice to have a role.\n  The Senator from South Carolina believes it should happen. That is \nwhy he has offered an amendment. I believe it should happen that is why \nI offered an amendment. It is true we come at it in different ways, but \nthey are, in many ways, not so far apart. And I am hoping in not too \nmany hours we can reach some sort of common understanding between our \namendments and resolve the differences we have. The technical \ndifference is I am proposing what is called an VIII(c) standard, and he \nis dealing with a Clayton 7 standard. These standards are not so \ndifferent. The best approach will be if we can, the Senator from South \nCarolina and others on both sides of this issue, find a way to merge \nthese two approaches so the Justice Department retains a strong role in \nthis legislation to protect the public interest. After all, protecting \nthe public interest is what this legislation must do in the final \nanalysis.\n  I appreciate very much the work and the words of my colleague from \nNebraska, Senator Kerrey.\n  I think the coalition of us, Senator Kerrey, myself, Senator \nThurmond, Senator Leahy, Senator Simon, and so many others, can amend \nthis legislation before this debate is over. [[Page S8058]] \n  If we do that, I think the winner will be the American people and the \nfree market system in our country that works only when there is healthy \nand robust competition.\n  So I know we are going to set this legislation aside and go to a \nSantorum amendment, after which we will come back to it. There are a \nnumber of Members who wish to come to the floor and speak on this \nissue--Senator Simon, Senator Leahy, and others. I hope at the end of \nthe debate we will have succeeded in amending the telecommunications \nbill to include a Justice Department role. I think it is important for \nthe American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Reserving the right to object. As in morning business? I \nthought the Senator was going to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am still waiting to hear if there is an agreement on \nmy offering the amendment. We are waiting to hear from Members on your \nside of the aisle.\n  Mr. KERREY. Did the majority leader not earlier ask? Is that what we \nare proceeding under? I thought we were going to----\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Nebraska, \nwhat we are trying to do is get an agreement on when we are going to \nvote, if we can get a 10:30 agreement to vote. Does anybody object to \nvoting at 10:30? Otherwise, we will have a Sergeant at Arms vote. There \nis going to be a vote. Either vote on the amendment or have a live \nquorum and we will have a vote. It is up to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I just got this amendment. I am not going to agree to a \ntime of 10:30 or any other time at the moment until I review this \namendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. We had an agreement last night, I understand, with the \nSenator for 10 o'clock. He had the amendment in his hand last night.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, 10 o'clock--my understanding last night \nwas we were going to take it up at 10 o'clock. I did not understand.\n  Mr. DOLE. Take it up at 9:15, vote at 10. Now we are going to take it \nup at 9:45, vote in 45 minutes. I understand it is a very technical \namendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Let me just continue what I am doing, which is reviewing \nthe amendment which I am looking at now for the first time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

I rise to continue my vigil in pointing out the lack of \nleadership of the President in coming forward and offering a balanced \nbudget resolution. I have been in the Chamber noting the days that have \npassed since the Republicans in the Senate brought to the floor a \nbalanced budget resolution which lay out a chart, a plan in specific \ndetail, of how we would achieve a balanced budget over the next 7 \nyears. Since that time, the President has played coyly with this issue \nand unfortunately has not come to the table. In fact, he has done a \nwhole lot of things that lead many of us to believe we are not so sure \nhe is ever going to come to the table.\n  Mr. KERREY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have not been in the Chamber before when \nthe Senator brought this chart down. I am 51 years old, 51 years old. I \nspent 3 years in the world's largest, most powerful Navy. And I was \ntaught, when I was in the Navy, the Commander in Chief, the President \nof the United States, deserved respect, and I never called the \nPresident of the United States by his first name in public, let alone \non the floor of the Senate.\n  I just ask my colleague, do you feel this is respectful? You can \ndisagree with the President, say you have something you do not like \nabout what he is doing, but, for God sakes, ``Where is Bill?'' I ask my \ncolleague----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I can reclaim my time, I would suggest to the \nSenator from Nebraska that the reason this chart was put forward really \nis as a response to some of the comments made by the Senator from \nMassachusetts about the previous President. You remember the famous \nstatement repeated over and over and over again in the 1992 election, \n``Where is George?'' How many times?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Excuse me. How many times did we hear that refrain \nthroughout the course of the election? So I would just----\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a followup \nquestion on that?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, is the Senator from Pennsylvania saying \nessentially then if somebody else does something that he finds \nobjectionable, because the other person has done it, therefore it \nestablishes a precedent and he does not mind doing it as well? Is the \nSenator from Pennsylvania saying he is following the example of the \nSenator from Massachusetts, that whenever the Senator from \nMassachusetts does something, even though he may object to it, he is \ngoing to cite it as a precedent? The question that I asked was, does he \nrespect the Commander in Chief, the President of the United States, \nenough to call him by a name that is worthy of that respect, regardless \nof whether he disagrees? If you want to bring up these opinions, bring \nup these policies, bring up whatever you want to the floor----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to reclaim the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I think you will find the dialog that has occurred in \ncharting the number of days that the President has refused to offer a \nbudget has been very respectful of the President in referring to him as \nthe President.\n  The point of the chart is apparent.\n  I find it ironic that when this was going on by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, I do not remember anybody coming to the well, much less \nthe Senator from Nebraska coming to the well, defending President Bush \nfrom those similar attacks. So I think it----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Depends on whose ox is being gored as to who is \noffended by the remarks. I can appreciate the constructive dialog, but \nI think it is a suitable poster and will continue with it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator would yield for a moment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate it very much. The Senator refers to the \nSenator from Massachusetts. My recollection of the dialog ``Where's \nGeorge?'' was that it occurred at a political convention. Is the \nSenator from Pennsylvania equating the floor of the Senate with a \npolitical convention?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am not equating the floor of the Senate with a \npolitical convention, no.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my friend will yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from South \nDakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I think in American society we refer respectfully to \nour President. I have heard various Presidents referred to by their \nfirst name on the Senate floor. I do not want to start digging it out. \nWe have a friendly society. We refer to our President by first name or \nlast name. We have good, healthy debate. I think that this whole \nobjection here is nonsense. And I urge----\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I urge the Senator from Pennsylvania to proceed.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the time.\n  Mr. KERREY. Parliamentary point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his point.\n  Mr. KERREY. I just heard my comment referred to as nonsense. Is that \ncorrect?\n[[Page S8059]]\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I did not refer to the Senator's comment as nonsense. I \njust said this whole debate I think----\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I believe you have to look long and hard \nto find a Member who comes here and refers to the President by his \nfirst name, whether it is President Clinton, President Bush, or \nPresident Reagan. You have to look long and hard to find it. I \nappreciate the Senator from Pennsylvania thinks it is humorous. I do \nnot.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time belongs to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. He has done an effective job in \nmoving this debate along to a vote at 10:30, and I appreciate the \nopportunity to have this discourse.\n  I think it may indicate that there is a sensitivity of the members of \nthe President's party about the President's lack of leadership. And I \nunderstand that sensitivity. I understand that there may be justifiably \nsome embarrassment about the lack of leadership by this President and \njumping into his defense on something other than the substance of what \nwe are discussing here.\n  We are not discussing substance in this little interplay. We sort of \ngot off the track. Let us talk about the substance. The substance is \nthat I have to put--I did not get a chance to get to the floor \nyesterday, but I have to put now ``22''--22 days with no proposal to \nbalance the budget from the President.\n  I will show you the chart I had the other day that was in the \nWashington Times. And again I understand the embarrassment of the other \nside on this issue. I understand they are a little sensitive about this \nbecause I am sure it is something I would not be proud of if it was my \nPresident on the Republican side.\n  But here is what Michael McCurry in a dialog with the reporter from \nthe Washington Times said about the balanced budget amendment and the \nPresident on Larry King earlier this week suggesting that he may have a \nbalanced budget resolution. The question was:\n\n       Where does President Clinton stand on writing his own \n     budget now?\n\n  The answer from the press secretary:\n\n       As he indicated last night in his television interview, \n     he's prepared to contribute his ideas to the budget at the \n     appropriate time.\n\n  Washington Times question:\n\n       What does that mean?\n\n  Michael McCurry, White House Press Secretary:\n\n       It means we're ducking the question for now.\n\n  ``We're ducking the question for now.'' The President of the United \nStates, who has the responsibility to lead this Nation, is ducking the \nquestion for now.\n  I understand the embarrassment. I understand the sensitivity that \nmany Democrats in this Chamber have about a President who is ducking \nthe question, who is ducking the issue, who is refusing to lead, who is \ntaking a back seat to all domestic policy in this country as we work \nhere in the Congress to get it done and work, as we see in this case, \non a bipartisan basis to get it done, but again without the leadership \nof the White House. Here we are debating probably one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation that we are going to get a chance to \ndebate that is going to affect our economy for a long, long time. We \nhave very important fiscal matters to be concerned with here in getting \nour budget in order and tax policy and other Government program \npolicies like welfare. But when it comes to regulating the private \nsector, this bill is probably as important as ever and the President \nhas not been offering his own telecommunications bill, not putting \nforward leadership on that area, basically standing back and sniping, \nsaying, well, I do not like this or I do not like that.\n  But where is the leadership? Where is the leadership on welfare \nreform as he goes around the country talking about how the Republican \nplan is mean spirited and terrible, and yet he has offered no plan this \nyear. The plan he offered last year was cast aside by his own Congress, \nthe Democratic Congress, as a joke, as irrelevant, as a nonstarter, as \nnot even meeting the straight-faced test of incremental reform.\n  And so we have a President on that major issue domestically, who has \njust taken a walk and now this week he trots out the veto pen, on what? \nOn reducing the deficit. On reducing the deficit, on a bill that was \nbipartisan, that was signed. This bill was signed on by the ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee on the Democratic side as well \nas on the Republican side and passed with over 60 votes in the Senate, \nand he vetoed it.\n  I have to quote the Senator from Oregon, Senator Hatfield, who came \nto the floor during the debate and said in his tenure on the \nAppropriations Committee, which spans six Presidents--six Presidents--\nhe has never been in a conference committee where the President of the \nUnited States did not send a representative to negotiate the conference \nreport. Every President has always sent a member of his staff to sit in \nthe conference committee when they are drafting the report, to \nnegotiate the final deal so we could settle it. The President did not \nsend anybody. He said that is the first time in his history on the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Now, there is a complete abdication of leadership. And so after an \nhonest bipartisan effort was put together in the conference report, \nvoila, the President decides it is not good enough for him even though \nhe had no input into the process. I think it just goes to show you that \nwhat we have is a President who has decided to start running for the \n1996 election and forget about serving in the office of the President. \nThe whole concept now is just simply to run for office, to run against \nthe Congress, not to offer anything, because if you offer anything, \nthen you can be held down to specifics and people can criticize you. If \nyou just criticize the other side, well, then all you do is pander to \nthe different groups that you have to get to get elected.\n  And that is what is going on here. There is no substance coming out \nof that White House whether it is telecommunications, whether it is \nwelfare, whether it is rescissions, whether it is balancing the budget. \nIt is a continuation of, as the majority leader so eloquently said, the \na.w.o.l. strategy of the President, absence without leadership. I think \nwe should demand better.\n  And so I have set myself on this mission of coming here. I try to get \nhere every day, but sometimes because of the floor schedule and the \nbusiness we have at hand, I have not had a chance to do it every day. \nBut I get here just about every day and put up the chart and count. I \nhave been informed by my staff that we have, I think it was, 135 days \nbetween the time----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Is the morning \nbusiness time requested 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). There was no limit placed on the \nmorning business.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, so I will probably have to have another \nlittle doohickey over here so we can put the ``1'' here, because it \nwill be 135 days where the President is not going to offer a bill.\n  Again, he made comments on the Larry King show earlier this week that \nhe was going to come up with a plan. He had talked about a plan that \nwas going to balance the budget. This was, I think, day 6. He talked \nabout a plan that was going to balance the budget over 10 years. That \nwas his mission; that he was going to come up with that.\n  I did a little homework and found out that the last plan that was \naround here to balance the budget in 10 years that was offered never \nactually came to the floor of the House, but it was put together. It \nwas by the chairman of the Budget Committee at the time. The chairman \nof the Budget Committee at that time was Leon Panetta, now Chief of \nStaff at the White House. But at the time of putting this budget \ntogether in 1991, he was chairman of the Budget Committee. This was \nafter the Bush budget battle of 1990, and he thought it would be \nresponsible.\n  I give him credit for this, because I was on the Budget Committee at \nthe time and worked very closely with then Chairman Panetta. I had the \nutmost respect for him and his ardor in putting forward plans to put \nthis country back on sound fiscal footing. I was not always in \nagreement with how he did it, but I know then Chairman Panetta really \nhad a strong motivation to deal with these problems, face up and \n[[Page S8060]] to do it in a way that was honest, no gimmicks. This was \na legitimate attempt by then Chairman Panetta to deal with these \nissues.\n  I found it ironic that when he actually put the document together--it \nwas in late 1991--he not only did not even bring it up in the Budget \nCommittee, but he was roundly criticized by those on his side of the \naisle, so he pulled it down.\n  I must tell you, it was a budget to balance the budget over 10 years. \nThere were some interesting points in it. What you find is that, very \nmuch like the Republican budget that was put forward and passed by the \nSenate and the House, it called for reductions in growth in entitlement \nspending. It called for reductions in growth in Medicare. It called for \nreductions in growth in Medicaid. It called for reductions in growth in \nFederal retirement programs. If you go on down the list on what the \nRepublicans are now being roundly criticized for, the Panetta budget in \n1991 was very similar in respect, maybe not to degree, but certainly \nsimilar in the programs that it went after, the recognition of where \nthe problem was, and focused on entitlements as the biggest area for \nresolution of that problem.\n  The other interesting thing is that only two-thirds of the deficit \nreduction was achieved as a result of spending reductions. Two-thirds \nwere achieved through spending reductions. The other one-third of \ndeficit reduction was achieved through a tax increase. A little over \n$400 billion in new taxes, not specified, but new taxes that were going \nto be placed on the American public.\n  Maybe it goes back to the reason why the President has been so shy \nabout offering this or bringing to light this 10-year budget. I am of \nthe opinion that maybe what the Chief of Staff of the White House did \nwas rummage through some of his old budget files when he was Budget \nchairman or have someone dig up his 1991 proposed budget and offered \nthat to the President: ``See, Mr. President, we can do it.''\n  I know again how concerned the Chief of Staff is about the budget \ndeficit and how honest he was in dealing with that. I believe he has \nbeen a voice in the White House saying, ``Let's be responsible. Let's \ngo out and show how we are going to do it, and let's bite the bullet \nlike the Republicans have in the Congress, and lead this country into \nthe future. Mr. President, here was my plan to get there. You should \nlook at it.''\n  So what the President probably did was read it and probably voiced he \nhas a plan he is looking at, a 10-year plan, to balance the budget. But \nit, unfortunately, contains another big tax increase. This tax increase \nwould actually pale by comparison to what the President and the last \nCongress passed in 1993. This was, as I said before, close to $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion dollars in new taxes on the American public to solve this \nproblem.\n  I think if you looked at the debate during consideration of the \nbudget resolution, there certainly was not a fervor to go out and raise \ntaxes. I know there were a couple of Members who voiced that concern, \nbut frankly, that sentiment was roundly dismissed by both sides of the \naisle as something that was not only not in the public's interest but \ncertainly not in the interest of the economy.\n  If we look now at what is going on with the economy and the effect of \nthe 1993 tax increase on the economy and the fact that we had the \nlargest ever payment of taxes in April, the largest amount of money \never written to the Internal Revenue Service at tax time was this last \nApril where they sent an enormous amount of money--I think the number \nis around $20 billion in tax payments paid over what the previous \nrecord was--some economists are suggesting that is one of the reasons \nwe may be seeing the slowdown now, because that tax time and that tax \nincrease drew so much money out of the economy that it had the \ndampening effect of reducing the rate of growth and possibly even \nspinning us into a recession.\n  So I think everyone realizes that tax increases are not the way to \ndeal with the budget deficit. I think we saw from the debate just a few \nweeks ago--I do not remember an amendment that called for a tax \nincrease--that in fact suggested we should solve the problem by \ninstituting new taxes.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. EXON. My question of the Senator from Pennsylvania is simply that \nwe have, as I understand it, very important business to transact. Can \nthe Senator advise me as to how long he intends to hold the floor on \nthe matter that we have heard from him on several occasions?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I expect I will be talking for a few more minutes. I \nknow the leader would like to get a vote and is seeking a unanimous \nconsent agreement to get a vote on a----\n  Mr. EXON. If I might, I simply advise my colleague, as I understand \nit, the Republicans have a golf game this afternoon. I am sure that is \na high-priority item. But this measure before us, which I would like to \nget to, is a very important piece of legislation for America.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I reclaim the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I do not know anything about that. I have some very \npressing business of my own which, hopefully, can wait. My wife is \nexpecting our third child, and we are hoping that will come tomorrow. \nWe are very anxious about that. Things are looking good. I would like \nto be home tomorrow. But if Senate business calls, Senate business \ncalls, and I will be here if I need be.\n  I know what we would like to do is proceed on some of these \namendments. I have these notes passed to me saying no one wants to \nagree to vote on anything; we want to stall and delay.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my friend will yield, I think what is going on, \nSenator Dole is trying to get an agreement for a vote at 10:30 and has \nbeen unable to do so. But I say respectfully to everybody, when I was a \nlieutenant in the Army--a mere second lieutenant--LBJ was referred to \naffectionately, at least by my superiors, as ``LBJ.''\n  Also on this floor I heard the term ``Reaganomics'' used a great deal \nback at the point when it was thought not to be popular. I am very \nrespectful, as I am sure my friend is, of the President of the United \nStates.\n  Let me say, whether it is Ike, FDR, LBJ, Reaganomics, Bush-whack--I \nhave heard all these terms around the Senate over the years. I just \nwant to point that out because I am very respectful, as I am sure the \nSenator from Pennsylvania is.\n  Military service was mentioned. When I was a second lieutenant, we \nused to affectionately and supportively refer to LBJ as LBJ. Maybe we \nneed a new form of rules because past Presidents have been referred to \nin a variety of ways on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KERREY. Will the Senator yield for an explanation? I say to my \ncolleague----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will not yield.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator brings an amendment to the floor and then \nstands up for a discussion. It should not be a surprise the amendment \nis being delayed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. I will quickly wrap up my \nremarks, and, hopefully, we can move to the vote soon.\n  In response to some of the comments, I know this amendment was made \navailable last night, and it is really a minor, technical amendment. I \nhope that is something we can agree to down the road.\n  I think it is important. I understand telecommunications is \nimportant, and if we can get agreements, we can move forward on it.\n But this is also important. The role of the President in this country \nover the next 18 months, and whether he is going to be a leader of this \ncountry in moving forward on the domestic agenda, whether it is \ntelecommunications or balanced budget or welfare reform, or a whole \nhost of other areas, is important.\n\n  The Presidency--an office I respect--is important to this country. In \nfact, that is the reason I am here, because I think it is important. I \nthink it is necessary for the President to step forward and offer \nsuggestions, to lead the [[Page S8061]] country. If I did not think it \nwas important, if I did not think the President had a role, if I did \nnot think the President was in fact the leader of the free world, then \nI probably would not be here. He would be like any other American who \ndid not have to participate in the process.\n  Well, he was elected to participate in the process; he was elected to \nlead this country; he was elected to change this country. What he has \ndone is elected not to participate. I think we need to point that out. \nWe need to continue to point that out until he elects to participate.\n  So I will be back and I will talk about the number of days with no \nproposal to balance the budget from President Clinton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8058-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              QUORUM CALL\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, let me indicate this is the first time we \nhave had a vote like this all year. I do not like these kinds of votes \nbecause it punishes people who are not here for no good reason, but we \ncould not get an agreement to vote on an amendment and, as I understand \nit, we are not going to get any time agreement on any amendment.\n  The managers have been doing an excellent job, I want to indicate, \nboth to Senator Pressler and Senator Hollings. I would like to complete \naction on this bill. It is a very important bill. No one is trying to \nrush it, but if we cannot get an agreement on a technical vote, I do \nnot know what other recourse there is but sometime today to file \ncloture, have a pro forma session tomorrow, and then have a cloture \nvote on Monday around 5 o'clock to see if we cannot speed up movement \nof this bill.\n  If there is a willingness to agree to vote on the very important \namendment offered by Senator Dorgan and Senator Thurmond from South \nCarolina, even at 5 o'clock on Monday, if we could agree to vote at 5 \no'clock on Monday, agree to vote on the Santorum amendment here in the \nnext 30 minutes? Failing that, we will have no recourse. Under the \norder, as I understand it, the Senator from Pennsylvania will be \nrecognized to offer his amendment. We can have a vote, move to table \nthe amendment, vote against tabling, and we can have another vote and \nanother vote. But we do not make any progress.\n  But if the Senator from Nebraska is determined, as I believe he is, \nthat we will not have any agreements or any votes, then we will just \nhave to have some procedural votes between now and 2 o'clock.\n  If there is any inclination on anybody's part to make any kind of \nagreement, certainly I am prepared as the leader to try to accommodate \nall of my colleagues, many of whom are not here today, and many of whom \nwould like not to be here today.\n  But, having said that, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, if I may respond, what transpired here \nthis morning was we were debating the second-degree amendment offered \nby the Senator from South Carolina to the underlying amendment offered \nlast night by the Senator from North Dakota. We had a short period of \ndebate last night. We came in here early this morning. We had just \nbegun the debate and the Senator from Pennsylvania came to the floor, I \nunderstood with an amendment, and asked for unanimous consent to go \ninto morning business.\n  I did not, in good conscience, in good faith to a colleague, ask for \nany time limitation.\n  Then the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania came--and not for \nthe purpose of talking for a short period of time and then going to his \namendment--with a very provocative, very effective, but very \nprovocative political appeal against the President of the United \nStates, to which I responded; to which I was quite willing to respond \nat an even longer time and had no opportunity. I had a very short \nexchange with the Senator from Pennsylvania on that issue.\n  I laid his amendment aside, which I think is appropriate for me to \ndo. He has provoked an argument not on his amendment but on another \nissue. I did not choose to do that. He chose to come to the floor and, \ninstead of addressing his amendment, provoked a debate on another \nsubject. I laid that amendment aside and began to prepare my remarks to \naddress the subject that he chose. [[Page S8062]] \n  That is what happened here this morning. As to the underlying \namendment, it is not that I am unwilling to set a time. I am not trying \nto filibuster this, I truly am not. I believe the differences between, \nin particular, Senator Dorgan and Senator Thurmond and myself, are not \nvery far and there might be possibility for an agreement here on this \nparticular proposal.\n  I heard the Senator from Arizona earlier, when he got up and made his \nopening remarks on this bill. He and I are not that far apart as to \nwhat we think the regulatory structure ought to be. I truly am trying \nto improve this bill. I am not trying to stop it. I am not trying to \nkill it. I am not trying to filibuster it indefinitely.\n  I would agree here this morning, if the Senator from Pennsylvania \nwants to lay his amendment down and you want to table it, I would like \na short period of time at least to describe how I view this particular \namendment in the brief period of time I have had to look at it.\n  Mr. DOLE. I certainly have no objection. I am not indicating any \ndisagreement with the Senator from Nebraska. He has every right he \nwants, and has exercised his right.\n  I wonder if we might agree that there would be--the Senator does not \nwant a vote up or down on the amendment, right? Will the Senator from \nNebraska let us vote up or down on the amendment after 30 minutes of \ndebate equally divided?\n  Mr. KERREY. What I am asking for, they came over to me earlier and \nsaid that the distinguished majority leader was going to table, and \nwhat I had asked for as opposed to putting us into a quorum call was \njust a little bit of time to offer some comments on the amendment \nitself. I do not want to agree to an up-or-down vote on it. I really \nhave not had time to look at the amendment that carefully, but I was \njust with respect asking for a small period of time to make some \ncomments on the amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. I am not managing the bill, but I just suggest that maybe \nwe vote at 11:30, and the Senator from Nebraska have half that time and \nthe other half would be divided----\n  Mr. KERREY. I say to the majority leader, I would agree not to a time \nlimit for an up-or-down vote, but I would definitely--I am asking if \nthe Senator would agree to a unanimous consent that would give me 10 \nminutes to comment prior to a tabling motion.\n  Mr. DOLE. And then if the motion to table is not successful, would \nthe Senator let us adopt the amendment?\n  Mr. KERREY. The answer is no. I say to the majority leader, I came--\nthe distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania gave me his amendment. I \nwas reading it over, and he got up and he provoked me. There is no \nother way to say it. So I took his amendment and put it in a little \nsquare thing over here called the trash can and started to make notes \nto respond to what he was arguing. He was not arguing his amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. I do not know anything about that. If I could suggest this, \nthat the Senator from Pennsylvania offer his amendment and after 20 \nminutes of debate, or 30 minutes of debate --the Senator from Nebraska \n10 minutes, the managers or someone in opposition to the amendment, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania 10 minutes--that the Senator from South \nDakota then be recognized to move to table the Santorum amendment.\n  Would that be satisfactory?\n  Mr. KERREY. That would be satisfactory.\n  Mr. DOLE. Is there any objection?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1267\n\n       (Purpose: To permit the Bell operating companies to provide \n     interLATA commercial mobile services)\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. SANTORUM] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1267.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 94, strike out line 24 and all that follows through \n     page 97, line 22, and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(C) providing a service that permits a customer that is \n     located in one LATA to retrieve stored information from, or \n     file information for storage in, information storage \n     facilities of such company that are located in another LATA \n     area, so long as the customer acts affirmatively to initiate \n     the storage or retrieval of information, except that--\n       ``(i) such service shall not cover any service that \n     establishes a direct connection between end users or any \n     real-time voice and data transmission,\n       ``(ii) such service shall not include voice, data, or \n     facsimile distribution services in which the Bell operating \n     company or affiliate forwards customer-supplied information \n     to customer- or carrier-selected recipients,\n       ``(iii) such service shall not include any service in which \n     the Bell operating company or affiliate searches for and \n     connects with the intended recipient of information, or any \n     service in which the Bell operating company or affiliate \n     automatically forwards stored voicemail or other information \n     to the intended recipient, and\n       ``(iv) customers of such service shall not be billed a \n     separate charge for the interLATA telecommunications \n     furnished in conjunction with the provision of such service,\n       ``(D) providing signaling information used in connection \n     with the provision of telephone exchange service or exchange \n     access service to another local exchange carrier; or\n       ``(E) providing network control signaling information to, \n     and receiving such signaling information from, interexchange \n     carriers at any location within the area in which such \n     company provides telephone exchange service or exchange \n     access service.\n       ``(2) Limitations.--The provisions of paragraph (1) are \n     intended to be narrowly construed.

The Senate will come to order. The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment which clarifies the \nintent of the current language in the bill regarding inter-LATA \ncommercial mobile services. This amendment makes only a minor change to \nthe bill, and my understanding is that the amendment is \nnoncontroversial with respect to the managers of the bill. Both \nSenators Pressler and Hollings see no problem with the amendment and we \nhope to get the support of the other Members of the Chamber.\n  Mr. President, as you know, the consent decree that broke up AT in \n1984 divided up the territory served by the old Bell system into 160 \nLATA's, which are local access transport areas. The LATA boundaries \nwere drawn based on the then existing wire-based telephone network. \nSince that time, these wireline LATA's have been applied to new \nwireless services offered by the Bell companies, services such as \ncellular telephone systems. This was done in spite of the fact that \nthere is no particular relationship between the LATA's and the wireless \narea served.\n  As a result, the Bell operating companies have been placed at a \ncompetitive disadvantage vis-a-vis the other wireless communications \nservices, because the other wireless providers are not required to \nadhere to these LATA boundary restrictions.\n  The current piece of legislation addresses this inequity in section \n255, and I wish to commend the committee for doing so. Section 255 \naddresses when a [[Page S8063]] Bell operating company may provide \ninter-LATA telecommunications services. Subsection (e) defines when a \nBell operating company may provide inter-LATA services incidental to \nproviding video and audio programming, storage and retrieval services, \nand commercial mobile services. The intent is to finally allow the Bell \noperating companies to provide these specific services free of inter-\nLATA restrictions.\n  However, Mr. President, I believe that with respect to commercial \nmobile services, the term ``incidental'' creates an unintended \nambiguity. The non-Bell wireless providers that currently have \nadvantage, as I said before, will argue down the road that the inter-\nLATA Bell services in any given case are not incidental to the \ncommercial mobile services in question. As a result, the Bell operating \ncompanies are not guaranteed the full entry into the inter-LATA \ncommercial mobile services that this bill intends to provide.\n  The problem is very simply in the processing of a cellular phone \ncall, they use wire services, and so it is in fact integral to \nproviding the wireless services that they use a wire communications \nnetwork. So the term ``incidental'' can be used to say that they \nfrankly cannot do it at all and then have to fall back into their LATA \nboundaries, which is not the intent of the bill.\n  My amendment clarifies the intent by doing two things. First, the \namendment carves out commercial mobile services from the incidental \nservices section.\n  Second, the amendment inserts this commercial mobile services \nparagraph into a new subsection, subsection (f), immediately following \nthe incidental services section. By creating a new subsection, this \namendment removes the ambiguity of the term ``incidental'' with respect \nto the commercial mobile services without affecting the other wireless \nservice provisions in subsection (e). As a result, this amendment makes \nonly a very slight change to current language, yet it guarantees a \nlevel playing field intended for the Bell operating companies' \ncommercial mobile services and their competitors.\n  Wireless services are competitive today. There are two cellular \ncarriers in every locale. The FCC has allotted additional spectrum for \nservice providers which will compete with cellular carriers. Only Bell-\naffiliated wireless carriers are subject to the LATA constraints while \nall others can offer services in whatever way and configuration their \ncustomers want. The Bell companies' lack of a comparable freedom of \nflexibility puts them at this competitive disadvantage.\n  As I said before, the distinguished ranking member, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, and the chairman of the Commerce Committee have agreed \nto this, and I commend their efforts in putting this provision in the \nbill in the first place. This is simply a technical correction to make \nthe focus of the bill very clear and so it is not under litigation by \ncompetitors down the road.\n  I seek the support of the Senate on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senators from South Dakota and Nebraska control 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield to the Senator \nfrom South Dakota.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in just the minute yielded to me, we \nhave reviewed the amendment and it is an incidental. The ``incidental'' \namendment is incidental. It corrects a good part of it, and on this \nside we would approve the amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, we also on this side of the aisle \nsupport this amendment, and we have no problem with it and look forward \nto working with the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If nobody yields time, time \nwill be subtracted equally from all three sides at this point.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been suggested. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have no problem, as I understand it, \nwith this amendment. As I see it, the Senator from Pennsylvania is \nbringing a request from the Bell operating companies to clear up this \nlanguage so that the Bell operating companies will know with certainty \nthat their companies can get into long distance cellular service.\n  The ``Dear Colleague'' sent out by the Senator from Pennsylvania \nexplains it so far as it goes, talking about the difficulty that the \nBell operating companies are having as a consequence of an unusual \nsituation where the Federal Communications Commission has drawn up \nLATA's that determine what the local area is. Excuse me, the Justice \nDepartment. And the Federal Communications Commission, when they did \nthe cellular lotteries, used MSA's, mobile service areas.\n  But let us be clear on this. The idea that the Bell operating \ncompanies that the amendment will protect have been somehow abused in \nthis deal is stretching it a little far, in my judgment. They were \ngiven this cellular franchise in the local areas. They were given it. \nEveryone else had to go through a lottery process, so they were given \nthis license to begin with. In my judgment, what the Bell operating \ncompanies are asking the Senator from Pennsylvania to do with this \namendment is, it seems to me, quite reasonable and I will not oppose \nit.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator from Nebraska yield?\n  Could it be then at the conclusion of the time that we could just \nhave an up-or-down vote on the amendment?\n  Mr. KERREY. I do not object to that.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Pennsylvania \nyields back the remainder of his time.\n  Does the Senator seek to modify the previous consent agreement?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I believe there are no more speakers.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to vitiate the motion to \ntable?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft], \nthe Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell], the Senator from Texas [Mr. \nGramm], the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], the Senator from \nAlabama [Mr. Shelby], the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson], the \nSenator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], the Senator from Alaska [Mr. \nStevens], and the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas] are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Simpson] would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], \nthe Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], and the Senator from \nGeorgia [Mr. Nunn] are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] is absent \nbecause of a funeral.

Mr. President, Senator Hollings and I have crafted a \npackage of provisions designed to strike a better balance between \nconsumer protections and market deregulation. These safeguards are \ndesigned to protect consumers by expanding services and keeping them \naffordable.\n  This is accomplished in four ways.\n  First, it improves the cable rate regulation provisions in the bill \nwithout compromising the important deregulatory changes that will spur \ncompetition and provide consumers with more choices.\n  Specifically, the amendment improves the cable rate regulation \nprovision of the committee bill by strengthening the bad actor test. \nRates for the upper tiers of cable service will be found unreasonable \nonly if they significantly exceed the national average rate for \ncomparable cable service for systems other than small cable systems \ndetermined on a per channel basis as of June 1, 1995, and adjusted \nevery 2 years.\n  Additionally, the amendment will deregulate a cable company only \nafter a telephone company begins to provide video programming service \ncomparable to the video service provided by the cable company.\n  Second, this amendment places reasonable limitations on the ability \nof cable and telephone companies to eliminate each other as potential \ncompetitors through buyouts and mergers, except in rural areas where \ncompetition may not be viable. This is an important distinction to \nmake. While the overall goal of this legislation is to increase \ncompetition, the universal service section and other pieces recognize \nthe fact that competition will not work everywhere. This is especially \ntrue in rural areas like South Dakota.\n  The third important safeguard will allow small telephone companies to \njointly market local exchange service with long distance service \nproviders that carry less than 5 percent of the Nation's long distance \nbusiness. This will allow consumers to realize the benefits of \ncompetition in the local telephone exchange, while preserving the \ncompetitive balance between the RBOC's and major long distance \ncarriers. The amendment also will sunset the prohibition on joint \nmarketing after 3 years.\n  Finally, a provision that was originally sponsored by Senator Kerrey \nfrom Nebraska to promote network interoperability is a part of this \npackage. Ensuring interoperability is an important part of building a \nseamless, national information infrastructure that will support \neducation, business, and hospitals. This provision will not expand or \nlimit the FCC's current authority over standards setting.\n  Mr. President, nothing in this agreement precludes existing local \ntelephone marketing agreements from continuing. This amendment \nrecognizes the need to help small broadcasters continue to diversify \ntheir broadcasts.\n  These steps are important not only to the successful passage of this \nlegislation, but also the financial security of American consumers. It \nrecognizes that companies need relief from burdensome Federal \nregulations, but also provides a mechanism that will protect consumers \nfrom unreasonable and unjustified rate hikes. Passage of S. 652 will \nrequire give and take on both sides. These measures are reasonable and \nprudent, and they ought to be adopted.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask that the vote occur on this amendment at 12 noon and \nthat the time be equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. KERREY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I have \nnot----\n  Mr. DOLE. This is Dole and Daschle combined.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It is the leadership amendment--Dole-Daschle amendment.\n  I am protecting the rights of Senator Simon just for a minute. He \nwanted to be consulted on a particular section. If the Senator could \nwithhold the request of time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. For the information of all Senators, this is the \ncombination of the legislation that the majority leader and I have been \nworking on. He has a managers' amendment. I have been working with \nSenator Hollings over the course of the last several days.\n  Instead of having two separate amendments, we have simply combined \nthem. I think everyone is aware of the text of Senator Hollings' and my \namendment. We would be happy to share it with anybody. That is all we \nare doing, combining them into one vote, and limiting the time to about \nhalf an hour.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have to object until I have a chance to \nlook at the amendment. I have looked at both amendments separately, but \nnot together.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will this require a rollcall vote once we get consent?\n  Mr. DOLE. Not as far as I am concerned. The Senator from West \nVirginia would like a rollcall vote. That would be the last vote if we \ncan work it out. If not, we will stay until we work it out.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOLE. I withhold that request until the Senator from Nebraska has \nhad an opportunity to look at the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might be recognized, I would support the request and \nhope the Senator from Nebraska will, as well.\n  I would only say that I had intended to offer a second-degree \namendment to this on the issue of the elimination of the restrictions \non the number of television stations that can be owned.\n  My understanding, and I have agreed not to offer a second-degree \nhere, with the understanding that my right will be protected to offer \nan amendment to the bill on this subject.\n  That also is an important issue and I want that issue debated. I will \nforego a second-degree amendment so we can move this ahead. I want to \nbe protected on the right.\n  Mr. DOLE. The Senator is correct, he would have that right.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand that some negotiations were \ngoing on while we were in the quorum call.\n  I would like to note some of my feelings on this bill, because I will \nhave a number of amendments and will be joining with others on \namendments, including, for example, the amendment of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, on VIII(c) and others.\n  Mr. President, the telecommunications bill that we are considering \nwill have an enormous impact on multibillion-dollar cable, phone, and \nbroadcast industries. [[Page S8067]] \n  But beyond that, it also affects the pocketbooks of every one of our \nconstituents, and of every single American. It will affect the array of \ntelecommunications services available for each of us, and the choices \nthat we as Americans and as consumers will have.\n  Most of us and certainly this is true in Vermont, have no choice who \ngives us cable TV service or our local phone service. Whether or not \nthe service is good, we are stuck with our local phone or cable \ncompany. We do not have any choice in the matter.\n  And, if the price is too high, our only choice is to cut-back on \nservice or to drop it altogether. When I look at the telecommunications \nbill, my first question is will this foster competition, because \ncompetition will give consumers lower prices and more choices than \nsimply cutting back or dropping a service altogether.\n  I think Congress has been behind the curve in telecommunications. We \nneed to update our laws to take account of the blurring of the formerly \ndistinct separation of cable, telephone, computer, and broadcast \nservices, and encourage new competitors in each of these markets.\n  The distinguished Senator from South Carolina [Senator Hollings], I \nknow, worked at trying to bring out a bill to that effect last year. \nEfforts have been made between the distinguished managers, the \nchairman, and the ranking member this year.\n  The key, in my view, is providing a legal framework that promotes \ncompetition and protects consumers.\n  The Government's role in the future of telecommunications must be \ncarefully defined. There is no question that bad regulation can stifle \nthe growth of industry. There are other times, however, when both the \nFederal and the State agencies can foster the competition we need. And, \nof course, that is particularly important if you are dealing with \nmonopoly industries.\n  Senator Thurmond, the chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, and I \nheld a hearing on this bill a few weeks ago. One witness pointed out \nthere are only two things standing between a monopolist and the \nconsumer's wallet: Competition or regulation. You need one or the \nother, because if you get rid of both, the consumer may as well just \nhand over his wallet.\n  Some of the efforts made in doing away with regulation give some of \nthe telecommunications giants a license to print money. They certainly \nwill not reduce prices--if all regulation is done away with, and there \nis no competition there. What is their incentive? To lower costs? Of \ncourse not. That is as apt to happen as a belief in the Easter bunny. \nThe fact is, they will raise costs.\n  So I have a number of questions. I hope with some amendments we can \naddress some concerns I have with the bill.\n  First, the bill would permit our local phone monopoly to buy out our \nlocal cable monopoly so the consumers have even less choice. If you \nhave just one monopoly cable company and one monopoly telephone \ncompany, and that telephone company buys out the cable company, do you \nreally think rates are going to go down for your cable service? Of \ncourse not. We have not found any cable companies by themselves that \nhave been eager to lower rates, and they do not. Suddenly, if there is \nno regulation and no possibility of competition, one company owns both \nthe telephone and the cable, it does not take a genius to know what \nhappens. The price goes up. In fact it is a new version of Willie \nSutton, go to that monopoly because ``that is where the money is.''\n  So, as we stand on a precipice between a new world of healthy \ncompetition between telephone and cable companies to serve all \nconsumers, let us not go back to a one-wire world, where one monopoly \ncompany does both cable and phone service.\n  The bill unleashes the Bell operating companies, which have monopoly \ncontrol over the phone wires going into our homes, and lets them into \nthe long-distance market without a formal Department of Justice \nanalysis. I think that is wrong and I will speak more on it a little \nlater on.\n  Then the bill takes the lid off cable rates before there is any \ncompetition in cable service.\n  If we had a nationwide referendum on taking the lid off cable rates, \nhow do you think the American public would vote? It would be the most \nresounding ``no'' vote you ever heard. Yet the special interests want \nus to give a ``yes'' vote here.\n  Does anybody think if you have a totally unrestricted cable system--\nunrestricted because there is no competition or unrestricted because \nthere is no regulation--that they are going to lower their rates? If \nanybody believes that, I have a mountain in Vermont to sell you, a \nbridge in New York to sell you, and a place called the Grand Canyon, \nand I have the quit claim deeds all ready to go.\n  Cable rates are bound to go up. They are going to force consumers to \nmake the hard choice of cutting back or turning off their cable \nservice.\n  Fourth, the bill rolls back State efforts to promote competition. For \ninstance, 10 States require ``1-plus'' dialing for in-State, short-haul \ntoll calls so consumers do not have to dial cumbersome access codes for \ncarriers other than the local exchange carrier. The bill would preempt \nthese dialing parity requirements that would hurt competition in the \nin-State toll market, it would hurt the consumer, and again it removes \nchoices of people.\n  Senators Simpson, Kerrey, Simon, and Feingold are working with me on \nan amendment to restore State authority to require ``1-plus'' dialing. \nOther provisions in the bill that should be corrected would preempt \nState laws on judicial review of State regulatory commission decisions, \nand prohibit use of rate of return regulation.\n  Last, there are provisions in this bill that threaten to chill the \nflow of information and communications on the Internet. They undercut \nprivacy of communications for on-line communications and the ability \nfor the court to conduct court-authorized wiretaps for fighting crime. \nUsers of the Internet are very concerned.\n  I saw on the Internet, as I was going through it--and I know the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer is one who is familiar with that. I \nthink he and I probably spend as much time using electronic \ncommunications as anybody here. I saw an electronic petition that was \ncirculated on the Internet by a coalition of civil liberties groups, \nincluding Voters Telecommunications Watch and Center for Democracy and \nTechnology, because I suggested I would offer an amendment which makes \nit very clear that every one of us are against kiddie porn and all \nthose things, but would protect the integrity of the Internet.\n  In just a few days here is what happened. This. This. In just about 2 \nweeks: 25,000 electronic petitions from all over the country, every \nState in this Union, in support of my amendment. I hope Senators will \nconsider what people have done. And I will speak more on that and we \nwill have an amendment on that. But 25,000 people have already heard \nand expressed their concern.\n  This bill does contain provisions that I heartily endorse. I commend \nSenators Pressler and Hollings, and the members of the Commerce \nCommittee, for their attention to universal service and the special \nconcerns that we share for rural customers and those in small towns. \nThey have also attended to promoting access to networks and services by \nindividuals with physical disabilities, and providing incremental rates \nfor rural health clinics, schools and libraries. These are essential \ncomponents of an effective national information policy. Like the \nFreedom of Information Act and public access channels, these concepts \nwill help make increasing citizen participation a reality.\n  Telecommunications is critical to the economic health of our country, \nthe education of our children, the delivery of health care services to \nour citizens and our overall quality of life. The explosion of new \ntechnologies in telecommunications has fueled many of our newest \ninnovations and will continue to create new opportunities, some of them \nunimagined today.\n  Our challenge is to try to keep pace with changes in technology that \nare driving changes in the marketplace. With this legislation, we are \nmaking changes in the legal framework governing our telecommunications \nindustries, and we must keep our eye on making our laws more \nprocompetitive and proconsumer.\n   [[Page S8068]] What I am saying is that our country has made \nenormous advances in telecommunications. But in those areas where we \nhave not had real competition, we have stayed behind other parts of the \nworld. With real competition we can not only catch up with the rest of \nthe world, we can be in advance of the rest of the world. Let us make \nsure what we come up with here fosters real competition, gives \nconsumers a choice, and does not allow a few monopolists to set the \nrates that all of us have to pay.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have a question to address to the \nmajority leader or the minority leader.\n  Mr. President, I would be very pleased to ask my question to the \nDemocratic leader, if that would be acceptable to him.\n  We are confronted with a situation here, the present posture, as I \nunderstand it, is that we are going to vote on a very complex series of \naspects of this bill, and after we have voted time for debate.\n  What I think I have a real problem with is the fact that debate \nhonestly changes people's minds, a good debate. I think as a result of \nthe debate last night on one of our amendments a number of minds were \nchanged. In this case, where we are dealing with cable rates, where \nthere are less than 35,000 people within the system, and those would be \ncompletely regulated, that has enormous effect. And it may be that a \nlot of Senators do not know that this is in that legislation.\n  So the question I would have to the Democratic leader, is there \nanything inherently wrong in not trying to have the vote now but have \nthe debate now, to try to debate this with our colleagues and then have \nthe vote laid over until Monday? It just strikes me that in a \ndemocratic body having a debate after you have already cast your vote \nis not the way democracy usually works.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the Senator will yield, the managers as well as the \ntwo leaders have been working on this package for the better part of 3 \nor 4 days, and we have had a large number of consultations with Members \non both sides of the aisle, in an effort to better accommodate concerns \nof Senators to address this managers' package as well as to address a \nnumber of schedules that are becoming increasingly jeopardized as a \nresult of our delay.\n  We had hoped, after all of this consultation, to lay the amendment \ndown and have a vote, but also ensure that everyone's rights are \nprotected to amend the managers' package as they can amend the bill, \njust as we do with any other piece of legislation, so every Member is \nprotected. And if there are provisions in this managers' amendment \nwhich would be part of the bill that they would not find in their \ninterest, they are protected and would be encouraged to offer \namendments to address those particular aspects.\n  But I must say a tremendous amount of effort has been put into \naccommodating everybody and to accomplish the point where we are now at \nlegislatively. So I would hope that we could accommodate schedules as \nwell as to accommodate those who have participated in this series of \nnegotiations to get us to this point.\n  Mr. DOLE. If the Senator will yield, I would be prepared, and I think \nSenator Daschle, in any provision in our amendment to protect the \nrights of anyone. If it takes consent, I would give consent right now \nthat the Senator would have the right to move to strike that section \nnext week if the Senator wanted more debate at that time. I certainly \ndo not want to take away anybody's rights, but I think what we are \ntrying to do is get a lot of these things we have sort of agreed on \ninto the package without any further delay. And then obviously I would \nbe willing to agree right now if the Senator wanted to offer a motion \nto strike or whatever on Monday or Tuesday, we could debate it at that \ntime.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That would be entirely satisfactory with this \nSenator. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think that would apply to Senator Daschle's provision, \ntoo.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, I have had, \nparticularly with the amendments separately, when I urged them to come \nover the last couple days, particularly originally Daschle-Hollings and \nthen Dole separately, I had some difficulties but in combined form I \nhave not, and I have no difficulty in moving to a vote in an \nexpeditious fashion.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the majority leader's \namendment, as modified.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me just indicate for everybody--then we will have a \nvote in a minute--this is the provision, so-called Dole provision and \nthe so-called Daschle provision combined. I have taken out one \nobjection. We have indicated to Senator Rockefeller, I have also \nindicated to Senator Dorgan that I would consent if they wanted to move \nto strike or whatever if they had problem with a section. I thank \nSenator Daschle.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Senator Simon.\n  Mr. DOLE. Senators Simon and Lott have reached the same agreement. I \nthink with the Daschle amendment, if somebody had not approved, they \nwould have that same right?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. This will be the last vote today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. MACK (when his name was called). Present.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft], \nthe Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell], the Senator from Texas [Mr. \nGramm], the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], the Senator from \nArizona [Mr. Kyl], the Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], the Senator \nfrom Wyoming [Mr. Simpson], the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. \nSpecter], the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], and the Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Thomas] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Simpson] would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], \nthe Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], and the Senator from \nGeorgia [Mr. Nunn] are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] is absent \nbecause of a funeral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 77, nays 8, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 248 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--77\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roth [[Page S8069]] \n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--8\n\n     Bradley\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Dorgan\n     Lieberman\n     Murkowski\n     Rockefeller\n     Simon\n\n                        ANSWERED ``PRESENT''--1\n\n       \n     Mack\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--14\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Coverdell\n     Gramm\n     Helms\n     Kennedy\n     Kyl\n     Nunn\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n  So the amendment (No. 1255), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wanted to make a couple of comments on \nthe amendment just adopted. I support the long-term goal of this \nlegislation to deregulate the telecommunications industry in this \ncountry and to bring vigorous competition to these markets. We can all \nenvision the intended results in the not-too-distant future. The Bell \ncompanies, cable companies, long distance companies, all competing at a \nlocal level offering a wide variety of services--video, telephone, \ncellular, personal communications. All of these services will be \noffered in a vigorously competitive atmosphere where the companies are \nbending over backward to give the best and most innovative service for \nthe dollar.\n  In the coming competitive environment after the lifting of \nregulations and the modification of final judgment, a business, for \nexample, could call up one company and arrange for that company to \nprovide local telephone service as well as long distance service at one \nlow price, with only one vendor to deal with. But the fact is, in some \nareas, including in parts of my State of Iowa, these combined services \nexist now. These services are provided by smaller companies who are \nable to provide all of a business' telephone services for one price.\n  How do these companies do that? Well, they buy the local telephone \nlines in bulk and resell them at retail, just like millions of other \nsmall businesses all over the country do. They package the local \nservice along with long distance service and sell them for one price. \nWhat does the buyer get? The buyer gets the convenience and low cost of \nhaving only one company to deal with, and they pass these savings along \nto their customers.\n  The company fills a niche currently unfilled in the market and is \nable to build capital to allow them to build the infrastructure that \nthey would need to break through into real competition with the local \ntelephone company.\n  In my home State of Iowa, an innovative telecommunications pioneer, \nClark McLeod, has been offering these services in Cedar Rapids and \nother locations for several years. In the process, he has created \nthousands of jobs and filled a need for service.\n  We all talk about the need for competition in the local market. But \nwe have to think about who that competition will come from. Do we think \nthat the only ones who will compete for local phone service will be the \nbig companies already providing telecommunications services? Is the \ngoal here just to allow the big cable and long distance companies to \nget in and sort of duke it out with Ma Bell? Or should we not provide a \nregulatory framework that will allow new companies to grow, to build \ncapital, and to break out into full competition?\n  Mr. President, I was a Member of the House when the cable business \njust started getting big, when the cable industry was in its infancy. \nThey used to build cable systems just for the purpose of taking in a \ngood quality signal from over the air stations and then piping it into \nhomes where they could get a clearer signal rather than just getting it \nover the air stations.\n  In other words, they took the programming from the broadcast stations \nand then resold it. When they collected sufficient capital, they \nstarted the many new cable channels. When MCI, for example, got \nstarted, it was renting long distance lines from Ma Bell and reselling \nthem at discount prices.\n  In other words, the two large industry groups--cable and long \ndistance--that are expected to provide much of the competition, arose \nfrom reselling of the services of existing large companies and doing it \nin a new form. These resellers are like the acorns from which a mighty \noak might grow.\n  Unfortunately, one provision of this bill would have killed these \nfledgling services. In a supposed effort to be fair to the Bell \ncompanies, we would actually kill off companies that are currently \nproviding these joint marketing services.\n  The joint marketing provision of the underlying bill would have \nprohibited companies from buying local service from a Bell company and \nthen marketing it jointly with long distance service until the Bell \ncompany is allowed to offer long distance services.\n  This provision is anticompetitive and it is a job killer in my State. \nIt ought to be fully stricken. I have been working with the managers of \nthe bill to address this issue.\n  I am pleased to say that the leadership amendment that we just \napproved would take care of the most immediate part of this problem. It \nwould make the ill-advised joint marketing provision apply to only \nthose firms with more than 5 percent of the market nationally. It would \nsunset the prohibition for everyone in 3 years.\n  Mr. President, while I think we should strike the whole provision, \nthe change in this amendment is a critically important first step. It \nwould at least protect the many innovative smaller companies like Mr. \nMcLeod and the others in my State, to continue their operations and \ncontinue to provide the services valued by so many Iowans.\n  Some will argue that this provision simply maintains fairness between \nthe Bell companies and their potential competitors. They argue that it \nis unfair for the long distance companies to be able to offer a package \nto sell when the Bell companies cannot.\n  But the fact is, this is adding a new restriction that would kill \nthousands of jobs that already exist and thousands more that could be \ncreated in the interim. Worse yet, it would deprive those companies \nthat want to get into the local market of their best opportunity to do \nso, impeding the competition that is supposed to be the whole point of \nthis bill. This whole bill is about creating competition in the local \nmarket and allowing the power of competition to help the consumers and \nto expand the technology available to all. The Bell companies are \nunlikely to lose a significant portion of their business to resellers \nin the few years that it will take to open the local loop to \ncompetition.\n  So I am very pleased that first step has been taken through a \ncomponent of the leadership amendment just adopted. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I want to give a little legislative \nhistory on the majority leader and minority leader's package, if I may, \nand if any Senator has pending business that they want to interrupt me \nwith, I will be glad to do so.\n  I want to praise both Senator Dole and Senator Daschle for their \nleadership on the amendments we just passed which have been worked out \nand negotiated over a number of weeks and days and down to the last \nminute.\n  The package of amendments that is the Dole-Daschle package is \nintended to modify a number of areas in the bill and thus improve the \nbill's deregulatory nature. It ensures that certain provisional intents \nusually apply the way they were meant to and provides exceptions where \nnecessary.\n  The amendments end all rate regulations on small and rural cable \ncompanies. These companies cannot economically exist under such rate \ncontrols and are unable to provide basic and upper-tier services.\n  It also eliminates restrictions on the number of TV stations, 12 \ntwelve, owned nationwide while maintaining the 35-percent national \naudience reach. It eliminates all ownership restrictions on radio, and \nthe FCC is granted the authority to deny additional licenses if it \nthinks an entity is getting undue concentration.\n  It gets rid of the GTE consent decree arising from GTE's purchase of \nSprint. [[Page S8070]] GTE has sold Sprint. Therefore, the consent \ndecree is no longer necessary. It eliminates unnecessary regulations \nand functions at the FCC. These items are noncontroversial, suggested \nby the FCC. The FCC will also be required to forbear from regulating \nwhen competition develops.\n  Telecommunications carriers will gain a petition process to seek \nrepeal of the FCC and State regulations. The amendment redefines \nuniversal service to narrow its definitions to essential services--not \nentertainment services and equipment.\n  Finally, the amendment will require the FCC to complete a proceeding \nwithin 270 days, determining whether or not AT should continue to be \nregulated as a dominance carrier in the long distance market.\n  Again, this amendment seeks to improve the bill's deregulatory nature \nby addressing overlooked items but maintaining the bill's fundamental \nstructure.\n  Mr. President, those are some comments on the Dole-Daschle package of \namendments that we have just adopted, for purposes of legislative \nhistory.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make some remarks about the upcoming \nDepartment of Justice amendment that is being offered by my colleague \nfrom North Dakota and, in general, the DOJ.\n  I will proceed with these points on the DOJ and why I feel it is not \nappropriate to expand this bill to include a DOJ review.\n  First, DOJ proposed the line-of-business restrictions on the BOC's, \nnot the Court, AT or the Bell Companies.\n  Second, DOJ and the Court both recognized that the line-of-business \nrestrictions are anticompetitive due to the restriction on entry which \nactually reduces competition.\n  Third, consequently, DOJ did not follow its own internal policy of \nproposing a 10-year sunset, but instead promised to conduct triennial \nreviews.\n  Fourth, AT and the district court accepted the line-of-business \nrestrictions on the basis that DOJ would conduct these triennial \nreviews and the BOC's could obtain waivers from the MFJ under section \nVIII(c)--the standard proposed in the Dorgan amendment.\n  Fifth, DOJ has abandoned its promise to conduct triennial reviews.\n  Sixth, DOJ fails to deal with waiver requests in a timely manner.\n  Seventh, yet, nearly, all requests for waivers from the line-of-\nbusiness restrictions are supported by DOJ and approved by the district \ncourt.\n  Eighth, DOJ has announced new principles which must be met before it \nwill support relief from the MFJ, thereby signaling its rejection of \nthe section VIII(c) test.\n\n\n the united states doj has failed to fulfill its obligations under the \n                    modifications of final judgment\n\n  First, DOJ proposed the line-of-business restrictions on the BOC's, \nnot the Court, AT or the Bell companies.\n  The DOJ was the principal proponent of the line-of-business \nrestrictions.--United States v. Western Electric Co., 552 F. Supp. 131, \n186 n.227 (D.D.C. 1982).\n  AT did not want the line-of-business restrictions imposed upon the \nBOC's, but accepted them as part of the bargain to settle the antitrust \ncase with DOJ.\n\n       We do not want restrictions on those BOCs. That wasn't our \n     idea. We understand the theory, we understand why that had to \n     be part of the bargain, but it wasn't our idea. . . . The \n     last thing in the world you want to do is to impose some \n     further restrictions on their efficiencies, . . . [W]e should \n     be getting rid of restrictions. . . . They weren't our \n     idea.--Comments of Howard Trienens, AT General Counsel, FCC \n     En Banc Meeting (March 24, 1982).\n       I'm against restrictions. I'll be happy if nobody is \n     restricted on anything. After this divestiture occurs, let \n     [the BOCs] do what they want.--Comments of Howard Trienens, \n     AT General Counsel, United States v. Western Electric Co., \n     Civil Action No. 82-0192, Hearing Transcript at 25210-25211 \n     (June 29, 1982).\n\n  Second, DOJ and the Court both recognized that the line-of-business \nrestrictions are anticompetitive due to the restrictions on entry which \nactually reduces competition.\n  The line-of-business restrictions ``are generally anticompetitive and \ndeserve the most careful scrutiny.''--Response Of The United States To \nPublic Comments On Proposed Modification Of Final Judgment at 56, \nUnited States v. Western Electric Co., Civil Action No. 82-0192 (May \n20, 1982).\n\n       A number of comments also expressed concern regarding the \n     absence of any time limit on the BOC line of business \n     restrictions. Some have suggested that in the absence of \n     limitations on the duration of the restrictions, as \n     technology changes, the modification will have unintended \n     anticompetitive consequences by needlessly restricting entry. \n     The Department believes that these concerns are valid. Id. at \n     61-62.\n       [S]uch restrictions deserve ``the most careful scrutiny'' \n     to ensure both that they will have the desired effect and \n     that they will not actually limit competition by \n     unnecessarily barring a competitor from a market.--United \n     States v. Western Electric Co., 552 F. Supp. 131, 186 (D.D.C. \n     1982).\n       [T]he restrictions are, at least in one sense, directly \n     anticompetitive because they prevent a potential competitor \n     from entering the market. Id.\n       If the restrictions were to continue in effect, their sole \n     effect would be to limit competition by preventing the entry \n     of a viable competitor. Id. at 195 n.264.\n\n  Third, consequently, DOJ did not follow its own internal policy of \nproposing a 10-year sunset, but instead promised to conduct triennial \nreviews.\n  It has been DOJ Antitrust Division policy since 1979, and remains so \ntoday, that antitrust consent decrees should have an automatic sunset \nof 10 years or less. Most antitrust consent decrees contain this 10 \nyear sunset language. The MFJ does not, and is one of the few \nexceptions to this Department policy.\n  The DOJ Antitrust Division Manual contains ``standard language'' to \nbe contained in antitrust consent decrees, which states that the \n``final judgment will expire on the tenth anniversary of its date of \nentry or, with respect to any particular provision, on any earlier date \nspecified.''--U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division Manual IV-\n76 (2d ed. 1987).\n  DOJ promised AT and the district court that it would examine the \ncontinuing need for the line-of-business restrictions on the third \nanniversary of its entry and every 3 years thereafter.\n\n       [T]he Department intends to review carefully the continuing \n     need for the restrictions. In order to ensure that the Court \n     is fully apprised of development in this area, the Department \n     will undertake to make a formal report to the Court on the \n     continuing need for the restrictions on the third anniversary \n     of the date of divestiture, and every third year thereafter \n     so long as the restrictions remain in force.--Response Of The \n     United States To Public Comments On Proposed Modification Of \n     Final Judgment at 62, United States v. Western Electric Co., \n     Civil Action No. 82-0192 (May 20, 1982).\n       The Department recognizes that as technology changes, the \n     restrictions on the BOCs may outlive their usefulness, and \n     indeed, become anticompetitive in effect. The Department has, \n     therefore, committed to a regular review of the need for the \n     restrictions with the intention of petitioning the Court for \n     their removal at the earliest possible date consistent with \n     technological and competitive conditions.--Brief Of The \n     United States In Response To The Court's Memorandum of May \n     25, 1982, at 31, United States v. Western Electric\n      Co., Civil Action No. 82-0192 (June 14, 1982).\n\n  Fourth, AT and the district court accepted the line-of-business \nrestrictions on the basis that DOJ would conduct these triennial \nreviews and the BOC's could obtain waivers from the MFJ under section \nVIII(C)--the standard in the Dorgan amendment.\n\n       AT's acceptance of the restrictions is based upon the \n     Department's commitment to a periodic review of \n     their reason-ableness . . ., and upon the BOC's \n     ability--independent of the Department's periodic review--to \n     seek the Court's removal of the restrictions (Decree, \n     Sec. VII).--AT Brief In Response To The Court's Memorandum \n     of May 25, 1982, United States v. Western Electric Co., Civil \n     Action No. 82-0192 (June 14, 1982).\n\n  The district court required that DOJ and AT agree to Section \nVIII(C) as a condition of its approval of the MFJ.\n\n       It is probable that, over time, the Operating Companies \n     will lose the ability to leverage their monopoly power into \n     the competitive markets from which they must now be barred. \n     This change could occur as a result of technological \n     developments which eliminate the Operating Companies' local \n     exchange monopoly or from changes in the structures of \n     competitive markets. . . . the decree should therefore \n     contain a mechanism by which they may be removed.--United \n     States v. Western Electric Co., 552 F. Supp. 131, 194-195 \n     (D.D.C. 1982).\n       Recognizing this fact, the Department of Justice has \n     undertaken to report to the Court every three years \n     concerning the continuing need for the restrictions imposed \n     by the decree. (Citation omitted.) In addition, both parties \n     have agreed that the restrictions may be removed over the \n     opposition of a party to the decree when the Court finds that \n     ``the rationale for [the restriction] is outmoded by \n     technical developments.'' Id. [[Page S8071]] \n       Thus, a restriction will be removed upon a showing that \n     there is no substantial possibility that an Operating Company \n     could use its monopoly power to impede competition in the \n     relevant market.\n       [T]he Court will approve the proposed decree as in the \n     public interest provided that the parties agree to the \n     addition of the following new section: VIII Modifications. . \n     . . Id. at 225.\n\n  Fifth, DOJ has abandoned its promise to conduct triennial reviews.\n  DOJ conducted the first triennial review in 1987 and recommended \nremoval of the interexchange restriction on mobile services, \nthe manufacturing restriction, the information services \nrestriction, and the restriction against the provision of \nnontelecommuni-cations products and services.--Report and \nrecommendations of the United States concerning the line of business \nrestrictions imposed on the bell operating companies by the \nmodification of final judgment at 56-57 (February 2, 1987); and \nresponse of the United States to comments on its report and \nrecommendations concerning the line of business restrictions imposed on \nthe bell operating companies by the modification of final judgment at \n24, 60, 95, and 135 (April 27, 1987).\n  In 1987, during the first triennial review, the district court only \nadopted DOJ's recommendation to remove the restriction against the \nprovision of nontelecommunications products and services, and granted \nlimited information services infrastructure components.--United States \nv. Western Electric Co., 673 F. Supp. 525 (D.D.C. 1987).\n  The court of appeals reversed and remanded the decision of the \ndistrict court to not remove the information services restriction.--\nUnited States v. Western Electric Co., 900 F.2d 283 (D.C. Cir. 1990).\n  The district court removed the information services restriction on \nremand.--United States v. Western Electric Co., slip op. (D.D.C. July \n25, 1991).\n  In 1989, while the appeal from the first triennial review decision by \nthe district court was pending, DOJ advised the Court that it ``remains \ncommitted to a periodic review of the decree's line of business \nrestrictions,'' but that it ``plans to defer the second general review \nof the decree restrictions until after the court of appeals decides the \npending appeals.''--Memorandum of the United States Concerning the \nsecond review of the line-of-business restrictions at 3 (July 3, 1989).\n  DOJ advised the district court that ``[f]ollowing the Court of \nAppeals' decision, the Department will suggest to this Court a schedule \nand procedures for the next general review consistent with that \ndecision.'' Id. at 3-4.\n  SBC, Bell Atlantic, and NYNEX sought a scheduling order which would \nrequire DOJ to submit a second triennial review report to the district \ncourt within 90 days after the Court of Appeals decision.\n  In response to DOJ's announcement that it was going to postpone the \nsecond triennial review, the district court held that:\n\n       [It] does not endorse the Department's recommendation that \n     the triennial review be postponed until after the Court of \n     Appeals decides on currently pending appeals.\n       This Court has no intention of postponing any phases of its \n     own responsibilities under the decree because appeals have \n     been filed.\n       [W]hile the Court does not affirmatively endorse the \n     Department's plans, it does not impose any particular timing \n     requirements of its own.\n       [T]he Department has complete discretion on the question \n     whether and when to file another report, and the Court will \n     not attempt to interfere with the exercise of that \n     discretion.--United States v. Western Electric Co., slip op. \n     at 4-5 (July 17, 1989).\n\n  DOJ has never conducted another triennial review.\n  Sixth, DOJ fails to deal with waiver requests in a timely manner.\n  Section VII of the MFJ contemplates that waivers may be filed \ndirectly with the District Court.\n  Section VII provides, in part, that:\n\n       Jurisdiction is retained by this Court for the purpose of \n     enabling. . . a BOC to apply to this Court at any time for \n     such further orders or directions as may be necessary or \n     appropriate for the construction or carrying out of this \n     Modification of Final Judgment, for the modification of any \n     of the provisions thereof, . . . .\n\n  However, in 1984, the district court announced that it would consider \nwaiver requests for removal of the line-of-business restrictions only \nafter review by DOJ.--United States v. Western Electric Co., 592 F. \nSupp. 846, 873-874 (D.D.C. 1984).\n  This procedure of requiring the BOCs to obtain DOJ review of waiver \nrequests before filing them with the district court has given DOJ the \nability to, in effect, deny relief from the line-of-business \nrestrictions through inordinate delays.\n\n       In 1984, DOJ disposed of 23 waiver requests, with the \n     average age of waivers pending at DOJ at the end of the year \n     being approximately 2 months;\n       In 1992, DOJ disposed of 9 waiver requests, with the \n     average age of waivers pending at DOJ at the end of the year \n     being approximately 30 months;\n       In 1993, DOJ disposed of 7 waiver requests, with the \n     average age of waivers pending at DOJ at the end of the year \n     being approximately 36 months;\n       In 1994, DOJ disposed of 10 waiver requests, with the \n     average age of waivers pending at DOJ at the end of the year \n     being approximately 30 months;\n\n  On average, DOJ now takes almost as much time to consider a single \nwaiver request as was intended to elapse between the comprehensive \ntriennial reviews it promised, but has failed, to conduct.\n  Seventh, yet, nearly all requests for waivers from the line-of-\nbusiness restrictions are supported by DOJ and approved by the district \ncourt.\n  DOJ has acted on 266 waiver requests and opposed relief in only 6 \ncases. In all others, DOJ supported relief either in whole or in part.\n  Of the same 266 waiver requests, the district court has approved 249 \nin their entirety and 5 in part. Only 6 were denied and 6 were pending \nas of the end of 1993.--Affidavit of Paul H. Rubin at para.para.8 and \n10, submitted in support of the Motion of Bell Atlantic Corp. BellSouth \nCorp. NYNEX Corp. and Southwestern Bell Corp. to vacate the decree, \nUnited States v. Western Electric Co., Civil Action No. 82-0192 (filed \nJuly 6, 1994).\n  The district court has approved the vast majority--96 percent--of the \nwaiver requests submitted to it.\n  Eighth, DOJ has announced ``new principles''--as part of the \nAmeritech agreement--which must be met before it will support relief \nfrom the MFJ, Thereby signaling its rejection of the section VIII(C) \ntest.\n  Section VIII(C) of the MFJ provides that:\n\n       the restrictions imposed upon the separated BOCs by virtue \n     of section II(D) shall be removed upon a showing by the \n     petitioning BOC that there is no substantial possibility that \n     it could use its monopoly power to impede competition in the \n     market it seeks to enter.\n\n  Section VIII(C) assumes that a local exchange monopoly will continue \nto exist, but nevertheless provides the BOC's with a basis for relief.\n  Under Section VIII(C), the only issue is whether there is a \n``substantial possibility'' that a BOC can use its local exchange \nmonopoly to ``impede competition''.\n\n       [U]nless the entering BOC will have the ability to raise \n     prices or restrict output in the market it seeks to enter, \n     there can be no substantial possibility that it could use its \n     monopoly power to ``impede competition''.--United States v. \n     Western Electric Co., 900 F.2d 283, 295-296 (D.C. Cir. 1990).\n\n  According to the court of appeals,\n\n       . . . the importance of the word ``substantial'' should not \n     be minimized. The ultimate burden under Section VIII(C) \n     remains on the petitioning BOC, but the requirement that the \n     possibility of using its monopoly power to impede competition \n     be ``substantial'' relieves the BOC of the essentially \n     impossible task of proving that there is absolutely no way \n     for it to use its monopoly power to impede competition. Id. \n     at 296.\n\n  According to the DOJ,\n\n       a BOC cannot impede competition in a given market unless it \n     has market power--the ability to restrict output and/or raise \n     prices. Id.\n       Whatever it means to ``leverage'' one's monopoly power, the \n     DOJ is surely correct that no damage to competition--through \n     ``leverage'' or otherwise--can occur unless the BOCs can \n     exercise market power. Id.\n\n  Under Section VIII(C), the state of competition or lack thereof in \nthe local exchange is irrelevant.\n\n       And while there may be some complexities in defining \n     precise boundaries of the relevant market, one thing that is \n     clear from section VIII(C) is that it is the ``market [the \n     BOC] seeks to enter'' that matters, and not the local \n     exchange market. Id.\n\n  On February 28, 1995, Assistant Attorney General Anne K. Bingaman \ngave an address to The National Press Club entitled ``Promoting \nCompetition In Telecommunications'' (Bingaman Address) wherein she set \nforth new principles that would establish a basis for DOJ support for \nremoval of the line-of-business restrictions.\n\n\n[[Page S8072]]\n\n       Until Congress enacts reform legislation, we are prepared \n     to recommend to Judge Greene that the Court move forward \n     under the MFJ when three basic principles are satisfied:\n       First, steps to foster the emergency of local competition \n     must be taken.\n       Second, the effectiveness of these steps must be tested by \n     actual marketplace facts--by the state of competition.\n       Third, RBOC participation in other markets initially must \n     be accompanied by appropriate safeguards.'' Bingaman Address \n     at 12-13.\n\n  On March 2, 1995, David Turetsky, Senior Counsel to AAG Bingaman, \ngave an interview to Charles Jayco of KMOX Radio in St. Louis, MO, \nwherein he indicated that DOJ would recommend relief from the long \ndistance [interexchange] restriction in court if the states take steps \nto foster local competition and choice is really available to \nconsumers.\n\n       There is recognition that there is great need for \n     competition, real competition in local telephone service and \n     for that matter, cable television service, too. . . . The way \n     we hope to get there, in the local market, is first of all, \n     national legislation. . . . But this week we said that we \n     have to do what we can with the tools we have in the \n     Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice to try to \n     foster local competition without national legislation. We \n     can't wait. So really what we have done is announced that \n     we're going to try to find a way to move forward. The first \n     part of what we're trying to do is really up to the states. \n     If they take steps to foster local competition and if we can \n     test the steps they've taken to see that there are some \n     actual marketplace facts that indicate that choice is really \n     available for consumers, then what we'll do is we'll go to \n     court, which we can do now, and recommend that local phone \n     company be able to also compete in the long distance market, \n     something they're not able to do today.--KMOX Newsmakers \n     Broadcast Transcript at 2 (March 2, 1995).\n\n  DOJ's adoption of this new and different standard for removal of the \nline-of-business restrictions is inconsistent with the section VIII(C) \ntest and inconsistent with the court of appeals' articulation of what \nthe BOC's must demonstrate under section VIII(C) to obtain relief from \nthe line-of-business restrictions.\n  In other words, DOJ has announced that it will not follow the law of \nthe MFJ and apply the section VIII(C) test to BOC requests for relief \nfrom the line-of-business restrictions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, last night we had what I thought was a \nvery stimulating debate on what makes technology move. And I pointed \nout that sometimes Government regulation is appropriate but in the \ncomputer industry there were no standards and there was no Government \nregulation and the computer industry moved forward very quickly.\n  I am very stimulated by discussions of what makes technology move \nforward, what kind of research really results in things moving forward.\n   competition in the computer and telephone industries: a comparison\n\n  By the early 1980's, AT and IBM were two of the largest and most \npowerful companies in the world. Both had been embroiled in antitrust \nlitigation with the Department of Justice for over a decade.\n  Both the AT and IBM suits had focused on interconnection and \nbundling practices. The Government's complaint against IBM charged the \ncompany with ``[m]aintain[ing] pricing policies, including the quoting \nof a single price for hardware, software and related support,'' which \n``discriminated among customers'' and ``limited the development and \nscope of activities of an independent software and computer support \nindustry * * *.'' IBM was charged with monopolizing both the general \nmarked for electronic digital computer systems, and the submarkets of \nperipherals and other computer add-ons. The company had allegedly \n``[e]ngaged in various pricing and marketing practices'' in order ``to \nrestrain its competitors from entering, remaining or expanding'' in the \ngeneral computer market, and its submarkets. IBM had allegedly pursued \npolicies that maintained a ``lease-oriented environment so as to raise \nthe barriers to entry or expansion.'' IBM, in short, was allegedly \nrefusing access to its closed, proprietary hardware systems, to stymie \ncompetition.\n  The Government's initial complaint against AT alleged very similar \npractices, centering on discriminatory interconnection of other \nproviders of equipment and services, policies that centered on leasing \nrather than outright sales, and obstruction of competitive equipment \nproviders through maintenance of proprietary standards. AT, in short, \nwas allegedly refusing access to its hardware and network, to stymie \ncompetition.\n  The Government at first proposed similar remedies in the two cases. \nIBM was to offer and price separately its computer systems, peripheral \nequipment, and software and support services. The Government suggested \na possible need for structural reorganization as well: it invited the \ncourt to grant further relief ``by way of divorcement, divestiture and \nreorganization with respect to the business and properties of the \ndefendant [IBM] as the Court may consider necessary or appropriate * * \n*''\n  On January 8, 1982, the Federal Government resolved both cases--but \nin fundamentally different ways. The Government simply dismissed the \ncase against IBM. It hoped to achieve its objectives in the computer \nindustry through the consent decree that it signed with AT AT was \nbroken up, but was freed from the antitrust quarantines imposed upon it \nby a previous antitrust decree entered in 1956, and so permitted to \nenter the computer business to challenge IBM.\n\n\n                  emergence of competition: computers\n\n  By the time the Government had decided not to pursue its case against \nIBM, Intel was already over a decade old. Apple was growing fast. And \nIBM had just introduced a brand-new machine, based on an Intel \nmicroprocessor. Big Blue's new machine--its ``personal computer''--was \nsmall and beige. Three weeks after the break-up of AT was complete, \nin January 1984, Steve Jobs stepped out on the podium at the annual \nstockholders' meeting of Apple Computer and unveiled the new Macintosh.\n  The Government's decision to allow competition, not regulation to \nguide the computer market, paid off handsomely. As the Department of \nCommerce has noted, ``[c]ontinuously declining computer prices, \nsteadily rising performance, and increasingly sophisticated uses have \nall stimulated domestic sales and exports.'' The Electronic Industries \nAssociation has reached a similar conclusion:\n\n       Pushed by intense competition among PC suppliers, greater \n     use of commodity-based mass marketing channels, and increased \n     focus on the more price-sensitive buyers in homes, schools \n     and small businesses, vendors continued to slash list prices, \n     cut dealer margins, and introduce low-cost lines aimed at the \n     consumer and home markets.\n\n  The impact of this unfettered competition has had its effect on IBM. \nIBM's market share, measured against overall industry revenues, had \nfallen to 20 percent by 1993. It has, however, recovered from the \ninitial shock and is now holding its own against other competitors. \nIBM's stock, which had dropped to $41 a share by mid-1993 is now back \nnear $100. In an attempt to shift its focus from mainframes to the PC \nmarket, IBM has introduced its OS/2 Warp operating system, which is \nfighting against Microsoft's Windows operating system.\n  It is important to note that while the industry moved from virtual \nmonopoly to full competition, domestic manufacturers maintained their \ndominant position in the world market where they continue to account \nfor some 75 percent of all computer hardware sales. United States based \nfirms also dominate the world market for software.\n\n\n                  emergence of competition: telephony\n\n  Long Distance: In contrast, the markets for products and services \nprovided by the predivestiture AT have languished. After an initial \npostdivestiture drop, AT's share of the overall interexchange market \nis now holding steady at about 60 percent even though AT charges \nhigher prices than its rivals for comparable service. The combined \nmarket share of AT, MCI, and Sprint remains at 94 percent, down only \n5 percent since divestiture. [[Page S8073]] \n  Price competition has also not maintained pace with the computer \nindustry. MCI and Sprint have brought their prices up to AT's since \ndivestiture, and the three major carriers' prices now move almost \nmonolithically. Long-distance prices actually fell faster before \ndivestiture, when access charges are considered.\n  Equipment: AT has lost significant share in the market for \ntelecommunications equipment. In the market for central office \nswitching equipment, all market share lost by AT since divestiture \nhas been gained by Canada's Northern Telecom. Foreign producers \naccounted for about one-fifth of U.S. switch sales in 1982, but they \nhad more than half of the market 10 years later. Between them AT and \nNorthern Telecom still controlled some 87 percent of sales in 1992, \nprecisely the same combined share they held in 1982.\n  In the market for CPE, the vacuum created by AT's breakup and the \nline-of-business restrictions was filled by large foreign \nmanufacturers. The Commerce Department has determined that ``[t]here is \nvery little U.S. production of commodity-type [CPE] products, such as \ntelephone sets, telephone answering machines and facsimile machines'' \nand that the country's trade deficit in CPE was approximately $3 \nbillion in 1992.\n\n\n                     comparative market performance\n  Price: Nowhere is difference between the IBM and AT approaches more \napparent than in improvements in price performance ratios. A $5,000 PC \nin 1990--featuring a 486 microprocessor running at 25 MHz--had the \nprocessing power of a $250,000 minicomputer in the mid 1980's, and a \nmillion-dollar mainframe of the 1970's. Five years later, that same \n$5,000 PC is two generations out of date--with a third new generation \non the horizon. Systems with nearly twice the processing power of that \n1990 system--using a 486DX2--66 chip--are available for under $1,500 \nand advertisements are run which encourage owners of these chips to \nupgrade to newer ones. Systems with more than twice the processing \npower of that system--featuring a 120 MHZ Pentium chip--are now \navailable, most for under $5,000.\n  The upshot is that consumers can purchase systems with four times the \npower of 1980's mainframes at one-fiftieth of the price. Put another \nway, systems today have over 200 times the value of systems in 1984. By \ncontrast, longdistance calls today represent only twice the value of \nlong-distance calls in 1984. Had price-performance gains of the same \nmagnitude occurred in the long-distance market since 1984, the results \nwould have been equally stunning. For example, in 1984, a 10-minute \ncall at day rates between New York and Los Angeles cost a little less \nthan $7, in 1994 dollars. Today it costs $2.50. Had competition and \ntechnological advances developed in the long distance market as it did \nin the computer market, that same would cost less than 5 cents. \nAlternatively, a 10-minute call from New York to Japan cost roughly $25\n in 1984, again in 1994 dollars, and $14 today. Had long-distance \nservice advanced as rapidly as the personal computer industry, that \ncall would cost less than 13 cents.\n\n  This same formula can be applied to all telecommunications markets. \nThe price of a PBX, measured on a per-line basis and adjusted for \ninflation, has fallen by about half since 1984, from about $1,000 to a \nlittle over $500. Price and performance gains on par with the computer \nindustry's would have brought that per-line price down to less than $4. \nInflation adjusted per-line prices for central office switches went \nfrom $330 in 1984 to $165 today. Improvements in Central Office switch \nvalue comparable to that seen in PC's would have lowered that figure \nbelow $2. A typical telephone cost about $50 in 1985 and $25 today, but \nhad CPE followed the trend in the PC industry, essentially the same \nfunctionality might cost under a dollar today.\n  Open Networks: Central to the Government's case against both \ncompanies was their attempts to maintain closed systems. Yet in \nscarcely a decade after the Government dismissed its suit against IBM, \n99 percent of all computing power migrated out of the mainframe and on \nto dispersed, desktop machines. Driven entirely by market forces, IBM \nhas since extensively unbundled its products and services. IBM has spun \noff its printer and keyboard division, Lexmark, and has entered into \nnumerous joint ventures with former rivals. ``The idea of open \nsystems--that computers should easily share things and basically behave \nlike friends--is what everyone is aiming for,'' IBM's advertising now \ndeclares. During that same time period, regulators and industry \nparticipants have been struggling to define the same types of \ninterfaces.\n  Jobs: One measure of relative market health is growth in the number \nof employees. In 1980 there were a little more than 300,000 Americans \nemployed in the computer industry while more than a million were \nengaged in the provision of telephone products and services. By 1993 \ncomputer products and services accounted for more than 1.2 million, a \nfour-fold increase. At the same time, the number of telephone employees \nhad dropped to less than 900,000.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  In 1982, the Department of Justice was prosecuting two cases, one \nagainst AT and another against IBM. The theories of the two cases \nwere virtually identical. The Government, however, chose to break up \nAT and prohibit its local companies from participating in the markets \nfor long distance service and telecommunications equipment. At the same \ntime, it chose to drop its suit against IBM and allow market forces to \nshape the computer industry. These two very different approaches have \nyielded very different results. Today AT remains dominant in the \nmarket for long distance services. In the market for telecommunications \nequipment, AT has seen erosion of its position, but almost all the \nnew entry has been by foreign firms. IBM, by contrast, is now only the \nfourth largest personal computer manufacturer. The computer market is \nflourishing, domestic jobs are growing fast, and U.S. computers set the \nstandard worldwide. These results confirm that in a rapidly developing \nmarket, competition will yield better results than will regulation and \nembargo.\n  Mr. President, I would like to summarize my statement by saying that \nI think all of us here have worked together on a bipartisan basis. We \nhave some disagreements on some amendments to come, but I am sure we \nwill work them out. I very much respect everyone's point of view, and I \nrespect the need to debate these. And I welcome Senators to come to the \nfloor to make their statements and to offer their amendments, for that \nmatter.\n  It is my strongest feeling that the bill we worked out in the \nCommerce Committee--and we had input from a number of sources. Indeed, \nwe have had meetings since January on this, and we invited other \nSenators who are not on the Commerce Committee to participate. I \nbelieve the very able staffer of my friend from Nebraska--and I wish to \npraise Carol Ann Bischoff. I had intended to praise her in my closing \nstatement. It is not unusual to praise a staffer, but she did a great \njob. She was in many of the meetings, and we appreciate that very much.\n  So what I am saying is a number of people have worked on this \nlegislation. I am not criticizing anyone for raising questions here. We \nwill continue to work on it.\n  We did have meetings every night from about January on, including \nSaturdays and Sundays, for interested Senators, and we think that we \nhave crafted a good bill. I want to praise Senator Hollings and Senator \nInouye, all the Democrats and Republicans on the committee and off the \ncommittee who participated.\n  But we worked out this delicate balance on this bill, which provides \nfor an FCC review. It provides for a checklist. It also has the public \ninterest, convenience and necessity standard. We feel that going on to \na Justice Department review would be duplicative.\n  But in any event, let me state the need to pass this bill. This bill \nwill provide a road map for the next 15 years or 10 years or however \nlong it takes to get into the wireless age. It will provide a basis for \ninvestment and for jobs, and it will be something like the Oklahoma \nland rush because right now our telecommunications sectors are an \napartheid, an economic apartheid. They each have an economic sector. \nThis bill is intended to get into everybody else's business, but also \nit takes off certain restrictions on our domestic companies that they \nspend their money in Europe. [[Page S8074]] \n  So I hope we can pass it, and I wish to commend everybody for \nparticipating. We have tried to run as open a process as possible. \nSenator Hollings and I have invited everybody to meetings. His staff \nhas done an outstanding job and our staff on the Commerce Committee has \ndone an outstanding job. We welcome amendments. We welcome digesting \nthis further. I thank everybody for their participation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes and \ndescribe what was in the Hollings-Daschle amendment that was adopted \nearlier and describe why we believe it is important to have these \nthings included in the bill.\n  Before I do, I would like to once again compliment and respond to the \ncomments just made by the distinguished chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. President, what we are about to do in this legislation is without \nprecedent. There is no legislative precedent for taking this large a \nsector of the economy. It is true we have deregulated other sectors of \nthe economy but nothing that touches nearly half of all the U.S. \neconomy, either directly or indirectly. It is a mammoth part of the \neconomy.\n  Make no mistake about it, while it may be true that some Americans do \nnot fly, and some Americans do not use a truck, every single American \nwill be touched by this piece of legislation. If you have a telephone \nline coming into your home, if you watch broadcast television, if you \nbuy records, if you have cable service, if you use any consumer \nelectronics, if you have a computer, if you have any contact at all \nwith information industries or services, this bill will have an impact \non you--a substantial impact on you.\n  I say this to my colleagues who are wondering why this is important. \nThere will be precious little interest, I suspect, in this legislation, \nor a relatively small amount of interest in this legislation, while we \nare debating it as perhaps in the first 30 or 60 days after it is \nenacted.\n  For those who wonder what this bill will do, I urge you to go back \nand examine the 1984, 1985, 1986 period and try and reach back and test \nthe waters to see what consumers and citizens were saying the last time \nwe attempted to move from a monopoly to a competitive environment.\n  At that time, the Department of Justice managed that transition. That \nis why the role for the Department of Justice is so important. That is \nwhy the Dorgan amendment and the Thurmond amendment are so critical. \nThe Department of Justice does have expertise in doing this. It is not \nduplicative. It is not additional bureaucracy, Mr. President.\n  Those who say that and who believe that is true should look at the \nlong run. It requires a process to go forward simultaneously with the \nDepartment of Justice and with the FCC. In the Department of Justice, \nthere is a 90-day time certain. That is not duplicative. That does not \nrequire people to go through a long, lengthy process. Indeed, I will \npredict with great confidence that if this bill is passed without--\nwithout--the DOJ language in there, what will happen is we will have \nextensive litigation, because the 14-part test that is required before \na regional Bell operating company can get into long-distance service, \nbefore your local telephone company can do long-distance telephone \nservice, has not been litigated. There is no precedent. There is no \ncourt history that can be referenced with clarity so that people \nunderstand what is going on. And it will be litigated.\n  I understand the delicate balance argument. I understand what the \ncommittee had to do. I understand what the committee had to try to \nbalance in order to get this out. Indeed, it is the sole responsibility \nand credit of the senior Senator from Nebraska, Senator Exon, that the \ncompromise that gives DOJ a consultative role was added by the \ncommittee prior to it being voted out.\n  Nonetheless, I say over and over and over, do not underestimate the \ndifficulty this vote is going to produce for you unless the most \nexperienced manager of taking a monopoly to a competitive environment \nhas more involvement than just consultation. If you are uncomfortable \nwith the bureaucracy argument, there are fewer than 900 employees over \nin antitrust at the Department of Justice. If the language troubles you \nin some fashion and you think we need to make certain that time certain \nis held to, that it is not delayed for a long period of time, come and \nargue for changes in that.\n  Second, the distinguished Senator from South Dakota lays out the \ndifferences in results with the Justice Department's action with IBM in \nthe early 1980's--about 1982--and the action taken by the Justice \nDepartment in 1984.\n  I say to my colleagues, this makes the case for Justice involvement. \nThey had a success in both cases. It is a completely different \nsituation, however, when you are talking about a monopoly that has been \ncreated by law to perform a public service of providing telephone \nservice to all American households.\n  The goal of the 1934 act says universal service and, indeed, as early \nas 20 years ago universal service had been attained, but it is a \nfranchise, a monopoly franchise granted first to AT and second, after \ndivestiture, to the regional Bell operating companies, and no one \nshould suffer the belief that somehow these companies are not earning \nrelatively high rates of return on equity. Their P's are quite \nimpressive. Their performance has been quite impressive. We are not \nreceiving complaints from citizens of this country who come back from \nEurope or Asia or South America or Australia or Africa saying, ``Gosh, \nI wish I had as good a service as I got when I was outside the United \nStates.'' We have exceptional service. We have high-quality service. We \nhave high- and well-performing corporations that are providing that \nservice.\n  So we are going to be asked by our people, the citizens who are not, \nin the main, asking for us to deregulate these industries, these \ncompanies, why we did this thing. It is fair to say, I think, this is a \ncontract with America's corporations who are currently not allowed to \ndo many things that this law will allow them to do. Corporations are \nsaying to us, ``Please let us do these things, because if you do, trust \nus, things are going to get better.'' But if they do not get better, \nMr. President, it will be our vote and we, as Members of this body, \nwill be responsible for it.\n  I hope the Senate will seriously consider next week when we vote on \nthe Dorgan and the Thurmond amendments--my hope is we can bring the two \namendments close enough together that we will have a vote on a single \namendment--my hope is that my colleagues will look at this seriously \nand say this may be the only safety valve that I have on behalf of the \nconsumers, the citizens, the voters of the State which I represent.\n  Mr. President, I was actually going to do this next week. I will \nstart to do a little of this now.\n  This is the annual report of one of the companies. You hear people \nsay--I heard it already in this debate--``Gee, the Government is \nsitting like a big animal in the middle of the road preventing this \ngold rush to occur, this stampede of innovation, this creation of new \njobs.''\n  Look at the job creation over the last 10 years created by the \nregional Bell operating companies, created by AT and other long-\ndistance providers, created by the computer industry. The computer \nindustry surprisingly has laid off 150,000 people over the last 9 \nyears. Look at the existing industries that are coming and talking to \nus saying they need this change and you do not see much in the way of \njob creation. You do not see much in the way of job creation, indeed, \nwith the exception of cellular and cable. The job growth has been going \ndownward to the right.\n  So do not expect in your home States to be greeted by a round of \napplause that you are going to create jobs in the areas where you are \ncurrently being asked or lobbied to support one provision or another, \nwith a few notable exceptions.\n  This is Southwestern Bell. The headline reads: ``Southwestern Bell \nbuilds value, your $100 investment has grown to $173 in 10 years and \nwe're ready for another decade of growth.'' [[Page S8075]] \n  I have a whole stack of them. I suppose I will have a chance next \nweek. I am sure somebody is going to come to the floor and talk about \nhow we are blocking these companies; it is difficult for them to do \nwell. Their P's are very impressive. They outperform most \nmanufacturing businesses in America. They are doing quite well.\n  As I said, I do not object to many of the deregulatory efforts. I do \nnot object to cutting the regulation. I am the only Member of Congress \nto have signed a deregulation bill. But I do not want the presumption \nthat we need to deregulate be that these companies are really \nunderperforming against other corporations in America or that somehow \nCongress has denied them a fair shake in the marketplace.\n  Mr. President, let me now go through the package of amendments that \nwe took up earlier.\n  The Hollings-Daschle amendment was a package of provisions that \nattempted to strike a better balance between consumer protection and \nmarket deregulation. These were safeguards which were designed to \nprotect consumers by expanding services and keeping them affordable.\n  The first amendment improved the cable rate regulation provision of \nthe committee bill by strengthening what was known as the bad actor \ntest. Rates for the upper tiers of cable service will now only be found \nunreasonable if they significantly exceed the national average rate for \ncomparable cable service for systems other than small cable systems \ndetermined on a per channel basis as of June 1, 1995.\n  It sounds arcane. It was significant. By excluding the small cable \nsystem, we raised the bar a bit--and I think quite appropriately so--to \nprotect American consumers.\n  In addition, the amendment will deregulate a cable company only after \na telephone company begins to provide video programming service that is \ncomparable; not just a single channel, but comparable to the video \nservice provided by the cable company.\n  A second amendment also prohibited buyouts in joint ventures by \ntelephone companies and cable companies, except in areas below 50,000 \nand in a nonurbanized areas or if the FCC waives the provision.\n This places reasonable limitations on the ability of cable and \ntelephone companies to eliminate each other as potential competitors \nthrough buyouts and mergers, except in rural areas where competition \nmay not be viable. This change improves the bill.\n\n  I must tell you that I am still very much concerned about the \npotential for a telephone company to buy out a local cable company. \nAgain, you can imagine your own household, where you have a telephone \nline coming in, a cable line coming in, and those two pipes give you \nthe potential for a competitive environment. That environment is going \nto be substantially reduced if you allow that kind of acquisition which \nwill reduce you from two to one line.\n  The Hollings-Daschle amendment will also allow small competitors to \nthe telephone companies to jointly market local and long distance \nservice, but not AT, MCI, and Sprint. It amends the provision on \njoint marketing to allow carriers with under 5 percent of the Nation's \nprescribers to engage in joint marketing and to sunset the prohibition \non joint marketing after 3 years. With the earlier provision, this is \nsomething I have taken a particular interest in, as many colleagues \nhave as well. It is unquestionably a procompetitive action.\n  I urge, again, upon my colleagues the idea that if we are going to \nhave a competitive environment, the competition is going to come from \nstart-up companies who are going to end up like Intel, having a \nmicroprocessor 12 years ago and now with tremendous market value, and a \ntremendous market net worth as a consequence of them having an idea, \nactually spun off from IBM, that they developed over that period of \ntime. That is where the jobs are going to be created. They are going to \nbe created from new competitors, not from the established businesses. \nWe do not want to be unfair to established businesses, but what this \nchange allows is for the smaller entrepreneurial companies to jointly \nmarket and, as a consequence, have a better chance of surviving in that \nmarket.\n  The amendment will allow consumers to realize the benefits of \ncompetition in the local telephone exchange, while preserving the \ncompetitive balance between the regional Bell operating companies and \nthe major long distance carriers. The provision also promotes network \ninteroperability by all communications carriers. This is a provision I \nwas also personally involved in, having introduced legislation to this \neffect some months ago. This is an important part of building a \nseamless national information infrastructure that will enhance \neducation, business, and health care providers.\n  This amendment would not expand or limit the FCC's current authority \nover standards setting. I emphasize that last part because, as \noriginally introduced--and this is one of the dangers of these kinds of \nlaw-making efforts--it did in fact establish what are called de jure \nstandards, a legal standard thus preventing de facto standards.\n  What is happening across the board in networking, in transmission, in \nhardware, in information services, in content, in the market sitting \nout there, businesses are out there and individuals are out there \nsaying: These are my needs, this is what I need to get done; here is \npoint A and here is point B. This is the kind of network requirements \nthat I have, and the engineers and the innovators are coming up with \nnew solutions constantly.\n  Thus, though it is terribly important for us to have interoperability \nin this network, particularly the network-to-network, and the ability \nto come on line anyplace you are, it is terribly important to have \nthat. This legislation, I think, strikes a very good balance between \nthat need and the comparable need to avoid establishing a standard that \nwould restrict and constrict the development of technology itself.\n  Nothing in this amendment, Mr. President, precludes existing local \ntelephone marketing agreements from continuing in effects. Many small \nbroadcasters like the programming to fill an entire broadcast day, and \nconsequently they often lease their facilities to other programmers. \nThese are called local marketing agreements. This amendment I \nreferenced earlier recognizes this need and will help small \nbroadcasters continue to diversify their products.\n  Mr. President, as with the amendment offered by the majority leader, \nthe amendment that was agreed to earlier, that was approved earlier on \na rollcall vote, and offered by the distinguished Democratic leader and \nthe distinguished ranking Democratic member of the Commerce Committee, \ncomes to this law and says we are concerned about consumers, we are \nconcerned about those individual families living in households, we are \nconcerned about that small entrepreneur, that start up company that \nnobody even knows about today. We want to make sure that we give them a \nfull and fair opportunity.\n  Mr. President, we are probably at a point where it is not worthwhile \nto continue this exchange. It looks to me like it might be the Senator \nfrom South Dakota and I alone sitting here all afternoon talking to one \nanother. That would not necessarily be very constructive. Thus, I look \nforward to continuing the debate next week on the Department of Justice \namendment offered by the Senator from North Dakota and the second-\ndegree amendment offered by the senior Senator from South Carolina.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chair states that when the majority leader \nmodified his amendment, that subsumed the underlying Daschle amendment. \nThat is for the information of the Senate.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I say to my friend, the Senator from Nebraska, that my \nmother is watching in Sioux Falls. She might appreciate it if we can \njust talk all afternoon, but I think other than her, there might be \nsome boredom.\n  I did want to praise Senator Inouye for his leadership and \nwillingness on the GTE consent decree. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. President, I will go a bit further to describe in more detail \nsome of the things in the Dole package this morning. I think all this \nwas worked out in Dole-Daschle and others, including myself as a \ncosponsor.\n  In that package, the\n   current law does not recognize the uncertainty and disproportionate \nburdens rate regulation [[Page S8076]] imposes on small cable \ncompanies. Without relief, many small cable companies will be unable to \nrebuild and upgrade their systems; moreover, they may be unable to \nsurvive or compete in the telecommunications marketplace.\n\n  Small cable companies must spread high fixed costs over a small \nsubscriber base, making it difficult to rebuild and upgrade facilities, \nto obtain a return on investment, and to service debt. At the same \ntime, small cable companies typically incur a higher cost of capital \nthan the industry as a whole.\n  The current regulatory scheme has required small cable companies to \ndevote a substantial amount of their operating budgets to legal and \naccounting expenses simply to understand and comply with the complex \nregulations spawned by the Cable Act of 1992.\n  Rate regulations imposed on these companies have depressed their \nrevenues and caused uncertainty in the financial sector, exacerbating \nthe difficulty such companies have in attracting financing. The \nuncertainty caused by the threat of regulation alone has discouraged \nthe banking community from extending financing to small cable \ncompanies. Without such financing, small cable companies will be unable \nto position themselves to meet competition, or in many cases, to stay \nin the cable business.\n  At the same time, small cable companies have been particularly hard-\nhit by the competitive challenges of direct broadcast satellite [DBS], \nwhich has become one of the fastest introductions ever of a new \nconsumer electronics product since its launch in 1994. DBS services, \nwhich are expected to serve 2.2 million subscribers by the end of this \nyear, deliver virtually every program network offered on cable, \nincluding movies, sports, and dozens of channels of pay-per-view \nmovies.\n  Small cable companies need immediate rate relief in order to access \nthe capital necessary to compete and to continue to provide services to \ncustomers. Consequently, telecommunications reform legislation should \nexempt small cable companies from rate regulation.\n                            radio ownership\n\n  The financial health and competitive viability of the Nation's radio \nindustry is in our hands.\n  We all agree that the telecommunications legislation we are \nconsidering today is about competition, and not picking winners and \nlosers. And we also agree that this legislation goes a long way toward \ngiving cable, satellite, and the phone companies the freedoms they need \nto compete, but we now need to agree to extend these same freedoms to \nthe over 11,000 radio broadcasters in this country.\n  No other audio service provider, be they cable, satellites, or \ntelcos, has the multiple ownership restrictions that radio has. The \nlanguage we are offering today eliminates these outdated radio-only \nrules. It is imperative that we in the Congress end this discrimination \nagainst radio sooner by adopting this language, rather than wait for \nthe bureaucracy to come around to it later, as this legislation as \ncurrently drafted, would have it.\n  Immediate action is critical because the FCC is on the verge of \nauthorizing digital satellite radio service, whereby 60 new radio \nsignals will broadcast in every market in the United States. This \nsatellite service will be mobile and available in automobiles, homes, \nand businesses. Also, cable already provides 30 channels of digital \nradio broadcasting in markets across the United States under a single \noperator. Obviously, an incredible diversity of voices has been \nachieved, with even more competition to radio quickly making its way \ndown the information superhighway.\n  Yet let us not lose sight of the fact that all of these welcome new \nvoices are also aggressive competitors for radio's listeners and \nadvertisers. And unlike radio, these competitors are not burdened with \nradio's multiple ownership restrictions, nor do they have the same \npublic service obligations are radio broadcasters.\n  Our Nation's radio broadcasters have a strong tradition of providing \nthe American people with universal and free information services. In a \ntelecommunications environment increasingly dominated by subscription \nservices and pay-per-view, it is essential that we not foreclose the \nfuture of free, over-the-air radio by restricting ownership options. \nFor radio, serving the public interest and competing are not mutually \nexclusive, they are complementary. So it is left up to us to empower \nradio so it can grow strong well into the next century, and continue to \nserve our communities as it has done so well for the past 70 years.\n  The last is perhaps the most important, relief from ownership rules \nworks. In the early and mid-1980's, the FCC issued hundreds of new \nradio licenses and the market became oversaturated with radio stations \nwithout sufficient advertising revenue to support the increase.\n  However, in 1992, the FCC granted limited relief in radio ownership \nrestrictions. After many years of financial losses, suddenly radio \nbecame an attractive area for investment, and alarmingly, multiyear \nstations going off the air was arrested.\n  The economies of scale kicked in, stations gained financial strength \nin consolidation, and competing for advertising improved.\n  Allow me to cite some statistics. In 1993, a year after the new \nlimits took effect, the dollar volume of FM-only transactions almost \ntripled, to $743.5 million, while group sales grew 44 percent.\n  In 1994, sale prices of single FM stations rose 12.7 percent from \n1993's $743.5 million to $838 million.\n  From 1993 to 1994, the total volume of AM station sales shot up 84 \npercent, totaling $132 million.\n  There is every reason to believe that all of these positive trends \nwill continue and flourish if we remove radio's outmoded multiple \nownership restrictions.\n  Clearly, maintaining local and national radio ownership limits in the \nface of tomorrow's competitive environment is not only unfair but is a \nmajor step backward.\n  Mr. President, I might say a word about the GTE consent decree. The \nGTE consent decree arose from the 1982 acquisition of Southern Pacific \nCommunications Co., the forerunner of Sprint, and Southern Pacific \nSatellite Company, Spacenet.\n  The Justice Department, as part of its statutory Hart-Scott-Rodino \nreview of the proposed acquisition, negotiated a consent decree based \non section 7 of the Clayton Act.\n  Unrelated to the acquisition, the suit also claimed GTE's provision \nof information services created a substantial profitability, \nmonopolizing the market in violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act. \nThis portion was removed in 1991.\n  GTE was not found to have violated any antitrust statute. They \nvoluntarily accepted the consent decree in December 1994, allowing the \ncompany to proceed with acquisition.\n  The primary restrictions of the decree are: Structural separation \nbetween GTE's telephone operating companies and Sprint; and GTE's \ntelephone operating companies are prohibited from providing or joint \nmarketing interLATA long distance companies.\n  The GTE consent decree should be vacated through the pending \ntelecommunications reform legislation for three reasons: First, GTE no \nlonger owns the Sprint or Spacenet assets that gave rise to the \noriginal suit. The Sprint assets were disposed of completely in 1992. \nSpacenet assets were sold to General Electric in late 1994.\n  The GTE consent decree is not related to the modified final judgment. \nThe 1982 court order that resolved the AT antitrust case and broke up \nthe Bell system restricts the regional Bell operating companies from \nentering the long distance and manufacturing businesses.\n  GTE is the only non-Bell telephone company with such cumbersome \nproceedings. These procedures resulted in higher costs and hamper GTE's \nability to compete.\n  GTE also filed a motion with Judge Harold Greene in the U.S. district \ncourt to have the court vacate the GTE consent decree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [[Page S8077]]\n  \n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, last week, I ventured out to Hollywood and \ncalled upon the executives of the entertainment industry to exercise \nsome good citizenship and put an end to the steady flow of mindless \nviolence and loveless sex they serve up each day to our young people. I \nsaid that a ``line has been crossed--not just of taste, but of human \ndignity and decency. It is crossed every time sexual violence is given \na catchy tune. When teen suicide is set to an appealing beat. When \nHollywood's dream factories turn out nightmares of depravity.''\n  Although I made it very clear that government censorship was not the \nanswer, the response to my remarks has been predictable and predictably \nferocious. All the usual suspects--Oliver Stone, Ed Asner, Norman \nLear--have been out in force, rushing to Hollywood's defense and \nlashing out at anyone who would dare criticize the entertainment \nindustry for its excesses.\n  I will continue to speak out because people like Bill Bennett, Paul \nSimon, Pete Domenici, Bill Bradley, and C. Delores Tucker all happen to \nbe right: cultural messages can and do bore deep into the hearts and \nminds of our impressionable young. And when these messages are negative \nones--repeated hour after hour, day after day, week after week--they \ncan strip our children of that most precious gift of all: Their \ninnocence.\n  Apparently, the American people share this concern, particularly when \nit comes to television, perhaps the most dominant cultural force in \nAmerica today. A recent survey conducted by USA weekend magazine \nrevealed that an astonishing 96 percent of the 65,000 readers surveyed \nare ``very or somewhat concerned about sex on TV,'' 97 percent are \n``very or somewhat concerned'' about the use of vulgar language on \ntelevision shows, and another 97 percent are ``very or somewhat \nconcerned'' about television violence. Jim Freese, the principal of \nHomestead High School in Fort Wayne, IN, put it this way: ``I'm seeing \nmore instances of inappropriate language around school. It is part of \nthe vocabulary, and often they do not think about some of the words \nbecause they hear them so often on TV. It is a steady diet. Program \nafter program has this inappropriate language.''\n  According to a study commissioned by USA Weekend, 370 instances of \n``crude language or sexual situations'' were recorded during a five-\nnight period of prime-time programming, or one every 8.9 minutes. Two \nhundred and eight of these incidents occurred between 8 and 9 p.m., the \nso-called family hour.\n  Of course, we have more to lose than to gain by putting Washington in \ncharge of our culture. Instead, it is my hope that the decision-makers \nwithin the entertainment industry will voluntarily accept a calling \nbeyond the bottom line and help our Nation maintain the innocence of \nour children.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cover article from \nthe USA Weekend magazine be reprinted in the Record immediately after \nmy remarks.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From USA Weekend, June 2-4, 1995]\n\n                               Turned Off\n\n                    (By Dan Olmsted and Gigi Anders)\n\n       It was, in its crude way, a perfect TV moment for our \n     times: 9 p.m. ET on a Wednesday this spring on Grace Under \n     Fire, the top-5 ABC sitcom. Divorced mom Grace is talking in \n     the kitchen with 10-year-old Quentin, who has been visiting \n     his dad. Let's listen in, along with the 28.3 million people \n     watching the show on a typical night, 5.6 million of them \n     under age:\n       Grace: How come your daddy didn't come in and say hey?\n       Kid: Aw, he was in a hurry. He had a date with some slut.\n       Grace: Quentin? I'm going to wash your mouth out with \n     fabric softener. Where did you hear that word?\n       Kid: Dad's house. It was a cable.\n       These days, that episode neatly demonstrates, the raw stuff \n     isn't on just cable anymore. Sex, and what your mother called \n     ``vulgar language,'' now play nightly on the four major \n     networks--for laughs, shock value, sizzle and ratings, and \n     because producers say viewers want verisimilitude, and this \n     is how reality looks and sounds in 1990s America.\n       But such programming may turn off a sizeable number of \n     viewers--including 97 percent, or 63,000, of the 65,142 \n     readers who took part in USA Weekend's survey on TV violence \n     and vulgarity. The key finding: Many viewers want to wash out \n     TV's mouth with something stronger than fabric softeners. \n     They're especially upset that much of the unclean stuff is \n     coming out of the mouths of relative babes like Quentin and \n     into the eyes and ears of kids.\n       The written survey, which ran in our March 3-5 issue, \n     follows a similar one two years ago that drew 71,000 \n     responses. The earlier survey came amid concern about TV \n     violence and congressional hearings on the subject; is showed \n     violence was readers' top concern, with sexual content a \n     close second.\n       This year the figures are reversed (see chart, opposite \n     page): Sexual content tops the list of ``troublesome \n     programming,'' with violence second.\n       The results are not scientific, but they're over-whelming--\n     make for a comparison with two years ago. Viewers still find \n     TV violence troubling but seem increasingly concerned about \n     rawness, especially on the networks' prime-time shows.\n       Concern over violence remains high, to be sure: 88 percent \n     of readers who responded to the write-in are ``very \n     concerned'' about it, compared with 95 percent in 1993.\n       ``We limit our kids' TV viewing because of the violence, \n     and because too much TV of any kind turns their minds to \n     jelly,'' says Sue Sherer, 40, of Rochester, N.Y., a mother of \n     three (ages 11, 9 and 7) and PTA president who filled out the \n     survey. ``We rob kids of innocence when we expect them to \n     grow up so fast and mirror kids like those on Roseanne. I \n     don't want them to be naive, either, but I'd like them to be \n     children. And TV is a great vandal of that.''\n       Responding to the concern over vulgarity, USA Weekend \n     monitored five evenings of prime-time network TV (8-11 p.m. \n     ET). We enlisted journalism students from The American \n     University School of Communication in Washington, DC., who \n     videotaped each program and noted incidents of crude language \n     or sexual situations (see chart below).\n       The result: 370 incidents over five nights--after giving \n     the tube the benefit of the doubt on close calls. ``I was \n     surprised,'' said Alan Tatum, one of the AU students who \n     helped us. Even on ``family'' shows, ``it almost seems the \n     producers feel they need to throw in bodily humor every so \n     often.''\n       Every 8.9 minutes, on average. And 208 incidents--well over \n     half--occurred in ``the family hour.''\n       A cultural Rubicon of sorts was crossed in the past few \n     weeks, when ABC moved Roseanne to 8 p.m. ET and two family-\n     hour staples, Blossom and Full House, went off the air.\n       First sanctioned by the National Association of \n     Broadcasters code in the early 1970s, the family hour (8-9 \n     p.m. Eastern and Pacific time; 7-8 p.m. elsewhere) was long \n     considered the proper time to appeal to kids. It meant Happy \n     Days and Laverne & Shirley, The Cosby Show and Family Ties. \n     But in more recent years, thanks largely to competition from \n     cable and the emergence of the Fox network in 1986, \n     programmers have been so eager to recapture a dwindling TV \n     audience that the family hour has become inhabited by adult \n     and young-adult hits such as Mad About You, Martin, Melrose \n     Place and Beverly Hills, 90210. In fact, following the \n     stunning success of NBC's Thursday night comedy blitz, ABC \n     has been trying to create a solid block of its own on \n     Wednesday by reshuffling two of its edgier sitcoms, Roseanne \n     and Ellen, into the family hour.\n       For all the national discussion about values, even such \n     family-hour shows as Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and The Nanny \n     are laden with sexual innuendo and hot-blooded humor. And \n     Martin has all the subtlety of a Friar's Club roast.\n       There's a sense that TV, which in the '50s and early '60s \n     made happily married couples like Ricky and Lucy and Rob and \n     Laura sleep in separate beds, is making up for lost time.\n       Programmers say it's not that simple. ``TV is changing,'' \n     says James Anderson, a vice president of Carsey-Werner, which \n     produces Roseanne. ``The show reflects the climate we're in. \n     There's a big discussion going on over what should be shown \n     during the family hour. It's necessary, I guess, but any show \n     that pushes the envelope usually gets penalized in some way. \n     And Roseanne does push it.''\n       He cites the show's complex treatment this season of \n     Roseanne's pregnancy--worrying whether there was something \n     wrong with the baby she was carrying--as an example of \n     provocative but responsible programming. ``Parents who say \n     they dislike the show and [[Page S8078]] wouldn't let their \n     kids watch are uncomfortable about having to discuss the \n     issues raised on the show with the children.''\n       But, he suggests, the genie isn't going back into the \n     bottle. ``The face of TV is going to be seriously redefined \n     over the next couple of years. I mean, Melrose Place is on at \n     8, and they have way more T than Roseanne does.'' Fox and \n     Melrose Place did not respond to requests for comment.\n       CBS senior vice-president Martin Franks defended his \n     network's programming, while acknowledging some early-evening \n     broadcast fare is inappropriate for kids. ``I have a 13-year-\n     old and an 11-year-old, and I don't let them watch The \n     Simpsons [Fox, 8 p.m. ET Sundays]. I don't want my kids \n     talking that way.''\n       He compared the high level of dissatisfaction recorded by \n     the USA Weekend survey to asking viewers if they dislike \n     ``attack ads'' during political campaigns: ``Of course the \n     answer is going to be yes, yet people watch them and are \n     being affected.'' Many people who complain about network \n     programs also would complain ``if we pre-empted them for a \n     presidential press conference,'' Franks argues.\n       ``Adults ought to be able to watch something. Someone at \n     this point who is surprised by The Simpsons or Roseanne or \n     Seinfeld is living under a rock.''\n       All four networks have offices of standards and practices \n     that monitor shows for taste and content. (The industrywide \n     National Association of Broadcasters code is defunct.) ``You \n     can argue they miss something or their judgment is different \n     from yours,'' Franks says of the censors, but they take the \n     job seriously: ``They make suggestions to change scripts \n     before they're even shot.''\n       The bigger question: Is it worth wondering whether course \n     language and risque fare have any social impact? Or is that \n     like Dan Quayle attacking Murphy Brown, easy to dismiss as an \n     overblown attack on a fictional character? Educators, for one \n     group, don't think it's\n      far-fetched.\n       ``I've been a principal for 20 years, and I've seen \n     significant changes. And one of the factors is TV,'' says Jim \n     Freese of Homestead High School in Fort Wayne, Ind., where \n     students filled out the survey. ``I'm seeing more instances \n     of inappropriate language around school. It's part of the \n     vocabulary, and often they don't think about some of the \n     words because they hear them so often on TV. It's a steady \n     diet: Program after program has this violence and \n     inappropriate language.''\n       Last month, U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, \n     proposed legislation giving parents access to a ``report \n     card'' rating the violence in TV shows. Funded by the \n     government and compiled quarterly by a neutral organization \n     such as a university, the report would list the most violent \n     shows and their sponsors; viewers could then pressure the \n     sponsors to withdraw their ads.\n       The movies' rating system ``has worked very well,'' \n     Hutchison told USA Weekend, adding that the magazine's survey \n     reinforces other studies, as well as comments from her \n     constituents. ``Parents are sitting with their children \n     thinking a show will be all right, and all of a sudden there \n     is something very inappropriate.'' The report card would \n     offer parents a ``comfort level,'' knowing certain programs \n     would not contain violence or vulgar language.\n       Not surprisingly, the older our survey respondents, the \n     greater the concern. For instance, 95 percent of those over \n     65 are ``very concerned'' about TV violence, vs. 70 percent \n     of those under 36. Older readers worry that younger viewers \n     aren't concerned. ``Most of my students find the issues under \n     question acceptable,'' says Nancy Movall of Newell, Iowa, \n     whose high school visual communications class took the \n     survey. ``I wonder if it's because they have been raised in a \n     world that sees violence far too often and thus have become \n     more tolerant of it.''\n       Also filling out the survey: 14 inmates at the South Dakota \n     State Penitentiary, who marked ``very concerned'' about \n     either sex, violence or vulgarity on TV a total of 20 times.\n       Some language in prime time is now so strong, we've chosen \n     not to print it on our cover:\n       From The Wright Verdicts, 9 p.m. ET Friday on CBS: ``You \n     lousy bastard!''\n       From NYPD Blue, 10 p.m. ET Tuesday on ABC: ``You're lucky I \n     don't kick your ass.''\n       From the CBS movie With Hostile Intent, 9-11 p.m. ET: ``. . \n     . kiss my butt a little harder . . . probably getting laid . \n     . . Let's go get naked . . . Aw, hell, I'm stuck with a bitch \n     tonight . . . Roberta's on the rag . . . ''\n       From Fox's Melrose Place, 8-9 p.m. ET: ``. . . I want you \n     to go home with me . . . I want you to unbutton my blouse and \n     pull up my skirt . . . I'll be up for hours unless I can find \n     a way to relieve my tension.''\n       From NBC's Friends, 9:30 p.m. ET: ``Now we need the semen \n     of a righteous man.''\n       Of course, Friends is a smash: Melrose fans aren't likely \n     to picket Aaron Spelling because of too-steamy plots; and \n     Roseanne, in many critics' eyes, is quality TV.\n       ``Thinking adults are hardly going to turn into a heaping \n     pile of gelatin because they hear the word ``ass' on the \n     air,'' argues Los Angeles Daily News television critic Ray \n     Richmond. ``I don't see this `vulgarity' as a loosening of \n     standards, but rather as a reflection of the reality around \n     us.''\n       Plus, more than two-thirds of U.S. homes now have cable, he \n     notes, and the government's ``set of rules for network TV \n     doesn't apply to cable or pay-per-view programs, and they're \n     all on the same remote control in people's living rooms and \n     bedrooms. People who believe TV's going to hell in a \n     handbasket are overreacting.''\n       But is there a middle ground between prudery and prurience? \n     Beneath the comic coarseness of Grace's response to Quentin's \n     use of ``slut'' is advice that's hard to disagree with. ``You \n     shouldn't use that word,'' she tells her son. ``It's \n     demeaning to women, and men who say it. And furthermore, if \n     it weren't for women like them, I wouldn't know how to rat my \n     hair real big and put on blue eyeshadow.\n       ``So show a little respect.''\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8077-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8078-S8080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    COMMENDATION OF CAPT. SCOTT F. O'GRADY AND U.S. AND NATO FORCES\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk and ask it \nbe read on behalf of myself, Senator Helms, Senator Warner, and many \nothers. I am not certain of all the cosponsors. This has been cleared, \nI understand, on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the resolution.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n       A resolution (S. Res. 132) commending Captain O'Grady and \n     U.S. and NATO forces:\n       Whereas on June 2, 1995, Bosnian Serb forces using \n     sophisticated surface to air missiles shot down a United \n     States Air Force F-16 aircraft piloted by Captain Scott F. \n     O'Grady while on combat patrol as part of NATO-commanded \n     Operation Deny Flight;\n       Whereas in late 1994, reports indicate the United Nations \n     vetoed NATO proposed operations to attack Bosnian Serb \n     surface to air missile sites;\n       Whereas effective measures to defend against Bosnian Serb \n     air defenses did not occur during Captain O'Grady's mission \n     on June 2, 1995;\n       Whereas thousands of United States Armed Forces and armed \n     forces of NATO allies were involved in search operations to \n     recover Captain O'Grady;\n       Whereas Captain O'Grady, in the finest tradition of \n     American military service, survived for six days and nights \n     through courage, ingenuity and skill in territory occupied by \n     hostile Bosnian Serb forces;\n       Whereas on June 8, 1995 Captain O'Grady was rescued in a \n     daring operation by United States Marines;\n       Whereas aircraft involved in the rescue operation were \n     attacked by Serb forces but no casualties occurred;\n       Therefore be it resolved by the Senate that it is the sense \n     of the Senate that--\n       (1) Captain O'Grady deserves the respect and admiration of \n     all Americans for his heroic conduct under life-threatening \n     circumstances;\n       (2) the relief and happiness felt by the family of Captain \n     O'Grady is shared by the United States Senate;\n       (3) all members of the United States and NATO armed forces \n     involved in the search and rescue operations, in particular \n     the members of the United States Marine Corps involved in the \n     extraction of Captain O'Grady, are to be commended for their \n     brave efforts and devotion to duty;\n       (4) U.S. and NATO air crews should not be put at risk in \n     future operations over Bosnia unless all necessary actions to \n     address the threat posed by hostile Serbian air defenses are \n     taken.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, this is a time for celebration--a brave \nAmerican pilot, Capt. Scott O'Grady, has been rescued from Bosnian \nSerb-held territory. He is back at Aviano Air Base in Italy and will \nsoon be on his way home to see his family.\n  I am pleased to submit this resolution on behalf of myself and many \nof my colleagues on both sides of the aisle commending Captain O'Grady, \nand the U.S. marines who rescued him, for their courage and \nprofessionalism.\n  In the interests of getting this resolution adopted today, I agreed \nto modify several provisions, although I have a hard time to understand \nwhy they are objectionable. But first it was objected to stating the \nobvious--that many missions prior to Captain O'Grady's were not \naccompanied by adequate action against hostile air defenses. And \nsecond, objection to urging appropriate responses to the attack on \nCaptain O'Grady. The term ``appropriate'' covers a lot,\n but apparently some want no response at all to the attack on Captain \nO'Grady or the attack on the rescue aircraft. But having said that, \nthose provisions have been removed to satisfy my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle. I think we all want to make a statement and I \nbelieve this resolution makes an appropriate statement. The \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, one of the Senate's combat \nveterans, said yesterday that it would be appropriate to respond to \nthis incident by bombing Serb missile sites.\n\n  Mr. President, events like this should make all Americans proud and \nappreciative of the sacrifices made by men \n[[Page S8079]] and women in the U.S. military. They should also make us \nrealize that courageous airmen like Captain O'Grady are the reason why \nour Armed Forces are second to none.\n  Captain O'Grady was shot down by Bosnian Serb Forces and remarkably \nsurvived for 6 days in the forest--in hostile territory--by eating \ngrass, leaves, and bugs and drinking rainwater, and evaded capture by \nBosnian Serb troops.\n  It was not only superb military training that enabled Scott O'Grady \nto survive, but his own personal intelligence and dogged determination.\n  This same combination of fine training and individual strength also \ncharacterizes the U.S. Marines and the other personnel aboard the \nU.S.S.\n Kearsarge who were involved in this dramatic rescue operation.\n\n  No doubt about it, these men and women are American heroes. In \naddition to giving them the respect and commendation they are due, we \nhave a responsibility--a responsibility to ensure that they are not \nexposed to unnecessary risk.\n  Every man and woman in the military has signed up knowing that there \nare risks involved and that one day their lives may be on the line. \nHowever, this does not mean that we take steps that unnecessarily \nincrease risks or fail to take steps to address risks.\n  Last fall, NATO commanders noted an increase in the deployment of \nsurface-to-air missiles by Bosnian Serb forces. Under the dual-key \nprocedure, NATO sought to take out these SAM sites, but the plans were \nvetoed by the UNPROFOR command. It is likely that had NATO gone ahead 6 \nmonths ago, Captain O'Grady never would have been shot down.\n  So in addition to retaliating for this hostile action--and we do not \nneed\n the permission of the United Nations or NATO to retaliate--we must \ntake action to suppress the threat posed by the remaining SAM sites. We \ncannot in good conscience continue to send our pilots to patrol the no-\nfly zone without taking such measures.\n\n  Furthermore, as this incident and recent developments underline, we \nmust start a new approach in Bosnia. The bigger picture is that the \nUnited States and our Armed Forces are participating in a failure.\n  It is high time to end this U.N. farce--to withdraw the U.N. Forces \nand lift the arms embargo on Bosnia. Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic \nreiterated yesterday in his meetings with Members of the Congress that \nthe Bosnians do not want our troops on the ground; they have their own. \nThey only want weapons to defend themselves. That is their fundamental \nright.\n  I am encouraged by the overwhelming vote in the House to lift the \narms embargo. It was a strong bipartisan vote on an amendment offered \nby a Democrat colleague in the House, Congressman Steny Hoyer. Clearly \nthe tide has turned. The White House needs to move with this tide \nrather than try to swim against it.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Thurmond and Senator \nMcCain be added as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am particularly privileged to join the \ndistinguished majority leader in sponsoring this resolution. The \nmajority leader speaks with a voice of great experience when it comes \nto military matters, having experienced firsthand himself the tragedies \nof war and the courage and stamina it takes to carry the wounds of \nthose wars through for these many years. He draws on a vast knowledge, \ncorporate knowledge of the conflicts that have occurred in our \nlifetimes--World War II, Korea, Vietnam. In all of those conflicts he \nhas taken a role, first as a soldier and then as a statesman.\n  We are particularly fortunate to have Senator Dole as our leader at \nthese perilous times. I heed his words and his messages very carefully.\n  Mr. President, I also had the distinct privilege this morning of \nspeaking by telephone to the father. And in the course of that \nconversation, with a sense of humility, we talked about the message and \nthe courage his son has sent to all America, a message in a sense that \nsays through these many years, this Nation has put an enormous \ninvestment in the equipment and in the training of our fine men and \nwomen who proudly wear the uniform of our Nation and, most importantly, \nthe investment in the individuals who wear the uniform, as well as \ntheir families.\n  This investment has paid off. This is a very clear example today of \nhow our investment has paid off in the cause of freedom.\n  I hope this also provides a message to the U.S. Senate and, indeed, \nthe Congress as a whole that we must continue to find the necessary \nfunds to support these courageous men and women. We see this one \nexample, but every day, whether it is in the Bosnian theater or a \nthousand other places at different times, these men and women take \nrisks for which we should always express our gratitude.\n  In training at home and far away places across the world, they do it \ntoday with the same patriotism as generations of Americans have done it \nin years past. It is my hope that the Congress will give these \nindividuals today the adequate funds that they need to carry their \nmissions, the funds not only to provide for the training today, the \nequipment today, but for the generations of tomorrow.\n  I am deeply concerned about the current level of defense spending. We \nhave had 10 consecutive years of real reduction in defense spending, \nand now is the time, in my judgment, for the Congress of the United \nStates to stand firm with the men and women of the Armed Forces, for \nthose who serve today and those who serve in the future.\n  I am thankful for the opportunity to have participated with my \ndistinguished majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me commend the majority leader for \nhis resolution and I ask unanimous consent to be listed as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there is much to celebrate on a day like \nthis, as the distinguished Senator from Virginia has just articulated \nso eloquently, to celebrate the fact that there are young men and women \nwilling to commit their lives for the security interests of this \ncountry, whatever they may be. Young Scott O'Grady understood that when \nhe took on the responsibilities of flying an F-16. He understood that \nwhen he climbed into his fighter plane on that day a week ago, \ncompletely aware of the enemy fire that he could be subjected to as he \nflew over those dangerous areas. He understood that as he ejected from \nhis crippled plane, and he understood that during the dangerous period \nof time that he evaded those who were seeking to capture him, all the \ntime wondering whether or not he would found.\n  There are men and women like him in the military in every branch of \nservice who are willing to commit themselves, willing to commit their \nlives to the mission that is put before them in the interest of \npatriotism, in the interest of the defense and strength of this \ncountry.\n  So today we celebrate that heroism, that willingness to put \npatriotism ahead of self-interest. And certainly we have seen a clear \ndemonstration of that in the heroic actions of Capt. Scott O'Grady. \nPatriotism and the life of a hero is something we can celebrate with \ngreat pride today as we consider the fact that Scott O'Grady is safely \nback with us.\n  Second, I think we can be very appreciative of the tremendous job \ndone by the Marine rescue crew who saw fit to take extraordinarily \nhazardous risks to retrieve Captain O'Grady and to do all that they \ncould to see that he was brought back safely.\n  As somebody who has had the opportunity on occasion to talk to rescue \ncrews and to realize what danger they put themselves through to \naccomplish extraordinarily difficult missions, I can certainly \nappreciate the magnificent efforts of these brave marines.\n  So it is with immense pride and gratitude that I salute Captain \nO'Grady and the brave men who carried out his breathtaking rescue. We \nall share in the joy of their safe return.\n  They, too, ought to be recognized and certainly deserve the \ntremendous accolades they have been given for what [[Page S8080]] has \nbeen an extremely dangerous rescue mission. So we thank them, as well.\n  Times like this bring out the best in many people. Yesterday, we had \nthe opportunity to talk to the Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina \nand he, too, is rising to the occasion under what are extraordinarily \nprecarious conditions. We, as Americans, watch with great interest and \nempathy as he tries in as many ways as possible to achieve a meaningful \neffort at resisting the extraordinary dangers that his people face day \nafter day.\n  So whether it is the Prime Minister, a pilot, or a rescue mission, \nthere is a lot to celebrate today. This resolution gives us an \nopportunity to say with some clarity how much we appreciate the \npatriotism, the determination, the extraordinary willingness to subject \noneself to danger, as we have seen just in the last 6 days.\n  So, again, I rise in support of the resolution. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor. I certainly urge its approval.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDaschle's name appear immediately following mine on the leadership \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it may be wise, since not all Senators knew \nthat this resolution was coming, and I think most, if not all, would \nsupport it, that we have a timeframe in which all Senators would have \nan opportunity to become cosponsors.\n  Would that be agreeable? I do not know what time would be right or \nsufficient, but I do think it is important that others not feel left \nout. I am sure the Senator does not want that, either. With that, Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nMcCain and Thurmond and the Presiding Officer, Senator Kempthorne, as \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think we can take action on it and still give, say, to 5 \no'clock for anybody else who wants to be added as a cosponsor. I ask \nunanimous consent that that be permissible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  So the resolution (S. Res. 132) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nresolution was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I note we are in a period of morning \nbusiness right now.

SCOTT F. O'GRADY AND U.S. AND NATO FORCES\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk and ask it \nbe read on behalf of myself, Senator Helms, Senator Warner, and many \nothers. I am not certain of all the cosponsors. This has been cleared, \nI understand, on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the resolution.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n       A resolution (S. Res. 132) commending Captain O'Grady and \n     U.S. and NATO forces:\n       Whereas on June 2, 1995, Bosnian Serb forces using \n     sophisticated surface to air missiles shot down a United \n     States Air Force F-16 aircraft piloted by Captain Scott F. \n     O'Grady while on combat patrol as part of NATO-commanded \n     Operation Deny Flight;\n       Whereas in late 1994, reports indicate the United Nations \n     vetoed NATO proposed operations to attack Bosnian Serb \n     surface to air missile sites;\n       Whereas effective measures to defend against Bosnian Serb \n     air defenses did not occur during Captain O'Grady's mission \n     on June 2, 1995;\n       Whereas thousands of United States Armed Forces and armed \n     forces of NATO allies were involved in search operations to \n     recover Captain O'Grady;\n       Whereas Captain O'Grady, in the finest tradition of \n     American military service, survived for six days and nights \n     through courage, ingenuity and skill in territory occupied by \n     hostile Bosnian Serb forces;\n       Whereas on June 8, 1995 Captain O'Grady was rescued in a \n     daring operation by United States Marines;\n       Whereas aircraft involved in the rescue operation were \n     attacked by Serb forces but no casualties occurred;\n       Therefore be it resolved by the Senate that it is the sense \n     of the Senate that--\n       (1) Captain O'Grady deserves the respect and admiration of \n     all Americans for his heroic conduct under life-threatening \n     circumstances;\n       (2) the relief and happiness felt by the family of Captain \n     O'Grady is shared by the United States Senate;\n       (3) all members of the United States and NATO armed forces \n     involved in the search and rescue operations, in particular \n     the members of the United States Marine Corps involved in the \n     extraction of Captain O'Grady, are to be commended for their \n     brave efforts and devotion to duty;\n       (4) U.S. and NATO air crews should not be put at risk in \n     future operations over Bosnia unless all necessary actions to \n     address the threat posed by hostile Serbian air defenses are \n     taken.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, this is a time for celebration--a brave \nAmerican pilot, Capt. Scott O'Grady, has been rescued from Bosnian \nSerb-held territory. He is back at Aviano Air Base in Italy and will \nsoon be on his way home to see his family.\n  I am pleased to submit this resolution on behalf of myself and many \nof my colleagues on both sides of the aisle commending Captain O'Grady, \nand the U.S. marines who rescued him, for their courage and \nprofessionalism.\n  In the interests of getting this resolution adopted today, I agreed \nto modify several provisions, although I have a hard time to understand \nwhy they are objectionable. But first it was objected to stating the \nobvious--that many missions prior to Captain O'Grady's were not \naccompanied by adequate action against hostile air defenses. And \nsecond, objection to urging appropriate responses to the attack on \nCaptain O'Grady. The term ``appropriate'' covers a lot,\n but apparently some want no response at all to the attack on Captain \nO'Grady or the attack on the rescue aircraft. But having said that, \nthose provisions have been removed to satisfy my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle. I think we all want to make a statement and I \nbelieve this resolution makes an appropriate statement. The \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, one of the Senate's combat \nveterans, said yesterday that it would be appropriate to respond to \nthis incident by bombing Serb missile sites.\n\n  Mr. President, events like this should make all Americans proud and \nappreciative of the sacrifices made by men \n[[Page S8079]] and women in the U.S. military. They should also make us \nrealize that courageous airmen like Captain O'Grady are the reason why \nour Armed Forces are second to none.\n  Captain O'Grady was shot down by Bosnian Serb Forces and remarkably \nsurvived for 6 days in the forest--in hostile territory--by eating \ngrass, leaves, and bugs and drinking rainwater, and evaded capture by \nBosnian Serb troops.\n  It was not only superb military training that enabled Scott O'Grady \nto survive, but his own personal intelligence and dogged determination.\n  This same combination of fine training and individual strength also \ncharacterizes the U.S. Marines and the other personnel aboard the \nU.S.S.\n Kearsarge who were involved in this dramatic rescue operation.\n\n  No doubt about it, these men and women are American heroes. In \naddition to giving them the respect and commendation they are due, we \nhave a responsibility--a responsibility to ensure that they are not \nexposed to unnecessary risk.\n  Every man and woman in the military has signed up knowing that there \nare risks involved and that one day their lives may be on the line. \nHowever, this does not mean that we take steps that unnecessarily \nincrease risks or fail to take steps to address risks.\n  Last fall, NATO commanders noted an increase in the deployment of \nsurface-to-air missiles by Bosnian Serb forces. Under the dual-key \nprocedure, NATO sought to take out these SAM sites, but the plans were \nvetoed by the UNPROFOR command. It is likely that had NATO gone ahead 6 \nmonths ago, Captain O'Grady never would have been shot down.\n  So in addition to retaliating for this hostile action--and we do not \nneed\n the permission of the United Nations or NATO to retaliate--we must \ntake action to suppress the threat posed by the remaining SAM sites. We \ncannot in good conscience continue to send our pilots to patrol the no-\nfly zone without taking such measures.\n\n  Furthermore, as this incident and recent developments underline, we \nmust start a new approach in Bosnia. The bigger picture is that the \nUnited States and our Armed Forces are participating in a failure.\n  It is high time to end this U.N. farce--to withdraw the U.N. Forces \nand lift the arms embargo on Bosnia. Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic \nreiterated yesterday in his meetings with Members of the Congress that \nthe Bosnians do not want our troops on the ground; they have their own. \nThey only want weapons to defend themselves. That is their fundamental \nright.\n  I am encouraged by the overwhelming vote in the House to lift the \narms embargo. It was a strong bipartisan vote on an amendment offered \nby a Democrat colleague in the House, Congressman Steny Hoyer. Clearly \nthe tide has turned. The White House needs to move with this tide \nrather than try to swim against it.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Thurmond and Senator \nMcCain be added as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am particularly privileged to join the \ndistinguished majority leader in sponsoring this resolution. The \nmajority leader speaks with a voice of great experience when it comes \nto military matters, having experienced firsthand himself the tragedies \nof war and the courage and stamina it takes to carry the wounds of \nthose wars through for these many years. He draws on a vast knowledge, \ncorporate knowledge of the conflicts that have occurred in our \nlifetimes--World War II, Korea, Vietnam. In all of those conflicts he \nhas taken a role, first as a soldier and then as a statesman.\n  We are particularly fortunate to have Senator Dole as our leader at \nthese perilous times. I heed his words and his messages very carefully.\n  Mr. President, I also had the distinct privilege this morning of \nspeaking by telephone to the father. And in the course of that \nconversation, with a sense of humility, we talked about the message and \nthe courage his son has sent to all America, a message in a sense that \nsays through these many years, this Nation has put an enormous \ninvestment in the equipment and in the training of our fine men and \nwomen who proudly wear the uniform of our Nation and, most importantly, \nthe investment in the individuals who wear the uniform, as well as \ntheir families.\n  This investment has paid off. This is a very clear example today of \nhow our investment has paid off in the cause of freedom.\n  I hope this also provides a message to the U.S. Senate and, indeed, \nthe Congress as a whole that we must continue to find the necessary \nfunds to support these courageous men and women. We see this one \nexample, but every day, whether it is in the Bosnian theater or a \nthousand other places at different times, these men and women take \nrisks for which we should always express our gratitude.\n  In training at home and far away places across the world, they do it \ntoday with the same patriotism as generations of Americans have done it \nin years past. It is my hope that the Congress will give these \nindividuals today the adequate funds that they need to carry their \nmissions, the funds not only to provide for the training today, the \nequipment today, but for the generations of tomorrow.\n  I am deeply concerned about the current level of defense spending. We \nhave had 10 consecutive years of real reduction in defense spending, \nand now is the time, in my judgment, for the Congress of the United \nStates to stand firm with the men and women of the Armed Forces, for \nthose who serve today and those who serve in the future.\n  I am thankful for the opportunity to have participated with my \ndistinguished majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me commend the majority leader for \nhis resolution and I ask unanimous consent to be listed as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there is much to celebrate on a day like \nthis, as the distinguished Senator from Virginia has just articulated \nso eloquently, to celebrate the fact that there are young men and women \nwilling to commit their lives for the security interests of this \ncountry, whatever they may be. Young Scott O'Grady understood that when \nhe took on the responsibilities of flying an F-16. He understood that \nwhen he climbed into his fighter plane on that day a week ago, \ncompletely aware of the enemy fire that he could be subjected to as he \nflew over those dangerous areas. He understood that as he ejected from \nhis crippled plane, and he understood that during the dangerous period \nof time that he evaded those who were seeking to capture him, all the \ntime wondering whether or not he would found.\n  There are men and women like him in the military in every branch of \nservice who are willing to commit themselves, willing to commit their \nlives to the mission that is put before them in the interest of \npatriotism, in the interest of the defense and strength of this \ncountry.\n  So today we celebrate that heroism, that willingness to put \npatriotism ahead of self-interest. And certainly we have seen a clear \ndemonstration of that in the heroic actions of Capt. Scott O'Grady. \nPatriotism and the life of a hero is something we can celebrate with \ngreat pride today as we consider the fact that Scott O'Grady is safely \nback with us.\n  Second, I think we can be very appreciative of the tremendous job \ndone by the Marine rescue crew who saw fit to take extraordinarily \nhazardous risks to retrieve Captain O'Grady and to do all that they \ncould to see that he was brought back safely.\n  As somebody who has had the opportunity on occasion to talk to rescue \ncrews and to realize what danger they put themselves through to \naccomplish extraordinarily difficult missions, I can certainly \nappreciate the magnificent efforts of these brave marines.\n  So it is with immense pride and gratitude that I salute Captain \nO'Grady and the brave men who carried out his breathtaking rescue. We \nall share in the joy of their safe return.\n  They, too, ought to be recognized and certainly deserve the \ntremendous accolades they have been given for what [[Page S8080]] has \nbeen an extremely dangerous rescue mission. So we thank them, as well.\n  Times like this bring out the best in many people. Yesterday, we had \nthe opportunity to talk to the Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina \nand he, too, is rising to the occasion under what are extraordinarily \nprecarious conditions. We, as Americans, watch with great interest and \nempathy as he tries in as many ways as possible to achieve a meaningful \neffort at resisting the extraordinary dangers that his people face day \nafter day.\n  So whether it is the Prime Minister, a pilot, or a rescue mission, \nthere is a lot to celebrate today. This resolution gives us an \nopportunity to say with some clarity how much we appreciate the \npatriotism, the determination, the extraordinary willingness to subject \noneself to danger, as we have seen just in the last 6 days.\n  So, again, I rise in support of the resolution. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor. I certainly urge its approval.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDaschle's name appear immediately following mine on the leadership \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it may be wise, since not all Senators knew \nthat this resolution was coming, and I think most, if not all, would \nsupport it, that we have a timeframe in which all Senators would have \nan opportunity to become cosponsors.\n  Would that be agreeable? I do not know what time would be right or \nsufficient, but I do think it is important that others not feel left \nout. I am sure the Senator does not want that, either. With that, Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nMcCain and Thurmond and the Presiding Officer, Senator Kempthorne, as \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think we can take action on it and still give, say, to 5 \no'clock for anybody else who wants to be added as a cosponsor. I ask \nunanimous consent that that be permissible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  So the resolution (S. Res. 132) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nresolution was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I note we are in a period of morning \nbusiness right now. We are trying to get some agreement on gift ban and \nlobbying reform. I am prepared, if we can get that agreement, to \nproceed to it. I need to be absent for 5 minutes from the Chamber.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8078-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF GRANT KOPPELMAN\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I was recently presented with tragic news \nregarding the death of a unique and talented young man. Grant \nKoppelman, a native of Rapid City, SD, who worked in my office in 1986, \nwas killed while traveling overseas. He was 30 years old.\n  My heartfelt condolences go out to his family. Few individuals are \nblessed with the combination of intelligence, compassion, and \npersonality that Grant possessed. With his disarming smile and quick \nwit, Grant could dissolve tension into humor, negating interpersonal \nconflict with great ease.\n  At the same time, his ability to instantaneously analyze situations \nand articulate brilliant responses earned him instant respect from \nthose who challenged him. Those skills served Grant well through his \nyears in high school debate, his time spent working for me, his years \nat Harvard Law School, and his successful private practice.\n  His professional life, however, was only a small part of this \nremarkable man's persona. Grant's love of knowledge and adventure \ncontinuously led him abroad. Members of my staff often would remark to \nme that they had heard from Grant while he was in Europe, or that Grant \nhad written them about the political situation in Burma. Most recently \nhe had sent out postcards from the Maldives Islands off the coast of \nIndia, with his usual promise that he would stay in contact.\n  Grant had always made good on that commitment to stay connected to \nhis friends. That fact, in part, helps explain the devastating shock we \nfelt over his death. The few details we know tell us that Grant was \nhitchhiking in Ethiopia and that someone tossed a grenade into the car \nin which he and a friend were riding.\n  Although a senseless act of violence took Grant from us at such a \nyoung age, he filled his life as completely as he was able, always \nlooking for his next opportunity to learn, to challenge himself and to \ngrow. His spirit greatly enriched those he touched, and we will miss \nhim.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask that I may use some additional leader \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has that right.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8080-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8080-S8082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          MISPLACED SYMPATHIES\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, last year, I spoke out against National \nPublic Radio's stunningly misguided proposal to hire convicted cop-\nkiller Mumia Abu-Jamal to provide a series of ``Death-Row \nCommentaries.'' Fortunately, NPR had the good sense to cancel its \ncontract with Mr. Abu-Jamal, who was convicted 13 years ago of \nmurdering Daniel Faulkner, a 25-year-old member of the Philadelphia \npolice force. Mr. Abu-Jamal remains on death row to this very day.\n  Despite a 4-week trial and despite a case that Assistant District \nAttorney Arnold Gordon describes as ``one of the strongest I have seen \nin 24 years as a prosecutor,'' there are still those who believe that \nMr. Abu-Jamal is the victim of a political witchhunt. Some even go so \nfar as to consider him a political prisoner. A bevy of left-leaning \nHollywood celebrities have apparently rallied to Mr. Abu-Jamal's \ndefense, raising money for a legal defense fund and helping to promote \nMr. Abu-Jamal's new book, ``Live From Death Row.'' According to news \naccounts, the Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. has paid an advance of \nnearly $30,000 for Mr. Abu-Jamal's latest creative venture.\n  Of course, most Americans are right to wonder why a person convicted \nand sentenced to death for viciously murdering a police officer more \nthan 13 years ago is still sitting on death row. This only serves to \nunderscore the wide gap between crime and punishment in America. \nAmericans are also fed up with the tiresome criminal-as-a-victim-of-\nsociety philosophy, apparently embraced by Mr. Abu-Jamal's most ardent \nsupporters. As Richard Costello, the president of the Philadelphia \nFraternal Order of Police, recently explained:\n\n       This pseudo-political garb Jamal has tried to wrap himself \n     in is just a sleazy attempt to save his own hide. . . . This \n     is not a political case; this is the case of the cold-blooded \n     killing of a police officer doing his job. . . . It is well \n     past time for the jury's sentence to be fulfilled.\n\n  Keep in mind it has been 13 years. The victim has been long \nforgotten, and the victim's family, but this man is still around.\n  Just last Friday, Pennsylvania's Governor Tom Ridge took a big step \nto [[Page S8081]] ensure that the Jury's sentence is fulfilled by \nsigning Mr. Abu-Jamal's death warrant. Governor Ridge could have taken \nthe easy way out by avoiding this politically contentious issue, but \ninstead he has stood his ground and confronted it head-on. He deserved \nour praise.\n  I also want to commend Governor Ridge for his efforts over the years \nto enact meaningful habeas corpus reform. On Wednesday, the Senate \npassed a series of reform proposals that, if enacted into law, will go \na long way to end the endless appeals and delays that have done so much \nto weaken public confidence in our system of criminal justice. Although \nGovernor Ridge is no longer in the House of Representatives, having \ngone on to bigger and better things as Governor of the Keystone State, \nhis hard work in Congress on behalf of habeas reform may finally be \npaying off.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article that recently \nappeared in The Washington Post be reprinted in the Record immediately \nafter my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DOLE. The article is all about his book, ``Live From Death Row.''\n  I also say that people wonder why some of us are frustrated with \nNational Public Radio and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, when \nthey use taxpayer's funds. If it had not been for Members of Congress--\nin this case, probably taxpayers out there, citizens calling it to our \nattention--you would have been hearing this cop killer on National \nPublic Radio with commentaries, and they were going to pay him, I \nthink, $120 per commentary.\n  So when we talk about a waste of taxpayers' money and about National \nPublic Radio--which could be an arm of the Democratic party as far as I \nam concerned--and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, I hope the \nAmerican people understand the kind of things they are willing to put \non the air. This happened to be one of them that was stopped because of \na firestorm that developed. But it seems to me that it is another \nindication that we can probably use that taxpayer money in some more \nuseful way.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 18, 1995]\n\n                         Condemned To Silence?\n\n                          (By Megan Resenfeld)\n\n       There is an image from Mumia Abu-Jamal's trial that stays \n     with Maureen Faulkner, even now, 13 years later, Abu-Jamal \n     was charged with killing Faulkner's husband, Daniel, a 25-\n     year-old Philadelphia policemen, by shooting him first in the \n     back and then pumping four bullets into his prone body. When \n     the ballistics expert held up her husband's bloody blue shirt \n     to display the bullet holes, Abu-Jamal, seated at the defense \n     table, turned around and looked at Maureen Faulkner.\n       ``He smiled at me,'' she says.\n       Abu-Jamal, then a freelance radio journalist and part-time \n     cab driver, was convicted of Daniel Faulkner's murder and \n     sentenced to death. But today he has become a cause celebre \n     among a segment of literary names, his case taken up by well-\n     known civil liberties lawyer Leonard Weinglass, the NAACP \n     Legal Defense Fund, Rep. Ron Dellums (D-Calif.) and actors \n     Whoopi Goldberg, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee and Ed Asner, among \n     others. They claim Abu-Jamal was wrongly convicted and \n     sentenced, despite what the prosecution, and a jury, believed \n     was convincing testimony from eyewitnesses and unrefuted \n     ballistics evidence. Two other groups, Amnesty International \n     and PEN, a writers' free-speech advocacy association, take no \n     position on Abu-Jamal's guilt or innocence, but question the \n     fairness of his trial and sentencing.\n       But what really has Faulkner upset is that Abu-Jamal has \n     just published a book, ``Live From Death Row,'' for which an \n     advance of about $30,000 was paid--although it is unclear to \n     whom. Nether Weinglass not the publisher, Addision-Wesley \n     would confirm the amount or say who got the money. A first \n     printing of 32,500 copies has been shipped to bookstores \n     around the country.\n       ``A rare and courageous voice speaking from a place we fear \n     to know: Mumia Abu-Jamal must be heard,'' writes prize-\n     winning author Alice Walker in a book jacket blurb.\n       And: ``Everyone interested in justice should read the words \n     of this innocent man,'' declares lawyer William Kunstler.\n       ``Does an innocent person turn and smile at the widow when \n     the bloody shirt is held up?'' Faulkner asks.\n       As far as Maureen Faulkner is concerned, the celebrities \n     and human rights activists are remnants of the radical chic \n     who have lined up like leftist lemmings and signed on to a \n     bad deal. The claims that Abu-Jamal has a freedom-of-speech \n     right to be heard, as expressed by his publisher and his \n     supporters, strike her as lame. ``He is a convicted \n     murderer,'' she says. ``Just as felons lose their right to \n     vote, I think that by taking another man's life, he forfeits \n     the right to freedom of speech.''\n\n\n                           A Delicate Balance\n\n       It's an argument as old as crime. How, in a nation ruled by \n     law, are the rights of the accused and the convicted \n     protected without abusing the survivors and victims? Like a \n     tipsy boat trying to right itself, we shift from one side to \n     the other, focusing first on the perpetrators and then on the \n     perpetrated upon. And when the death penalty is involved, the \n     emotion of the argument is even more intense, and the cries \n     of injustice from both sides increase in pitch. The battles \n     are as often fought in the arena of public opinion as in the \n     courtroom, and this is where Faulkner has taken up her battle \n     station.\n       Abu-Jamal, now 41, will file his next appeal in June, said \n     Weinglass. He has already been rebuffed twice by both the \n     Pennsylvania Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court. His \n     death warrant has not been signed, but the new governor of \n     Pennsylvania, Thomas J. Ridge, campaigned as a pro-death-\n     penalty Republican.\n       Abu-Jamal's profile has never been higher. He has become a \n     virtual folk hero. Even as the book reviews start coming in, \n     benefits for his defense fund--at least three committees are \n     raising money for him in different cities--are planned for \n     this weekend in New York City. John Edgar Wideman, who wrote \n     an introduction to the book; Melvin Van Peebles; two members \n     of the MOVE group in Philadelphia with which Abu-Jamal was \n     associated; Weinglass and others are giving a public reading \n     from the book Saturday afternoon for $15 a ticket. Another \n     reading, by actor Giancarlo Esposito, will be held that night \n     for $250 a ticket. Spokesmen at two of Abu-Jamal's legal \n     defense committees yesterday declined to say how much money \n     has been raised. There have been rallies of support here and \n     overseas. A typical pamphlet, published by the liberal-\n     leaning Quixote Center in Hyattsville, is headlined: ``A Saga \n     of Shame.''\n       So Faulkner has decided to raise her profile too. This week \n     she was in Washington for the annual National Police Week, \n     lobbying cops and their families to boycott the book. She is \n     starting a nonprofit organization, with some help from \n     Philadelphia's Fraternal Order of Police, to counter the \n     attention give to Abu-Jamal's case. She is spending her \n     weekends and Wednesdays writing to schools and school boards, \n     urging them to boycott Addison-Wesley's large text-book \n     operation.\n       And she's gone even further. Last week she hired a plane to \n     fly over Addison-Wesley headquarters in Reading, Mass., \n     trailing a 30-foot banner. It said: ``Addison-Wesley Supports \n     Convicted Cop Killer.''\n       ``I and all of us at Addison-Wesley feel great sympathy for \n     Mrs. Faulkner and the terrible ordeal she suffered,'' said \n     David Goehring, head of the firm's trade publishing division. \n     ``But this is a book with an important message. I think this \n     is a highly disturbing book, challenging our assumptions of \n     the death penalty. Is that a reason to deny someone his \n     freedom of speech?''\n\n\n                             `life goes on'\n\n       Maureen Faulkner is a small, blond, determined woman who \n     has done as well as she could to cope with her young \n     husband's murder. She was only 25 when he died, before they'd \n     had a chance to finish their college degrees, buy a house, \n     have children.\n       Both were the youngest of large families, born and raised \n     in Philadelphia. She was aware of the dangers of her \n     husband's career. They had a pact always to kiss good night, \n     and kiss goodbuy, regardless of marital ups and downs, \n     because life was so uncertain. And they had discussed the \n     possibility of his death.\n       ``He said, `If anything happens to me, I died doing the \n     work I love most. Life goes on. I want you to be happy,''' \n     she says. And Faulkner has had a full life--no professional \n     widowhood for her.\n       After the four-week trial, she left her job as an \n     accountant for a Philadelphia corporation and worked for \n     Trans World Airlines in New York, selling tickets. She \n     backpacked around the world, trekked in Nepal, climbed the \n     foothills of Everest. After she moved to Southern California \n     about 10 years ago, she owned and operated a deli with one of \n     her brothers. She earned a private pilot's license and \n     started to raise show dogs--Hungarian Viszlas. For the past \n     seven years she has worked as a medical assistant for an \n     office of obstetricians. Although she has not remarried, she \n     lives with a boyfriend.\n       She still is afraid to give out information about where she \n     lives or works, because all during the trial she got nasty \n     phone calls, which she attributes to supporters of Abu-Jamal. \n     She changed her unlisted number more than a dozen times, but \n     somehow they always got it.\n       Her anger, long dormant, was rekindled last year when she \n     heard that Abu-Jamal had been hired by National Public Radio \n     to do a series of commentaries from prison for $150 each. She \n     protested, and then got a list of NPR's contributors and \n     wrote to hundreds of them. In the ensuing storm of argument, \n     NPR canceled the contract. The canceled commentaries form the \n     bulk of ``Live From Death Row.''\n       Then, in March, her uncle sent her a clipping about the \n     book. ``I couldn't sleep all night,'' she says. ``I screamed, \n     I cried, I [[Page S8082]] didn't know what to do.'' At 5 a.m. \n     California time, she called Addison-Wesley in Massachusetts, \n     and thus began her ongoing battle with the publisher--and \n     with David Goehring personally.\n       ``I think it is immoral to reward a convicted cop killer \n     financially,'' she says. Even after 13 years away, her \n     Philadelphia accent is strong. ``And I think David Goehring \n     is going to look at himself in the mirror one day and realize \n     he made a mistake.''\n       But the two are arguing from such differing perspectives \n     that they will probably never agree. Faulkner operates from \n     an unshakable belief in Abu-Jamal's guilt, while Goehring \n     says the question of guilt or innocence is not relevant to \n     what he sees as the power of Abu-Jamal's description of what \n     it's like to be on death row. He does not see the book as \n     part of Abu-Jamal's quest for vindication, or as part of a \n     campaign against the death penalty. ``We are making his voice \n     available,'' he said. ``Our role is not to take sides.'' \n     Indeed, he said, the company has published a book arguing for \n     victims' rights, ``With Justice for Some,'' by law professor \n     George Fletcher. Goehring declined to say how many copies \n     were printed.\n       But for Faulkner, guilt is everything. Freedom of speech? \n     Does every prisoner have the right to a book contract? ``What \n     does eloquence have to do with a convicted murderer?'' she \n     asks.\n\n\n                           eager for justice\n       Daniel Faulkner was killed early one cold December morning, \n     two weeks before Christmas, in 1981. His widow believes the \n     evidence of Abu-Jamal's guilt can be pinned to two things: \n     Five bullets were emptied into her husband, and five bullets \n     of the same type were missing from Abu-Jamal's gun. They were \n     high-velocity, +P-type bullets that fragmented so completely \n     police could not match them to Abu-Jamal's gun, which was \n     found on the sidewalk, next to Abu-Jamal. He too was wounded, \n     shot in the stomach by Faulkner. Abu-Jamal had a license for \n     the gun, and a store owner testified to selling him the \n     bullets. Two people testified that he shouted in the \n     emergency room, ``I shot the [expletive].''\n       ``From an evidentiary standpoint, the case against Mumia \n     Abu-Jamal was . . . one of the strongest I have seen in 24 \n     years as a prosecutor,'' wrote Assistant District Attorney \n     Arnold H. Gordon to NPR chief Delano E. Lewis a year ago. \n     ``Abu-Jamal was identified . . . by three eyewitnesses who \n     had never lost sight of him during the entire incident,'' he \n     wrote.\n       But Weinglass, in his afterword to ``Live From Death Row,'' \n     claims there were witnesses who saw another man fleeing the \n     scene, and that Abu-Jamal was denied the right to represent \n     himself and given an unprepared court-assigned lawyer. His \n     sentencing was tainted by prosecutorial misuse of information \n     about Abu-Jamal's teenage involvement with the Black Panthers \n     as well, Weinglass asserts.\n       Faulkner hopes her campaign will tap into public \n     frustration with the criminal justice system. Daniel \n     Faulkner, she says, would have fought just as hard in her \n     memory. She supports the death penalty, and is eager for Abu-\n     Jamal's death sentence to be imposed.\n       ``I'd like to be there,'' she says.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8080-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              COMMENDING CAPTAIN O'GRADY AND HIS RESCUERS\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM.

Mr. President, I am pleased to note that a Treasury \nofficial appearing before the Finance Committee this week testified in \nsupport of targeting estate tax relief to family-owned businesses.\n  Time and time again, family business owners across the country have \ntold me about the unfairness of the current estate tax and its 55 \npercent rate. Too often heirs are forced to sell the family business or \nfarm just to pay the estate tax. And too often the buyer of the family \nbusiness is a large corporation that does not necessarily have the best \ninterests of the community or the business employees at heart.\n  I will be introducing legislation in the coming weeks that will allow \nfamily-owned and other closely held businesses to remain in the family \nafter the death of an owner. I intend to drastically reduce the estate \ntax rates for the value of a closely held business. For the smallest of \nbusinesses, the estate tax should be virtually eliminated.\n  Without the estate tax burden on the backs of American families, they \ncan continue to prosper. And when families continue to operate their \nbusinesses we all benefit--the business employees keep their jobs, the \nGovernment receives income taxes on business profits, and the families \nretain their livelihood.\n  The estate tax is not a Democratic or a Republican problem, or one \nthat affects only rural or urban families. That is why I am working \nwith Members of both sides of the aisle to develop broad, bipartisan \nsupport for the legislation. There are farmers, ranchers, or family \nbusinesses in each State that would benefit from the legislation.\n  I welcome all Senators to join this effort. I am already working with \nSenators Roth, Baucus, Grassley, Pryor, Simpson, Breaux, Pressler, \nD'Amato, Nickles, Burns, and others to design targeted estate tax \nrelief for family-owned businesses.\n  The legislation will provide relief to those that need it most--\nfamilies whose estates are made up primarily of a family business. It \nis these families who would otherwise be forced to sell their business \nto pay the estate tax. And in determining whether a family business is \ncomprised primarily of an estate, I would like to exclude the family's \nprincipal residence. This would ensure that heirs won't have to sell \ntheir residence to keep their business.\n  Because this legislation is designed to help families that hold on to \ntheir businesses, if a family chooses to sell a substantial portion of \nthe business [[Page S8083]] within a period of time after the decedent \ndies, all or part of the reduced tax rate may be recaptured.\n  The legislation will allow families to leave their businesses in the \nhands of family members, or trusted, long-term employees of the \nbusiness.\n  The bill will also extend the period of time available to compute the \nalternative valuation date for the family business. This will help \nresolve disputes with the Internal Revenue Service about the value of \nthe business when the value is closely tied to the skills of the \ndecedent.\n  Family-owned businesses are the job creators in this country. In the \n1980's they accounted for an increase of more than 20 million private \nsector jobs. I look forward to working with the farm, ranch, and small \nbusiness community, and Members of the House and Senate, to provide \nrelief for out most precious resource--the family business \nentrepreneur.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8082-5", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8083-S8084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             KRESIMIR COSIC\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, a beloved friend and adopted son of Utah, \nKresimir Cosic, passed away May 25. At that time I paid a tribute to \nhim on the floor of the Senate. Since then, others have also paid \ntribute in Utah newspaper articles. I ask unanimous consent that these \ncomments be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                 [From The Deseret News, June 3, 1995]\n\n                           (By Lee Davidson)\n\n                   Cosic Was a True Man of Principle\n\n       Washington.--He skipped the chance to be a basketball-star \n     millionaire and never looked back. Instead, he choose to \n     sacrifice for his God, his country, his friends and his \n     family.\n       But that made Kresimir Cosic, 46, who died last week, among \n     the happiest people I've ever known, even when he suffered \n     from cancer.\n       As Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said--giving maybe the highest \n     honor I've seen a politican offer at the death of another--\n     ``I never saw Kres without a smile.''\n       That's hard to say about other sports stars and celebrities \n     who spend millions or act outrageously thinking it will make \n     them happy. Cosic found the type of joy through service that \n     money cannot buy, nor can sickness or even death destroy.\n       My own story of Cosic begins where most others end--after \n     his basketball career, mostly because I didn't meet him until \n     he arrived in Washington as deputy ambassador for Croatia. \n     That's when I wanted to find out how an athlete became an \n     ambassador.\n       Of course, Cosic was among the greatest of all basketball \n     stars at Brigham Young University and led the former \n     Yugoslavia to many Olympic medals (including a gold in 1980) \n     as a player and a coach.\n       But Cosic's power in politics (and religion) came because \n     the 6-foot-11 center--who could dribble, pass and score from \n     three-point range as well as a guard--turned down offers from \n     the Los Angeles Lakers and others that would have made him a \n     millionaire.\n       Cosic said riches weren't as important as his country and \n     helping The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints.\n       He returned to Yugoslavia and almost single-handedly turned \n     it into a basketball powerhouse with world and European \n     championships. He found and developed players such as the \n     Chicago Bulls' Toni Kukoc (a Croat) and the Lakers' Vlade \n     Divac (a Serb).\n       They would become millionaires, unlike Cosic. That didn't \n     bother him. During an interview at his middle-class home last \n     year, Cosic would not dwell on unfound riches, but instead \n     his eyes twinkled when he told how rewarding it was to coach \n     such players from differing (and now warring) ethnic \n     backgrounds.\n       He didn't return to Yugoslavia just to build a basketball \n     team. He wanted to build principles of democracy and sought \n     to reconcile ethnic groups of Yugoslavia. Such work would \n     later win him the prestigious Freedom Award.\n       He also wanted to build up the LDS Church there and at age \n     23 became the country's presiding elder.\n      He even translated and published The Book of Mormon in \n     Serbo-Croatian and assumed all responsibility for it \n     before the Communist hierarchy.\n       Cosic's politics and religion were an irritant to Communist \n     leaders--but his popularity and talent on the basketball \n     court made them withhold action against him.\n       His patriotism showed again when Yugoslavia dissolved into \n     a multisided civil war at the end of communism. At the time, \n     Cosic was coaching a professional team in Greece--and could \n     easily have stayed far from the conflict.\n       But he contacted leaders of Croatia (whom he knew because \n     he was a sports hero) to volunteer for whatever they needed. \n     Because he has lived in the United States and had contacts \n     with key members of Congress, they sent him to Washington as \n     a deputy ambassador to tell their story.\n       After a year into his assignment, the cancer was \n     discovered.\n       Even with it, Cosic looked--as always--for a bright spot. \n     The energy-depleting treatments forced him to stay at home. \n     Instead of complaining, he spoke with a smile about how nice \n     it was to have more time with his wife and three children.\n       He said it also gave him a chance to work on his family \n     history, which he said he had been too busy for too long to \n     research well.\n       Even with illness, he seemed to be almost always at the LDS \n     Church's Washington Temple. Some church assignments of my own \n     often took me there, and I always ran into Cosic. I joked \n     that the must live there. He smiled and said he enjoyed the \n     peace he found there--and enjoyed being near a temple, which \n     he lacked for most of his years as a member of the LDS \n     Church.\n       That's how I will remember Cosic. Always finding a reason \n     to be happy no matter what problems he faced or opportunities \n     he had to skip--even though they were often not only big, but \n     monumental.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                 [From the Deseret News, May 26, 1995]\n\n                             (By Brad Rock)\n\n              Colorful Cosic Brought Joy to BYU Basketball\n\n       Pete Witbeck can see him even now, dark hair tousled and \n     untamed, laughing in the doorway of the coaches' office 25 \n     years ago. Which is how he wants to remember Kresimir Cosic.\n       Cosic, one of the legendary basketball players in BYU \n     history, died early Thursday in a Washington D.C. hospital at \n     46, after fighting cancer for over a year.\n       The loss cast a pall over the athletic department at BYU. \n     It wasn't only that they lost a former player; it's that with \n     the passing of Cosic, a little of the joy was lost from the \n     game, too. Because nobody played for the joy of it all like \n     Cosic.\n       He arrived on the BYU varsity basketball scene in 1970 like \n     a cool wind off the Adriatic Sea, where he played as a child. \n     He was a gangly summation of tendons and bones, loping down \n     the court and driving everyone--the opposition, the coaches, \n     the fans--a little crazy. He had an 18-foot skyhook and a \n     baseline hook and a set shot beyond what is now the 3-point \n     arc. His game ranged from unorthodox to unpredictable to \n     flat-out weird.\n       ``Everyone just fell in love with the guy and the way he \n     played,'' says Witbeck.\n       When Witbeck, now BYU's associate athletic director, was an \n     assistant basketball coach for the Cougars, he recruited \n     Cosic from the former Yugoslavia. Since Cosic lived under a \n     Communist regime, contact was limited.\n       Several years after first being contacted by BYU, when the \n     Yugoslavian national team was in Naples, Cosic defected. He \n     arrived in Salt Lake City in the still-dark hours of the \n     early morning, where Cougar officials picked him up at the \n     airport. ``It was like an episode from `Mission \n     Impossible,''' says Witbeck. ``Cloak-and-dagger.''\n       Once in Provo, though, Cosic never turned back. As anyone \n     who ever saw him lead a fast break can attest, Cosic wasn't \n     one to turn back. ``When you got Kres, you got 110 percent of \n     him,'' says his friend, Bill Nixon.\n       Bursting to the forefront after a year on the freshman \n     team, Cosic caught the fans, the opposition and even the \n     coaches by surprise. He was a reedlike 195-pound, 6-11 center \n     who loved bringing the ball up the court. The guards \n     complained that centers shouldn't be leading the break, but \n     to no avail. Cosic would smile engagingly and protest that he \n     only brought the ball up because he was open.\n       Cosic's versatility was astounding for his era. In a time \n     of mostly slow, post-up centers, Cosic ranged across the \n     court. Before David Robinson, Hakeem Olajuwon or Sam Perkins, \n     there was Cosic. He could make a wraparound pass, dribble \n     between his legs, put up a finger roll or nail the perimeter \n     shot with surprising adeptness. He was Pete Maravich with six \n     more inches. Fans packed the Smith Fieldhouse and later the \n     Marriott Center to see him cast his spell.\n       Witbeck's enduring memory is of a tight game for the \n     conference championship against rival Utah. Cosic was \n     bringing the ball down\n      the middle on a fast break, when Utah guard Mike Newlin came \n     over to check Cosic, expecting him to pass it to the wing. \n     But Cosic unexpectedly lifted into the air near the free \n     throw line, tucking his knees under his chin like a 737 \n     folding up its landing gear, and laying the ball off the \n     glass.\n       Cosic looped out from under the basket, trying hard not to \n     smile. The coaches, who had been worrying about Cosic losing \n     the ball out of bounds, exhaled. The Utah players gaped in \n     astonishment. ``The things he'd do were unbelievable,'' says \n     Witbeck.\n       Cosic ignored overtures from the NBA in order to return to \n     Yugoslavia, where he spent most of the rest of his life in \n     church and civic work. When he died, he was serving as \n     Croatia's deputy ambassador to the U.S.\n       But it's his career at BYU for which he will be most \n     remembered. Of all the stars in the school's history, none \n     could turn heads like Cosic. As fierce a competitor as was \n     Danny Ainge, as dramatic as Michael Smith, as accurate as \n     Devin Durrant, as spectacular as Jeff Congdon, as unstoppable \n     as Mel Hutchins . . . nobody could bring the crowd to its \n     feet like Cosic.\n       ``Nobody who ever played for us was in his class,'' says \n     Witbeck. [[Page S8084]] \n       And none exuded the elation of basketball in quite that \n     way. In a sport now dominated by trash talk and shattered \n     backboards, navel rings and disrespect, there is something \n     sweetly appealing in the long-ago memory of Cosic, racing \n     exuberantly down the court, wondering what to do with the \n     ball, once he got to the hoop. Wondering if there were \n     anything in the world quite so much fun.\n       ``I can see him now,'' says Witbeck.\n       Witbeck can still see Cosic, all elbows and knees, taking \n     in a rebound and turning to start the break. He pictures the \n     18-foot hooks and the court-length passes. He envisions the \n     angular shoulders filling up the frame of his office door. \n     And when he does, for just for a moment, he too can feel the \n     joy of the game.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. In these articles you find that Kresimir Cosic dazzled \nmany with his grace on the basketball court at Brigham Young University \nand wherever he played or coached. He is also remembered as a devoted \npatriot who served his country, Croatia, and ours, as Croatia's Deputy \nAmbassador to the United States.\n  Although Cosic suffered later in his life from cancer, he still \nremained in service to his faith, family, and country.\n  I hope my colleagues will take the opportunity to read these \narticles, because they truly describe the great man Kresimir Cosic was.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8083-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, if I had to come up with a title for the \nshort statement I would like to make this morning, I would call it \nsomething along the lines of: ``Look which pot is calling the kettle \nblack.'' Anyone even fleetingly familiar with the People's Republic of \nChina will recognize the Beijing Government's frequent admonitions to \nus about ``interfering in China's internal affairs.'' We express \nconcern about the PRC's deplorable treatment of hundreds of \nprodemocracy students at Tiananmen Square in 1989, and we are told not \nto interfere in China's internal affairs. We worry about how Chinese \npolicies may affect our economic interests in Hong Kong, and we are \ntold not to interfere in China's internal affairs. Myriad statements \nmade just this month by the Foreign Ministry, the State-controlled \npress, party and government cadres are replete with these references.\n  For example, the PRC's Xinhua domestic service on May 11 carried the \nfollowing statement in reaction to the Senate vote urging the \nadministration to admit Taiwan's President Lee to this country for a \nprivate visit: ``The U.S. Senate, in passing the resolution in \ndisregard of the solemn position of the Chinese side, has constituted a \ngross interference in China's internal affairs.'' When our government \nlast week protested the recent arrests of several members of China's \nprodemocracy movement for no apparent reason other than the approach of \nthe June 4 anniversary of Tiananmen, the reaction of the Foreign \nMinistry's spokesman Shen Guofang was this:\n\n       ``A very evil shortcoming of the U.S. Government is that it \n     always criticizes the internal affairs of other countries * * \n     *. It would be advisable for the U.S. Government to mind its \n     own affairs.''\n\n  When the State Department urged the parties to the Spratly Island \ndispute to come to a peaceful solution thereto because of the serious \neffect any regional conflict might have on world trade, we were \nreminded that the PRC is opposed to ``other countries' interference in \nthe matter.\n  It is clear to me, though, that our Chinese friends are in no \nposition to lecture this country on the topic of meddling; they are \nbetter at it than most. For example, in regards to the visit of \nPresident Lee, which individuals we admit to this country for private \nvisits pursuant to our immigration laws is purely an internal affair of \nthe United States in which China has no business meddling; yet the PRC \nhas raised a furor over the decision and has sought to impose its will \non us by dictating our internal policies to us. Similarly, the Chinese \nForeign Ministry derided the administration's recent decision to impose \na trade embargo on Iran because of the latter's penchant for sponsoring \nterrorism; yet that decision is inarguably a bilateral issue between us \nand Iran in which China has no license to interfere.\n  Related examples of China seeking to inject itself into the purely \ninternal affairs of other countries are legion. For instance, China \nconsistently denounces the government of Israel in that country's \nvarious dealings with its Arab neighbors; yet these issues are strictly \nbilateral ones between Israel and the country concerned and China has \nno place in concerning itself with them. The PRC has a long history of \ncondemning the government of the Republic of Korea in its dealings with \nNorth Korea, but China has no business meddling in such a uniquely \nbilateral relationship.\n  Vice-Premier and PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen recently quoted a \nsaying from the Confucian Analects: ``What you do not want done to \nyourself, do not do to others.'' Yet, every day the PRC comments on \nissues which clearly, unambiguously do not concern it. So, Mr. \nPresident, the next time the PRC feels the urge to trot out the rather \nhackneyed phrase about us ``interfering in their internal affairs'' \nthey should pause and remember a variation of another famous saying: \n``Governments that live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.''\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8084-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          PROTECTION OF CHILDREN FROM COMPUTER PORNOGRAPHY ACT\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, at Senator Grassley's request, I have \ncosponsored the Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act, \nwhich he introduced earlier this week.\n  Since coming to Washington, Senator Grassley has been a leader in the \nfight to protect our children from the evils of pornography and sexual \nabuse. In 1994, for example, Senator Grassley was successful in passing \na law that made it a Federal crime to produce child pornography in a \nforeign country with the intent to distribute it in the United States. \nAnd, in 1993, I joined with my colleague from Iowa in supporting a \nsense of the Senate resolution opposing the Clinton administration's \nattempt to weaken the Federal child pornography laws with its misguided \nlegal brief in the Knox case.\n  Senator Grassley's bill raises many technical issues that must be \ncarefully examined before the Senate reaches any final conclusions. \nAnd, of course, whatever we do must be absolutely consistent with the \nfirst amendment.\n  I look forward to hearings on Senator Grassley's bill and to a full \nexposition of the complicated issues involved here. But, in the \nmeantime, I wanted to show my support for my colleague from Iowa, whose \ncommitment to protecting our children has never waivered.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8084-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         WELCOME TO KELLY JOHNSTON AND TRIBUTE TO SHEILA BURKE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I join with all Senators in welcoming Kelly \nJohnston as secretary of the Senate.\n  For the past 3 years, Kelly has served as staff director of the \nSenate Republican Policy Committee, where he has won the respect of all \nSenators--Republican and Democrat--for his intelligence and integrity. \nKelly has an impressive 14-year career working in the legislative and \nexecutive branch, and I am confident he will do an outstanding job in \noverseeing the legislative administration of the Senate.\n  Kelly will succeed Sheila Burke, who has served as secretary since \nthe beginning of this Congress.\n  During that time, Sheila succeeded in creating a secretary's office \nthat was both smaller and smarter.\n  Under her leadership, a 12.5-percent reduction in the secretary's \nbudget was achieved, without cutting needed services to Members and the \npublic.\n  Sheila also took the lead in bringing many advancements in technology \nto the secretary's office, including many that will result in long-term \nsavings of tax dollars.\n  Under her guidance, improvements were made in the Senate page \nschool--improvements that will ensure a quality education for the\n pages, and ones that saved the Senate close to $100,000.\n\n  Sheila was also the guiding force behind the family night, in the \nSenate dining room, allowing all of us to spend more time with our most \nimportant constituents--our families.\n  Sheila will continue to serve as my chief-of-staff, and I know all \nSenators join me in thanking this dedicated public servant for a job \nwell done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8084-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S8085]]\n\n                   PROPOSED SIMON AMENDMENT TO S. 652\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, today I submit an amendment that I plan to \noffer to S. 652, the telecommunications bill next week. The amendment \nwill ensure that when the Regional Bell Operating Companies enter the \nbusiness of manufacturing, the consumer will be protected against \npossible price increases as a result of cross-subsidization and self-\ndealing. While some of us may disagree on the wisdom of allowing the \nBell companies into manufacturing, no one should disagree on the need \nto ensure the consumer is protected against possible rate increases.\n  I applaud the authors of the legislation for including certain \nsafeguards already in the legislation. My amendment would take these \nprotections one step further by requiring an audit conducted at the \ndirection of the State. The language, which is based on last year's \ntelecommunications bill, is simple and straightforward.\n  I hope that my colleagues will agree and adopt this important \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be printed in the \nRecord.\n       On page 31, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n       ``(d) Biennial Audit.--\n       ``(1) General requirement.--A company required to operate a \n     separate subsidiary under this section shall obtain and pay \n     for an audit every 2 years conducted by an independent \n     auditor selected by, and working at the direction of, the \n     State commission of each State in which such company provides \n     service, to determine whether such company has complied with \n     this section and the regulations promulgated under this \n     section, and particularly whether such company has complied \n     with the separate accounting requirements under subsection \n     (b).\n       ``(2) Results submitted to commission; state commissions.--\n     The auditor described in paragraph (1) shall submit the \n     results of the audit to the Commission and to the State \n     commission of each State in which the company audited \n     provides service, which shall make such results available for \n     public inspection.

Mr. President, we are still in a period for morning \nbusiness. I wanted to indicate that the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, Senator Pressler, is standing by. He is prepared to do \nbusiness. He is sincere about finishing the telecommunications bill, \nand he is prepared to stay here for the rest of the afternoon and on \ninto the night. But in order for him to do business, somebody has to \noffer an amendment.\n  Now, it is my hope that we can finish this bill by next Tuesday \nevening. Senators Pressler and Hollings think that may be possible. I \nunderstand that there are some who wanted to debate and said they were \nnot getting time to debate, and they are not here at the present time--\nSenator Dorgan and Senator Kerrey. Senator Pressler is on the floor. If \nyou want to debate your amendment, this is a good opportunity. We want \nto finish this bill and move on to either welfare reform or regulatory \nreform next week.\n  So, hopefully, we will finish the bill no later than Tuesday evening. \nWe will not file cloture today. This is an important bill. We should \nhave a lengthy debate. A lot of people have different ideas on this \nbill. Certainly, we should be able to complete action on the bill by \nTuesday. That would give us the better part of about 4\\1/2\\ to 5 days, \nwhich seems to be a considerable length of time, considering the \nimportance of the bill.\n  But I just say that Senator Pressler is here and ready to do \nbusiness. If the Senator from Iowa has an amendment, we would be happy \nto engage in a debate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. CHAFEE pertaining to the introduction of S. 910 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, since I have to catch a flight back to \nMinnesota, and I understand the majority leader is going to be coming \nout in a moment, I just wanted to say to all who have been involved in \nthese negotiations I am very pleased. I know that Senator Levin, \nSenator Feingold, and Senator Lautenberg join me.\n  I thank Senator Ford from Kentucky and my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. It seems as if what we are going to have is an \nannouncement that will make it clear that in July, and certainly no \nlater than the end of the month, we will have an opportunity to have \nboth lobby disclosure and the gift ban in this Chamber, and we will \nhave the debate and we will have votes.\n  I think that is the way it should be. I am very pleased with what I \nunderstand is certainly going to be an agreement. The majority leader \nwill go into this in more detail, and he will read the terms of the \nagreement, but this is what we have all been working for. It is what we \nhave all been negotiating about. And from my own point of view, I think \nthe most important thing is that this will be an opportunity for the \nSenate to go on record, this will be an opportunity for the Senate to, \nI think, really lead the way on a measure that has everything to do \nwith openness in the political process, with accountability, with \nchanging matters for the better.\n  People in the country really believe in public service, want to \nbelieve in public service. All of us do, Democrats and Republicans \nalike. I think this moment in July and this debate, this discussion and \nthe final action by the Senate will be a very strong and positive \nreform.\n  So I am very pleased that finally these negotiations have borne \nfruit, and I am pleased that the majority leader will be out here to \nannounce this. I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, we have had some ongoing negotiations the \nlast several days on lobbying reform legislation and gift ban \nlegislation as it affects the Senate or affects Congress, depending on \nwhich prevails.\n  We have a unanimous-consent agreement. It is fairly lengthy, but I \ncan read it. In any event, I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that not later than Friday, July 28, and \nafter notification of the minority leader, that we proceed to S. 101, a \nlobbying gift ban bill, the bill having been discharged and placed on \nthe calendar by this consent agreement; that the motion to proceed be \nagreed to and the bill then be automatically divided into two separate \npieces of legislation; the first measure embodying the text of title I \nregarding lobbying reform, and the second measure embodying the text of \ntitle II regarding gift rules; that the clerk be authorized to make the \nnecessary changes in the form of the measure or matter that are \nappropriate, so that each measure stands on its own; that the Senate \nthen begin consideration of the measure embodying title I; that \nimmediately upon the disposition of that measure, the Senate turn to \nthe consideration of the measure embodying title II; and that the \npreceding all occur without any intervening action or debate.\n  That is the first part of the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. And the second part.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that if, after third reading of the \nsecond bill, which is gift rules, that bill contains matter which only \napplies to the Senate, the Senate then immediately turn to the \nconsideration of a Senate resolution that contains the text of that \nlanguage; that a vote occur on the resolution, without any intervening \naction or debate; and that the Senate bill be indefinitely postponed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I further ask unanimous consent that this agreement be null \nand void if a unanimous-consent agreement can be subsequently reached \ngoverning the Senate's consideration of legislation regarding the \ncongressional gift rules and an original bill regarding lobbying \nreform, or a bill that encompasses both proposals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that no bill, resolution, \nor amendment regarding the congressional gift ban rule or lobbying \nreform bill be in order prior to the execution of this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The text of the agreement is as follows:\n\n       Ordered, That prior to the August recess, but not later \n     than Friday, July 28, 1995, the Majority Leader, after \n     notification of the Minority Leader, shall proceed to S. 101, \n     a Lobbying Gift Ban Bill.\n       Ordered further, That the motion to proceed be agreed to \n     and the bill then be automatically divided into two separate \n     pieces of legislation: the first measure embodying the text \n     of Title I regarding lobbying reform, and the second measure \n     embodying the text of Title II regarding gift rules: \n     Provided, That the Clerk be authorized to make the necessary \n     changes in the form of the measure or matter that are \n     appropriate, so that each measure stands on its own.\n       Ordered further, That the Senate then begin consideration \n     of the measure embodying Title I, that immediately upon the \n     disposition of that measure, the Senate turn to the \n     consideration of the measure embodying Title II, and that the \n     preceding all occur without any intervening action or debate.\n       Ordered further, That if after third reading of the second \n     bill, that bill contains matter which only applies to the \n     Senate, the Senate then immediately turn to the consideration \n     of a Senate resolution that contains the text of that \n     language, and that a vote occur on the resolution, without \n     any intervening action or debate, and that the Senate bill be \n     indefinitely postponed.\n       Ordered further, That this agreement be null and void if a \n     unanimous consent agreement can be subsequently reached \n     governing the Senate's consideration of legislation regarding \n     the Congressional gift rules and an original bill regarding \n     lobbying reform, or a bill that encompasses both proposals.\n       Ordered further, That no bill, resolution, or amendment \n     regarding the Congressional gift ban rule or the lobbying \n     reform bill be in order prior to the execution of this \n     agreement.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, having gotten the consent agreement, let me \nindicate what it does.\n  We have been trying for some time to come together on a lobbying \nreform bill and gift rule changes. We are not there yet, but there is, \nI think it is fair to say, honest negotiation going on on both sides. \nThis is not a partisan matter. I do not know of anybody here who does \nnot want lobbying reform, depending on how you define ``reform.''\n  And I do not know of anybody who does not believe we can improve the \ngift rules that apply to Members of Congress. We have been working with \nthe distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Senator Ford, and others on \nthat side of the aisle. As I understand, there will be a number of us \non each side of the aisle working together in the next few weeks to see \nif we can come up with a separate package, but, if not, then we will \nproceed to S. 101.\n  If we come up with a package and we agree on it, obviously, we have \nnow consent to go to that. That is precisely what it is. I hope that we \ncan do this. We will take it up no later than Friday, July 28, and if \nwe have some agreement, or even without an agreement, it should not \ntake more than 2 or 3 days of the Senate's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I want to thank the majority leader for his \npatience, Senator Lott's patience, and others as we have tried to move \nthrough this, because it is complicated. If it is a resolution, it only \napplies to the Senate. If it is a bill, it applies to the House and \nSenate.\n  There are different views on lobbying reform and on gift ban. But \nthis S. 101 is a bipartisan piece of legislation. It is Cohen, Levin, \nWellstone, and others as it relates to bipartisanship. So there is an \ninterest on both sides of the aisle to work something out. Senator \nLevin has worked very hard, as the majority leader knows, to put this \ntogether and to bring this bill to the attention of the Senate and to \nhave a stand-alone vote. Also, Senator Wellstone, Senator Feingold, \nSenator Lautenberg--very sincere and like-minded individuals--and \nothers.\n  I hope we at some point, as the majority leader says, can come \ntogether with a bipartisan effort so we can agree on it. If we do, I \nthink it will be a bellwether day. Let me thank him and others who have \nbeen so diligent in this. We all understand the give and take, and \nsometimes we have to walk off and let it cool a little and come back \nand go after it again. That is the system. That is the institution. As \nof today, I am proud I am here. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator from Kentucky. I just hope this is \nsomething on which the leadership, including the Senator from Kentucky, \nobviously the Senator from Mississippi, Senator Lott, myself, and \nSenator Daschle, will have some input.\n  It seems to me we have to take some responsibility for changes in the \nlobbying procedures and also gift rules. I am prepared to do that. I \nknow the Senator from Kentucky and I assume the Senators from South \nDakota and Mississippi are, too, working with other Senators, because \ndifferent people have different ideas on what reform is and what rule \nchanges ought to be made.\n  As far as I am concerned, they can go as far as they want. It does \nnot make any difference to this Senator. But I think we can work out a \nreasonable approach to get it done and get it behind us either before \nor during the August recess, let us put it that way, because we are not \ncertain when the August recess will begin.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator qualify during the recess? \nWork on it after we go or is he indicating we may not go out?\n  Mr. DOLE. In fact, I should say, in all candor, we are working this \nweekend--my staff has been directed to work with others to see how much \nwe really believe we can finish by the date of the normal August \nrecess, which is scheduled to begin on Friday, August 4, and scheduled \nto conclude on September 5.\n  Obviously, all Senators hope we can keep that entire period of time. \nIt is my hope we can also do that. But I must say to my colleagues, we \nneed to take a hard look at where we are. It is a question of how long \nwe stay out in August or how long we stay here in November. So it will \nbe one way or the other. We will try to give everybody \n[[Page S8087]] some indication by the end of next week whether we will \nstart the August recess on the 4th or the 11th or the 18th or \nthereafter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8086-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JUNE 12, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, all Members should be aware that the Senate \nwill resume consideration of the telecommunications bill at 1 o'clock \non Monday. The chairman is here. He is ready to do business now. He \nwill be ready to do business on Monday. Senator Pressler is available. \nSenators should, therefore, be aware that rollcall votes can be \nexpected throughout Monday's session of the Senate, however, not before \n5 p.m. on Monday.\n  Let me indicate to my colleagues who will say, ``Well, we didn't have \nenough time for debate,'' we have time right now. It is 3:10. For 3, 4, \n5 hours, the Senator from South Dakota is willing to stay on into the \nevening and will be here all day Monday. So I hope people do not come \nback at 5 and say, ``We didn't have time to debate.''\n  We have all day today and all day Monday starting at 1 o'clock. I \njust said if we cannot get an up-or-down vote on the pending amendment, \nthen all the recourse the manager would have would be to make a motion \nto table sometime on Monday. I did not file cloture to shut off debate. \nIt is a very important amendment. It is a very important bill. I am not \ntrying to take time away from any Senators. You can see there is nobody \nhere. So all those people who complain Monday about having time to \ndebate, they could have been here today. Right?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Right.\n  Mr. DOLE. And they can be here Monday. So I just hope if we are told \nwe have not had time, we need more time to debate, that they will think \nabout what they did not do on Friday and what they could have done on \nMonday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8087-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I have delayed bringing up this matter until \nan appropriate time when I would not necessarily inconvenience all of \nmy colleagues with the very important amendments that I have had a part \nin developing as a member of the committee of jurisdiction, the \nCommerce Committee.\n  I will be back on the floor on this matter, though, next week before \nthe vote or votes are held on the matter on which I wish to address the \nSenate today. There has been a great amount of behind-the-scenes \nactivity. There has been a great amount of activity on the Internet \nsystem, and I am here today to outline the measure that I will offer as \na substitute to the measure that was reported unanimously out of the \nCommerce Committee, called the Exon decency bill with regard to the \nInternet.\n  I cannot think of a more appropriate means of bringing this to the \nattention of the Senate and the American people than in our debate and \neventual enactment of the telecommunications legislation, which is the \nmost far-reaching legislation dating back to 1934. Obviously, everyone \nknows of the dramatic developments in telecommunications since 1934. It \nis about time we do something.\n  But as we are doing this, and with the many important factors that we \nhave considered and deliberated on for a long, long time, including \nlast year when the Commerce Committee had extensive hearings on the \nwhole matter and scope of telecommunications, what we should do and \nshould not do, what we should try to do, and what we can do--\nunfortunately, the Senate adjourned before that bill was reported out \nof the Commerce Committee last year and was considered and enacted into \nlaw.\n  When Senator Pressler took over as the very distinguished chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee this year, Senator Pressler, rightfully, in \ncompany with the Democratic leader on the Commerce Committee, Senator \nHollings, moved very aggressively on, once again, bringing forth a \npiece of legislation not distinctly different from the legislation that \nwe reported after extensive hearings and deliberations and brought to \nthe floor last year.\n  So here we are, Mr. President, making some very significant changes. \nOne of the things this Senator feels we should properly address, and \nwill address and, hopefully, act on in a fair and reasonable fashion, \nwith full understanding, absent of outlandish claims and charges, is \nthe matter of trying to clean up the Internet--or the information \nsuperhighway, as it is frequently called--to make that superhighway a \nsafe place for our children and our families to travel on.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record and held at the \ndesk. I will formally call it up for consideration sometime next week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator has that right.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, earlier this week, I circulated a ``Dear \nColleague'' letter which explained the revisions in the communications \ndecency provision. In title IV of the telecommunications reform bill, \nas my colleagues know, title IV includes legislation that I have worked \non for about a year to make the Internet and other aspects of the \ninformation superhighway safer for our families and for our children to \ntravel.\n  It seems an appropriate time to explain these revisions and file my \namendment so that it may be printed in the Record, as I have just asked \nfor and received consent for--primarily, for the convenience and review \nof my colleagues before we debate this matter further next week and \neventually come to a vote.\n  Mr. President, some basic rules of the road need to be established. \nAs the information superhighway rolls up to the front door of every \nhousehold and school and library in America, this bill will bring \nexciting, revolutionary, and new information technologies within the \nreach of every American. There has not been anything that I think is \nmore exciting that has ever been developed than the information \nsuperhighway and what it is going to do to make more information and \nmore education readily accessible to any who seek it.\n  I have said on many occasions that I happen to believe the whole \ncomputer Internet system is the most important, the most revolutionary \ndevelopment since the printing press. Eventually, I predict, it will do \nas much good for circulation of information as the printing press. I \nsupport the development of this so very, very strongly.\n  I simply cite that there are some dangerous places, Mr. President, on \nthe information superhighway. I think that while we are creating this \nas an important part of our new telecommunications bill, we who are \ncharged with the responsibilities to pass laws that are reasonable and \nproper should emphasize a little in our thinking what is proper and \nwhat is not proper. [[Page S8088]] \n  It is my intention to point out to the U.S. Senate some of what I \nthink is highly improper, what I think is eroding the society and will \ncontinue to erode the society of America, unless we have the courage to \nstand up and do something about it, despite the minority of naysayers \nin the United States of America who do not want to change anything.\n  Mr. President, the Snowe-Rockefeller-Exon-Kerrey amendment that \nassures that schools and libraries will gain affordable access to the \ndigital world, including the Library of Congress, the great \nuniversities, and the museums, will remain in place.\n  The Communications Decency Act is proposed in the context of this \ninformation revolution that is exploding in our society. Just as we \nmodernize the rules which apply to the telecommunications industry, we \nneed to modernize the rules which apply to the use of their products \nand their services that are going to be distributed in a form that we \nnever even imagined previously.\n  Unfortunately, the current laws, which clearly protect young and old \nusers from harassment and obscenity and indecency, are woefully out of \ndate with this new challenge and this new opportunity. The current law \nis drafted in the technology, primarily, of the telephone, dating back \nto 1934. Our efforts today, and in the coming weeks, bring closer the \nday of technological convergence. Soon the concept of a telephone will \nbe as relevant as today's concept of the telegraph.\n  The principles that I have proposed in the Communications Decency Act \nare simple and constitutional. Telecommunications devices should not be \nused to distribute obscenity, indecency to minors, or used to harass \nthe innocent.\n  The revisions offered to the committee-reported bill are in response \nto concerns raised by the Justice Department, the profamily and \nantipornography groups, and the first amendment scholars. If anyone \nwould take the time to look through them and study them, I think most, \nbut not all, would conclude that they are reasonable and proper.\n  I have also had a great deal of cooperation from the online service \nproviders. The online service providers, of course, are those \nentrepreneurs who have assisted us in providing services to the many \noutlets that are anxious to have their services in America. These \nservice providers are key members of this new industry.\n  Certainly, what we are trying to do here is to only craft and put \ninto law some of the provisions that have been in existence for a long, \nlong time, way back to 1934, to make sure that the same restrictions \nthat were necessary and have been placed into law, and have been held \nconstitutional time and time again by the courts, have a role to play \nin the new Internet system and how that Internet system reacts, as best \nexplained on this chart, which I will get to in a few moments.\n  So I have had good cooperation from many, many people who are truly \nexperts in this area, including members of the telephone industry who \nhave worked and operated without problems under very similar, if not \nidentical, restraints in the law that everyone thought had been good.\n  The proposed revisions that I have submitted to the desk that passed \nunanimously out of the Commerce Committee, follow closely the confines \nof several Supreme Court cases. I am very confident that this \nlegislation will withstand a constitutional challenge.\n  I am not interested, Mr. President, in passing a piece of legislation \nhere, and then say, ``Look what a good job we did,'' and then have that \nmatter in the very near future declared unconstitutional by the Supreme \nCourt. We would have to start all over again.\n  I assure all from the beginning, I have put out the hand of \ncooperation to all parties--even those most opposed to any action \nwhatever in this area--and I find that there are a great number of \nwell-intentioned people who shudder at the thought of passing any kind \nof legislation in this area.\n  They are not bad people. I just do not think they fully understand, \nas I think I do and as I think 9 out of 10 Americans do, when they find \nout what is going on, on the information superhighway today.\n  Mr. President, a few days ago I had a remarkable demonstration, in \nmore detail than I had even fully known, of what is readily available \nto any child with the very basic Internet access. I want to repeat \nthat, Mr. President: Of what is readily available to any child with the \nbasic Internet access. It is not an exaggeration to say that the worst, \nmost vile, most perverse pornography is only a few click-click-clicks \naway from any child on the Internet.\n  I have talked to so many people about this and had so many interviews \nand read so much material. There have been many experiences during \nthese last few months, people have told me of the fact that they knew \nnothing about what was on the Internet with regard to what I was \nconcerned about.\n  Only last week I had a journalist who was doing a story on this who \nconceded--this was a woman--when she started writing this story she was \nextremely skeptical of what my motives were and whether there truly was \na problem. It just happened that very recently, though, during the \nprocess of writing the article that she was doing for a national \npublication, she put her computer at home on the Internet system and \nwas sitting with her 8- or 9-year-old daughter one evening.\n  She said, ``Senator, I got my eyes opened very wide, very quickly.'' \nShe said, ``I was astonished at what I came across accidentally. Even \nmore astonished when I started doing even preliminary searches of what \nwe were getting into. Finally, I recognized it was not something I \nwanted my daughter to see, let alone me sharing it with her.''\n  I did a television show on this subject. Half the people that called \nin were very upset that I was not for free speech, I wanted to violate \nthe Constitution.\n  The most rewarding of those who supported it was a call out of the \nblue from an obviously very young person who identified himself as a \n12-year-old boy. He said, ``Senator Exon, I want to salute you for \ndoing this. I am a 12-year-old. I am completely literate on the \ncomputer. I have seen and observed the material that you are talking \nabout. It is common talk among all of us my age and younger, and, of \ncourse, older, in school.'' He said, ``I appreciate the fact you are \ntrying to do something about it, because someone has to.'' That word \nfrom a 12-year-old really meant more to me, Mr. President, than all of \nthe brickbats that have been thrown my way from, basically, people that \nI think are uninformed in what this Senator is trying to do.\n  The fundamental purpose of the Communications Decency Act is to \nprovide much-needed protection for children. Throughout the process of \nrefining this legislation, I have held out the hand of friendship and \nunderstanding and cooperation to those who have had different ideas, \nand I have made revisions in many instances that I think are very \nappropriate and help in our effort rather than hurt us.\n  I responded to the concerns raised over the last several months and \nthose raised earlier today by my friend and colleague from the State of \nVermont, Senator Leahy. I have publicly and privately expressed support \nfor Senator Leahy's study. But not as a substitute for or at the \nexpense of these critical provisions which are designed to allow \nchildren and families to share and enjoy the many wonderful benefits of \nthe information revolution that are taking part on the Internet.\n  The reason that I am concerned is that I am afraid that there are \nsome of my colleagues in the Senate on both sides of the aisle that \nmight be tempted by Senator Leahy's efforts, that have been primarily \nsponsored, as I understand it, by the Clinton administration people, \nprimarily in the Justice Department.\n  What the Clinton administration and the Justice Department is trying \nto do is punt--punt like in football. We happen to know something about \nfootball in Nebraska. I would simply say that any time Nebraska has a \nfourth down and 37 yards on our own 3-yard line, they always punt. But \nthis is not a time to punt on this important matter, if it concerns my \ncolleagues as much as it does me.\n  I think if they will take time to study it, most of my colleagues \nwould agree that we cannot punt. Even though it is third down or fourth \ndown and 37, we better act.\n  In response to the concerns that have been raised by the Justice \nDepartment [[Page S8089]] and others, the Exon revision drops the \nbill's definition of ``knowing'' and the so-called ``predominant \ndefense issue.''\n  The remaining defenses are narrow and streamlined and limited to the \nnew revised section 223. A new section is added to assure that no other \nFederal statute will be limited or affected by the Communications \nDecency Act.\n  I want to repeat that, Mr. President: The new section is added to \nassure that no other Federal statute will be limited or affected by the \nCommunications Decency Act.\n  This is important to many Members and pro-family groups. The current \ndial-a-porn statute would be left untouched and unamended by the \ndecency provisions. We have made that clear.\n  Furthermore, the bill's narrow, streamlined defenses would not apply \nto the current dial-a-porn law or any other Federal statute. We are \nleaving that measure that has been heavily debated, on which there have \nbeen court cases alone, to stand exactly like it is.\n  The Exon Decency Act does not touch it.\n  With these revisions, decency provisions pose no risk to any current \nor future dial-a-porn, obscenity, or indecency prosecution. The State \npreemption provision in the committee-reported bill is clarified, in \nthat its application is limited to commercial activities and consistent \nwith the interstate commerce clause. This provision will assure that \nbusinesses and nonprofit services and access providers know that State \nand Federal rules and obligations with respect to the Communications \nDecency Act are consistent and are predictable. This assurance is \ncritical to any interstate enterprise.\n  In addition, new language is added to this provision to assure that \nthe State preemption provision in no way limits State authority over \nactivities not covered by the Communications Decency Act. In other \nwords, State child endangerment or delinquency statutes will in no way \nbe adversely affected by this legislation.\n  The heart and the soul of the Communications Decency Act are its \nprotection for families and children. The distribution of obscenity and \nindecency to minors by means of telecommunications devices would be \ncovered by new sections in the revised language. Unlike the current \ndial-a-porn statute, there would be no noncommercial loophole in the \nnew provisions. I am saddened to report that there is a great deal of \ngrossly obscene and indecent material on the Internet available to \nanyone free of charge. The decency revisions strengthen the committee-\nreported bill by providing clear, constitutional, and much-needed \nprotections for users of the telecommunications services.\n  I look forward to discussing this critical piece of legislation as \nthe Senate further considers the telecommunications reform bill, as I \nindicated earlier, next week.\n  Mr. President, given the floor debate will be a key part of the \nlegislative history for these new provisions, I ask unanimous consent \nthat a section-by-section analysis, as well as the text of my \namendment, be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The Chair had previously given authority for those to be printed. I \nam asking that they be printed following the conclusion of my remarks \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. EXON. I also ask that a copy of an Omaha World-Herald article, \nwhich appeared in the Seattle Times, entitled, ``Police Cruise the \nInformation Highway'' appear in the Record, also following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. EXON. I send those to the desk for action, as has been agreed to.\n  Mr. President, let me, if I might at this juncture, go into a little \nfurther discussion as best I can, and as I think decency would allow me \nto proceed. This is the blue book. This is a sample of what is \navailable today free of charge: Click, click, click on the computer, on \nthe information superhighway. This will be available for any of my \ncolleagues who are not familiar with what is going on on the Internet \ntoday, to have a firsthand look at the listings of materials that are \navailable free of charge and pictures of what is being shown. To give \nan idea, let me read through some of the listings that appear on the \nbulletin boards.\n  The computer is a wonderful device for arranging, storing, and making \nit relatively easy for anyone to call up information or pictures on any \nsubject they want. That is part of the beauty of the Internet system. \nThis is on some of these bulletin boards, and there is such a long list \nit would take a big binder to cover all of them, but let me read \nthrough what is in the form of pictures that have been taken on \ncomputer screens on the Internet. I have several pages of them here. I \nam going to just go through some of them and tell you any child who can \nread--and of course anyone else, too--could click onto this kind of an \nindex that tells them what to do to punch in very easily to any of \nthese types of things.\n\n       Multimedia erotica; erotica fetish; nude celebrities; \n     pictures black, erotic females; pictures boys; pictures \n     celebrities; pictures children; pictures erotic children; \n     pictures erotica; pictures erotica amateur; pictures erotica \n     amateur females; pictures erotica amateur males; erotica \n     animal; erotica auto; erotica bestiality; erotica bestiality, \n     hamster, duct tape; bestiality, hamster, duct tape; [two of \n     those] erotica black females; erotica black males; erotica \n     blondes; erotica bondage; erotica breasts. Here is a good \n     one: Erotica cartoons; erotica children; erotica female; \n     erotica female, anal; erotica fetish; erotica fury; erotica \n     gay men; erotica male; erotica male, anal; erotica Oriental; \n     erotica porn star.\n\n  This goes on and on and on--so much repetition. But it is startling, \npage after page after page, on screen after screen after screen--free, \nfree of charge, with a click, click, click.\n  The blue book will be available to any who want to see how bad this \nis. I hope if any of my colleagues are not familiar with it, they \nbecome familiar.\n  Mr. President, I draw the Senate's attention to the chart that I have \nbefore me. I have been here in the Senate for 17 years. I think this is \nthe second time I have ever used charts. We never had charts in the \nSenate until we had television. But now we talk to our American \ncitizens, many of whom watch us very religiously from their homes \nthroughout the Nation, as much as we do to our colleagues on the floor.\n  To try to explain this as briefly as I can, and I certainly do not \nclaim to be an expert at it, the Internet system here in the center is \nthe information system and the information system explosion that I have \nbeen talking about. When we look at what is good about this system, it \nis the Internet, the information, and all the multitude of good that is \ncoming out of this today and is going to be further exploding in the \nfuture.\n  Then we have people at home on the Internet and children at home on \nthe Internet. Under the system that the Exon Decency Act would provide \nand protect is this kind of a system with those at home, the children, \nhaving direct and full access to the Internet. After they get on the \nInternet, there would be a degree of protection\n to keep them from going on to the pornography bulletin boards.\n\n  That is what I am talking about here. The child at home, the adult at \nhome could get on the Internet and they could go to the Library of \nCongress, the museums or any of the other magnificent sources of \ninformation we have. But anyone who pollutes that system over here on \nthe pornography bulletin board would be subjected to the restraints in \nthe law that the Exon decency provision tries to put in place.\n  Let me describe this for just a moment, if I might, and emphasize \nonce again that we have today laws against--and providing fines and \njail terms--people who misuse the telephone system to promiscuously \nspread pornography.\n  We also have in like manner in that regard laws prohibiting the use \nof United States mail for pornography.\n  Obviously, Mr. President, under the present law we do not put the \ninnocent mailman in jail for delivering pornography, which is prevented \nby the law, from one place into a home.\n  This is a way that I would like to see, and I think most people would \nlike to see, the Internet operate. But that is not the way the system \nworks today and is the reason for the Exon decency provisions.\n  This is the way it works, Mr. President. You will notice in the \nprevious chart that there are lines connecting these entities. On this \nchart, I simply say to you this is the way it is today. This is the way \nit is today where either [[Page S8090]] the child or the adult at home \nenters the Internet system and is automatically connected with an \nadditional click to the pornography bulletin board which is the \nmaterial in the blue book and everything that I connected with it that \nI call smut. They are all connected together.\n  I happen to feel, if we make law the Exon decency bill, the Exon \ndecency bill would not prevent or eliminate people from seeking the \npornography bulletin board, and if they are adults and if the material \non that is designed for and dedicated to adults, whom I would basically \ndescribe perhaps for these purposes as someone 18 years of age or more, \nthen they could seek out the pornography bulletin board, and any of the \npeople on the Internet, who have been claiming that Senator Exon's bill \nwants to close them down, if they want to watch pornography on the \nInternet, should have that right. I agree. I do not like it but I \nagree. It would be unconstitutional I think if we tried to eliminate \nthat totally.\n  What I am trying to do with the Exon Decency Act is make the Internet \nlike this rather than the direct connection accidentally to this \nsystem.\n  Over here in the pornography bulletin board we have entrepreneurs, \nentrepreneurs who are seeking money, cash money-making opportunities. \nThey have facilities to where you dial into these bulletin boards, and \nthey will through a credit card system allow you to subscribe whenever \nyou want to the whole galaxy of things that they have, some of which I \nread out of the blue book. And that would continue, that would be \nallowed for adults under the Exon Decency Act.\n  What would be prevented under the Exon Decency Act is that these \npeople who make lots of money, hundreds of millions of dollars selling \nsmut, people on this pornography bulletin board, not unlike the Library \nof Congress, if I dare use that example, have a complete library of \nanything and everything that you could possibly imagine that you might \nsee in an adult bookstore. If it is pocketed over there where it is \nvery difficult to reach and you have to pay for it, that is one thing. \nBut that is not the way it is.\n  What do these entrepreneurs over here do, Mr. President? What they do \nis to use the free access, without charge advertising with the best of \nsome of their pornographic, obscene material, and they put it over here \non the Internet with their printing press. That is a printing press and \neverybody has one. They can enter their computer, and they can take off \nanything that is in the Internet and store it, if they have the proper \nequipment. And people do.\n  Let me emphasize once again what I am trying to do, Mr. President, is \nto stop these people over here essentially from using teasers, not \nunlike coming attractions that we see when we go to the movies--best of \nthe coming shows that will be here 2 weeks from today. And obviously \nwhen you get into movies you see some of the most violent explosions on \npreviews of things to come.\n  When they, the pornographers over here, the money-making \npornographers enter the free system of advertising, you do not even \nhave to pay the price of going in and sitting down in a seat at a movie \ntheater. What they do is take the best and most enticing pictures of \nwhatever they want to sell that particular day or that particular week \nand they enter it over here on the Internet. They are posted on the \nbulletin board. And those are the ones, those are the pictures, those \nare the articles that are freely, without charge, accessible to very \nyoung children and to anyone else who wants to see them.\n  Among other things, the Exon bill would prevent the money makers over \nhere--and many of them are perverts but very smart perverts--from \nadvertising free on the Internet system to pollute, in the view of this \nSenator, our children and our grandchildren.\n  Simply stated, Mr. President, I have tried to summarize this as best \nI can in the 20 or 30 minutes' time I have taken of the Senate today, \nand I will be talking more about it next week as we come to a vote on \nthis matter. I hope that most of my colleagues would recognize and \nrealize that this is not the time to punt. This is the timely way to \ntake action with regard to the telecommunications measure before us. I \nsay today, as I have said before to my colleagues and all others \noutside the Senate who have an interest in this, many of them \nlegitimate, I invite once again, if there is any particular problem you \nhave with the Exon language, come let us reason together. I am not an \nunreasonable individual as my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in \nthe Senate recognize.\n  There has been nothing that has concerned me more in my 8 years as \nGovernor of Nebraska and my 17 years of having the great opportunity to \nserve my State in the Senate, there is nothing that I feel more \nstrongly about than this piece of legislation, because I think it is \nmore than just a piece of legislation. It is a time I suggest to step \nup to the plate and not offer excuses, not go along with those who say \nI wish to do what I wish to do, when and in whatever form I want, and I \ndo not care what it might do to others.\n  I am going to do everything I can to see that a constitutional remedy \nis offered. If it is offered exactly as I am recommending or will \nrecommend in future, if changes are in order, will that stop all of \nthis and end the problem? No, it will not. It is too big for that. We \nstill have obviously pornography through the mails, yet we have laws \nagainst it. We have pornography on the telephone. I guess that we do \nnot have, though, anywhere near the stalking that is going on with \nregard to children by deviants. The newspapers have been full of that \nmaterial very recently. And there are many hundreds of cases that take \nplace all of the time that never reach the press, for obvious reasons.\n  I simply say, Mr. President, that this Senator is very dedicated to \nthis cause.\n  I have no ill will toward those who do not agree with me, but I hope \nthat after studying this they would at least agree that there is a \nproblem that we should do something about.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                             Amendment 1268\n\n       Beginning on page 137 line 12 through page 143 line 10, \n     strike all therein and insert in lieu thereof:\n       (1) by striking subsection (a) and inserting in lieu \n     thereof:\n       ``(a) Whoever--\n       ``(1) in the District of Columbia or in interstate or \n     foreign communications\n       ``(A) by means of telecommunications device knowingly--\n       ``(i) makes, creates, or solicits, and\n       ``(ii) initiates the transmission of,\n\n     any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other \n     communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or \n     indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass \n     another person;\n       ``(B) makes a telephone call or utilizes a \n     telecommunications device, whether or not conversation or \n     communication ensues, without disclosing his identity and \n     with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person \n     at the called number or who receives the communication;\n       ``(C) makes or causes the telephone of another repeatedly \n     or continuously to ring, with intent to harass any person at \n     the called number; or\n       ``(D) makes repeated telephone calls or repeatedly \n     initiates communication with a telecommunications device, \n     during which conversation or communication ensues, solely to \n     harass any person at the called number or who receives the \n     communication; or\n       ``(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility \n     under his control to be used for any activity prohibited by \n     paragraph (1) with the intent that it be used for\n      such activity,\n\n     shall be fined not more than $100,000 or imprisoned not more \n     than two years, or both.''; and\n       (2) Section 223 (47 U.S.C. 223) is further amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsections:\n       ``(d) Whoever--\n       ``(1) knowingly within the United States or in foreign \n     communications with the United States by means of \n     telecommunications device--\n       ``(A) makes, creates, or solicits, and\n       ``(B) initiates the transmission of or purposefully makes \n     available,\n\n     any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other \n     communication which is obscene, regardless of whether the \n     maker of such communication placed the call or initiated the \n     communications; or\n       ``(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility \n     under such person's control to be used for an activity \n     prohibited by subsection (d)(1) with the intent that it be \n     used for such activity;\n\n     shall be fined not more than $100,000 or imprisoned not more \n     than two years or both.\n       ``(e) Whoever--\n       ``(1) knowingly within the United States or in foreign \n     communications with the United States by means of \n     telecommunications device-- [[Page S8091]] \n       ``(A) makes, creates, or solicits, and\n       ``(B) initiates the transmission of, or purposefully makes \n     available,\n\n     any indecent comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, \n     or other communication to any person under 18 years of age \n     regardless of whether the maker of such communication placed \n     the call or initiated the communication; or\n       ``(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility \n     under such person's control to be used for an activity \n     prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be used \n     for such activity,\n\n     shall be fined not more than $100,000 or imprisoned not more \n     than two years or both.\n       ``(f) Defenses to the subsections (a), (d), and (e), \n     restrictions on access, judicial remedies respecting \n     restrictions for persons providing information services and \n     access to information services--\n       ``(1) The provision of access by a person, to a person \n     including transmission, downloading, storage, \n     navigational tools, and related capabilities which are \n     incidental to the transmission of communications, and not \n     involving the creation or editing of the content of the \n     communications, for another person's communications to or \n     from a service, facility, system, or network not under the \n     access provider's control shall by itself not be a violation \n     of subsection (a), (d), or (e).

This revision \n     would make Section 223(a) Constitutional on its face. Section \n     223(a) would become the key Federal telecommunications anti-\n     harassment provision.\n       Sections 223 (b) and (c), the current law ``dial-a-porn'' \n     statute provisions are left untouched. The ``dial-a-porn'' \n     statute remains drafted in the technology of the telephone. \n     This ``overlap'' remains as an ``insurance policy'' against \n     challenges to new sections.\n       A new Section 223(d) is added. Whoever knowingly by means \n     of telecommunications device ``makes, creates or solicits'' \n     and ``initiates the transmission of or purposefully makes \n     available'' an obscene communication could be subject to \n     penalty.\n       A new Section 223(e) is added. Whoever knowingly by means \n     of telecommunications device ``makes, creates or solicits'' \n     and ``initiates the transmission of or purposefully makes \n     available'' an indecent communication to a minor could be \n     subject to penalty.\n       The section (f) defenses of the Committee-reported bill are \n     narrowed, and streamlined. Similar defenses exist in the \n     current ``dial-a-porn'' statute. These new defenses are \n     necessary because information service providers are not \n     common carriers and the total absence of defenses would \n     expose the statute to Constitutional invalidation.\n       Defense (f)(1) (the access defense) is narrowed from the \n     Committee-reported bill. This defense can not be used by one \n     owned, controlled or a conspirator with a violator of this \n     section.\n       Defense (f)(2) (the editorial control defense) is narrowed \n     and not available to one who cedes editorial control to \n     another likely to use that control to violate this section.\n       Defense (f)(3) (the good faith defense) is narrowed and the \n     illustrative list of options in the Committee-reported bill \n     is dropped. The FCC would determine by regulation ``good \n     faith, reasonable and appropriate'' steps to restrict access \n     to prohibited communications.\n       Defense (f)(4) assures that service providers will not be \n     prosecuted for implementing a defense which is not a \n     violation of law.\n       The State pre-emption provision in Section (g) limited to \n     ``commercial'' activities and savings language is added to \n     assure that States retain full rights to prosecute activities \n     not covered by this section.\n       A new section (h) is added to assure that the \n     Communications Decency Act in no way adversely affects \n     prosecutions under other federal laws.\n       And finally, a new section (i) is added to clarify that \n     one-way broadcasters and cable operators already covered by \n     other obscenity and indecency provisions in the \n     Communications Act of 1934 as amended incur no new \n     obligations under this section.\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n              [From the Omaha World-Herald, June 8, 1995]\n\n                   Police Cruise Information Highway\n\n       Police in Fresno, Calif., have a quick and dirty way to \n     show parents how easily their children find sexually explicit \n     material over computers: They bring parents in for show and \n     tell.\n       Surfing the Internet, police have unearthed sexually \n     graphic conversations, photographs and X-rated movie clips, \n     complete with audio.\n       ``(Parents) come up and go, `What? Computers can do \n     that?''' said Ken Diliberto, a network-systems specialist who \n     helps detectives in Fresno, one of few cities whose police \n     departments are using sophisticated methods to catch \n     computer-aided criminals.\n       A Maple Valley, Wash., youth's disappearance for 18 days \n     after meeting a San Francisco teen in an America Online \n     ``chat room'' for gays and lesbians startled parents and \n     raised questions about just what can happen in cyberspace.\n       Just as pedophiles and stalkers exist in society, there are \n     electronic predators, police and prosecutors say. Though \n     parents warn children not to talk to strangers on the street, \n     few are as vigilant with people their kids meet via computer.\n       ``There's nothing from the message itself that tells you \n     anything about the person,'' said Ivan Orton, a King County, \n     Wash. senior deputy prosecutor who handles technology crimes.\n       ``You've got nothing but the words, and lots of people \n     adopt different personas when they go on-line,'' he said. \n     ``Men become women. Women become men. You don't know who \n     you're dealing with.''\n       The FBI has pursued charges against people who transmit \n     pornography, including child pornography, on-line, or who \n     entice children with e-mail messages to cross state lines for \n     sexual purposes.\n       Diliberto and Fresno detectives suggest that parents be \n     aware of their children's computer use.\n                  Attention Surprises On-Line Runaway\n\n       Maple Valley, WA.--When Daniel Montgomery took a bus to San \n     Francisco to meet a friend he had encountered on-line, he \n     figured he might get some attention from his parents.\n       But Daniel, who turned 16 Monday, had no idea he'd draw the \n     attention of the nation.\n       ``I didn't think it was going to get this big'' he said, \n     clicking the mouse of a computer in his Maple Valley house \n     Tuesday. ``I don't know, maybe it was stupidity.''\n       Nearly three weeks after he disappeared to meet a mystery \n     person called Damien Starr, fueling speculation of abduction \n     and pedophilla, Daniel explained publicly that his departure \n     was neither a kidnapping nor a luring. Instead, he said, it \n     was something closer to running away with the encouragement \n     of an on-line friend.\n       Sitting at the computer where he first communicated with \n     Starr in a gay-and-lesbian ``chat room'' on America Online, \n     Daniel said his friend was not an older man looking to \n     exploit him sexually but rather a teen-ager, 16 or 17, who \n     had been kicked out of his own house because he was gay.\n       While he would not reveal Damien Starr's real name or say \n     much about the three men in their 30s who live with Starr in \n     a San Francisco apartment. Daniel did say none of them tried \n     to harm him in any way.\n       Daniel, who described his adventure as an ``uninformed'' \n     vacation, said he was never hurt or in danger.\n       ``I want people to understand there was nothing but \n     friendly contact,'' he said.\n\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.

Mr. President, I thought we were finished earlier. I \nlistened carefully to the senior Senator from Nebraska on this issue. I \ncome to make final statements. I do not know if I will take the whole \n15 minutes. I appreciate that the Presiding Officer and others were \nexpecting to leave when the senior Senator was done.\n  I must say, as I have on a number of other occasions, I am not sure \nmost Americans know what it is we are about to do. I expect this bill \nis going to be enacted sometime in the next 4, 5, 6 days. It is 146 or \nso pages long, I believe, and it is going to touch every single \nAmerican. If you have a phone, if you have a cable, if you use \nbroadcast, if you buy records, if you are connected at all to the \ninformation services industry, you will be affected by this law.\n  I have said, and I believe it to be the case, that it is not \nsomething that is occurring as a consequence of Americans saying we \nwant to change our laws, we are unhappy with our phone service, we are \nunhappy with our cable service, we are unhappy with what we have. \nTypically, what we do around here is we try to make adjustments \naccording to the agendas as we observe Americans saying that they have \nfor themselves--the deficit, crime, education, all sorts of things that \ntend to dominate our debates.\n  This one is being driven by corporations who have a desire to do \nthings they currently are prohibited from doing under our laws. So we \nare rewriting our laws. I do not object to that. In fact, I have been \nan advocate for a number of years of deregulating the \ntelecommunications industry, and I am enthusiastic about doing so.\n  I just want to make it clear that the laws of this land will have \nultimately an effect, and this law will have about as large an effect \non the American people as anything that I have been a part of in the 7 \nyears that I have been in the U.S. Senate. I do not want anybody to \nsuffer under the illusion that we are just dealing with something \nrelatively minor here.\n  I cannot, and I said it before, support this legislation in its \ncurrent form. The debate that we were having earlier on the Department \nof Justice role--indeed, the compromise that was produced in this \nlegislation was produced by the senior Senator from Nebraska in the \ncommittee to try to give DOJ, the Department of Justice, a role to \nconsult as the application for permission to do long distance was being \nprocessed by a regional Bell operating company or local telephone \ncompany trying to get into long distance.\n  But I must say, of all the things that had provoked interest in and \nby the American people, the title IV provision, the Communications \nDecency Act, sponsored by the senior Senator from Nebraska, has \nreceived the most interest. I will say directly that my own first \namendment tendencies to support the first amendment cause me to sort of \nimmediately say there must be something wrong with this thing.\n  I am not familiar with the things that were available that the senior \nSenator showed earlier in the blue book, but I am a regular user of the \nInternet and I have used E-mail and the computer for last 12 or so \nyears and consider myself to be relatively literate, though I will say \nI am not familiar with the items in question.\n  I am prepared to acknowledge, and I think we all should acknowledge, \nthere is a serious problem here. I have noted with a considerable \namount of concern, since the senior Senator from Nebraska was \nsuccessful in getting this attached to this bill, that he has been \nsubject to a considerable amount of abuse and a considerable amount of \nattacks and a considerable amount of criticism from all sorts of \nsources, I suspect many of whom are not terribly informed what is in \nhis bill or what is available over the Internet.\n  Not surprisingly, the senior Senator from Nebraska has not withered \nunder that fire and has not backed off from a legitimate concern, as I \nsay, that may be one of the few real concerns that we are getting from \nthe American people.\n  If you asked me today in the area of communications what is on \npeople's minds, what sort of things are people bothered by, it may, in \nfact, be the violence, indecency in broadcasting that tops the list. It \nmay be the only thing.\n  I ask my senior colleague, if you went to a townhall meeting, let us \nsay in Broken Bow or Omaha, Lincoln, and you just raised the question \nof telecommunications and you define it as the media, telephone, so \nforth and ask them, ``Of all the things about this, what's the problem \nfor you,'' they may complain the rates are too high with cable, or they \nhave some broadcast problems out in the western part of the State, like \nwe had at Scottsbluff a couple years ago. But this one does come up in \ntownhall meetings. This issue does get raised. Parents are concerned. \nCitizens at the local level are concerned about this particular \nsubject.\n  I do not know exactly where the efforts to amend this legislation \nwill go. I have not looked at the details of the changes the senior \nSenator has proposed, but I am not unmindful, at least in this \nparticular area, of all the things we are debating, this is something \nregarded by citizens as something that needs to be addressed.\n  Earlier in the comments of Senator Exon, he used the word ``punt'' \nand brought up the Nebraska football team. After Nebraska won the \nnational championship, Senator Exon just sort of clapped his hands and \nthunderously here comes the team to Washington, down to the White \nHouse.\n  It was a very moving moment for those of us who waited a long time \nfor this to happen. In a conversation with Coach Osborne that I had \nthat day at the White House, I asked Coach Osborne--he is the football \ncoach for the University of Nebraska. He has been giving many speeches \nand expressed some real concern of what is going on with young people \ntoday, particularly in Nebraska but throughout the country, since he \nrecruits throughout the country.\n  I do not know if the senior Senator had just introduced the bill at \nthat time, but he said he did not know if this particular piece of \nlegislation was good or not because he had not read the details of it, \nbut it addressed a problem that he thought was real and present at the \nlocal community. It addressed a problem that he himself is personally \nterribly concerned about.\n  Mr. President, I hope that in the process starting Monday, Tuesday, \nWednesday--whenever it is we reach a final vote--that we will begin to \ngenerate some enthusiasm amongst Americans to pay attention to these \n146 pages that we are about to enact in some shape or form.\n  I personally hope, though I know it is going to be difficult to do, \nand I am here to put out an appeal to the Presiding Officer and the \nsenior Senator from Nebraska who were very much a part of the \ncommittee's deliberation--I am not on the Commerce Committee; I was \nallowed to have a staffer sit in on much of the deliberation--I hope \nthat we can get a good-faith effort to narrow the differences between \nthe Dorgan amendment and the Thurmond amendment on this DOJ role.\n  It is a very serious matter. It is a very serious matter to me \npersonally. I cannot support this legislation unless there is a role \nfor the Department of Justice. I intend to oppose it strongly unless \nthere is.\n  I am very much concerned about what is going to happen to the \nAmerican consumer as we move from a regulated monopoly at the local \nlevel to competition at the local level--very much concerned about it.\n  As I paid attention, I must say, this has been my dominant concern \nright from the opening bell. I do not know if the senior Senator from \nNebraska has any way to try to help us bring Senator Thurmond and \nSenator Dorgan together and maybe perhaps bring a majority around some \nincrease in strength in the role for DOJ, but it seems to me we can do \nit in a fashion that addresses the concerns of the senior Senator from \nSouth Dakota.\n  The chairman of the committee has expressed over and over concerns \nfor duplication, excess bureaucracy. We drafted at least that portion \nof the [[Page S8093]] amendment that deals with bureaucracy, so there \nis a time period, a 90-day commitment.\n  The Senator from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, has decreased some \nof the role for the FCC, not dramatically but enough.\n  It seems to me what we are trying to do is address the problems that \nsome have, and I think they are legitimate concerns, for tying down and \ntying up companies too much as they try to get into long distance.\n  But, Mr. President, if the consumers of America, who are truly, in my \njudgment, likely to be unaware of what we are about to do, if they are \nreally going to benefit from the corporations' new rights to get into \nlong distance, if they are truly going to benefit from competition, \nthen the benefits are going to have to come from entrepreneurs that do \nnot exist today, businesses that will be startup businesses, that will \nbe coming into households and offering services that will be packaged.\n  The only way, in my judgment, that we are going to get decreased \nprices and increased quality is if you get ferocious competition at the \nlocal level. As much as I am enthusiastic about the 14 points that are \nrequired, the 14 actions that are required by the Bell operating \ncompanies before they can make an application, I am troubled that we do \nnot have any case law on it. I fear we are going to have lots of \nlitigation on it.\n And I fear as well that rather than having immediate competition, you \nare going to have a slowing of entry into competition, and, as a \nconsequence, we are going to find ourselves with consumers, citizens, \nvoters, taxpayers, who are not terribly pleased with the net result.\n\n  Once again, I look forward next week to the continuation of this \ndebate. I hope it is constructive and that it does, in the end, lead to \na piece of legislation that I am able to enthusiastically support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I am going to be very brief. I thank my \nfriend and colleague from Nebraska for his remarks. I simply say that I \ndid not use coach Tom Osborne's name. He has called me on the telephone \nand written me a letter. He does support this legislation. And for \nwhatever that is worth, I think you and I have the highest respect for \nTom Osborne, the man, as well as Tom Osborne, the football coach, and \nfor what he has done for young people.\n  I want to ask my colleague from Nebraska a question with regard to \nthe matter that he just brought up. We are going to vote next week on \nthe amendments being offered by the Senator from North Dakota, and I \nthink cosponsored by my colleague from Nebraska, with regard to the \nJustice Department.\n  I have been following this, and I am not quite sure I understand the \nSenator's objections. I had a great deal to do with this during the \nlast 2 years--the whole bill, in the Commerce Committee.\n  On page 8 of S. 652, there was specifically put in the legislation on \nline 20, section 7:\n\n       Effect on other law. A, antitrust laws. Except as provided \n     in subsection B and C, nothing in this act shall be construed \n     to modify, impair, or supersede the actions of the antitrust \n     laws.\n\n  I am sure that my colleague from Nebraska knows of that provision. I \nhave always thought that was put in there specifically to make certain \nthat the Justice Department of the United States would maintain their \ntraditional role of enforcing the antitrust laws in America. Does that \nnot satisfy the concerns of the Senator from Nebraska, or does he feel \nthat that particular quote from the law impairs, in any way, the \nresponsibility that the Justice Department has under the antitrust \nlaws, that they will have the full right, as I understand it, to pursue \nin the future as they have in the past?\n  Mr. KERREY. That provision is very important. That language the \nSenator mentioned is a very important provision. It would make certain \nthat the Department of Justice continues to have its historical \nantitrust role. That is very important.\n  The problem that I have with that being sufficient is that it does \nnot go as far as 1822 did last year, in that it is after the fact.\n  In other words, let us pick the regional Bell operating company in \nour area, U.S. West. Let us say U.S. West now does all 14 of the things \nthat are required in order to get into the interLATA, in order to do \nthe long distance, and they come to the FCC and get permission to do \nlong distance service. Well, the problem is, if the Department of \nJustice wants to take action, they have to take action after the fact, \nafter permission is granted; after they are in long distance, then they \nhave to come and take action. What I would feel more comfortable with \nis if we had DOJ involved, as 1822 did, in a parallel fashion, not in \naddition to. What I was most interested in was making sure that there \nwas a parallel process with a time certain. And in the language of the \nDorgan amendment, as amended, as well by the Senator from South \nCarolina, there is a 90-day time certain, and a parallel process \noccurs. You do not file to one and then go to the other.\n  The precedent that I am trying to use repeatedly--and I think it is a \ngood one--is that in 1984 the Department of Justice was the one that \nmanaged the transition from a monopoly to a competitive environment in \nlong distance.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would like to be able to enter into \nthis colloquy. What is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At present, if I might state it, there is a \nprevious order that we were to recess after the senior Senator from \nNebraska completed his statement, which has been completed.\n  Mr. KERREY. Should I be asking unanimous consent to speak until the \npresiding officer has to leave?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would like to get into this colloquy.\n  Mr. KERREY. I ask unanimous consent that the earlier unanimous-\nconsent order be revised and that we will go out at 4:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Will my friend yield so I can get a question in?\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes, if I can first finish the answer I was giving to \nSenator Exon.\n  I deeply hope that this colloquy can result in you helping me. I am \nnot trying to get you to necessarily say, gee, yes, I am going to vote \nfor this amendment. But I am trying to enlist your help in getting a \nlarger role for DOJ to allay the concerns that I have that permission \nis going to be granted to get into the long distance service, and then \nthe only opportunity that consumers would have to make sure that there \nis competition is to be for an action to be filed after the fact.\n  Again, what I am expressing is a concern that we may not have real \nlocal competition. What the committee did--and I think it was good \nwork--was come up with this 14-part checklist and say this is going to \nreplace the VIII(c) test we had in last year's legislation. This will \nbe sort of in lieu of. It is quite good. It does not give me \nconfidence. I know that the senior Senator understands this as well, \nthat when it comes time to starting a business as an entrepreneur, \ntypically, you do not have enough money to be able to hire your own \nlawyer. These larger companies have whole dump trucks full of lawyers \nthat work for them.\n  When you are dealing in that kind of environment, I want to make sure \nthat this entrepreneur that wants to come to Omaha, Grand Islands, or \nHastings, or Scottsbluff, and come to the household and say I want to \ndeliver a competitive information product, which the playing field \nallows them to do it, I want to make sure they have the Department of \nJustice signing off in a parallel process to do so.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my friend will yield for a question, is there \nanother area of the Justice Department where they have a decisionmaking \nrole? Earlier this year, we had this process that we went through, and \nboth Senators from Nebraska had their staffs there and could have been \ntheir personally, night after night, and they both did a good job. They \nwrestled with this Justice Department thing over and over and could not \nfind another area of American life where the Justice Department has a \ndecisionmaking role, such as this amendment wants to add.\n  Mr. KERREY. You have asked me a question; let me answer. We have had \n[[Page S8094]] this colloquy a couple of times before. My answer, with \ngreat respect--and I am not trying to argue--I am trying to, hopefully, \nget some change that enables me to support the legislation. What I said \nbefore I will say again--we had a role with the Department of Justice \nwhen we did this thing once before 10 years ago. The Department of \nJustice had the most important role in taking us from a monopoly in \nlong distance to a competitive marketplace.\n  The answer to your question is that the Department of Justice had the \nprincipal role. We are not asking the--in this proposal we are not \ngiving the Department of Justice the ability to manage this thing \nunnecessarily. We are simply saying that there is a review process and \nthey have the authority to sign off on it, and they have to answer in a \n90-day period.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my friend will yield, there is no other area of \nAmerican economy--and it is true since Judge Greene's order, and he has \n200 staff attorneys over there, basically. But there is no need to \ncontinue having that just for one sector of our economy in the Justice \nDepartment, a decisionmaking role.\n  Mr. KERREY. If there is a need for this law--the law is \nunprecedented. We are doing something extremely unprecedented. Ask the \nratepayers, the taxpayers and citizens in the households. We are taking \nyour comfortable telephone service, your comfortable cable service--you \nhave it now and it is a monopoly, you know it is there--and subsidize \nrates and keep the rates down in residential. We are transitioning \nwhere those protections are not going to be there any longer. It is an \nunprecedented move from a monopoly to a competitive environment.\n  I am suggesting that because of that lack of precedent, it is \nreasonable to look for an unprecedented way to manage, as the bill \nitself describes--manage from that monopoly situation to a competitive \nsituation. I believe that it is possible and perhaps, even desirable, \nto put some limitations, if you want to, on what the Department of \njustice can do.\n  There have been earlier suggestions on how to do that. But to give \nthem only a consultative role, I just genuinely, sincerely believe that \nthat risks this entire venture. It places this entire venture into the \nhands of corporations to say we know that you want to do the right \nthing, so we know you are going to allow competition. I think it is \nmore than reasonable to expect of anybody. If I am a business--even a \nsmall business--I can talk all I want to about competition and how I \nfavor it. But the truth of the matter is, given a choice, I would \nrather not have it.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Under the consent decree that broke up AT, DOJ is not \nthe decisionmaker; it was the court, Judge Greene. Now we are making \nDOJ the decisionmaker under the Dorgan proposed amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. No.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. They will make the final decision.\n  Mr. KERREY. It does exactly what the consent decree did, as well.\n  It basically says, ``You are going to have multiple consent \ndecrees.'' What happens when, say U.S. West buys a long-distance \ncompany. What happens then? I tell you what happens. The Justice \nDepartment has to approve it. The Department of Justice would have to \napprove a merger of a local company acquiring a long-distance company.\n  The senior Senator from South Dakota would not object to that.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. But under the Clayton and Sherman Acts, as my \ndistinguished friend pointed out, the language in the bill, they \nalready have antitrust power.\n  We are setting up a permanent administrative bureaucracy in the \nDepartment of Justice that is supposed to be done over at the FCC, and \nwe have it done in the FCC in two ways. One is the public interest \nconvenience and necessity; and two is the checklist that Senator \nHollings and Senator Exon and Senator Kerrey of Nebraska had there with \nstaff.\n  This was all worked out. We spent night after night. Never has there \nbeen a more bipartisan effort in this Senate, preparing a bill, if I \nmay say so. We invited everybody. I talked to all 100 Senators.\n  There is an implication by the Senator from Nebraska that all this \nwas sprung upon him suddenly.\n  Mr. KERREY. I knew precisely what was in the bill. If I were in the \ncommittee, I would vote ``no'' entirely based on that provision.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. There is an implication that the bill is driven by \ncorporate interests.\n  Mr. KERREY. It unquestionably is, Senator. That is very difficult not \nto deny.\n  I do not say that there is a dark and mysterious and evil aspect to \nthat at all.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. From this Senator's point of view, the public interest \nis very much at heart throughout these considerations. I think all the \nSenators who worked on this bill have had the public interest. I do not \naccept that conclusion about the Senate of the United States.\n  Mr. KERREY. There is nothing wrong with the Senate of the United \nStates considering and worrying about what corporate America wants. I \nam not saying that just because corporate America is asking for this \nthat corporate America somehow is bad. I am not implying they are bad \nat all.\n  I am saying when I talk to people about this issue, when I get phone \ncalls on this issue, it is rarely a citizen that is calling up and \nsaying, ``Senator, I really am concerned. I heard you talk about the \nJustice Department having a role in the application for interLATA \nfreedom.'' Citizens do not ask about interLATA.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Your staff was in the room where the bill was drafted.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am not a member of the committee and I did not vote on \nthis. I am approaching a moment where I will have an opportunity to \nvote. I understand that my staff was involved in the deliberations. I \nappreciate that opportunity.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I want to say how hard that staff and Senators involved \nworked through the weekends. A lot of Members have not had a day off \nsince Christmas.\n  I find the suggestion that this bill is a result of corporate \ninterests in the Senate of these United States, when we had a \ndiscussion this morning about assuming language, or whatever people are \nsaying, and so forth, and maybe I misspoke. I do not know. I raised \nsome points. I consider the Senator from Nebraska a good friend.\n  We have done everything we can to do what is right for the American \npeople. If we do not pass this bill in this Congress, it will fall over \nto 1997 and we will lose 2 years of jobs and creativity.\n  This is not a perfect bill. I welcome the participation of the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I think this bill will pass. It has a lot of steam behind \nit, and I think it is likely to pass. I am just saying it will not have \nmy vote unless there is a strong Justice Department role.\n  I do not think what I am asking for is unreasonable.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I find it unreasonable for the suggestion that this is \na bill of corporate interests. I believe the Senators involved have \nacted in the public interest.\n  Mr. KERREY. I do not doubt they are acting in the public interest or \nthat the senior Senator from Nebraska is acting in the public interest. \nI do not doubt that. That is not the point I am making.\n  I am saying, look out there for who it is that is asking for change. \nIt is corporate America.\n  If I polled the people of Nebraska to rank this on their agenda, the \nonly thing they would mention is probably the Communication Decency \nAct.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. There is a large part of corporate America for the \nJustice Department review which the Senator is supporting.\n  Mr. KERREY. That is true.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. But I am not accusing the Senator of responding to \ncorporate America. I think we are asking, in the public interest.\n  Mr. KERREY. That is my point, Senator.\n  Corporate America has weighed in on this issue. Corporate America has \ncontacted me on this particular issue, as they have contacted the \nSenator.\n  The point I am trying to make is that the dominant interest in this \npiece of legislation is a relatively small group of corporations that \nare currently regulated and that want to do something that the current \nlaw does not allow them to do. That is the point [[Page S8095]] I have \nmade before, that I will continue to make.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Some of the biggest corporations in America want a \nJustice Department review.\n  Mr. KERREY. I agree, some of the biggest corporations in America do \nnot want the Justice Department review.\n  That merely makes the point that this is largely the kind of an \nargument driven by concerns of corporations who either want to do \nsomething or do not want somebody else to do something in this area.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I notify all Senators that it is now 4:30. \nBased on the previous agreement, all discussion was to cease at 4:30.\n  Mr. EXON. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to continue for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. First, to be facetious, I would like to advise my colleague \nfrom Nebraska that unless he misspoke or unless I heard him wrong, he \nsaid something to the effect that he sees nothing wrong with the U.S. \nSenate. If somebody would take that out of context, it would be the end \nof his political career. It might be a good time to ask that be \nstricken from the record.\n  Seriously speaking, I had cited earlier the section on page 8. I \nwould also like to cite an additional paragraph from page 89 of the \nsame act which says ``before making any determination under this \nsubparagraph, the commission shall consult with the Attorney General \nregarding the application.''\n  I would simply advise both of my colleagues that this Senator has had \nconsiderable experience over the years in dealing with the bureaucracy. \nWe have dealt for a long time, and my colleague from Nebraska has been \ninvolved in many of the interstate commerce decisions.\n  In no case does the Justice Department have prior consideration with \nregard to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Therefore, I think the \npoint the Senator from South Dakota is trying to make is that we are \ntreating the various agencies of the Federal Government--either \nindependent agencies or agencies under the direct control of the \nPresident--the same as we have treated them previously.\n  I think that my colleague from Nebraska makes a pretty good point. I \nthink I understand his concern.\n  I just want to say, as one involved in S. 1822, the predecessor of \nthis, and this piece of legislation, the original draft that came to \nthe committee after our distinguished colleague from South Dakota \nbecame chairman, contained no information or statement whatever to help \naddress the concerns that have been raised, and I think to some degree, \nlegitimately raised by my colleague from Nebraska.\n  It had nothing in there at all. That proposal came that would have, \nfor all practical purposes, ignored the Justice Department.\n  I have cited two instances where, during the cooperation, during the \ndiscussion, during the compromise that we worked very hard to maintain, \nwe came up with something that I think would allow the Justice \nDepartment to play a key role.\n  One thing I would suggest might be wrong, to go back to the \nillustration used by my colleague from Nebraska, U.S. West, for \nexample, wanted to go into some kind of a network they had not \npreviously been allowed to do.\n  According to the feelings, unless they were spelled out in the law, \nthey would have to act after the fact. Of course, that is the way they \nalways do, act after the fact.\n  The problem that the company, in that particular situation, I am \nfearful, was that they would have two different agencies of the Federal \nGovernment to go to for clearance, the Justice Department on one hand \nand the Federal Communications Commission on the other.\n  I simply say that I happen to feel that the hard-driven compromise \nthat was worked on this by members of the committee may not be perfect, \nbut as both Senators know, I have never voted for a perfect law since I \nhave been here.\n  I will study the matter over the weekend further. I appreciate the \ndiscussion I had with my good friend and colleague from Nebraska and my \ncolleague from the State to the north, South Dakota, where I was born. \nThank you both very much.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8092-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8095-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting treaties.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8095-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:48 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 349.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                 ``Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 28\n\n       ``Whereas, Michigan's farmers represent an important \n     element of our state's increasingly diversified economy. \n     American consumers purchase ever higher amounts of high \n     quality fresh produce, and Michigan farmers continue to meet \n     that demand. Fresh produce, by its nature, is also highly \n     perishable with a relatively short shelf life compared to \n     manufactured products. This characteristic of fresh fruits \n     and vegetables imposes a burden on farmers unique to them. \n     Specifically, the need to sell produce quickly means that \n     fruits and vegetables may actually be consumed before the \n     farmer can even receive payment. If farmers sell their goods \n     to customers who are slow to pay or who fail to pay at all, \n     farmers have few means to recoup their losses. Consumed goods \n     can hardly be reclaimed, and the costs associated with \n     pursuing a claim through the courts make this avenue futile \n     in many cases; and\n       ``Whereas, fortunately, our nation's farmers have been \n     protected from such problems for sixty-five years by the \n     Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA). Enacted in \n     1930, the PACA enforces fair trading practices in the \n     marketing of fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables. It is \n     administered by the Fruit and Vegetable Division of the \n     Agricultural Marketing Service and allows farmers to ship \n     their produce across our country in a timely fashion with \n     confidence that they will be paid for their labor and goods. \n     Should a contract dispute emerge, the PACA provides a means \n     to resolve the problem without further burdening our court \n     system; and\n       ``Whereas, consumers benefit in many ways from this act. \n     Not only can consumers purchase high quality produce fresh \n     from the field because farmers may rapidly ship their goods \n     confident that they will be paid, but other protections exist \n     as well. For example, our schools, hospitals, and restaurants \n     cannot be over-charged for produce because the PACA prohibits \n     a produce dealer from hiding the true wholesale cost received \n     by farmers for the fruits and vegetables; and\n       ``Whereas, defenders of the PACA recognize that the act can \n     be improved and have been willing to compromise in order to \n     address the concerns of retailers. Unfortunately, legislation \n     has been introduced into the United States House of \n     Representatives that undermines efforts to preserve the PACA \n     while improving it to correct certain shortcomings. HR 669 \n     has been introduced into the 104th Congress to repeal the \n     Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act. Rather than being a \n     bill to eliminate unneeded regulations, this bill would \n     impose a severe hardship on our state's farmers, and \n     ultimately all people who purchase and enjoy high quality \n     fruits and vegetables. HR 669, or any other bill that would \n     repeal the PACA, must not be passed for the sake of our \n     farmers and consumers: Now, therefore, be it\n       ``Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That we memorialize the United States Congress \n     to reject any efforts to repeal the Perishable Agricultural \n     Commodities Act; and be it further\n       ``Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted \n     to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, and the members \n     of the Michigan congressional delegation.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-207.

Under deeming, \n     the income of the sponsor is counted as though available to \n     the immigrant, regardless of actual availability to the \n     immigrant, to determine if the immigrant meets the income and \n     resource eligibility criteria of any given program. Deeming \n     also disqualifies the immigrant if the immigrant's sponsor is \n     unavailable or unwilling to cooperate by providing evidence \n     of income and property; and\n       ``Whereas, the deeming provision contains no exceptions for \n     emergency services. Deeming would apply to almost all \n     emergency services such as church meals provided with public \n     funds, battered women's shelters and child protective \n     services to rescue battered children; and\n       ``Whereas, the deeming provision does not contain a time \n     limit. Therefore, a legal immigrant who has lived in the \n     United States and paid taxes for thirty or forty years would \n     be disqualified from benefits solely because he or she is \n     unable to locate their sponsor; and\n       ``Whereas, the deeming provision does not contain an \n     exception for battered spouses. Because women are frequently \n     sponsored by their husbands, the PRA would create a situation \n     where a battered woman would be unable to qualify for basic \n     services to escape family violence because she cannot obtain \n     the cooperation of the very husband she seeks to escape; and\n       ``Whereas, because the deeming requirement applies to all \n     needs-based programs at the state and local levels, any \n     entity receiving government-funded assistance, including \n     churches, schools, English as a Second Language classes, \n     health care clinics, soup kitchens and shelters would be \n     required to check immigrant status and to obtain financial \n     assistance from immigrant sponsors. The time-consuming nature \n     of this process and the difficulty of ascertaining much of \n     the necessary information would create a tremendous \n     administrative burden for these entities, many of which are \n     already operating on a very limited budget; and\n       ``Whereas, Congress recently passed legislation which would \n     prohibit ``Unfunded Mandates''. One could argue that the \n     Personal Responsibility Act is an unfunded mandate of \n     enormous magnitude.

A bill to designate the Nellis Federal Hospital in Las Vegas, \nNV, as the ``Mike O'Callaghan Military Hospital,'' and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n     the mike o'callaghan military hospital designation act of 1995\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, it is my privilege today to introduce \nlegislation to designate the Nellis Federal Hospital in Las Vegas, NV, \nas the ``Mike O'Callaghan Military Hospital.''\n  The Nellis Federal Hospital is a newly constructed joint venture \nhospital facility in Las Vegas, NV. The facility is operated jointly by \nthe U.S. Department of Defense through the Nellis Air Force Base, and \nthe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs through the Las Vegas Veterans \nAffairs Outpatient Clinic.\n  This medical facility is the culmination of years of cooperative \nefforts between the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to \naddress the health care needs of both active duty military at Nellis \nAir Force Base and their families, and the rapidly increasing southern \nNevada veterans population.\n  The Federal hospital, formally dedicated on July 8, 1994, was opened \nto patients on August 1, 1994. It was my pleasure to attend the July \ndedication of this remarkable joint facility. For Nellis Air Force \nBase, the Federal hospital provides base personnel access to a new \nmedical facility to provide quality health care. For southern Nevada \nveterans, the Federal hospital represents their first permanent \nveterans inpatient hospital in the Las Vegas area. For many of these \nveterans, hospital care can now be provided in State, rather than in a \ndifferent State hundreds of miles away from home.\n  This hospital will serve many Nevadans--those who, while serving at \nthe Nellis Air Force Base, call Nevada their home temporarily, and \nthose who, as retired veterans, call Nevada their home permanently.\n  It is, therefore, only appropriate to name this vital health care \nfacility after a man who has served his country militarily with honor \nin three branches of the armed services; the Air Force, the Army, and \nthe Marine Corps. A man who, as disabled veteran, is reminded every day \nof the sacrifice of that service. A man who has spent his entire career \nworking tirelessly to make life a little bit better for all Nevadans\n  It is, therefore, truly a privilege for me to introduce this \nlegislation today to name the Federal hospital for Mike O'Callaghan.\n  Mike O'Callaghan and I both have had the honor of serving the people \nof Nevada as their Governor. In fact, Governor O'Callaghan is one of \nonly five two-term Governors in Nevada's history.\n  As Nevada's Governor, Mike O'Callaghan was a hands on worker. The \nlights in the Governor's office were always the first ones on, and the \nones out when he was the occupant. He was always the man in charge, and \nhe always got the job done for Nevadans.\n  Governor O'Callaghan is also a most compassionate, caring and \nsensitive human being, both in his instincts and in his actions. While \nGovernor, he always worked for the underdog. For people who could not \nspeak for themselves, Governor O'Callaghan was their voice. He made \nsure they were heard.\n  One of the highlights of his terms as Governor was passage of \nNevada's fair housing law to ensure all Nevadans equal access to a home \nof their own. He understood how very important it is for people to have \na place of their own to call home wherever they choose to live.\n  Governor O'Callaghan's military career began early. At 16 years of \nage, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps to serve during the period \nending in World War II.\n  During the Korean conflict, he served with both the Air Force and the \nArmy. While in Korea, he was wounded in combat, forcing amputation of \nhis left leg. His unflinching courage was recognized through the \nawarding of the Silver Star, the Bronze Star with Valor Device, and the \nPurple Heart.\n  Following his Army service in Korea, Governor O'Callaghan spent the \nnext years as a teacher and journalist. He earned a master's degree at \nthe University of Idaho. He then taught economics, government, and \nhistory in Henderson, NV, for several years. One of his students, my \ncolleague, Senator Harry Reid, took those classes to heart.\n  In 1963, Governor O'Callaghan began his public service career when he \nbecame the first director of Nevada's Health and Welfare Department. He \nalso served almost 2 years as a project manager for the Job Corps \nConservation Centers.\n  His professional career continued in 1969 when Governor O'Callaghan \nfounded a research-planning firm in Carson City, NV. He then started \nhis political career entering the race\n for Nevada's Governor as a Democrat in 1970. He was reelected in 1974, \nwinning by an overwhelming majority. He was also honored that year by \nTime Magazine as one of the Nation's top 200 promising young Americans. \nInstead of running for a third gubernatorial term, he retired from \nelected office in 1978.\n\n  Today, Governor O'Callaghan is currently the chairman and executive \neditor of the Las Vegas Sun. He continues to write provocative \neditorials on Nevada and national political issues, continuing always \nto speak for those without a voice.\n  He is also publisher of the Henderson Home News and the Boulder City \nNews. He travels every year to Israel, where as a private citizen, he \ngives his time to help work on military tank maintenance.\n  His interest in the concerns of those currently serving in the \nmilitary and in those who have already served their country has not \nwaned. In recognition of that continued commitment, former Governor \nO'Callaghan was presented the Air Force Exceptional Service Award in \n1982.\n  We in Nevada are proud to have the Nellis Federal Hospital in Las \nVegas. To name the hospital after Mike O'Callaghan would commemorate \nnot only his valuable personal contributions to Nevada, but would honor \nall those who answer the call of duty to their country.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 904. A bill to provide flexibility to States to administer and \ncontrol the cost of the food stamp and child nutrition programs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n              THE NUTRITION ASSISTANCE REFORM ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, most Americans now recognize the \nneed to reform our welfare system. U.S. welfare policy has encouraged \ndependency, [[Page S8099]] has failed to encourage work effort, and has \ncontributed to runaway entitlement spending.\n  These failures do not mean that we have been wrong to assist needy \nAmericans. A just society makes provision for its less fortunate \nmembers.\n  But what is the best way to do that? What policies offer the best \nprospect of helping the needy to become independent? What are the \nunintended consequences of the modern welfare state? What is the cost \nof the culture of dependency?\n  These are questions with which we must grapple. Most accounts of the \nwelfare reform debate focus solely on the prospect that someone's \nbenefits will be reduced.\n  That is the wrong question. The right question is: What will happen \nif we refuse to reform welfare because we are afraid of the political \nconsequences? How many more generations of dependency will we foster? \nHow many people will fail to break out of the welfare trap who \notherwise might have gotten jobs, or started businesses, or sent \nchildren to college?\n  Is compassion always and everywhere defined by spending more money?\n  Our society's compassion must now be reflected in tough choices, not \nblank checks. It is easy to write repetitive stories about cuts in \nbenefits. More understanding is required to note the effect of changing \nincentives, encouraging work effort, and insisting on independence.\n  I chair the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, which \nhas jurisdiction over the Food Stamp program and child nutrition \nspending. We are not the primary committee of jurisdiction on welfare \nmatters, but the programs we oversee are a vital part of the Nation's \nsocial safety net.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that represents my best effort at \na consensus bill that reflects the range of views on our committees. \nThat range is a broad one, comprising Senators who favor block grants \nand those who do not. Some committee members on both sides of the aisle \nand prepared for sharp reductions in nutrition spending, while other \nare not.\n  I was prepared to act boldly. I agreed with many of our Nation's \nGovernors that the States deserve the change to try new\n approaches to delivering nutrition assistance.\n\n  The legislation I introduce today will not convert the Food Stamp \nProgram to block grants. I made this decision consciously because I \nbelieve committee consensus is preferable to contention if the latter \nwould divert us from the real issues.\n  Welfare reform should not, at the end of the day, be measured by \nwhether or not it converts all programs to block grants. Block grants \nare a means, not an end.\n  Instead, I ask my colleagues to measure welfare reform proposals by \nthese tests: Do they give States more freedom to try new approaches? Do \nthey encourage work and responsibility? And do they reduce the runaway \nexpenditure of taxpayer funds?\n  I hope Senators will agree that the bill I introduce today does all \nthese things. First, it gives the States wider latitude to reform the \nFood Stamp Program. The bill allows States to try a variety of \napproaches to delivering benefits, structuring incentives and \nencouraging independence. Many current Federal requirements are ended, \nand States are granted more authority to modify the program in light of \ntheir unique circumstances. Under this bill, States could restrict \neligibility for benefits, create work supplementation initiatives where \nfood stamp benefits would be used to leverage job incentives, and \nundertake other reforms.\n  Second, the bill promotes work and responsibility. The bill will \nenforce strict work requirements, allow States to crack down on food \nstamp recipients who fail to pay child support or cooperate with the \nchild support enforcement system, and put real sanctions on recipients \nwho violate work requirements or voluntarily quit a job.\n  Finally, this legislation will reduce Federal spending. It is \ndesigned to achieve approximately the level of savings in the budget \nresolution approved by the Senate. This legislation will pay food stamp \nbenefits based on 100 percent of the low-cost thrifty food plan, \ninstead of the present 103 percent. It will also modify income \ndeductions and asset tests used in calculating eligibility and benefit \nlevels. The bill achieves savings in other nutrition programs while \nretaining the Federal responsibility for these programs. For example, \nthe legislation will reduce subsidies for meals served in day care \nhomes in upper- and middle-income areas.\n  Mr. President, a just nation does not cast its poor out on the \nstreet. But neither does it absolve them of personal responsibility. As \nwe reform welfare programs, we must count the cost to both society and \nwelfare recipients of retaining the old, failed system. That cost is \ntoo high. Instead, we must try new approaches and provide new \nincentives. Some may fail. But the greater failure of the old order is \nmanifest.\n  We owe it to every American to try new approaches and question old \nways. We must enter the new century as a nation whose watchword is \nindependence, not dependency.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the test of the bill I \nintroduce, along with a summary of its provisions, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 904\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

For example, under current law, unmarried \n     couples may qualify for more Food Stamp benefits than a \n     married couple--in effect, a ``marriage penalty.''\n       Delete laws that micromanage state Food Stamp \n     administration. Such laws now go so far as to specify when to \n     use boldface type in Food Stamp applications and require USDA \n     review of local office hours.\n       Allow states to recover over-issued Food Stamp benefits \n     immediately.\n\n\n      promoting work, responsibility and state reform initiatives\n\n       The bill encourages responsible behavior, empowers the \n     states to pursue innovative welfare reforms, and reduces \n     federal spending. The bill will:\n       Ensure Food Stamp benefits do not increase when a \n     recipient's welfare benefits are reduced for violating \n     welfare rules.\n       Allow states to operate work support programs in which the \n     value of Food Stamp benefits is paid to an employer who hires \n     a welfare recipient and passes on the benefit to the employee \n     as part of wages. Such systems encourage movement from \n     welfare to work.\n       Allow a limited number of states to offer Food Stamp \n     benefits in cash to recipients who have been working at least \n     three months.\n       Strengthen child support enforcement by allowing states to \n     require that custodial parents cooperate with enforcement \n     agencies, and to disqualify from benefits a parent who is in \n     arrears on court-ordered child support. Also allow states to \n     disqualify non-custodial parents who refuse to cooperate in \n     child support and paternity proceedings.\n       Give states more ability to undertake welfare reform \n     demonstration projects where they might restrict or reduce \n     Food Stamp benefits. Impose a strict 60-day time limit for \n     USDA to respond to state proposals for welfare reform. The \n     state's request is automatically approved if USDA does not \n     respond.\n       Sanction any adult who voluntarily quits a job while on \n     Food Stamps. Require that individuals who violate Food Stamp \n     work requirements be disqualified from benefits for mandatory \n     minimum periods, with states\n      able to disqualify for longer periods if they choose.\n       Exempt Food Stamp benefits delivered through Electronic \n     Benefit Transfer from Regulation E, which limits cardholder \n     liability if cards are lost or stolen.\n       Establish a new work requirement for non-elderly, able-\n     bodied adults without dependents, generally requiring them to \n     work or be in job training within six months, or lose Food \n     Stamp eligibility.\n       Require that anyone age 21 or younger who lives with his or \n     her parents must be considered part of the parents' \n     household.\n       Reduce the rate of growth in Food Stamp spending by \n     revising the way benefits are calculated. Currently, benefits \n     are 103 percent of a ``thrifty food plan'' reflecting a low-\n     cost diet. The bill would pay benefits at 100 percent of the \n     thrifty food plan, the same formula used until 1989.\n       Reduce the ``standard deduction,'' an amount automatically \n     subtracted from applicants' income to determine eligibility \n     and benefits.\n       Repeal scheduled increases in the maximum value of \n     automobiles that may be owned by persons who wish to collect \n     Food Stamp benefits.

A bill to provide for the management of the airplane over \nunits of the National Park System, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n           THE NATIONAL PARKS AIRSPACE MANAGEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation \nI offered last year, but in simpler and improved form, that is designed \nto mitigate the impact of commercial air tour flights over units of the \nNational Park System. The National Parks Airspace Management Act of \n1995 would create a new statutory framework for minimizing the \nenvironmental effects of air tour activity on park units.\n  Briefly, my bill would: specify the respective authorities of the \nNational Park Service and the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] in \ndeveloping and enforcing park overflight policy; establish a process \nfor developing individualized airspace management plans at parks \nexperiencing significant commercial air tour activity; provide for the \ndesignation of those parks which did not experience commercial air tour \nactivity as of January 1, 1995 as flight-free parks; establish a new, \nsingle standard governing the certification and operation of all \ncommercial air tour operators that conduct flights over national parks; \nrequire a variety of safety measures, such as improved aircraft \nmarkings, maintenance of accurate aeronautical charts, installation of \nflight monitoring equipment, and an air tour database; and, establish a \nNational Park Overflight Advisory Council.\n  As my colleagues are aware, aircraft overflights of noise-sensitive \nareas such as national parks have been increasing in scope and \nintensity for a number of years, sparking significant public debate and \ncontroversy about the safety and environmental impact of such activity. \nThe focus of much of the debate, and much of the controversy, has been \nthe commercial air tour sightseeing industry, which has experienced \nexplosive growth in some areas, most notably at the Grand Canyon and in \nmy own State of Hawaii.\n  The air tour industry has become a $500 million business nationwide. \nFully half of that revenue is generated by the 800,000 flightseers who \nannually view the Grand Canyon area by aircraft. In 1994, the Hawaii \nair tour industry, which is centered around tours of Haleakala and \nHawaii Volcanoes National Parks, provided tours to more than 500,000 \npassengers, generating approximately $75 million in \nrevenues. [[Page S8110]] \n  Apart from parks in Arizona and Hawaii, significant commercial air \ntour activity has also been developing in such widely dispersed \nlocations as Glacier National Park in Montana, the Utah national parks, \nMount Rushmore in South Dakota, and the Statute of Liberty and Niagara \nFalls in New York. In fact, at Great Smoky Mountains National Park, \ncommercial air tour overflights have fostered such opposition that the \nState of\n Tennessee has passed legislation to restrict such flights.\n\n  Thus, the problems that my bill attempts to address are national, not \nmerely local, in scope and interest. I would venture to say that every \nMember of this body has, or will soon have, a park in his or her State \nthat is impacted to a greater or lesser degree by commercial air tour \noperations.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am offering is not the first attempt \nto deal with this issue through legislation. In 1987, Congress passed \nthe National Parks Overflights Act, Public Law 100-91, which \nestablished certain flight restrictions at three parks which were \nexperiencing heavy air traffic. Flights below-the-rim at Grand Canyon \nwere permanently banned and Special Federal Aviation Regulation [SFAR] \nwas established creating flight-free zones and air corridors. The act \nestablished less stringent temporary altitude restrictions for Yosemite \nin California and Haleakala in Hawaii.\n  The act also required that a comprehensive study be conducted by the \nPark Service, with FAA input, to determine appropriate minimum \naltitudes for aircraft overflying national parks. Completed and \nsubmitted to Congress in September 1994, the study evaluated the impact \nof aircraft noise on the safety of park system users and on park values \nand offered numerous recommendations to Congress and the administration \non ways to mitigate the effects of aircraft noise, including incentives \nto encourage use of quiet aircraft technology, flight-free zones and \nflight corridors, altitude restrictions, noise budgets, and limits on \ntimes of air tour operations.\n  Unfortunately, the minimum altitude restrictions mandated by Public \nLaw 100-91 have not fully addressed the noise and safety problems at \nGrand Canyon, Yosemite, and particularly Haleakala, given the explosive \ngrowth in air tour activity at these parks. And, of course, the act did \nnot establish mitigation measures for other parks experiencing high \nlevels of air traffic. And, to date, none of the noise and safety \nmitigation measures recommended by the Park Overflights Study have been \nimplemented.\n  Since October 1, 1988, there have been 139 air tour accidents in the \nUnited States, resulting in 117 fatalities. It saddens me to report \nthat my home State of Hawaii has experienced a disproportionately high \nnumber of these tragedies. During that period, 34 of those accidents \noccurred in Hawaii, resulting in 35 fatalities.\n  Concern over the high incidence of air tour accidents in Hawaii's \nskies compelled the FAA, in March 1994, to initiate a comprehensive \nreview of the operations and maintenance practices of the Hawaii air \ntour industry. This review culminated in the implementation of an \nemergency regulation--SFAR-71--which imposed numerous safety measures \nupon Hawaii's commercial air tour operators, including a 1,500-foot \nabove-ground-level minimum\n altitude restriction. To date, the FAA's emergency rulemaking actions \ngenerally appear to have been effective in providing short-term \nsolutions to many of the safety problems associated with commercial air \ntour operations in Hawaii.\n\n  Similarly, in 1992, when the FAA implemented SFAR-50-2 governing \nairspace over Grand Canyon National Park, a significant improvement in \nair safety was effected there also. Unfortunately, however, short-term, \nemergency measures such as SFAR's 71 and 50-2 have not, and cannot be \nexpected to, addressed the full range of safety problems that have \nattended the explosive growth of the commercial air tour industry in \nthis country.\n  In addition to safety issues, the rapid growth of the air tour \nindustry has fostered environmental concerns as well, largely centering \non noise problems. The Clinton administration has made a good faith \neffort to address the noise and environmental impacts of commercial air \ntour overflights through existing regulatory authorities and \nmechanisms. The interagency working group formed in 1993 by Secretary \nBabbitt and Secretary Pena has demonstrated that limited cooperation \nbetween the FAA and Park Service is attainable in addressing this \nissue.\n  Nevertheless, while some progress has been made, the pace has been \npainfully slow and tangible results so far are not readily evident. In \nthe meantime, the number of air tour flights has continued to grow, \nserving to exacerbate existing environmental and safety problems. This \nexperience has shown us that only Congress, through legislation, can \nproduce lasting, effective policy on this matter.\n  The simple truth is, the complex problems associated with park \noverflights cannot be fully resolved administratively. This is largely \ndue to the fact that the FAA and the Park Service, the two agencies \nwith the greater responsibility in this area, are governed by vastly \ndifferent statutory mandates. On the one hand, the FAA is responsible \nfor the safety and efficiency of air commerce; on the other, the Park \nService is charged with protecting and preserving park resources. At \nsome point--in this case the regulation of airspace over noise \nsensitive areas--their interests are mutually incompatible. Only by \nmodifying or clarifying their statutory responsibilities with respect \nto the management of park airspace can the two Federal agencies be \nexpected to work together to address the overflights problem.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am proposing today would address \nthis and other barriers to the development of a comprehensive park \noverflights policy. My bill deals with the commercial air tour \noverflights issue in a national context, since the safety and \nenvironmental concerns which are being debated so vociferously in \nHawaii are being echoed at park units scattered throughout the National \nPark System.\n  At the outset, my bill establishes a finding that National Park \nService policy recognizes the importance of natural quiet as a resource \nto be conserved and protected in certain park units. Toward that end, \nmy bill creates a new statutory framework for minimizing the \nenvironmental effects of air tour activity on units throughout the \nNational Park System.\n  The bill articulates a regulatory scheme under which the Park Service \nand the FAA are required to work in tandem to develop operational \npolicies with respect to the overflights problem. It provides for joint \nadministration in many areas while clearly denoting the FAA's primacy \non matters related to safety and air efficiency and the Park Service's \nlead role in identifying the resources to be protected and the best \nmeans of protecting them.\n  The bill requires the development, with public involvement, of \nindividually tailored park airspace management plans for units \nsignificantly affected by overflight activity, as determined by the \ndirector of the Park Service. It calls for good faith negotiations \nbetween commercial air tour operators and both the Park Service and the \nFAA to reach agreement on flights over park areas.\n  It provides for the Park Service to recommend to the FAA the \ndesignation of individual units as flight-free parks for those units \nwhich, as of January 1, 1995, experienced no overflights by commercial \nair tour operators and where air tour flights would be incompatible \nwith or injurious to the purposes or values of those parks.\n  It also mandates the development by the FAA or a generic operational \nrule for commercial air tour operations at all units of the National \nPark System, subject to modification at individual park units based on \nnegotiations among air tour operators, the FAA, and the Park Service.\n  My legislation requires the FAA to implement a single standard, \nthrough a new subpart of part 135, title 14, Code of Federal \nRegulations, for certifying commercial air tour operators. Such a \nuniform standard, which has been recommended by the National \nTransportation Safety Board [NTSB], will substantially enhance safety \nby providing essential consistency in such areas as pilot \nqualifications, training, and flight and duty time limitations.\n  It mandates commercial air tour safety initiatives recommended by the \n[[Page S8111]] NTSB and others, including the installation of a flight \nmonitoring system and the use of identification markings unique to a \ncommercial air tour operator, the development of aeronautical charts \nwhich reflect airspace management provisions with respect to individual \npark units, and the development of a national data base on air tour \noperations.\n  Last but by no means least, the bill establishes a National Park \nOverflight Advisory Council which would provide advice and \nrecommendations to the Park Service and the FAA on all issues related \nto commercial air tour flights over park units and serve as a national \nforum for interest groups--including representatives of the air tour \nindustry and the environmental community--to constructively exchange \nviews.\n  It is significant to note that my bill will not affect emergency \nflight operations, general aviation, military aviation, or scheduled \ncommercial passenger flights that transit National Park System units. \nFurthermore, recognizing the special needs for air travel in Alaska, \nthis bill will not affect the management of park units or aircraft \noperations over or within park units in the State of Alaska.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the legislation I am offering today \nwill give us the tools to minimize the adverse effects of commercial \nair tour flights on park resources as well as on the ground visitor \nexperience, while at the same time enhancing the safety of such \nflights. I believe it is a balanced measure that, through extensive \nopportunity for public involvement, attempts to accommodate the \nlegitimate concerns of all park users, including air tour operators and \npassengers. Indeed, I strongly believe that under certain well-\nregulated conditions, air tourism provides an important service to \nmillions of elderly, disabled, or other visitors who might otherwise \nnever enjoy the wonders of our national parks.\n  Nevertheless, my bill's central premise is that the 367 park units of \nthe National Park System were created because of their exceptional \nnatural or cultural significance to the American people. All of the \nprovisions of the National Parks Airspace Management Act are therefore \ndesigned with the protection of park resources as their essential, if \nnot exclusive, goal. For it is self-evident that a park whose values \nhave corrupted is a park ultimately not worth visiting, by air or land.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 905\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Parks Airspace \n     Management Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Commercial air tour flights over units of the National \n     Park System (referred to in this Act as ``units'') may have \n     adverse effects on the units. The flights may degrade the \n     experiences of visitors to the affected areas and may have \n     adverse effects on wildlife and cultural resources in those \n     areas. A significant number of complaints about commercial \n     air tour flights over certain areas under the jurisdiction of \n     the National Park Service have been registered.\n       (2) Whereas resource preservation is the primary \n     responsibility of the National Park Service, the agency \n     continues to struggle to develop a policy that would achieve \n     an acceptable balance between flights over units by \n     commercial air tour operators and the protection of resources \n     in the units and the experiences of visitors to the units.\n       (3) Whereas the mission of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration is to develop and maintain a safe and \n     efficient system of air transportation while considering the \n     impact of aircraft noise, the agency continues to have \n     difficulty adequately controlling commercial air tour flights \n     over units.\n       (4) Significant and continuing concerns exist regarding the \n     safety of commercial air tour flights over some units, \n     including concerns for the safety of occupants of the \n     flights, visitors to those units, Federal employees at those \n     units, and the general public. The concern of the Congress \n     over the effects of low-level flights on units led to the \n     enactment, on August 18, 1987, of the Act entitled ``An Act \n     to require the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study \n     to determine the appropriate minimum altitude for aircraft \n     flying over national park system units'' (Public Law 100-91; \n     101 Stat. 674; 16 U.S.C. 1a-1 note). The Act requires the \n     Director to identify problems associated with flights by \n     aircraft in the airspace over units.\n       (5) Pursuant to the Act referred to in paragraph (4), on \n     September 12, 1994, the Director submitted a report to \n     Congress entitled ``Report On Effects Of Aircraft Overflights \n     On The National Park System''. The National Park Service \n     report concluded that, because the details of national park \n     overflights problems are park-specific, no single altitude \n     can be identified for the entire National Park System. The \n     National Park Service report presented a number of \n     recommendations for resolution of the problem, including--\n       (A) the development of airspace and park use resolution \n     processes;\n       (B) the development of a single operational rule to \n     regulate air tour operations;\n       (C) seeking continued improvements in safety and \n     interagency planning related to airspace management; and\n       (D) the development of a Federal Aviation Administration \n     rule to facilitate preservation of natural quiet.\n       (6) The policy of the National Park Service recognizes the \n     importance of natural quiet as a resource to be conserved and \n     protected in certain units. The National Park Services \n     defines natural quiet as ``the natural ambient sound \n     conditions found in certain units of the National Park \n     Service'' and recognizes that visitors to certain units may \n     reasonably expect quiet during their visits to those units \n     established with the specific goal of providing visitors with \n     an opportunity for solitude.\n       (7) The number of flights by aircraft over units has \n     increased rapidly since the date of enactment of the Act \n     referred to in paragraph (4) and, due to the high degree of \n     satisfaction expressed by air tour passengers, as well as the \n     economic impact of air tour operations on the tourist \n     industry, the number of flights will likely continue to \n     increase. A progression of aesthetic and safety concerns \n     about low altitude flights have been associated with growth \n     in commercial air tour traffic. As the number of flights \n     continues to increase, the likelihood exists that there will \n     be a concomitant increase in the number of conflicts \n     regarding management of the airspace over the units.\n       (8) A need exists for a Federal policy to address the \n     conflicts and problems associated with flights by commercial \n     air tour aircraft in the airspace over units. A statutory \n     process should be established to require the Secretary of \n     Transportation and the Secretary of the Interior, acting \n     through the Director, to work together to mitigate the impact \n     of commercial air tour operations on units, or specific areas \n     within units that are adversely affected by commercial air \n     tour operations.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to add multiple \ndeaths as an aggravating factor in determining whether a sentence of \ndeath is to be imposed on a defendant, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     the death penalty act of 1995\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I introduce a bill that will make \nmultiple murders an aggravating factor in determining whether a \nsentence of death is justified.\n  Mr. President, on March 21, 1995, Christopher Green murdered four \npeople and critically injured another in the robbery of a postal \nsubstation in my hometown of Montclair, NJ. Two postal workers, Ernest \nSpruill and Scott Walensky, and two customers, Robert Leslie and George \nLomaga, were forced into a back room and made to lie down on the floor. \nThey were then shot in the back of their heads multiple times at point \nblank range, execution-style, with a 9-millimeter Taurus semiautomatic \npistol containing a 15-round capacity magazine. The magazine contained \ndeadly, flesh-ripping Black Talon bullets which expand upon impact with \nhuman tissue. A third customer, David Grossman, entered the post office \nas the robbery was in progress. He was shot in the face. By the grace \nof God, however, he survived the attack.\n  Yesterday in Federal court Christopher Green admitted his guilt in \nintentionally murdering Ernest Spruill, Scott Walensky, Robert Leslie, \nand George Lomaga, and of attempting to kill David Grossman. He told \nthe court that he had worked for the Montclair Post Office for parts of \n1991, 1992, and 1993, and had dealings with the substation where the \ncrime occurred. Mr. President, Christopher Green further admitted that \nhe knew that the substation had minimal security measures in place, and \nthat thousands of dollars in cash were kept at the substation. He also \nstated in court that he knew Ernest Spruill and Scott Walensky.\n  Mr. President, Christopher Green used a 9-millimeter Taurus \nsemiautomatic pistol containing deadly Black Talon bullets. You may \nrecall that Black Talon bullets produce razor-sharp, reinforced radial \npetals that expand upon impact into a mushroom or claw configuration, \nproducing maximum tissue damage in the wake of the penetrating core. \nThese bullets are designed for one purpose and that is to kill the \nintended target. Mr. President, Christopher Green admitted yesterday \nthat he knew that the bullets that he possessed during the robbery--\nBlack Talon bullets--had the propensity to inflict tremendous internal \ndamage when he viciously murdered Ernest Spruill, Scott Walensky, \nRobert Leslie, and George Lomaga, and attempted to kill David Grossman.\n  Mr. President, for committing this horrible crime, Christopher Green \nwill be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. \nWhile he will never walk the streets of America as a free citizen \nagain, Mr. President, the U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey \nexpressed frustration that her ability to seek the death penalty in \nthis case was limited because the death penalty statute does not list \nmultiple murders as an aggravating factor.\n  Mr. President, the determination of whether the death penalty is to \napply is made in a separate trial following conviction. A jury must \nunanimously find certain statutorily defined aggravating factors to \njustify the imposition of the death penalty. Where the commission of a \nhomicide occurs, such factors include, among others; first, a previous \nconviction of a violent felony involving a firearm; second, two \nprevious felony drug offense convictions; or third, the murder of high \npublic officials, including the President, as noted by the U.S. \nattorney for the District of New Jersey, ``[i]nexplicably, \nmultiple murder--even execution style murder--is not listed in the law \nas an aggravating factor.''\n  In order to fix this glaring limitation in Federal death penalty law, \nMr. President, this bill would add multiple murders to the list of \naggravating factors presently available to determine whether a sentence \nof death can be imposed on a defendant who commits homicide. When \nChristopher Green purchased the weapon used in this mass murder, police \nperformed a background check and found that Green had no criminal \nrecord. Because he had no prior criminal record, the U.S. attorney was \nseverely limited in her ability to seek the death penalty. This bill \nwill therefore strengthen the death penalty law by providing that those \nwho commit atrocious multiple murders will be prosecuted under the \ndeath penalty statute, irrespective of whether they have prior criminal \nrecords.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the death penalty should be available \nwhere an individual commits multiple murders. The senseless spiral of \nviolence burns in many places. No one is immune. Indeed, the mass \nmurders in Montclair occurred in a community that was described in the \nrecent issue of New Jersey Monthly as ``a desirable community where \nparents feel safe allowing young children to ride their bicycles around \ntown.'' Because of this epidemic of violence, every tool in our legal \narsenal, including the death penalty, must be employed to make our \ncommunities safe.\n  Mr. President, the horror and devastation of violence impacts our \ncommunities in immeasurable ways. I was in Montclair recently, and I \nmet with the widow of one of the victims. As I spoke with her, I saw \nthe pain and despair in her eyes. I felt\n her anger, hurt, and confusion. Mr. President, her expressions \ncommunicated to me her yearning to understand exactly why this horrible \nevent could claim her husband and devastate her life in this great \ncountry of ours. As I departed Montclair, Mr. President, I promised \n[[Page S8114]] her that I would continue to do everything in my power \nto return our communities to places where ``parents feel safe allowing \nyoung children to ride their bicycles around town.'' This bill, Mr. \nPresident, is one more installment of that promise.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 906\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of \n1986 to clarify the authorities and duties of the Secretary of \nAgriculture in issuing ski area permits on National Forest System lands \nand to withdraw lands within ski area permit boundaries from the \noperation of the mining and mineral leasing laws; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                    forest service land legislation\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am today introducing \nlegislation to resolve a longstanding problem ski areas permittees on \nForest Service land have encountered with the fee system the Forest \nService developed to calculate their rental fees. This legislation \ncreates a new and simplified ski area fee system to calculate rental \nfees for these ski areas for use of the national forest lands.\n  This same fee system legislation passed the Senate during the 102d \nCongress but time ran out before the legislation was considered in the \nHouse. This proposal was determined to be revenue neutral to the United \nStates by the Congressional Budget Office. The ski area permittees \nsupport this proposal because it is revenue neutral and at the same \ntime collects their fees utilizing a simplified formula that everyone \ncan understand. The Forest Service manual and handbook currently \ncontain over 40 pages of guidelines on the currently utilized fee \nsystem. Ski area permittees and the public have a significant \ndifficulty understanding this system. The new fee system that will be \ncreated by this legislation is set out on one page and is easy for \neveryone to understand.\n  This legislation continues to receive bipartisan support and I hope \nthat more Senators will join our effort to bring some common sense to \nhow ski areas calculate their rental fees on the national forests. This \nlegislation will reduce some of the management problems of the Forest \nService. This simplification of the ski area fee system will eliminate \nthe need for the Forest Service to apply and audit the complex rental \nfee system that they now have in their manual. The new fee system in \nthis proposed legislation will reduce the fee system to a simple \nformula based on gross revenue of the ski area permittee and from \nclearly defined sources. Therefore there will be a significant \nreduction in the bookkeeping and administrative tasks for both the \nForest Service and the ski areas.\n  I hope that hearing can be held soon on this legislation so that the \nnew ski area fee system can be put in place as soon as possible. \nSimplification of this fee system is consistent with reinvention and \ndownsizing the Federal Government.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN:\n  S. 909. A bill to amend part I of title 35, United States Code, to \nprovide for the protection of inventors contracting for invention \ndevelopment services; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  the inventor protection act of 1995\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the \nInventor Protection Act of 1995, which is intended to plug a leak in \nthe longrunning pipeline of American ingenuity, and to make sure that \ninventors are free to pursue their dreams, without losing their money \nto conartists.\n  As Americans, we live in the most inventive society on Earth. From \nFranklin to Edison to Henry Ford and to Steven Jobs, we have a long \ntradition of dreamers, tinkerers and creators, working in basements and \ngarages, motivated by the pervasive quest to build a better mousetrap. \nThe very symbol of a new idea, which is the light bulb, is, of course, \nan American invention.\n  The Founding Fathers even recognized, as we sometimes forget, the \nimportance of protecting the inventive spirit. In article I, section 8 \nof the Constitution of the United States, they empowered Congress to \ncreate a Federal patent system to promote the progress of science and \nuseful arts.\n  Now, more than two centuries later, in an era of intense global \ncompetition, that mission has become even more important. We must do \nall we can to make sure good ideas get to market. Unfortunately, \nthough, for too many inventors today, the path to commercialization is \nstrewn with hazards.\n  It has been said that a person seeking to build a better mousetrap \ntoday will probably run into capital and material shortages, patent \ninfringement lawsuits, work stoppages, product liability suits, and the \nomnipresent burden of taxes. But there is another threat out there, one \nthat is as resilient and longstanding as the American spirit of \ningenuity, and that threat is the American scam artist.\n  Each year thousands of inventors lose tens of millions of dollars to \ndeceptive invention marketing companies that take advantage of their \nideas and their dreams. Last year, as then-chairman of the Subcommittee \non Regulation and Governmental Affairs, I held a hearing on the \nproblems presented by the invention marketing industry. Witness after \nwitness testified how dozens of companies, under broad claims of \nhelping inventors, have actually set up schemes in which inventors \nspend thousands of dollars for services to market their invention--a \nservice that companies regularly fail to provide. State and Federal \nlaws have been vague and ineffective in this area, leaving consumers \nvirtually helpless and lacking the information they need to make truly \ninformed decision about how to develop and sell their idea.\n  To understand the scope of the problem, let me describe how the fraud \nworks: These companies attract inventors through ads that include a \ntoll-free number that an inventor calls to request an invention \nevaluation form. The inventor returns the form, which includes a full \ndescription of their designs, with the expectation that it will be \nevaluated by qualified experts.\n  In fact, according to hearing testimony by the FTC and the Patent and \nTrademark Office [PTO], no expert evaluation occurs. Instead, the form \nis referred to a salesperson who calls the inventor and tires to \nconvince the inventor to purchase a product research report, which the \ninventor is led to believe will evaluate the patentability and \ncommercial potential of the idea. The price for the product research \nreport is generally around $500. Instead of an informative, indepth \nstudy, the inventor receives a boilerplate report of little value which \ninvariably concludes that the idea is patentable. That statement \ntypically is deceiving since almost any idea may be patented. However, \nthe patent may merely protect the design of the idea, not the function \nor usefulness. Such a design patent\n is typically worthless in attempting to commercialize the product.\n\n  The next step in the scheme involves convincing the inventor to \npurchase patent and marketing services. Again, the services are useless \nand quite expensive. The average charge is $7,000 and ranges as high as \n$10,000. For this sum, the inventor routinely receives a few generic \npress releases about the idea and a brief mention in catalogs exhibited \nat various trade shows. In almost every case, this marketing plan is \nessentially worthless.\n  While there are no official figures available on how many people \nannually contract with invention marketers, one person who works at a \nlegitimate non-profit center that helps inventors testified that he \nestimates the number to exceed 25,000. Given an average cost of $7,000 \nfor services that companies charge, that would represent a total of \n$175 million in revenue for these companies, with virtually no benefit \nto inventors. [[Page S8115]] \n  The legislation that I propose to crack down on these scam artists is \nsimple, yet stringent. It uses a multi-faceted approach to separate the \nlegitimate companies from the fraudulent and guarantee real protection \nfor America's inventors.\n  To start with, I propose requiring invention marketing companies to \nregister with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This registration \nrequirement would be fully funded by fees paid by these companies, and \nwould take advantage of the existing structure already set up for \nregistering attorneys to administer it. As a result, no new Federal \nspending would be necessary, nor would any new bureaucracy need be \ncreated.\n  The companies would also be required to provide a complete list of \ntheir officers so shady characters could not hide behind ever-changing \ncorporate names. One former salesperson for an invention marketing \ncompany said his company changed names three times in less than 6 \nyears: ``To evade consumer action, the MO was to frequently change \ncompany names * * * You forgot sometimes what company you are working \nfor.'' Complaints against these companies will also be tracked.\n  In addition, my bill creates standards for contracts between \ninventors and invention developers to help inventors in making informed \ndecisions about developers. One of these standards would require \ncompanies to attach a cover sheet to every contract that lists the \nnumber of applicants the company has rejected, which is usually very \nsmall, and the number of customers who have actually earned a profit \nfrom their inventions, which is also usually very small. If the \ninvention marketing company fails to meet the guidelines set forth in \nthe bill, customers can void these contracts, and even sue for damages \nin Federal court.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is just the type of law that \nAmericans are clamoring for. It addresses a specific identified problem \nthat can be best solved by the Federal Government and does so without \ncreating a new bureaucracy. Although several States have passed \nlegislation to address the problem, they have largely failed to wipe \nout this threat because the companies can simply move to States with \nweak laws and lax enforcement. Best of all, this legislation will not \ncost American taxpayers a cent; the entire burden will be covered by \nthe registration fees called for in the bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill to ensure that inventors as \nwell as their ideas are protected.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 909\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan election to exclude from the gross estate of a decedent the value of \ncertain land subject to a qualified conservation easement, and to make \ntechnical changes to alternative valuation rules; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n           the american farm and ranch protection act of 1995\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, a serious environmental problem facing the \ncountry today is the loss of open space to development. All across the \ncountry, farms, ranches, forests, and wetlands are forced to give way \nto the pressures for new office buildings, shopping malls, and housing \ndevelopments.\n  America is losing over 4 square miles of land to development every \nday. In Rhode Island, over 11,000 acres of farmland have been lost to \ndevelopment since 1974. In many instances, this is simply the natural \noutgrowth of urbanization of our society. Other times it is the direct \nresult of improper planning at the State and local levels.\n  But frequently, the pressure comes from the need to raise funds to \npay estate taxes. For those families where undeveloped land represents \na significant portion of the estate's total value, the need to pay the \ntax creates powerful pressure to develop or sell off part or all of the \nland or to liquidate the timber resources of the land. Because land is \nappraised by the Internal Revenue Service according to its highest and \nbest use, and such use is often its development value, the effect of \nthe tax is to make retention of undeveloped land difficult.\n  In addition, our current estate tax policy results in complicated \nvaluation disputes between the donor's estate and the Internal Revenue \nService. In many cases, the additional costs incurred as a result of \nthese disagreements may cause a potential donor of a conservation \neasement to decide not to make the contribution.\n  These open spaces improve the quality of life for Americans \nthroughout the great Nation and provide important habitat for fish and \nwildlife. The question is how do we conserve our most valuable resource \nduring this time of significant budget constraints.\n  Mr. President, I think we need to restructure the Nation's estate tax \nlaws to remove the disincentive for private property owners to conserve \nenvironmentally significant land. The American Farm and Ranch \nProtection Act, with I am introducing today along with Senator Baucus, \nwill help to achieve this goal by providing an exemption from the \nestate tax for the value of land that is subject to a qualified, \npermanent conservation easement.\n  This bill is similar to legislation that we introduced last year. The \nprinciples involved in this bill have been endorsed by the Piedmont \nEnvionmental Council, the National Audubon Society, the American Farm \nBureau, the Land Trust Alliance, and the National Trust for Historic \nPreservation.\n  The bill excludes land subject to a conservation easement from the \nestate and gift taxes. Development rights retained by the family--most \nfrequently the ability to use the property for a commercial purpose--\nremain subject to the estate tax.\n  In order to target the incentives under this bill to those areas that \nare truly at risk for development, the bill is limited to land that \nfalls within a 50-mile radius of a metropolitan area, a national park \nor a national wilderness area.\n  Conservation easements, which are entirely voluntary, are agreements \nnegotiated by landowners in which a restriction upon the future use of \nland is imposed in order to conserve those aspects of the land that are \npublicly significant. To qualify for the estate tax exemption under \nthis bill, such easements must be perpetual and must be made to \npreserve open space, to protect the natural habitat of fish, wildlife \nor plants, to meet a governmental conservation policy, or to preserve \nan historical important land area.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to save \nenvironmentally sensitive open spaces.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and a \nbrief explanation of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 910\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``American Farm and Ranch \n     Protection Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

The bill does this in the \nfollowing ways:\n  By excluding from estate and gift taxes the value of land on which a \nqualified conservation easement has been granted if the land is located \nin or within a 50-mile radius of a metropolitan area, a National Park, \nor a wilderness area that is part of the National Wilderness Area \nSystem; and,\n  By clarifying that land subject to a qualified conservation easement \ncan also qualify for special use valuation under Code section 2032A.\n  The bill also contains a number of safeguards to ensure that the \nbenefits of the exclusion are not abused. These safeguards include the \nfollowing:\n  The easement must be perpetual and meet the requirements of Code \nSection 170(h), governing deductions for charitable contributions of \neasements;\n  Easements retaining the right to develop the property for commercial \nrecreational use would not be eligible, while other retained \ndevelopment rights would be taxed;\n  Land excluded from the estate tax would receive a carryover, rather \nthan stepped-up, basis for purposes of calculating gain on a subsequent \nsale;\n  The land must have been owned by the decedent or a member of the \ndecedent's family for at least 3 years immediately prior to the \ndecedent's death; and,\n  The easement must have been donated by the decedent or a member of \nthe decedent's family. [[Page S8119]] \n  The bill would be effective for decedents dying after December 31, \n1995.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ROBB:\n  S. 911. A bill to authorize the Secretary to issue a certificate of \ndocumentation with appropriate endorsement for employment in the \ncoastwise trade of the United States for the vessel Sea Mistress; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                certification of documentation legislation\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to \nauthorize the Coast Guard to issue the appropriate endorsement for the \nvessel Sea Mistress--U.S. official number 696806--to engage in the \ncoastwise trade. This legislation is necessary to resolve a lapse in \nthe Sea Mistress's chain of title.\n  The Sea Mistress was built in the United States in Louisville, KY, by \nAluminum Cruisers, Inc. It is a 41-foot, high-speed houseboat, which is \ncurrently being refurbished in the United States for the excursion \ntourboat trade. In 1984, the Internal Revenue Service, seized the \nvessel to secure an unpaid tax debt incurred by the original owner of \nthe vessel. This seizure has left a gap in the chain of title of the \nvessel. The Coast Guard has informed the owner of Occoquan Tours that \nif the gap is left unresolved, a coastwise endorsement cannot be issued \nfor the vessel, even though the owner is a U.S. citizen and the vessel \nwas built in the United States and is being refurbished locally.\n  The Congress passes a number of these technical bills every year. The \nSea Mistress was part of a package of similar legislative waivers which \npassed the House of Representatives October of last year, but failed to \nbe enacted prior to the end of the session. I'm introducing the bill \ntoday so that the Senate Commerce Committee may act upon it with the \nupcoming coastwise bill this session.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 912. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with \nrespect to the eligibility of veterans for mortgage revenue bond \nfinancing, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               MORTGAGE REVENUE BOND FINANCING LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I introduce a modified version of \nlegislation I introduced in February, S. 417, which will help Wisconsin \nand several other States, including Oregon, Texas, Alaska, and \nCalifornia, extend one of our most successful veterans programs to \nPersian Gulf war participants and others. This legislation will amend \nthe eligibility requirements for mortgage revenue bond financing for \nState veterans housing programs.\n  Wisconsin uses this tax-exempt bond authority to assist veterans in \npurchasing their first home. Under rules adopted by Congress in 1984, \nthis program excluded from eligibility veterans who served after 1977. \nThis bill would remove that restriction.\n  Wisconsin and the other eligible States simply want to maintain a \nprinciple that we in the Senate have also strived to uphold--that \nveterans of the Persian Gulf war should not be treated less generously \nthan those of past wars. This bill will make that possible.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. McCain, and Mr. \n        Bennett):\n  S. 913. A bill to amend section 17 of the Act of August 27, 1954 (25 \nU.S.C. 677p), relating to the distribution and taxation of assets and \nearnings, to clarify that distributions of rents and royalties derived \nfrom assets held in continued trust by the Government, and paid to the \nmixed-blood members of the Ute Indian tribe, their Ute Indian heirs, or \nUte Indian legatees, are not subject to Federal or State taxation at \nthe time of distribution, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                the mixed blood ute indian tax status act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am joined today by my colleagues, \nSenators Inouye, McCain, and Bennett, to introduce a bill of great \nimportance to the mixed-blood Utes, a native population of my home \nState of Utah.\n  This limited legislation will restore the tax status of the mixed \nblood Ute Indians with regard to proceeds received from a trust created \nby the Federal Government as agreed in a settlement between the Federal \nGovernment and the Ute Tribe in 1954.\n  Until recently, the Federal Government has respected the intent of \nCongress to exempt this income from Federal and State taxation. \nHowever, in a recent tenth circuit decision the court construed the \nintent of Congress as allowing the tax exemption on the settlement \nproceeds to lapse. This bill is necessary to clarify the legislative \nintent of Congress and reinstate the exemption.\n  In my view, it was the intent of Congress in the 1954 settlement to \nexempt from Federal and State taxation the income derived from the \nassets held in continued trust by the Federal Government for, and paid \nto, the mixed blood Ute Indians. This has been the law for nearly four \ndecades and should remain the law.\n  Historically, with regard to all settlements between the Federal \nGovernment and numerous Indian nations, the proceeds from settlements \nhave been exempt from Federal and State taxation. The mixed blood Ute \nIndians have been singled out and treated differently since the tenth \ncircuit's decision. This bill clarifies the 1954 settlement and simply \nrestores the tax status of the mixed blood Utes.\n  I believe all of my Senate colleagues will recognize this legislation \nas both fair and necessary. I am pleased to have the support of the \nchairman and ranking member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee as \nwell as my Utah colleague, Senator Bennett. I urge all Senators to help \nus clarify this exemption.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8098-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                  S. 456\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bradley, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kerry] was added as a cosponsor of S. 456, a bill to \nimprove and strengthen the child support collection system, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                  S. 644\n\n  At the request of Mr. Campbell, the name of the Senator from Illinois \n[Mr. Simon] was added as a cosponsor of S. 644, a bill to amend title \n38, United States Code, to reauthorize the establishment of research \ncorporations in the Veterans Health Administration, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                  S. 770\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the name of the Senator from Georgia [Mr. \nCoverdell] was added as a cosponsor of S. 770, a bill to provide for \nthe relocation of the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                  S. 798\n\n  At the request of Mr. Conrad, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] was added as a cosponsor of S. 798, a bill \nto amend title XVI of the Social Security Act to improve the provision \nof supplemental security income benefits, and for the purposes.\n\n\n                        Senate Joint Resolution 34\n\n  At the request of Mr. Smith, the name of the Senator from Maine [Ms. \nSnowe] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 34, a joint \nresolution prohibiting funds for diplomatic relations and most-favored-\nnation trading status with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam unless the \nPresident certifies to Congress that Vietnamese officials are being \nfully cooperative and forthcoming with efforts to account for the 2,205 \nAmericans still missing and otherwise unaccounted for from the Vietnam \nwar, as determined on the basis of all information available to the \nUnited States Government, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8119-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8119-S8120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 132--COMMENDING CAPTAIN O'GRADY, AND U.S. \n                            AND NATO FORCES\n\n  Mr. DOLE (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Helms, Mr. Warner, Mr. \nCoverdell, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. McCain, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Robb, Mr. Pell, \nMr. Graham, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Levin, Mr. Bryan, Mr. \nReid, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bradley, Mr. Cohen, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Ford, \nMr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Bumpers, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Glenn, Mr. \nHarkin, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \nSarbanes, and Mr. Nickles) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I wish to have printed in the \nRecord a resolution of the 74th Legislature of the State of Texas \nregarding the mission of the Johnson Space Center [JSC] and the United \nStates' leadership in space technology and exploration.\n  Recently, NASA undertook an extensive review to identify $5 billion \nin budget savings. I commend NASA for conducting this painstaking and \nconscientious review. However, I was alarmed when this review team \npreliminarily recommended moving the shuttle, orbiter, and space \nstation engineering division out of JSC. NASA additionally proposed \nmoving JSC's Shuttle Program Management Office and Orbiter Project \nManagement Office. However, after thorough examination of these \nproposals, NASA concurred with many in the space community--including \nformer astronauts--and found these transfers neither cost-effective nor \nin the best interests of NASA's space exploration mission.\n  The combination of engineering, operations, and flight personnel at \nJSC has proven its value. The crew of Apollo 13 owes their lives to \ntheir own courage and skill--and to the team at JSC that was able to \nfind a way out of a critical spacecraft failure and implement that \nlife-saving solution in real-time. It was the synergies, efficiencies, \nand problem-solving abilities of this combination of capabilities that \nlead NASA to designate JSC as host center for the space station 2 years \nago.\n  Maintaining the JSC model, with some budgetary streamlining, will \nyield necessary program savings while preserving much-needed stability \nin [[Page S8122]] NASA's research and development mission. With \nessential human spacecraft engineering functions preserved in \ncombination with mission operations, I am confident that NASA will be \nable to respond to the complexities--budgetary, scientific, and \noperational--that are inherent to human exploration of space in the \nnext century.\n  The material follows:\n\n                    House Concurrent Resolution 188\n\n       Whereas, Texas is proud to be home to the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Johnson Space \n     Center and is a state where thousands of Texans have taken \n     part in NASA's goals, vision, missions, and accomplishments \n     in furthering space exploration; and\n       Whereas, The approach of an integrated design and \n     development team concept implemented at Johnson Space Center \n     has a proven record of accomplishment in the Mercury, Gemini, \n     Appolo, and Shuttle programs, and the International Space \n     Station program was purposely located at Johnson Space Center \n     to take advantage of the integrated product team concept that \n     has been so successful in previous NASA programs; and\n       Whereas, The human space integration mission at Johnson \n     Space Center, including spacecraft engineering, space shuttle \n     operations program management, the shuttle orbiter project, \n     and science programs, are vital to NASA's human space \n     program; and\n       Whereas, A proposed plan developed by NASA to consolidate \n     operations portends an action that would severely impact \n     Johnson Space Center and the Texas economy; and\n       Whereas, If the proposal is implemented, Texas stands to \n     lose thousands of primary and secondary jobs associated with \n     the aerospace industry and Johnson Space Center, thousands of \n     secondary, retail, and support jobs, and a significant share \n     of investment opportunities and associated investment \n     benefits; and\n       Whereas, Texas was affected negatively as a consequence of \n     NASA's 1994 restructuring, downsizing, and space station \n     redesign at Johnson Space Center; and\n       Whereas, Texas support the general goal of reducing \n     government waste and jobs; how the goal is achieved in the \n     case of NASA's proposed reorganization is a key point that \n     needs clarification; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 74th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to review \n     fully NASA's proposed reorganization plan and to analyze the \n     cost/benefit of the plan, including proposed mission \n     transfers and relocations, with the purpose of preserving and \n     protecting the United States' leadership in space technology \n     and exploration; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the administrator of \n     the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, to the \n     President of the United States, to the Speaker of the House \n     of Representatives and President of the Senate of the United \n     States Congress, and to all members of the Texas \n     congressional delegation with the request that it be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record of the United \n     States of America.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8121-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       CONGRATULATING NATHAN BERISH, JEFF KENDA, AND MIKE HUBERTY\n Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \noutstanding Kentucky educator who retired just this last week as a \nteacher at an award-winning high school in Louisville. Through 32 years \nof dedicated service to Trinity High School, Maurice ``Woody'' Woods \nhas impacted the lives of thousands of young men.\n  Now, a familiar face will be absent in the classrooms of this \nnationally recognized school of excellence. However, you can be sure \nthat Mr. Woods will remain an important part of the Trinity family. As \na teacher of U.S. and world history, government, and business classes, \nhe has instilled in his students a sense of pride in the American \ngovernmental system. He has also taught his students the importance of \nbeing prepared to face the challenges of the business world.\n  ``Woody is a true gentleman, in the purest sense of the word,'' says \na fellow Trinity teacher. And indeed, Mr. Woods has served as a source \nof goodness and kindness for as long as most around Trinity can \nremember.\n  A former student said, ``Mr. Woods epitomizes the ideal teacher. In \nfact, he is one of the few teachers who really knows, loves, and has \nexperienced the lessons he passes on to his students. Woody is \nhistory.''\n  Mr. Woods has also been very active outside the classroom as an \nauthor and a volunteer in his school and his community. He has always \ntaught his students the value of serving the community. This is evident \nin the fact that several of his former students have gone on to \nthemselves teach at Trinity and other institutions throughout Kentucky.\n  As an author, his book on Kentucky history was written only after \nvisiting each and every county seat in the Commonwealth. Mr. Woods has \nshown a tremendous interest in sharing Kentucky's history with young \nand old alike. His book about Kentucky landmarks is also a favorite of \nscholars throughout my State.\n  As a volunteer, Mr. Woods has again sparked his students' interest in \nAmerican Government, serving as moderator to both the Young \nRepublicans, as well as the Young Democrats. His care for his students \nis certainly visible, as Mr. Woods is often found late in the day \ntutoring or just talking to his students about a wide variety of \nsubjects.\n  So Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the career of this \noutstanding Kentucky teacher, Mr. Maurice Woods. He is a man that other \nteachers can look to as a model for caring, compassion, and dedication. \nAnd although he will no longer teach in the classroom, his years of \nservice will most definitely live on through his students of the past \n32 years.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8122-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8122-S8123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        WHY STUDENT AID MATTERS\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President. We are in the process of making \nbasic decisions for the future of our country, and one of them is \nwhether we encourage or discourage our young people to go to college.\n  And, I just said ``young people;'' I should change that to \n``citizens,'' because a great many who are beyond the traditional \ncollege age can benefit by higher education, also. I recently visited \nwith a woman on welfare, a grandmother, who has enrolled in a community \ncollege program that she believes may take her off of welfare. I have \nevery confidence she is correct.\n  To deny people the chance to develop themselves is to limit the \nfuture of our Nation.\n  A New York Times editorial titled ``Why Student Aid Matters'' \nappeared the other day, and I ask to put its editorial wisdom into the \nCongressional Record at this point.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                        Why Student Aid Matters\n\n       Two years ago, Gregory McCall almost because a dropout when \n     he failed to make the state championship basketball team at \n     St. [[Page S8123]] Anthony High School in Jersey City. As he \n     told Neil MacFarquhar of The Times: ``I had no hope of going \n     to college because my family was so poor. I thought I would \n     end up in Jersey City working at Kmart in a minimum-wage \n     job.''\n       Instead, with prodding from teachers and counselors, Mr. \n     McCall graduated from St. Anthony this week, receiving an \n     award for outstanding educational improvement and earning a \n     full $20,000 scholarship to Monmouth University in New \n     Jersey.\n       He is one of 47 St. Anthony seniors who have been admitted \n     to 138 different colleges and universities, accumulating $1 \n     million in financial aid. It is the third year in a row that \n     St. Anthony, whose enrollment of 300 is drawn from \n     impoverished neighborhoods, has had every graduating senior \n     accepted in college.\n       But now the aspirations of future classes of such students \n     are in jeopardy. The Congressional assault on student aid \n     programs in general and minority scholarship programs in \n     particular will put college out of reach for many minority \n     and low-income youths.\n       Congress threatens to freeze the $6 billion appropriation \n     for Pell grants, which are targeted to low-income students, \n     for the next seven years. The current maximum award, $2,300, \n     has already been reduced to about $1,500 as appropriations \n     have failed to keep pace with increasing numbers of needy \n     students or rising college costs. The freeze is likely to cut \n     grants to poor students while proposed tax breaks for middle- \n     and upper-income families would make it easier for them to \n     pay tuition costs.\n       Mr. McCall and his fellow St. Anthony seniors, many of whom \n     are first-generation college students from inner-city \n     minority, ethnic blue-collar and immigrant families, still \n     have hope. But without targeted scholarships and grants, the \n     hopes of many who come after them will be dashed.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8122-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nCOMMENDING HOLLIS/BROOKLINE HIGH SCHOOL FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE \n                       ``WE THE PEOPLE'' PROGRAM\n\n Mr. SMITH.

The Citizen and the \nConstitution program from April 29 to May 1, 1995, in Washington, DC. \nThese young scholars worked diligently to reach the national finals. \nThey triumphed in local competitions in the Granite State, and were \namong more than 1,200 students from 49 States and the District of \nColumbia to participate in the program.\n  The distinguished members of the team representing New Hampshire are: \nSarah Birch, Alisa Bowen, Brian Clardy, Ashley Dennis, Cerissa \nDesrosiers, Alicia DiGrezio, Katie Enright, Joe Gautheier, Lisl Hacker, \nMeredith Ham, Jessica Hannon, Alyssa Hemmerich, Andrea Higgins, \nChristine Hsu, Arwyn Jackson, Eric Jones, Zak Klimas, Rachel Lee, Cathy \nO'Sullivan, Reina Parker, Joshua Rattin, Mary Beth Rosamond, Justin \nRydstrom, David Sawyer, Emilie Sommer, Rachel Spaulding, Stacey \nStabile, Alan Stenzel, Heather Towne, Jessica Wild, and Holly Williams.\n  I would also like to recognize their outstanding teachers, Deb \nChristenson and Joel Mitchell, who both deserve a great deal of credit \nfor the success of the team. The district coordinator, Raymond \nKneeland, and the State coordinator, Patricia Barss, also contributed a \nsignificant amount of time and effort to help the team reach the \nnational finals.\n  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the ``We the People'' \n. . . program, now in its eighth academic year, is the most extensive \neducational program in the country developed specifically to educate \nyoung people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The 3 day \nnational competition simulates a congressional hearing in which \nstudents' oral presentations are judged on the basis of their knowledge \nof constitutional principles and their ability to apply them to \nhistorical and contemporary issues.\n  The We the People . . . program provides an excellent opportunity for \nstudents to gain an informed perspective about the history and \nprinciples of our Nation's constitutional government.

Mr. President, our country is a remarkable \nmosaic--a mixture of races, languages, ethnicities, and religions--that \ngrows increasingly diverse with each passing year. Nowhere is this \nincredible diversity more evident than in the State of New Jersey. In \nNew Jersey, schoolchildren come from families that speak 120 different \nlanguages at home. These different languages are used in over 1.4 \nmillion homes in my State. I have always believed that one of the \nUnited States greatest strengths is the diversity of the people that \nmake up its citizenry and I am proud to call the attention of my \ncolleagues to an event in New Jersey that celebrates the importance of \nthe diversity that is a part of America's collective heritage.\n  On June 4, 1995 the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel, NJ began its \n1995 Spring Heritage Festival Series. This Heritage Festival program \nsalutes many of the different ethnic communities that contribute so \ngreatly to New Jersey's diverse makeup. Highlighting old country \ncustoms and culture, the festival programs are an opportunity to \nexpress pride in the ethnic backgrounds that are a part of our \ncollective heritage. Additionally, the Spring Heritage Festivals will \ncontribute proceeds from their programs to the Garden State Arts \nCenter's Cultural Center Fund which presents theater productions free-\nof-charge to New Jersey's school children, seniors, and other deserving \nresidents. The Heritage Festival thus not only pays tribute to the \ncultural influences from our past, it also makes a significant \ncontribution to our present day cultural activities.\n  On Saturday, June 10, 1995, the Heritage Festival Series will \ncelebrate the 25th Annual Festa Italiana. Chaired by Eileen DiNizo, \nthis year's event promise to be a grand celebration alive with colorful \ncostumes, traditional foods, ethnic arts and crafts, and talented \nentertainers of Italian descent. The celebration will consist of both a \nday-long open air mall event, featuring piazza entertainment, food, \ncrafts and a mass and an evening stage show highlighting renowned \nItalian entertainers. The Mall activities will kick-off with a \ntraditional sing-a-long, dancing and comedy acts and will feature \ntraditional food and crafts which will be available throughout the \ncultural exhibit area. Additionally, a liturgy will be concelebrated by \nthe most Rev. Theodore E. McCarrick, Archbishop of Newark and clergy \nfrom throughout New Jersey. Immediately following the liturgy will be \nan evening stage show featuring many Italian artists including, \ncomedian Freddie Travelena, singer Moreno Fruzzetti, and Anthony \nRolando, two-time U.S. Accordion champion.\n  On behalf of all New Jerseyans of Italian descent, which at 1.1 \nmillion people is the largest ethnic group in my State, I offer my \ncongratulations on the occasion of the 25th Annual Festa \nItaliana.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8123-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8123-S8124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                ``WHY ADOPTIVE PARENTS FIGHT FOR KIDS''\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, there are few things that have moved \nme as much in recent years as the tragic case of ``Baby Richard,'' who \nwas taken by the Illinois Supreme Court from his adoptive parents at \nthe age of four and given to his natural parents who had abandoned him \nupon birth. As an adoptive parent myself, I cannot believe the pain \nwith which this family has been afflicted and the emotional harm and \nscars that will be part of the life of Richard, unfortunately.\n  The other day, I happened to see in the New York Daily News an \narticle by Michael Quinn, on the staff of Time magazine, who is also an \nadoptive parent.\n  His article is titled, ``Why adoptive parents fight for kids.''\n  It tells the story very simply but meaningfully.\n  I ask that his story be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [From the New York Daily News, June 6, 1995]\n\n                  Why Adoptive Parents Fight for Kids\n\n                           (By Michael Quinn)\n\n       Already it ranks as one of the most shameful images of our \n     time: Chicago's 4-year-old ``Baby Richard'' being slowly \n     pried from the arms of the family with whom he shared every \n     memory of his tiny universe and whisked off by strangers with \n     whom he shared nothing but DNA.\n       You didn't need much to join in a nation's sense of \n     heartache--just two eyes and a soul. [[Page S8124]] \n       Yet even now, some ask: Why didn't they just give up? When \n     the biological father first pressed his case, why didn't the \n     ``Does'' simply hand the child over and spare him and \n     themselves a greatly amplified agony four years later?\n       For the answer, consider the story of two New Yorkers, \n     Cameron and Brandon Baldanza--a local Baby Richard case with \n     a vastly different ending.\n       Cameron, born in September 1989, and Brandon, born a year \n     later, were abandoned at the hospital by their biological \n     mother, Magaly Galindo. To be sure, Galindo did leave the \n     boys something to remember her by--an addiction to the heroin \n     she pumped into her system throughout the two pregnancies.\n       Fortunately, there was someone unwilling to walk away from \n     Cameron and Brandon: Millie Baldanza, a first cousin to \n     Galindo, who took the boys into her home and into her heart, \n     knowing in advance they entered the world as junkies.\n       With her husband, Jimmie, Millie nursed the two kids \n     through a nightmare no parent would want to imagine, let \n     alone experience--the body-quaking ordeal of drug withdrawal. \n     Brandon and Cameron survived--and thrived.\n       Meanwhile, Galindo and the boys' birth father, Jose Diaz, \n     were working as hard at being strangers as the Baldanzas were \n     at being parents. They had virtually no contact with the boys \n     for two years, making their very first appearance in court \n     six months after the Child Welfare Administration began \n     proceedings to terminate their parental rights.\n       Millie and Jimmie could have given up then. It would have \n     been hard to blame\n      them, given Child Welfare's blatant bias for ``family \n     preservation''--social-workerese for the philosophy that \n     nothing is worse for a child than adoption. Or they might \n     have tossed in the towel last summer, when Brandon and \n     Cameron were forced into extended stays with their now-\n     you-see-them, now-you-don't birth parents.\n       But Millie and Jimmie did not give up. And early last \n     month, less than a week after the taking of Baby Richard, \n     Judge Marjory Fields of the Bronx Family Court ordered the \n     return of Brandon and Cameron to the Baldanzas at the end of \n     this month--a delay only so they can finish the school term.\n       Fields based her decision on testimony from expert \n     witnesses who concluded ``the children have suffered grievous \n     harm from being removed from the [Baldanzas'] care.''\n       The experts backed up that grim diagnosis with tales of \n     caseworkers forcing the screaming children into taxis for \n     visits with Diaz and Galindo, of Cameron cowering in his \n     closet and complaining of chest pains and headaches when the \n     visits were increased.\n       The prognosis for the boys if they were taken from the \n     Baldanzas: ``personality disorder, clinical depression''--\n     perhaps even suicide.\n       That would have been the fate of Cameron and Brandon had \n     Millie and Jimmie decided to let their kids be abandoned for \n     a second time. And tragically, it may well be what lies ahead \n     for Baby Richard.\n       But win or lose, there is an even simpler reason why \n     adoptive families are willing to fight from the very first to \n     the very last for their kids.\n       Because that is what they are: our kids. Not some stereo \n     equipment we're ready to return if it doesn't work out. Not a \n     sports car we are borrowing for a test drive. Our kids. The \n     second they cross our door, we have made a commitment for \n     life, more serious than most marriages--and as sacred as \n     birth.\n       Thanks to the Baldanzas and the Does for \n     declaring it to the world: They are our kids. \n     \n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8123-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO KING RAMA IX OF THAILAND\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, King Bhumibol Adulyadej of \nThailand begins the 50th year of his reign. It is my great pleasure to \njoin Montana's Thai community in offering him congratulations and best \nwishes.\n\n\n                            the ninth reign\n\n  King Bhumibol took the name Rama IX and opened the Ninth Reign of the \nChakri Dynasty on June 9, 1946, just a few months after the end of the \nSecond World War.\n  At the time, like the rest of Southeast Asia, Thailand faced severe \nquestions. They arose from the end of colonialism in neighboring \ncountries; the rise of radical ideologies worldwide; and endemic \npoverty, illiteracy and illness.\n  Today, Thailand is one of the anchors of the modern, prosperous \nSoutheast Asia. Bangkok has become one of the world's great cities and \ncommercial centers. The Thai political system is evolving into a stable \nparliamentary democracy; in fact, a new political campaign opens today \nas candidates across Thailand file their papers to run for Parliament. \nAnd the Thai economy grows by 7 percent or more every year.\n  Much of this extraordinary success is due to the wise guidance of \nKing Bhumibol.\n  The King has led by example. He has embodied the 10 traditional moral \nprinciples of Buddhist Kings: charity toward the poor; morality, \nsacrifice of personal interest; honesty; courtesy; self-restraint; \ntranquility of temperament; non-violence; patience; and impartiality in \nsettling dispute.\n  And he has led by action. Together, King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit \nhave devoted decades to improving the lives of Thai people in rural and \nimpoverished regions. They constantly travel the country's 73 \nprovinces, meeting with villagers and staying close to the people. The \nresults are obvious in improved public health, the spread of education \nto all Thai children and the renewal of traditional crafts and \ntextiles.\n\n\n                   king rama ix and the United States\n\n  King Bhumibol has also been a great friend of the United States. \nDuring his reign, the Thai-American relationship has\n grown from one largely based on American aid and political support, \ninto a partnership for trade, prosperity, environmental protection and \nregional peace. And Thailand is about to fulfill the pledge he made in \nhis 1967 Address to a joint session of Congress: to end reliance on \nAmerican foreign aid.\n\n  The new maturity of Thai-American relations can be seen in our \nprospects for trade. American exports to Thailand more than tripled in \nthe last 7 years. They grew to nearly $5 billion last year, and now \nsupport nearly 100,000 jobs in America.\n  Prospects are especially good for my State of Montana. Our farmers \nand ranchers can supply a generation of newly affluent Thai consumers \nwith top-quality wheat, beef, and pork.\n  Montana environmental technology companies--in areas from mine waste \nreclamation to clean coal technology, sustainable forestry and low-\nimpact agricultural fertilizer--can help Thailand address its fast-\ngrowing environmental problems. Firms like Mountain States Energy in \nButte are already looking to the Kingdom for opportunity.\n  And people-to-people contracts between Thailand and Montana are \ngrowing fast. Thais like former Ambassador Birabhongse Kasemsri are \nhelping to support the Montana economy, by coming as tourists to see \nour National Parks and visit our skiing areas. And in several cities, \nsome of the newest members of the Montana family operate well-run small \nbusinesses like the Thai Deli in Missoula and the Thai Orchid \nRestaurant in Billings. They work hard, provide jobs and add a new \ntouch of diversity to our State.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, King Bhumibol is now the longest-reigning King of \nThailand. And history is certain to rank his reign with those not only \nof the greatest Thai monarchs of the past--Ramkamhaeng, creator of the \nThai alphabet; Naresuan and Phra Narai in the Ayutthaya era; Mongkut \nand Chulalongkorn in the last century--but the great constitutional \nmonarchs of the world and the democratic leaders of modern times.\n  It is my great pleasure to join all the Thai Montanans in \ncongratulating King Bhumibol as he begins the 50th year of his reign, \nand looking forward to many more to come.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8124-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8124-S8125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TAKE THE LEAD, MR. CLINTON\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, recently, Matthew Miller, a former \nsenior adviser to the Office of Management and Budget, had an op-ed \npiece about the budget.\n  It says precisely what I believe: that the Administration should have \nprovided Congress with a better budget, that the Republicans should be \napplauded for trying to achieve a balanced budget by the year 2002, but \nthat the priorities in the Republican budget are all wrong, even though \nthe goal is a proper one.\n  I know the budget has already passed the Senate and the House, and we \nwill be facing it shortly in conference, but in the belief that telling \nthe truth always has some virtue, I ask that the Matthew Miller piece \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 16, 1995]\n\n                       Take the Lead, Mr. Clinton\n\n                          (By Matthew Miller)\n\n       Washington.--I left the Clinton Administration in January \n     when the White House issued a budget that I felt turned away \n     from [[Page S8125]] its previous commitment to deficit \n     reduction and sensible public investment.\n       Today, while supporting President Clinton in opposing the \n     cruel and counterproductive Republican budget resolutions in \n     the House and Senate, I also wonder why the White House has \n     let the Republicans seize this issue.\n       Though the Administration is right to criticize plans that \n     would cut spending for the most vulnerable Americans to help \n     finance tax breaks for the well-off, it will not rally much \n     support by hypocritically attacking cutbacks in Medicare and \n     Medicaid or by resisting the idea of balancing the budget \n     altogether.\n       Last week, the White House chief of staff, Leon Panetta, \n     said that the Republicans would ``make Medicare a second-\n     class health care system for our seniors.'' The \n     Administration's 1993 economic plan, ``A Vision of Change for \n     America,'' struck a different note. In it, the Administration \n     hoped to ``control the growth of Medicare and Medicaid \n     spending in the long term, and thereby supplement the deficit \n     reduction in this economic program.''\n       Assuming ``health care controls,'' the plan estimated that \n     the deficit would decline to $87 billion in the year 2003--\n     from what otherwise would have been $399 billion. Bringing \n     down the combined annual growth rate of Medicare and Medicaid \n     was the single most important factor in the reduction.\n       This slower growth would have meant saving about $66 \n     billion yearly on average over a 10-year period. The \n     Republican Senate budget resolution, by contrast, calls for \n     savings that average $65 billion yearly over seven years, \n     while the House resolution calls for $69 billion yearly over \n     the same period.\n       It's hard to understand how a goal the Administration \n     considered reasonable only two years ago can seem unthinkably \n     draconian today.\n       Nor is the Republicans' aim of balancing the budget by 2002 \n     as dangerous for the economy as the Administration suggests. \n     Mainstream economists generally agree that reducing the \n     deficit by the equivalent of 0.5 percent of the gross \n     domestic product per year can be reliably offset by the \n     Federal Reserve (for example, by lowering interest rates). \n     With the Congressional Budget Office forecasting the deficit \n     at 2.5 percent of the gross domestic product in 1995, that \n     would mean a five-year path to a balanced budget by 2000 \n     would be reasonable.\n       In any event, it would be far better policy and better \n     politics for Mr. Clinton to take the lead by offering his own \n     plan to balance the budget rather than merely sniping at the \n     Republicans.\n       The GOP resolutions would slash basic research, investment \n     in infrastructure and in education, while leaving untouched \n     most of the welfare for the well-off that permeates the \n     budget. While families struggling on $35,000 a year would \n     continue to bear a disproportionate tax burden, for example, \n     $30 billion in health and pension benefits would still go \n     every year to senior citizens who have incomes above \n     $100,000--giving these retirees far more back than they paid \n     into the system.\n       Yet all of the Administration's well-taken criticisms will \n     be ignored if President Clinton does not renew his commitment \n     to addressing the problem of the deficit. The Republicans' \n     methods may be misguided, but the goal they have embraced is \n     the right one. Mr. Clinton should waste no time in taking \n     back an issue he claimed as his own from his first days in \n     office.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8124-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                THE 23RD ANNUAL JEWISH HERITAGE FESTIVAL\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, our country is a remarkable \nmosaic--a mixture of races, languages, ethnicities, and religions--that \ngrows increasingly diverse with each passing year. Nowhere is this \nincredible diversity more evident than in the State of New Jersey. In \nNew Jersey, schoolchildren come from families that speak 120 different \nlanguages at home. These different languages are used in over 1.4 \nmillion homes in my State.

Mr. President, just prior to the Memorial Day \nrecess, the Senate considered a near-record number of amendments to the \nSenate budget resolution. Since many of these amendments were offered \nafter time had expired and voted upon without debate, I want to take \nsome time now to offer explanations for several of the more critical \nvotes about which I was unable to comment at the time.\n  During the budget markup in committee the focus of many amendments \nwas the so-called fiscal dividend reserve fund. This fund was \nestablished to incorporate the estimates of the Congressional Budget \nOffice regarding the benefits of balancing the budget. According to the \nCBO, if Congress successfully balances the budget over the next 7 \nyears, we will experience lower interest rates and lower costs to the \nGovernment--about $170 billion over the next 7 years. It was the \nposition of the chairman--a position I strongly support--that any \nfiscal dividend resulting from balancing the budget should be given \nback to the taxpayers in the form of tax cuts.\n  One amendment offered on the Senate floor was the Feingold amendment \nto strike the budget surplus from the resolution. Instead of using the \nsurplus for more spending--as previous amendments had--this amendment \nwould have killed it outright, striking at the heart of efforts in the \nSenate to provide tax relief for American families. I opposed it for \nthat reason. Over the next 7 years, the Federal Government will spend \napproximately $12 trillion. Much of this spending will take the form of \ntransfer payments from those people who are working and paying taxes to \nthose less fortunate. I believe it is important for a compassionate \ncountry to take care of the elderly and the poor, and I support many of \nthese programs. However, I also support those families who are not \nreceiving Federal assistance but rather are working hard and paying \ntaxes. The fiscal dividend is about 1\\1/2\\ percent of total Government \nspending over the next 7 years. In my mind, this tiny surplus belongs \nto the taxpayers who make all the other Government programs possible.\n  One amendment I did support was the Hatfield amendment to restore $7 \nbillion in spending reductions to the National Institutes of Health by \ncutting all other discretionary accounts across-the-board. As Senator \nHatfield made clear during the debate, the United States is suffering \nfrom epidemics of cancer, Alzheimer's, and AIDS. The research conducted \nby the NIH is instrumental in fighting these diseases, and it is \nimportant that their efforts be fully funded.\n  Another amendment I supported was the McConnell amendment to restore \nfunding for the Appalachian Regional Commission. Under the Senate \nbudget, all funding for ARC would have been eliminated over 5 years. \nRather than eliminate the entire program, this amendment will reduce \nthe program's funding by 35 percent in 1996 and 47 percent overall. I \nbelieve it strikes a careful balance between cutting spending and \nhurting economic development in specific regions of the country. In \nrecent weeks, I have been working on a task force to determine the \nefficacy of Federal agencies. Should that effort conclude that the \nAppalachian Regional Commission is duplicative, wasteful, or has \nattained its objectives, [[Page S8126]] then my position regarding \nfunding for ARC may change.\n  One budget area where I have special concerns is education. As \nreported out by the committee, the budget reduces mandatory education \nspending by a considerable amount--and these reductions could affect \nstudent loan programs. Although I had previously supported restoring \neducation funding through offsetting spending cuts, I did not support \nany amendment that attempted to increase education spending through tax \nincreases. This opposition included both the Dodd and Kennedy \namendments. These amendments would have restored $28 billion in \neducation spending over the next 7 years by raising taxes. While the \nauthors argued that the offsetting tax increases would only come from \nthe elimination of certain tax preferences targeted at large \ncorporations, their practical effect would be to instruct the Senate \nFinance Committee to raise tax revenues by $28 billion through any \nmeans, including the elimination of tax provisions which I support, \nsuch as the home mortgage interest deduction. As I have stated \npreviously, while I am willing to establish education spending as a \npriority, I believe its enhancement should be achieved by reducing \nspending in other budget areas.\n  Similar reasoning was behind my vote against the Bradley amendment \ntargeting so-called tax expenditures. The underlying premise of this \namendment is that the Federal Government, not the taxpayer, has the \nfirst right of refusal to all income. In my judgment, the whole concept \nof tax expenditures is misguided, since the logical conclusion of the \nargument is that all income not taxed still belongs to the Government. \nI believe the real purpose behind the tax expenditure concept is to \nprovide ammunition for those Members who wish to raise\n taxes. As I have said before, I support reviewing corporate tax \nloopholes within the context of overall tax reform. However, I do not \nsupport targeting these loopholes if their result is to increase \nspending elsewhere.\n\n  One of the more positive signals coming from the budget debate was \nthe rejection, across-the-board, of numerous amendments to reduce our \ndefense budget. It is important to note that the bipartisan rejection \nof these amendments represents the Senate's recognition that investment \nin our national security is as low as it can possibly go. In my \nopinion, it is already too low to ensure the continued security of the \ncountry and, for that reason, I oppose amendments to reduce it further \nand supported efforts by Senators Thurmond and McCain to raise defense \nspending above the President's levels.\n  One extremely close vote took place on the Baucus sense of the Senate \namendment to encourage the use of the highway trust fund to support \nAmtrak. While the issue of Federal subsidies for interstate passenger \nrail service is extremely contentious and involved, using the highway \ntrust fund to support Amtrak clearly undermines the integrity of the \nfund and should be opposed. If Congress chooses to continue its support \nfor Amtrak, it should be done through general revenues and subject to \nthe same review process to which other discretionary spending is \nsubject.\n  Two substitutes were offered during debate of the budget which I \nbelieve merit comment. First, Senator Conrad offered his substitute to \nbalance the budget over 10 years without assistance of the Social \nSecurity surplus. While I applaud Senator Conrad's commitment to the \nSocial Security system, his budget falls short of the standard \nestablished by the Republican budget. Under the guise of balancing the \nbudget, this amendment is old-fashioned tax-and-spend politics.\n  The Conrad budget raises taxes by $228 billion over 10 years. We \ndon't have a budget deficit because Americans are under-taxed. We have \na deficit because the Federal Government spends too much. Yet the \nConrad budget ignores the history of over-spending by concentrating on \nthe revenue side of the ledger. At the same time, discretionary \nspending under the Conrad substitute will be $190 billion higher than \nunder the Republican budget while mandatory spending will be allowed to \ngrow at several times the rate of inflation. In other words, the Conrad \nsubstitute would allow Government spending to continue to grow \nunchecked by raising taxes on Americans--just the opposite of the \nlimited Government message sent to Washington by last November's \nelection.\n  The second substitute was offered by Senator Bradley. The Bradley \namendment balances the budget over 7 years through a combination of \nspending freezes and tax increases. It raises taxes by $197 billion \nover the next 7 years while reducing discretionary spending by $25 \nbillion. In other words, while the Bradley amendment reduces Government \ndiscretionary spending a little, it raises taxes a whole lot more. And \nwe witnessed with the earlier education amendments, many Senators still \nfind it easier to raise taxes than to cut spending.\n  Finally, Senator Bradley also offered a sense of the Senate amendment \nexpressing support for eliminating tax loopholes and using the money to \nlower individual tax rates. While I agree with the premise that our \ncurrent Tax Code is hopelessly complicated and that a major reform of \nthe Code was in order, Senator Bradley's amendment would preclude \ncertain deductions which I support. Efforts to target tax benefits at \ndepressed or blighted areas through enterprise zones--or tax free \nRenaissance Zones recently announced by Governor Engler--would not \nconform with the Bradley amendment and it jeopardizes the home mortgage \ninterest deduction that homeowners rely upon in order to make the \npayments on their homes. For those reasons, I opposed it.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/09/senate-section/article/S8125-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   RECESS UNTIL MONDAY, JUNE 12, 1995\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
