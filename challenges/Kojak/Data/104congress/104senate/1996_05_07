Mr. President, I thank the Chair and thank my good friend, \nthe distinguished Senator from Texas, for allowing me to speak for \nabout 5 minutes leading off today. Again, when we come to this time of \nthe year, America does weigh strongly on everybody's mind, because I \nrise today to celebrate tax freedom day.\n  Actually in Montana, it comes around May 3, but I did not get around \nto getting my work done on time, and I would like to talk about that \njust a little bit. The average American will work 128 days this year to \npay for the Federal, State, and local taxes and sets a new record high \nfor this country at 38.2 percent of his or her yearly income.\n  Now, think about that a little bit. We wonder why our bank accounts \ndo not grow and our savings accounts are almost nonexistent, and we \nthink about stagnation. It is not really stagnation, it is trying to \npay for this moderately huge Government that was talked about back in \nJanuary by our President who said the era of big government was over, \nand now he says ``it is kind of over.''\n  In my State of Montana, for an average family of four making around \n$39,000, $40,000 a year, to average it out, Federal taxes come to \n$7,400. Total State and local taxes are around $5,700. Mr. President, \n$13,216--and this has all been verified--is the tax burden of that \nfamily of four living in my State of Montana. One-third--one-third--of \nthe money they earn is going to the support of government. And we \nwonder where our money goes.\n  So the President's words ring sort of empty. The words do not match \nthe actions. Then we have to decide whether we want to go on with this \nkind of rhetoric, because he vetoed the balanced budget, he vetoed the \ntax cut, he vetoed welfare reform, he vetoed product liability--all \nthose contribute to a mounting, mounting tax burden. Contrary to \npopular belief, government has not always been big or moderately huge, \nas this would indicate.\n\n[[Page S4764]]\n\n  Back in 1925, freedom day was February 6. In 1945, it was April 1. \nAnd in 1965, it was April 14. On the average, since World War II, the \ndate has moved up nearly a week every decade.\n  One has to ask oneself, when does it stop? I know we work on averages \nin this body, and it seems to me that if you had one foot in a bucket \nof ice and the other in the oven, on the average you should feel pretty \ngood. But we know that does not always work, that there is somebody who \nfalls through the cracks. Basically, that is what is happening to our \nsociety today.\n  We are all very familiar with the 1993 tax increase, and now is the \ntime to give part of it back to America's working families. The Clinton \ncrunch has to come to an end, despite the rhetoric we hear out of the \nWhite House. Taxes must come down, spending must be restrained, and \ngovernment must be put on a budget, and I mean a balanced budget.\n  Now is the time to do it. With America on my mind, let us not let \nanother day be added next year to the burden of this year. Let us work \nto move it back a day or two. Let us dedicate ourselves, because there \nare a lot who think this is the most important debate of this century, \nand we need the help of the American people because our country has to \nfigure out a way to eliminate this devastating debt that we are passing \non to our young.\n  Let us put our Government back on a balanced budget. Let us make \nGovernment work for the people instead of the other way around.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] is \nrecognized for 60 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/07/senate-section/article/S4763-7", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4764-S4769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AMERICAN TROOPS IN BOSNIA\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to talk today about a matter \nthat concerns all Americans: the presence of 35,000 young American men \nand women supporting the peace implementation force in Bosnia. Those \ntroops were sent as a part of a NATO force to monitor the Bosnian peace \nagreement reached in Dayton, OH, last year. The Senate voted last \nDecember to support those troops, to provide them whatever they needed \nto do what they have been asked to do. But in the resolution submitted \nby the distinguished Republican leader, Senator Dole, and Senator \nMcCain of Arizona, the Senate also said by a margin of 69 to 30 that it \ndoes not endorse the President's decision or the agreement reached in \nDayton.\n  The House of Representatives was even more harsh. The House voted 287 \nto 141 to condemn the Dayton agreement, while expressing support for \nthe troops that have been sent on this mission.\n  There is never a doubt that we will support fully American troops \nanywhere when they are performing a mission for this country. We will \nalways be there for them. But, Mr. President, that does not mean we \ncannot question the policy, and this Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives did just that.\n  Many wanted a vote to deny the President the ability to dispatch the \ntroops by withholding the funds needed to pay for such a deployment. \nThat was not the right thing to do, and it failed, as it should have. \nBut, Mr. President, there are many good reasons why we disagreed with \nthe decision to send American troops, even while we acknowledged the \nPresident's right to do it.\n  First, we did not feel that the administration had made a compelling \ncase that there was a national security interest in Bosnia to justify \nthe deployment of tens of thousands of Americans, with the potential \nloss of American life. Mr. President, that is an essential element of \nany mission upon which we would embark with troops from our country.\n  There must be a U.S. security interest for American lives to be at \nrisk. But, more importantly, Mr. President, many of us voiced strong \nconcern that the administration lacked a strategy for removing those \ntroops once they had dug in and become part of the troubled landscape \nin the troubled country of Bosnia.\n  What made many of us particularly skeptical was the administration's \ninsistence that not only was there an exit strategy, but that the \ntroops would be able to perform their complex mission of creating two \nnations from one, patrolling rugged mountain terrain, separating \nhostile belligerents, and ending a 500-year-old civil war in just 1 \nyear.\n  In fact, Mr. President, the Dole-McCain resolution that expressed \nsupport for the troops and acknowledged the President's authority to \ndeploy them specifically noted that the Senate support was conditioned \non the return of those troops to the United States within 1 year.\n  Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues what senior administration \nofficials, including the President, assured us as we wrestled with the \nquestion of whether to support sending young Americans to Bosnia:\n  On October 13, 1995, Robert Hunter, the U.S. Ambassador to NATO, told \nthe Washington Post:\n\n       This is going to be a limited-duration operation-- 12 \n     months max. We're not going to take responsibility beyond \n     that.\n\n  On October 18, 1995, Defense Secretary William Perry and Gen. John \nShalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the House \nCommittee on National Security and the House Committee on International \nRelations:\n\n       The implementation force will complete its mission in a \n     period not to exceed 12 months. We believe this will be more \n     than adequate to accomplish the needed tasks that will allow \n     the peace to become self-sustaining. We anticipate the IFOR \n     will go in heavy and, if successful, would begin drawing down \n     significantly far in advance of the final exit date.\n\n  On October 18, 1995, Secretary of State Warren Christopher told the \nHouse Committee on National Security:\n\n       The force would have a limited mission and remain for a \n     limited period of time, approximately 1 year.\n\n  On November 28, 1995, President Clinton told the American people in a \ntelevised address:\n\n       Our Joint Chiefs of Staff have concluded that this mission \n     should--and will--take about 1 year.\n\n  Mr. President, none of these knowledgeable officials left any room \nfor doubt that the American mission in Bosnia would be limited in scope \nand duration. Specifically we were told, with no uncertainty, by \neveryone from the U.S. Ambassador to NATO, to the President of the \nUnited States, that our troops would be home within 1 year.\n  Mr. President, we now learn this is not so. December 20, 1996, was \nthe date set as the 1-year mark. That is the date that we have been \nfocusing on since the beginning of this mission. We now learn that this \nadministration has said to our allies that it intends to keep American \ntroops in Bosnia at least until early 1997 and, according to the United \nStates Commander of NATO forces, Gen. George Joulwan, maybe longer.\n  Mr. President, the reason we got into the mission in Bosnia with NATO \nis because our President told our allies that we would be there with \ntroops on the ground if there was a peace agreement. He told them that \na long time ago. Once we make a commitment to our allies, of course, \nAmerica must stand by the commitment.\n\n  But now, Mr. President, we have the dilemma of two commitments. We \nhave the President making a commitment to the American people, to \nSenator Dole, and to the troops that are there, that this would be a \nmission of 1 year. Everyone connected with this mission and with the \nleadership of this administration has repeatedly said 1 year. Now, Mr. \nPresident, we have the President making a different commitment to our \nallies, saying it is not going to be 1 year, but leaving it rather \nopen-ended, into 1997.\n  Mr. President, I want to highlight the difference between last year's \nmessage from the administration and an April 26, 1996, article in the \nWashington Post:\n\n       ``A substantial number of American troops will remain in \n     Bosnia for at least one month after the NATO-led mission ends \n     in December. In a departure from the original plan, NATO \n     commanders have decided to keep a significant force in Bosnia \n     up to the final day of the mission or one year after the \n     peace enforcement began,'' according to spokesman Kenneth \n     Bacon. Earlier officials had said the pullout would begin at \n     least a few months before the December 20 closing date in \n     order to have nearly everyone out by then. Kenneth Bacon said \n     the change in\n\n[[Page S4765]]\n\n     plans stemmed from a request by the Organization for Security \n     and Cooperation in Europe, which is assisting preparations \n     for Bosnia's elections, that NATO keep its full force there \n     until after the elections.\n\n  And, on April 30, 1996, the London Times reported:\n\n       The Clinton administration has scrapped plans to withdraw \n     its forces by the end of this year, and may maintain a \n     substantial American presence in the Balkans for months after \n     the deadline set by Congress. Only weeks ago the White House \n     repeated its promise to Republicans that the troops would be \n     back by December 20, the date agreed at Dayton for the end of \n     the NATO mission in Bosnia. The Pentagon, however, under \n     pressure from allies, international officials and its own \n     Gen. George Joulwan, has admitted that it plans to keep a \n     significant force in the region until the end of January, and \n     maybe longer.\n\n  Those are excerpts from quotes from newspapers.\n  Mr. President, this stunning reversal of a critical policy that \naffects the lives of thousands of Americans has been made in such a \ncasual way that we must ask if the administration's original commitment \nto withdraw in 1 year was a serious one. It was so casual, many people \nwere not even aware that all of a sudden this commitment that was made \nto this Congress to a December 20 deadline by which our troops would be \nout of Bosnia has now been put off, really indefinitely, into 1997.\n  The President is breaking his promise to the American people to the \nUnited States Congress, and, most importantly, to the troops in Bosnia.\n  Moreover, Senator Dole had earlier argued forcefully and persuasively \nabout arming the Bosnian Government and allowing the Bosnians to defend \nthemselves so American troops would not need to be sent in the first \nplace. This would have required lifting the U.N. arms embargo on the \nformer Yugoslavia, for which our leader argued forcefully and \npersuasively, many times for over a year on this Senate floor. We voted \nto lift the arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia so that the Bosnians \ncould arm themselves and fight to save their country.\n  Senator Dole led the fight to let the Moslems fight for their own \nfreedom with help from legitimate sources so that it would be legal to \nhelp the Bosnian people defend themselves. No Member of the Senate has \nbeen more outspoken for years about the need for the United States to \nlead our allies in establishing a policy on Bosnia that would avoid the \nneed for American troops than our leader, Bob Dole. But each time the \nCongress voted to urge the lifting of the arms embargo, the \nadministration refused to respond.\n  Now, Mr. President, in addition to the total abrogation of his word \nto the American people regarding when the troops would come home from \nBosnia, we now learn that, in fact, while President Clinton was \nstopping us from lifting the arms embargo, he was allowing another \ncountry to provide arms in violation of the embargo. Was it a \nlegitimate ally of the United States? No, Mr. President, it was not a \nlegitimate ally of the United States that was allowed to violate the \narms embargo that we in this Congress were trying to lift. No, it was \nan enemy of the United States, a terrorist country: Iran.\n  Despite widespread rumors that Iranian arms were being shipped to \nBosnia in violation of the arms embargo, an embargo this administration \nsaid we must support, and despite senior officials' strong denials, we \nlearn we were deceived. Here we have the quotes, Mr. President. On \nApril 15, 1995, a State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, told the \nLos Angeles Times, ``We do not endorse violations of U.N. embargo \nresolutions whatever. We are not violating those resolutions. We don't \nendorse anyone else who is violating them.''\n  On June 16, 1995, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said, ``I \nthink you get some instant gratification from lifting the arms embargo. \nIt is kind of an emotional luxury, but you have to ask yourself, what \nare the consequences of that?'' As late as March of this year, \nPresident Clinton himself told Congress that ``Iran continued to engage \nin activities that represent a threat to the national security, foreign \npolicy, and economy of the United States.''\n  Mr. President, despite all of those statements by senior \nadministration officials and the President himself, we have learned in \nrecent weeks that this was not the case at all. Just 3 weeks after the \nPresident's report to Congress on Iran, it has been reported that the \nadministration had given its tacit approval of the shipment by Iran, \none of America's most hostile adversaries, of weapons to the Bosnian \nMuslim government.\n  We are justified in concluding, Mr. President, that the Clinton \nadministration policy on Bosnia has been cynical. What many of us were \nadvocating for so long--arming the Bosnians and allowing them to defend \nthemselves with legitimate sales of arms by people who cared about the \npeople--was, in fact, being opposed by the administration by day, but \nby night secret arms shipments from Iran were moving forward with the \nadministration's blessing.\n  Now, Mr. President, we are faced with similar cynicism regarding the \ndeployment of American troops. Those troops are there precisely because \nthe administration refused the suggestions by Senator Dole and others \nin the Senate that arming the Bosnians and letting them fight for \nthemselves was the best way to go. Instead, the administration adopted \na half-a-loaf policy of covert arms shipments from Iran, which was too \nlittle, too late, from the wrong source.\n  As with arm sales to Bosnia, the American people have been deceived \nby the Clinton administration on the question of withdrawing American \ntroops from Bosnia. Very simply, the President made a commitment to the \nAmerican people, and he is now saying he will not honor that \ncommitment.\n  Mr. President, many in the Senate personally have opposed the \nadministration's policy on Bosnia but honored their belief that the \nPresident had the authority to deploy troops without permission from \nCongress. Many people on this floor were torn during that debate \nbecause they so violently disagreed with the policy, but they did \nbelieve that the President had the right to do it and that the troops \nneeded the support from Congress.\n\n  Our Republican leader did so at great political risk. He supported \nthe President's right to deploy troops, even though he thought it was \nwrong, but he did so only after getting a commitment from the President \nhimself that those troops would have a mission of limited duration, \nlimited scope, and they would be home within 1 year. That was the \npromise the President made to our leader.\n  We now learn this will not happen. The administration's disregard of \nits commitments to Senator Dole, to the U.S. Congress, and to the \nAmerican people amount to broken promises. Broken promises--there is no \nother way you can put it.\n  Today, Mr. President, I am going to ask the President to look at this \npolicy, which is a policy of broken promises, broken commitments, and \ncontradictory commitments to the American people and to our allies.\n  I am going to ask the President to do two things. First of all, to \nhonor his commitment to the American people about troop withdrawals \nfrom Bosnia and to tell our allies this commitment was made. If, in \nfact, he decides that he cannot keep his commitment to the American \npeople, I ask him to come back to Congress and talk to us about this, \nrather than just announcing very quietly that the troops are not going \nto be out by December 20 as promised. OK, President Clinton, if that is \nwhat you believe, come to Congress, talk to us about it, tell us why \nyou think this is necessary, and let us have the option of working with \nyou if you think you can make the case that we should be there beyond \nthe date you promised in your commitment to the American people.\n  That is what I ask the President to do today. Either keep his \ncommitment to the American people, or come to Congress and discuss it. \nMr. President, this is too important. We have a policy now in which the \nPresident is going to expand the use of our American troops beyond his \ncommitment to Senator Dole and the American people and this U.S. \nCongress. We have the second revelation that arm shipments from Iran \nwere being permitted by this administration at the same time that he \nwas keeping us in Congress from lifting the arms embargo, which we \nvoted repeatedly to do so that the Moslems in Bosnia could have arms \nfrom legitimate sources.\n  Mr. President, I just ask you, what kind of policy is that? What must \nthe\n\n[[Page S4766]]\n\npeople of the world think when our President would make commitments \nthat he does not keep and when he would keep legitimate arms sources \nfrom the Bosnian people while allowing Iran, a hostile nation to our \ncountry, a country with a background and history of terrorism against \ninnocent victims, to, in fact, violate the very arms embargo that he \nwould not let us lift? Mr. President, this is not the way our country \nshould be represented.\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 15 minutes to the Senator from Idaho, \nSenator Craig.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will not take that much time this \nmorning. I have a few moments before I have to be to another \ncommitment. Let me thank my colleague from Texas for her statement and \nfor taking out this special order.\n  Let me read two quotes that I think speak volumes about what our \nPresident has caught himself in--that is, doublespeak. Mr. President, \ntoday you are not telling the American people the truth. For the last \nseveral months, you have been caught in a very difficult and very \ndeceptive game of doublespeak.\n  Your representative, Richard Holbrooke, who immediate repudiated the \nDayton peace accord was quoted on May 3 in a Reuters article saying:\n\n       I will state flatly for the record that this policy was \n     correct--\n\n  He is referring to allowing the Iranians to move arms into the former \nYugoslavia.\n\n     and that if it hadn't taken place, the Bosnian Muslims would \n     not have survived and we would not have gotten to Dayton.\n\n  That is an absolute opposite from what our President has been telling \nus. Mr. President, that is double speak.\n  The next quote from Richard Holbrooke:\n\n       We knew that the Iranians would try to use the aid to buy \n     political influence. It was a calculated policy based on the \n     feeling that you had to choose between a lot of bad choices, \n     and the choice that was chosen kept the Sarajevo government \n     alive. But it left a problem--were the Iranians excessively \n     influential on the ground?\n\n  Mr. President, President Clinton once again was caught in double \nspeak. This Congress gave our President an option, a viable, \nresponsible, well-thought-out option, to allow the arms embargo to be \nlifted so that parity could be built on both sides. He chose not to do \nthat. He chose to openly and publicly deceive the American people.\n  Mr. President, part of the debate on the crisis in the former \nYugoslavia has been over the arms embargo, first imposed against the \nYugoslavian Government in 1991.\n  I was part of the majority in Congress that supported lifting the \narms embargo and felt it was a preferable alternative to the deployment \nof our troops to Bosnia. Along those same lines, I voted against the \nPresident's proposed deployment last year, and voted against funding \nfor that deployment.\n  Mr. President, some very disconcerting information has been coming to \nlight during the last few months. The importance of these developments \nhas led to the establishment of a select committee in the House or \nRepresentatives. Therefore, I would like to take a moment this morning \nto express some of my concerns and frustrations about the situation in \nBosnia.\n  As I mentioned, a main part of the debate on the crisis in the former \nYugoslavia has involved the arms embargo, first imposed against the \nYugoslavian Government in 1991.\n  Information continues to surface, showing that while the Congress was \nopenly debating the lifting of the arms embargo, the administration was \ngiving a green light to Iran, allowing them to circumvent the arms \nembargo.\n  Richard Holbrooke, the administration's representative who helped to \nmediate the Dayton Peace Accord, was quoted in a May 3, 1996, Reuters \narticle saying:\n\n       I will state flatly for the record that this policy was \n     correct and that if it hadn't taken place, the Bosnian \n     Muslims would not have survived and we would not have gotten \n     to Dayton.\n\n  Mr. President, I would agree with the comment made by Mr. Holbrooke. \nAllowing Iran to circumvent the arms embargo was not this \nadministration's only choice--it was certainly not a correct choice. \nThe Congress, just last year, provided President Clinton a viable \nalternative by the passage of S. 21, legislation that would have \nunilaterally lifted the U.N. arms embargo illegally enforced against \nBosnia.\n  There was ample reason to question the enforcement of the 1991 \nembargo against Bosnia. The original embargo was not imposed on Bosnia, \nbecause it did not exist in 1991. Rather, it was imposed on Yugoslavia.\n  In addition, enforcement of this embargo could arguably violate \nBosnia's right to self-defense under article 51 of the U.N. charter.\n  The legal, unilateral lifting of the arms embargo that was called for \nin S. 21, would have allowed rough parity to exist in this conflict.\n  The President chose to veto S. 21, citing concerns that it would be \nbreaking from an agreement with our allies, and diminish our \ncredibility with Europe.\n  Mr. President, the only credibility that has been diminished here has \nbeen through the administration's efforts to allow one of the strongest \nsupporters of terrorism around the world, Iran, to violate the arms \nembargo and gain a foothold in Europe.\n  In addition, Iran only provided light weaponry to the Bosnian's, \nwhich was fine for providing a little protection. However, it was not \nenough to provide the needed shift in the strategic military balance, \naltering Serbia's enormous advantage in the conflict. Therefore, even \nafter this evasion of the arms embargo had begun, thousands of Bosnians \nwere still being killed, and the Serbian forces continued to capture \nmore territory.\n  Mr. President, as we continue to see this situation unravel, we now \nface an extended deployment of our troops. After repeated assertions by \nadministration officials that our troops' deployment in the IFOR \nmission would be for only 1 year, we now are informed that time will be \nextended. On May 1, the Clinton administration endorsed a recent NATO \nrecommendation that IFOR remain at full strength to maintain peace \nuntil after the Bosnian elections.\n  Mr. President, these elections will not occur until September at the \nearliest. It is, therefore, likely that our troops will not be \nwithdrawn until January 1997.\n  Mr. President, Richard Holbrooke made another assertion about the \nadministration's decision in the May 3 reuters article, with respect to \nthe risks of dealing with Iran.\n\n       We knew that the Iranians would try to use the aid to buy \n     political influence. It was a calculated policy based on the \n     feeling that you had to choose between a lot of bad choices, \n     and the choice that was chosen kept the Sarajevo Government \n     alive. But, it left a problem--were the Iranians excessively \n     influential on the ground?\n\n  The article continues with Mr. Holbrooke claiming that this problem \nwas adequately dealt with through the negotiations of the Dayton \naccord, by including in the agreement that all foreign forces would \nhave to leave the country. This is precisely one of the problems that \nour troops have had to face: the removal of foreign forces including \nIranian forces.\n  In addition, it is my understanding that this arms transfer operation \nwas allowed to continue until January of this year--after our troops \nwere beginning to be deployed as peacekeepers in Bosnia.\n  In closing, the Iranian presence that the Clinton administration \nhelped to promote is now actively threatening the Dayton accord, the \nAmerican and NATO peacekeepers seeking to enforce it, and the military \nviability and democratic character of Bosnia itself.\n  Mr. President, this situation needs to be addressed, and our troops \nneed to be brought home.\n  I thank my colleague from Texas for taking out this special order. I \nhope the select committee in the House will thoroughly investigate what \nthis President is failing to do in foreign policy.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nprivilege of the floor be granted to Mike\n\n[[Page S4767]]\n\nMontelongo, of my staff, during this period of morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to talk for a minute about the \nimportance of arming and training the Bosnians.\n  One of the commitments that the President made to Senator Dole and \nSenator McCain was to arm and train the Moslems. I want to read from \nthe Dole floor speech of November 30, 1995. He said:\n\n       What is needed is a concrete effort, led by the United \n     States, to arm and train the Bosnians. This effort should not \n     be contingent on so-called ``builddown provisions'' in the \n     Dayton agreement. I understand administration officials said \n     this morning that the U.S. or NATO would not be involved in \n     enabling Bosnia to defend itself.\n       In my view, it is an abdication of responsibility to rely \n     on unspecified third countries to create the conditions that \n     will allow withdrawal of American forces. The sooner we start \n     to enable Bosnia to defend itself, the sooner U.S. forces can \n     come home. In my view, the definition of a success of this \n     deployment must include a real end to the war. That is only \n     possible with the creation of stable military balance which \n     enables Bosnia to defend itself. Anything less simply exposes \n     American forces to great risk in order to monitor a temporary \n     interlude in the fighting.\n\n  That is what Senator Dole said on the floor on November 30, 1995. \nBoth he and Senator McCain repeatedly talked about the importance of \nthat element. It is absolutely true. I have been to Bosnia twice in the \nlast 8 or 9 months, and I have seen what the three warring factions are \ndoing and what their relative strengths are. There is a strong Croatia; \nthere is a strong Serb force in Bosnia; there is a good, strong force \nof Moslems, but they are underarmed and undertrained.\n  To be very practical, Mr. President, any reader of military history \nor, indeed, history of the world, knows that a lasting peace is best \nkept with strength. The parity of strength among the three parties will \ngive Bosnia the very best chance for peace that it could possibly have. \nThe reverse is also true. If we do not strengthen the Bosnian Moslems, \nthey could be overrun by either of the other two stronger parties. That \ncould happen because we have not kept our commitment.\n  Mr. President, if we want to have a lasting impact on this country, \nwith the vast amount of resources, human and monetary, which our \ncountry has put forward already, we must take the last step. This \nadministration is not doing it. There is no large-scale effort to arm \nand train the Moslems, which was a promise that President Clinton made \nto Senator Dole and to this Congress. It was a promise made.\n  Mr. President, that is the key for a lasting cease-fire and the \npossibility for lasting peace in Bosnia. There must be rough parity \namong the three parties. Right now, we are almost halfway into the IFOR \nmission, the NATO mission, of which this country is a part, and we have \nyet to see a real effort in arming and training the Moslems.\n  Now, one of the reasons given, Mr. President, is that the Iranian \ncontingency has not left Bosnia, has not left Sarajevo. Well, Mr. \nPresident, why have the Iranians not left Sarajevo?\n  Could it be because Iran was the one country that violated the arms \nembargo to help the Bosnian Moslems with arms in their time of need?\n  This should come as no surprise. This Congress spoke forcefully time \nand time again: lift the arms embargo. Let arms from legitimate sources \ngo into that country and help those people fight for themselves. But \nthis administration continued to refuse to allow that to happen, and so \nthere was one country that provided the arms. And we now learn that \nthis administration knew and did not object to the Iranians providing \nthose arms, in violation of the U.N. embargo, which the administration \nrefused to let Congress lift.\n  Mr. President, it is a botched policy, and I would call today on the \nPresident of the United States to say just what his policy is. Where is \nthe integrity of the policy of this country when two promises that were \nvery important have been broken: That we would not violate the arms \nembargo despite repeated attempts by Congress to lift it legitimately, \nand that our troops would go in with a purpose of separating the \nwarring factions and leave December 20--two commitments that we now see \nare being broken?\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Georgia has come to the floor, \nand I am happy to yield up to 10 minutes to my colleague from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell] is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to support the admirable efforts \nby the Senator from Texas who has come to the floor this morning to \nraise and bring attention to a subject that needs considerable \nattention.\n  Last year, when we were debating the entire question about whether to \nsend United States troops on the ground in Bosnia there was much \ndebate--hearings before the Armed Services Committee, hearings before \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, of which I am a member. General \nShalikashvili, Secretary Perry, and others tried to sort out what \nshould and should not happen.\n  For one, I never believed that the United States should bear the \namount of responsibility it did in Bosnia. I felt that it was a \nEuropean theater, that the Europeans should have been the predominant \nforce, and that the U.S. support, which should have been there, should \nhave been just that, in support of a European initiative. I have always \nbeen worried about this--why around the world when we have a real \nproblem; it is in the European theater; the Europeans cannot work it \nout, so we will send in Uncle Sam.\n  I think it is a bad precedent to set. But the President made that \ndecision, and from that point forward, of course, all of us have been \nunanimous in trying to do everything we can to make certain that our \nsoldiers, our men and women, have every support they need.\n  But again, the idea that the European theater cannot work it out so \nthat the United States has to be the one that leads the way I think \nsets a bad precedent, not only in terms of who bears the responsibility \nbut it would be a little bit like the United Kingdom working out Haiti. \nI do not think in anybody's mind the leading force in Haiti would have \nbeen the United Kingdom or France. It was in our hemisphere. It was our \nback door, and we have borne the brunt of that situation. Here we are \nin the underbelly of Europe, and we are bearing the brunt of it again.\n  In addition to, I think, setting a political precedent that could \nlead to problems in the future, let us just look at the financial \nramifications of it. The United States, which is now the single world \npower, in a period of enormous domestic financial pressure cannot be \nthe ultimate financial resource in resolving these world conflicts. And \nthe cost of the operation in Bosnia has been and continues to be \nenormous. The effect of that is to squeeze training, squeeze logistical \nsupport, and squeeze research and development in our own standing \nmilitary. These vast sums of money going into the peacekeeping \noperations put enormous pressure on the ultimate mission of our own \nmilitary, which is to defend the integrity and the shores of the United \nStates.\n  At the time we were discussing all these questions, Secretary Perry \ncame before our Foreign Relations Committee, and in testimony before \nthe Foreign Relations Committee Secretary Perry indicated that the \nmaximum duration of the U.S. commitment would be 1 year. And I can \nremember on the lips of virtually every member of the committee was the \nassertion or the worry, the anxiety that there would be mission creep; \nthat we would get into nation building; that we would begin to assume \nthe responsibility of rebuilding this poor and war-torn country and \ncircumstance. And there was worry because of the ethnic divisions that \nin 1 year how would all that be quelled. But the assurances from the \nadministration, the assurances from Secretary Perry were that we would \nnot be in a mission of nation building; it was a military mission, as \nsuggested by the Senator from Texas, and that it would be 1 year and \nthat would have to suffice. That was the U.S. commitment.\n  As the Senator from Texas has suggested this morning and has read \nsome of the quotes of the London Times of April 30:\n\n       The Clinton administration has scrapped plans to withdraw \n     its forces by the end of the year.\n\n  And we are beginning to hear pleas from the European theater and \nsuggestions that, well, we maybe cannot conclude this at the end of the \nyear, and,\n\n[[Page S4768]]\n\nyes, maybe we will be involved in other activities other than the \ninitial military mission of separating the warring parties.\n  That suggestion leaves the American people once again unclear as to \nhow to respond to a Presidential commitment. You go to the American \npeople and say we are going to send your sons and daughters over there \nbut they are only going to be there a year. You come to the Congress. \nYou say we are only going to go for 1 year. We are going to have a very \nnarrow, very defined mission.\n  When we began to discuss an exit strategy, it was quelled in a minute \nbecause the administration said the exit strategy was we are out of \nthere in a year. And now with the slippage of time, we begin to \nundermine those commitments. Not only does that leave the American \npeople, not only does it leave their Representatives, the Congress of \nthe United States, unclear as to just where we are and where this all \nleads, but it is almost a certainty to mean more resources, more \ndollars.\n  What that means is more pressure on the principal mission of the \nmilitary, more pressure on the budget, more pressure on the funds \nnecessary to train American soldiers, more pressure on the budget to \nenter into research and development to keep us the technological \nmilitary we displayed in the Persian Gulf--keep it at the edge.\n  We have spent the last 2 years talking about the financial dilemma in \nAmerica. We fought for balanced budgets. We have eliminated programs. \nWe have fought through the 1996 budget, and now we will be into the \n1997 budget, trying to save billions of dollars in order to keep the \ncountry financially healthy, because at the end of the day, without a \nhealthy Nation, we cannot fulfill our obligations at home or abroad.\n\n  So those financial questions must be at the core of decisions we make \nabout where we put those resources and how long we can suffer those \nresources being spent. That was the worry when this debate began, that \nthe peacekeeping missions were putting too much pressure on the \nfundamental mission of the military. Here we are, already beginning to \ntake those initial promises to the American people, the initial \npromises to the Congress, and you get this fudging, this fuzzy look \nhere.\n  I think the Senator from Texas has been absolutely correct in calling \non the administration to clarify to the people and to the Congress that \nit is going to adhere to the promises made when this mission began, \nthat it is going to withdraw at the time it said, that it is not going \nto engage in mission creep, and we are not going to use the U.S. \nmilitary components to be engaged in social rebuilding of the war-torn \ncountry. I reiterate, it is a good time to reassess the fundamental \nresponsibility of the United States as an ally and in support of NATO, \nbut at the same time acknowledging that the final responsibility for \nthe European theater rests with the Europeans.\n  Mr. President, I see my 10 minutes has expired, and I yield back to \nthe Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized for the remainder of her 60 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we have been talking for the last 45 \nminutes about this administration's Bosnia policy. I would just sum it \nup with ``promises made, promises broken.''\n  This administration promised: On December 20, 1996, American troops \nwould be gone from Bosnia. The second promise was that the arms embargo \nwould not be lifted by the President, despite repeated attempts by \nCongress to do so. He refused to lift the arms embargo so that \nlegitimate sources could provide arms for Bosnians to fight for \nthemselves and their country and their freedom, despite the fact they \nbegged us in this Congress to do so. I will never forget the poignant \ntestimony of then-Vice President Ganic, who said, ``Let us die fighting \nfor our freedom. We are dying anyway. Help us die for a cause.''\n  But at the same time the administration was saying we are not going \nto allow legitimate sources of arms for the Moslems. Instead, according \nto news reports, this administration did not object to arms sales from \nanother source which was not legitimate, Iran.\n  What is the result of that? The result is the Iranian mujaheddin is \nstill in Sarajevo. Significant arming and training of the Moslems has \nyet to begin, and the excuse used is the Iranians are still in \nSarajevo, despite the fact that in the Dayton accords they were to have \nbeen expelled from Bosnia. And the result is that the December 20 \ndeadline is not going to be met.\n  So we have an administration that would not come to the American \npeople and state a policy that the American people could count on and \nthat our allies and our enemies would know would stay in place. That is \nthe result. The issue of arming and training the Moslems was a key part \nof the negotiations between Senator Dole and the President when we were \ntrying to support the President's right to deploy even as we were \ndisagreeing with the policy of deployment.\n  I want to quote from Senator Dole's statement on the floor, again, \nNovember 30, 1995:\n\n       In my view, the definition of success of this deployment \n     must include a real end to the war that is only possible with \n     the creation of a stable military balance which enables \n     Bosnia to defend itself. Anything less simply exposes \n     American forces to great risks in order to monitor a \n     temporary interlude in the fighting. In other words, I guess \n     if they all came home next year there might be a temporary \n     interlude to get us through the November activities of 1996, \n     and I am not certain it would last very long.\n\n  Senator McCain, November 30, 1995, in his statement on the floor:\n\n       Further, we must ensure that the goals of their mission are \n     clear and achievable and will justify to some extent the \n     risks we will incur. A clear exit strategy is not time-based \n     but goal-based. We must ensure that the peace we enforce for \n     12 months has a realistic prospect to endure in the 13th, \n     14th, 15th month, and hopefully for years beyond that. \n     Essential to that goal is a stable military balance. To \n     achieve that balance, we will have to see to it that the \n     Bosnian Federation has the means and the training to provide \n     for its own defense from aggression after we have withdrawn. \n     Therefore, I believe our authorization of this deployment \n     must be conditioned on the concrete assurances that the \n     United States will do whatever is necessary, although without \n     using our soldiers who are part of the implementation force, \n     to ensure that the Bosnians can defend themselves at the end \n     of our mission.\n\n  It was clear from Senator Dole and Senator McCain that it was a \ncondition of this Senate that the Moslems be armed and trained, to \ncreate a stable military balance. The President wrote a letter \nconfirming that. The President said:\n\n       In the view of my military advisers, this requires \n     minimizing the involvement of U.S. military personnel. But we \n     expect that some individual military officers, for example, \n     working in OSD, DSAA, or other agencies, will be involved in \n     planning this effort. I agree that maintaining flexibility is \n     important to the success of the effort to achieve a stable \n     military balance within Bosnia. But I will do nothing that I \n     believe will endanger the safety of American troops on the \n     ground in Bosnia. I am sure you will agree this is my primary \n     responsibility.\n\n  That is giving the President his due. We agree with that. The \nPresident went on to say in his letter to Senator Dole and Senator \nMcCain:\n\n       I have given you my word that we will make certain that the \n     Bosnian Federation will receive the assistance necessary to \n     achieve an adequate military balance when IFOR leaves. I \n     intend to keep it.\n\n  That is what the President said in writing, December 12, 1995. He \nsaid the Americans would not be leading that effort, but that we would \nmake sure that it would happen. ``I intend to keep my word.'' That is \nwhat he said. It was a condition. It was a condition for the approval \nof the President's right to deploy.\n  We have a policy. We have a promise that is being broken. Either the \nPresident must keep his commitment to the American people that he will \nwithdraw the troops by December 20, as he promised, or the President \nshould come back to Congress and tell us why he is breaking his word.\n  Why does he feel it is necessary to do this? I think he owes us that \nmuch. I think he owes the American people that much, and I think he \nowes our troops on the ground that much.\n  Mr. President, I think it is time for this administration to \nunderstand the importance of keeping a promise, whether it is to the \nAmerican people or to our allies or in general to the world, so that \neveryone knows that if we say we are going to do something, we will do \nit. But telling the American people we will withdraw troops by December\n\n[[Page S4769]]\n\n20 and telling our allies that we will leave troops on the ground into \n1997 is not keeping the integrity of the American word, and I think we \nhave the right to expect that from our President who is representing \nour country.\n  This is a serious issue, and I hope the President will address it \nwith integrity.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back the remainder of my time, and \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, until 10:30.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/07/senate-section/article/S4764-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4769-S4770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GAS TAX REDUCTION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have noted the last several days a \nnumber of people coming to the floor to talk about tax freedom day. I \nnoted this morning on the television programs that the majority leader, \nSenator Dole, was talking about bringing a vote to the floor of the \nSenate, perhaps today, he said, to repeal the 4.3-cent gas tax or \nreduce the gas tax by 4.3 cents.\n  I will make a couple of observations about those issues.\n  First, tax freedom day. The suggestion, I guess, by those who talk \nabout tax freedom day and the date beyond which they now can spend \nmoney on themselves, the suggestion is, I guess, that the money that is \nspent by them to build their children's schools, to pay for the police \nforce, to pay for the Defense Department to defend our country, to \nprovide for the resources for Social Security and Medicare, which \nincidentally are the four largest areas of public spending--schools, \nhealth care, defense, and local policing functions--the implication is \nsomehow that those are not investments or those are not expenditures \nthat count.\n\n  I think a lot of people would say that the payment of money to fund a \nschool system to be able to send your children to good schools does \ncount and does matter. That is an investment in your family. I just \nobserve that some taxes are levied in order to do things we must do \ntogether as a country--educate our kids, build roads, defend our \ncountry, provide for the general welfare such as Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, and so on. Some of them, I think, deserve a more \nthoughtful response than the implication somehow that it is just money \nthat goes into some dark hole. Much of that is an investment in our \nchildren, an investment in security, an investment in health care.\n  Having said all that, would we like to see lower taxes in our \ncountry? Yes. Would we like to find a way to reduce the tax burden? \nSure. We have a circumstance in this country now where we spend more \nmoney than we take in; 2 years ago, 2\\1/2\\ years ago, in 1993, we \npassed a bill on the floor of the Senate by one vote to reduce the \nFederal deficit. It was not easy to do. We only passed it by one vote \non a strictly partisan vote. We did not get even one vote from the \nother side of the aisle by accident. Normally you think somebody makes \na mistake, but we did not get one vote by accident. A group of us \npassed this piece of legislation, and 2\\1/2\\ years later the deficit is \nreduced by half. The deficit is half of what it was nearly 3 years ago.\n  Now I am glad we did that. It was not popular. The popular thing was \nto vote ``no.'' Certainly it was not popular to vote ``yes'' to cut \nspending and increase some taxes, but we did it. I am glad we did it. \nThe deficit is down as a result of it.\n  Now, what has happened in the last number of weeks is gasoline prices \nhave spiked up by 20 to 25 cents a gallon. Gasoline prices spike up, \nand then we have people come to the floor of the Senate and say, well, \nour solution to that is to reduce the gas tax by 4.3 cents. There is \nreally no connection, of course, but that is the solution. It is kind \nof like a person driving down the road in a vehicle and it overheats \nand steam starts flooding from under the hood and the driver pulls off \nthe road, gets out, opens the trunk, and changes the tire. There is no \nrelationship between the 20- or 25-cent-per-gallon spike in gas taxes \nand the 4.3-cent gas tax reduction that is being proposed. It is purely \npolitical. In fact, it is trotted out here on tax day, I guess it is \ncalled tax freedom day. It is trotted out as a purely political hood \nornament. That is fine. You have the right to do it.\n\n  My point is this: When we consider the issue of the 4.3-cent-per-\ngallon reduction in the gas tax, I intend to offer an amendment here in \nthe Senate that asks the question, whose pocket is this money going to \ngo in? If you are going to relieve the oil industry of collecting 4.3 \ncents a gallon in gasoline taxes, who ends up getting the cash? I said \nthe other day in this country there are a lot of pockets. There are big \npockets, there are small pockets, there are high pockets, there are low \npockets. The question is, who will pocket the reduction in the gasoline \ntax? I will offer an amendment that says, if you reduce the gasoline \ntax, we should make sure it goes into the right pocket, the pocket of \nthe consumer, the driver, the taxpayer. If we do not pass an amendment \nlike that that provides the guarantee, guess who pockets the reduction \nin the gas tax? The oil industry.\n  Does anybody here honestly think that if we reduce the gas tax by 4.3 \ncents a gallon and do not provide an ironclad guarantee that it goes \nback to the consumer, does anybody believe that the oil industry will \nnot grab that money? It is cash in their pockets. They are the ones who \nset the price of gasoline. We can have people boast on the floor of the \nSenate about reducing the gas tax. It will not mean a thing to drivers \nand consumers unless they end up paying 4.3 cents less a gallon than \nthey now pay.\n  I say to the majority leader and others, if you intend to bring a \nbill to the floor of the Senate to reduce the gas tax and increase the \ndeficit, make sure you provide for the allowance for amendments, \nbecause some of us will insist on our right to offer amendments. If you \ndevelop procedures that prohibit us from offering amendments to make \nsure that the reduction in the gas tax goes in the right pockets, then \nwe intend to slow this Senate down until we have an opportunity to \noffer amendments of that type.\n  I understand it is a Presidential election. It is an even-numbered \nyear. When the Framers wrote the Constitution of America, they created \na miracle. At least old Claude Pepper, the former member of this body \nand the House of Representatives, used to call it a miracle--a miracle \nthat every even-numbered year the American people are able to grab the \nAmerican steering wheel and make adjustments to where the country is \nheaded. They have the right to grab the steering wheel and make the \nadjustments. It is an election year, an even-numbered year in America. \nThere are lots of politics floating back and forth here and there; the \nonly time in our country's history, I believe, where the majority \nleader of the Senate is running against an incumbent President. I have \ngreat respect for both people. But the floor of the Senate is not, of \ncourse, a political party convention auditorium. It is the U.S. Senate. \nIs there an inclination to engage in a great deal of politics here on \nthe floor of the Senate on behalf of both sides? Yes. That has always \nbeen the case. Will there be more of an inclination now in the coming \nweeks to do that? I am sure. Is the gas tax reduction that is being \nproposed political? Obviously.\n\n  Someone wanting to know what caused a 20- or 25-cents-per-gallon \nrunup in gas prices at the pumps might have said, well, try to \ninvestigate what happened. Ask the Justice Department to investigate \nthe oil industry to ask what happened to the price of gas. Who did it? \nWhy? The President asked the Justice Department to do that. Some saw it \nas an opportunity to say, ``Well, come to the floor of the Senate and \ntalk about the 4.3-cent gas tax that was added in 1993 as part of the \ndeficit reduction act.'' That is politics. That is fine. They could \nhave said, how about the other 10-cent-per-gallon gas tax that was \nadded, supported by the majority leader and others here in this body? \nThere has been 10 cents supported previously, so, make it 14.3 cents, \nas long as it is a political issue. Do the whole thing.\n\n[[Page S4770]]\n\n  My point is this: Do not do anything to it unless you guarantee \nAmerican taxpayers and drivers that they will get the benefit. There is \nnot any way that we guarantee drivers in this country they will get the \nbenefit of lower gasoline taxes at the pump if we are not allowed to \noffer and if the Senate does not pass the amendment I have described. \nThe amendment is very simple: It would require certification by the oil \ncompanies that they have passed along this reduction in the gas tax and \na lower pump price, subject to criminal penalties and subject to \nenforcement by the appropriate people in the Federal Government. We can \ntalk about gas taxes until we are blue in the face and you can repeal \ngas taxes from now until next month. But if you do not guarantee that \ndrivers in this country get the benefit, guess who will walk off into \nthe sunset with bulging pockets? The oil company.\n  When I heard this morning the majority leader say we will have a vote \non that today, first of all, I do not think we will because it would \nrequire unanimous consent to have a vote on the reduction in the gas \ntax. But, second, I say to Members on the other side who are in charge \nof planning the activities of the Senate on the floor, when you decide \nto have a vote, we will insist that you give us the opportunity to \noffer an amendment that guarantees the drivers and the taxpayers in \nthis country, not the oil industry, get the benefit of the reduction in \nthe gas tax.\n  One additional point, and it is probably the most important point. We \nhave also talked on the floor of the Senate about the minimum wage. The \ngas tax is about $25 or $27 a year in benefits if the consumers get the \nbenefit, and they will not unless my amendment is passed. The minimum \nwage means about $1,800 a year to those folks who are out there, 40 \npercent of whom are working as a sole breadwinner on minimum wage, \ntrying to make ends meet, having had their wage frozen for 5 years. We \nare simply saying we want an opportunity, as well, to address the \nminimum wage issue. We think the minimum wage should be adjusted for \nthose folks.\n  We have been told that, well, there will be some point at which we \nwill vote on that. We also ask that when the gas tax reduction is \nbrought to the floor of the Senate, we have an opportunity to consider, \nas well, in those circumstances, a reasonable adjustment of the minimum \nwage.\n  So those are the issues that we are going to ask be addressed by the \nmajority leader and other Members of the Senate in the coming couple of \ndays as we discuss these issues.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/07/senate-section/article/S4769-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO THE LATE WALTER S. MONTGOMERY, SR.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, if the Palmetto State is famous for \ntextiles, then Mr. Walter S. Montgomery, Sr., is one of a handful of \nSouth Carolinians whose name is synonymous with that industry. Without \nquestion, he is a man who has left his mark on our State and Nation, \nand it is with great sadness that I rise today to note his recent \npassing.\n  ``Mr. Walter,'' as he was affectionately known by his friends and \nemployees, died late last month, ending what was a lifelong commitment \nto service and industry. From the time he took over his family's \ntextile mill to the day he died, Walter Montgomery worked hard to \nadvance textile manufacturing, to strengthen the South Carolina \neconomy, and to improve the quality of life for the South Carolina \nUpstate, especially his beloved hometown of Spartanburg.\n  Known as a benevolent boss, Mr. Walter would stroll the floors of his \nfactories in his shirtsleeves, supervising operations and talking with \nhis employees. His interest in those who worked for him extended beyond \nthe plant walls, and he was known to spend afternoons on the front \nporches of the homes of Spartan Mills workers, passing the time and \ngetting to know those in his employ. Additionally, Walter Montgomery \nworked hard to create a job place that was modern, clean, and safe, a \nfar cry from the old style mills of the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n  Walter Montgomery joined the family run Spartan Mills shortly after \nhis graduation from the Virginia Military Institute and eventually \nbecame its president and chairman of the board. Through his hard work, \ndetermination, and business acumen, Spartan Mills grew from 1 plant to \n10, and became the largest employer in Spartanburg County. A young and \ndynamic executive, Mr. Montgomery became a force in the national \ntextile industry and held leadership positions with the South Carolina \nTextile Manufacturers Association, the J.E. Sirrine Foundation, the \nInstitute of Textile Technology, and the American Textile Manufacturers \nAssociation. His professional accomplishments earned him recognitions \nfrom the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, which named him \nBusinessman of the Year; and from the ATMI, their organization's \nprestigious and coveted Samuel Slater Award.\n  Equally important to the contributions Mr. Montgomery made to \nbusiness was the role he filled as a civic leader. Spartanburg and the \nUpstate Region benefited handsomely from the efforts of Mr. Montgomery \nwho helped to establish the University of South Carolina at \nSpartanburg; served as a trustee of the Spartanburg Music Foundation \nand the Spartanburg Historical Society; and, organized the Spartanburg \nCounty Foundation. He also served for 55 years on the board of trustees \nat Converse College, was a booster for educational causes, and was an \nactive leader in the United Way. For these undertakings, and many \nothers, Mr. Montgomery was awarded the Order of the Palmetto; inducted \ninto the South Carolina Business Hall of Fame; was awarded three \nhonorary degrees; and, was recognized with almost countless citations \nfrom various business and community groups.\n  Mr. President, Walter Montgomery was the type of person that any \ncommunity or State would be fortunate to have as one of its citizens. I \ncan think of no more fitting tribute to Walter than the fact that he \nwas so well thought of, that hundreds of people came to pay their last \nrespects to this man. As a matter of fact, on the day of his funeral, \nthe Episcopal Church of the Advent was packed to capacity and \nloudspeakers had to be placed outside the church in order for mourners \nto be able to hear the service. While we will all miss Walter, I hope \nthat others will honor his legacy by trying to match the example he set \nfor service to business and community. I join a long list of people who \nexpress their sympathy and condolences to the family of Mr. Walter \nMontgomery, including his sisters, Kate Montgomery Ward and Lucile \nMontgomery Cart; his son, Mr. Walter Montgomery, Jr.; his daughter, \nRose M. Johnston; and his many grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. \nThese people are kin to a man who was one of a kind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/07/senate-section/article/S4770-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4770-S4773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           OMNIBUS PARKS BILL\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, last Wednesday, the Senate passed H.R. \n1296, the omnibus parks bill, by unanimous consent. I recognize that \nthis legislation had indeed gone through the mill. However, I am \npleased that we reached this agreement and passed this important bill \nwith strong bipartisan support.\n  In particular, I want to express my strong support for one title of \nthis bill, the Snowbasin Land Exchange Act, which was included within \nthe bill.\n  This measure contains provisions that will enable the U.S. Forest \nService and the Sun Valley Co. to prepare the Snowbasin Ski Resort, \nwhich is located 40 miles north of Salt Lake City, for the major alpine \nskiing events of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games to be held in Utah. It \nalso concludes a land exchange process that began more than 11 years \nago.\n  I want to acknowledge the efforts of Senators Dole and Murkowski, who \nhave worked diligently to forge this package so that this particular \nmeasure could pass the Senate and move forward in the legislative \nprocess.\n  As my colleagues know, the International Olympic Committee selected \nSalt Lake City to host the 2002 Winter\n\n[[Page S4771]]\n\nOlympic Games last June. I was honored to be present in Budapest when \nthis announcement was made.\n  Snowbasin, which is owned by the Sun Valley Co., was identified as \nthe site of six major Olympic downhill and slalom ski events. It was \nselected due to its magnificent mountain with ideal terrain, elevation, \nand techincal difficulty for Olympic competition.\n  It is estimated that Olympic racers will reach speeds exceeding 80 \nmiles per hour in the first 5 seconds of competition on the Snowbasin \ndownhill course, a course that has been designed by Bernard Russi of \nSwitzerland, an Olympic medalist and internationally recognized Alpine \ncourse designer.\n  In order to accommodate the planned events at Snowbasin, which are \nestimated to have a television audience of nearly 3 billion people \nworldwide, major new skiing, visitor, and support facilities will have \nto be constructed at Snowbasin. Some of these facilities will be \nconstructed on the ski mountain, while other facilities are needed at \nthe base of the mountain.\n  Failure to pass the provisions that are included in this bill for \nSnowbasin would have greatly jeopardized the success of the 2002 \nOlympic Games and, in general, sullied the reputation of U.S. Olympic \nhosts before an international audience. So I appreciate the support of \nmy colleagues for these provisions.\n  My colleagues should understand that this legislation is a land \nexchange--not a giveaway. The legislation exchanges 1,320 acres of \nnational forest land at the base of Snowbasin to the Sun Valley Co. \nThis transfer will allow development of base facilities that are needed \nfor the Olympics.\n  These facilities include a new access road, the Olympic stadium and \ngateway, parking, day lodges, restaurants, and other support buildings. \nThese facilities will greatly increase services and amenities to the \npublic during the Olympics. They will also become the nucleus of a \nworld-class competitive venue at Snowbasin in future years.\n  It is altogether consistent with Forest Service policy that base \nlands at ski areas be privatized for development. As my colleagues are \nwell aware, land exchanges have been routinely utilizied for this \npurpose.\n  In return for the 1,320 acres, the Forest Service will receive more \nthan 4,100 acres of private lands with outstanding environmental, \nrecreational, and other values. Each of these lands has been identified \nby Forest Service officials as highly desirable for acquisition to \nbenefit the public and the long-term management purposes of the Forest \nService in northern Utah.\n  Some of this acreage is immediately adjacent to Snowbasin; another \nparcel is on the outskirts of the city of Ogden. In fact, one of the \nparcels--Lightning Ridge--will open access to thousands of acres of \nForest Service land that is currently inaccessible to the public.\n\n  These are precisely the types of public benefits that should be \nrealized in land exchanges. The new Olympic quality recreational \nopportunities added at Snowbasin, coupled with major additions to the \nnational forest, clearly make the exchange a win-win for the public.\n  When completed, the land exchange will add over 4 square miles of \nland to the National Forest System in Utah.\n  Mr. President, there has been considerable discussion on this bill \nregarding the so-called sufficiency language in the bill that exempts \nthe initial portions of development at Snowbasin from certain Federal \nenvironmental laws. Let me discuss this for my colleagues.\n  Once the land exchange is completed, the ski mountain will remain as \nNational Forest System land. In order to prepare the ski mountain for \nthe Olympic events, numerous modifications are needed. These \nmodifications are referred to in the overall development plan for \nSnowbasin as phase I and relate to the race courses for the competitors \nas well as needed amenities for the public.\n  These items include new chair lifts, new and expanded courses, \nhelicopter pads for medivac purposes, snowmaking, safety netting, and a \nmountain restaurant for food and warming purposes. It is estimated that \nat least three summer construction seasons will be needed to construct \nthese facilities.\n  Moreover, to enable ski competitors to race the mountain prior to the \nOlympics, and to test the new facilities for safety and other purposes, \ninternational skiing events have been scheduled at Snowbasin beginning \nin 1999.\n  I hope my colleagues can see that we must immediately begin the \nprocess of preparing Snowbasin for important Olympic and pre-Olympic \nevents.\n  To accomplish this goal, Congress needs to provide general approval \nto facilities that need to be constructed on national forest lands at \nSnowbasin for the Olympics, to put the construction of these facilities \non a timetable, and to protect the decisions of the Forest Service \nduring this process from appeals and lawsuits. Without such action, \nconstruction of these facilities could be delayed for years. \nRegrettably, this type of delay is precisely what is currently being \nexperienced at Snowbasin.\n  A 1994 Forest Service decision to allow construction of a small chair \nlift and new ski run on the mountain has been appealed and litigated \nand is now before a Federal district court in Salt Lake City. \nConstruction of the lift has already been delayed for 2 years and the \nmatter could remain in the courts well into the future. Therefore, this \nlegislation allows the construction of traditional mountain facilities \nat Snowbasin that are needed for important Olympic and pre-Olympic \nevents.\n  However, my colleagues should realize that over the years, Snowbasin \nhas been subject to numerous environmental studies and reviews. In \nfact, in testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Forests and Public \nLand Management, I displayed a huge stack of these studies.\n  Since 1990, the Forest Service has prepared, among many items, an \nenvironmental impact statement and an environmental analysis on base \nmountain lands at Snowbasin. The public was fully involved in the \ndevelopment of these documents.\n  The Snowbasin master plan, referenced in the legislation, has been \ndeveloped taking into full account the environmental considerations \nnoted in these studies. Also, the Sun Valley Company has frequently \nconsulted with the Forest Service to ensure that environmental aspects \nof the land exchange are properly considered.\n  Our legislation directs the Secretary of Agriculture to impose \nconstruction and operation conditions on the Sun Valley Co. that are \nconsistent with Forest Service policies to protect forest resources. \nFurther, the Forest Service is empowered to make any changes to the \nfacilities to protect public health and safety, including water \nquality.\n  I think it is also safe to say that no one would want to visit this \narea if it were an environmental wreck. There is clearly an economic \nincentive to doing this the right way. Responsible development of this \nland is necessary any way you look at it.\n\n  Also, we learned from testimony provided by the members of the Salt \nLake organizing committee that one of the reasons Snowbasin was \nselected as the site for the Olympic downhill races was to keep Olympic \ndownhill events from being conducted in the environmentally sensitive \ncanyon areas immediately adjacent to Salt Lake City.\n  I am pleased to note that the significant addition of land to the \nNational Forest System resulting from this legislation will be \naccomplished without having to spend scarce land and water conservation \nfund dollars.\n  Moreover, our legislation ensures that an equal value exchange in \nevery respect will be conducted, and there will not be a giveaway of \nany kind to the Sun Valley Company. Instead, the Sun Valley Company \nwill assume the economic risks and costs of preparing Snowbasin to the \nhighest of Olympic standards for the 2002 Winter Games.\n  Mr. President, I again want to extend my sincere thanks to each \nmember of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee--all of \nwhom endorsed this legislation. The efforts of Senators Murkowski, \nCraig, and Bumpers, and my Utah colleague, Senator Bennett, have helped \nto perfect this bill and move it forward.\n  Again, I want to thank the majority leader for his leadership in \nsolving the impasse that had developed over the earlier version of the \nomnibus parks bill.\n  Having said that, I must admit my disappointment that one title of \nthe original package, the Utah wilderness\n\n[[Page S4772]]\n\nbill, has been deleted from the bill. I would have preferred that the \nSenate adopt this measure as well, but I know a roadblock when I see \none. I will continue to work on those provisions that could not be \nincluded in this package.\n  However, everyone in this chamber should know that this is a \ntemporary setback for our Utah wilderness bill. Our bill is not dead, \nas many have said or wished. I am just as committed today as I was \nduring the recent filibuster to see this body pass legislation that \nresolves this 17-year-old problem that has plagued our State.\n  As I mentioned, Senator Dole has demonstrated tremendous leadership \nto forge the compromise that allowed the omnibus bill to pass, and his \nsuggestion for a temporary detour around the matter of Utah Wilderness \nand Sterling Forest enables the other important provisions of the \nomnibus parks bill to move forward, including the Snowbasin exchange. I \ncommend him for that.\n  Mr. President, Snowbasin will be an electrifying site for the \nprestigious skiing events of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. The huge \nchallenge that Snowbasin will present to the international competitors \nwill be a true test of their Olympic ability. America is fortunate to \nbe selected as the host nation for these games, and Salt Lake City is \nhonored to be the host city. I thank my colleagues for supporting this \nurgently needed legislation to make these games a reality at Snowbasin.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Utah Governor Mike \nLeavitt, a resolution from the Ogden City Council, an editorial from \nthe Salt Lake Tribune, and a resolution from the Utah State \nLegislature--all expressing support for this legislation--be inserted \nin the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    State of Utah,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                Salt Lake City, December 12, 1995.\n     Representative James V. Hansen,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Lands, \n         Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jim: I am writing in strong support of H.R. 2402, the \n     Snowbasin Land Exchange legislation, and its companion bill \n     in the Senate, S. 1371. I applaud your efforts, as Chairman \n     of the subcommittee of jurisdiction, in holding hearings and \n     gaining co-sponsors.\n       Utah has been given an extraordinary opportunity in hosting \n     the 2002 Winter Olympics. Snowbasin is the venue for some of \n     the most visible and popular downhill events. Over 3 billion \n     people around the world will have their eyes set on Snowbasin \n     during the Olympics. We must be ready for them.\n       In order to successfully host this venue, certain \n     facilities must be built and improvements added to \n     accommodate all of the activities which are demanded of an \n     Olympic site. For over seven years, those plans have been \n     under review and scrutiny by the public and the Forest \n     Service. Environmental impacts have been carefully reviewed. \n     The required land exchange between Snowbasin and the Forest \n     Service has now bogged down in the administrative appeals \n     process. Further delays would seriously threaten the \n     timetable needed to be met for the 2002 games. That is why \n     your legislation is so vital.\n       I am also supportive of the land exchange authorized by the \n     legislation because it will enhance economic development for \n     Northern Utah by making Snowbasin a true world-class tourist \n     destination. Further, the public stands to benefit greatly by \n     receiving access to large tracts of pristine recreational \n     lands, such as Taylor Canyon, Lighting Ridge Wheeler Creek, \n     and the North Fork Ogden River-Devil's Gate Valley, which are \n     now in private ownership.\n       This legislation represents a win-win for the state of Utah \n     and the people of Weber County. I urge you to continue to \n     work for passage of this legislation and stand ready to \n     assist you in any way possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael O. Leavitt,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             Resolution of the Ogden City Council No. 96-6\n\n       Whereas the property development of a year-round ski and \n     recreational destination resort in the Snowbasin area would \n     be beneficial to the people of the City of Ogden; and\n       Whereas the recent awarding of the 2002 Winter Olympic \n     Games to Salt Lake City increases ski and recreational \n     opportunities of the Snowbasin area; and\n       Whereas Snowbasin has been designated as the site of \n     several 2002 Winter Olympic events, with pre-Olympic events \n     scheduled in 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001; and\n       Whereas these Olympic and pre-Olympic events add to the \n     urgency to develop the Snowbasin area; and\n       Whereas Snowbasin Resort and its owner Sun Valley Company \n     have requested 1,320 acres of public land be transferred to \n     Snowbasin Resort for the purpose of developing a year-round \n     recreational destination resort; and\n       Whereas Snowbasin Resort has agreed to transfer into the \n     public domain at least 4,100 acres of land which possesses \n     outstanding recreational, environmental and other values, and \n     which opens access to other Forest Service lands for public \n     enjoyment; and\n       Whereas much of the land presently under Forest Service \n     supervision in the Snow Basin area was originally transferred \n     without monetary consideration into the public domain by \n     Ogden City for the purpose of promoting and fostering the \n     future development thereof, and where previous Ogden City \n     Councils have adopted resolutions supporting this land \n     transfer of 1,320 acres of property to Snowbasin in order to \n     effectuate such desired development; and\n       Whereas the proper development of the Snowbasin area would \n     increase tourism in the State of Utah and would be beneficial \n     to the residents of northern Utah; and\n       Whereas a delay in facilitating the desired exchange could \n     hamper the State's hosting of several Olympic and \n     international alpine skiing events; and\n       Whereas the United States Congress is currently considering \n     legislation which would complete the Snowbasin land exchange \n     and enable the timely construction of facilities at Snowbasin \n     needed for Olympic and pre-Olympic events. Now, Therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Ogden City Council urges the United \n     States Forest Service, the United States Congress and \n     President William Clinton to enact Snowbasin Land Exchange \n     legislation for the purpose of preparing Snowbasin for \n     Olympic and pre-Olympic events, and for developing Snowbasin \n     as a multi-use, four season recreational resort area.\n       Passed and adopted this 9th day of April 1996.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                Ralph W. Mitchell,\n                                                            Chair.\n\n               [From the Salt Lake Tribune, Apr. 1, 1996]\n\n                         Approve Snowbasin Swap\n\n       When the Utah wilderness legislation submerged an omnibus \n     parks bill in the U.S. Senate last week, one of the dozens of \n     items that sank with it was another proposal of keen interest \n     to Utah--the Snowbasin/Forest Service land exchange. The \n     Snowbasin proposal deserves resuscitation and passage, either \n     as part of a revived omnibus bill sans Utah wilderness or as \n     stand-alone legislation.\n       This plan would provide long-term benefits to Utah, the \n     most conspicuous being the development of a four-season \n     resort at Snowbasin by an operator, the Sun Valley Company, \n     that has a proven record of good stewardship. And, as part of \n     that development, the site of the downhill and Super-G ski \n     races for the 2002 Winter Olympics would be completed on a \n     faster track.\n       Under the legislation, Snowbasin would acquire 1,320 acres \n     from the U.S. Forest Service in exchange for some 4,100 \n     acres, spread across four different parcels in the same \n     general area, that are currently owned by Sun Valley. \n     Assuming a fair appraisal process--and the legislation calls \n     for an exchange of equal value--this proposal amounts to an \n     even land swap, not the land grab that opponents claim it is.\n       Granted, this legislation does carry some baggage. For \n     instance, its supporters have couched this bill as a \n     necessity in order for the Olympic ski races to be held at \n     Snowbasin, but that's not quite right. Sun Valley may need \n     the 1,320 acres for condos and residential units, but it \n     doesn't need nearly that many for an Olympic ski venue.\n       In addition, granting an exemption from environmental \n     laws--as this bill does for Phase I, or the mountain \n     development aspect, of the plan--is not a step that should be \n     taken cavalierly, particularly in the name of an Olympic \n     movement that holds the environment as a top priority. \n     Adherence to local and state laws will mitigate this concern, \n     but it won't completely erase it.\n       And it hasn't helped the bill's cause that its chief \n     proponent, Utah Rep. Jim Hansen, has made some ill-chosen \n     comments recently, to the effect that the downhill could be \n     run at Snowbird if the Snowbasin bill fails. This needlessly \n     resurrected a dead-and-buried concern that the Cottonwood \n     canyons might be used for the Olympics; it only aroused the \n     opposition to his own bill.\n       Still, Rep. Hansen's rhetoric aside, the voice that counts \n     most on this proposal should be that of the U.S. Forest \n     Service, the current steward of the 1,320 acres in question. \n     And the Forest Service, which had already approved an \n     exchange of 695 of those acres in 1990, has signed off on \n     this one after finding boundary problems with the parcel it \n     had earmarked five years ago.\n       While legitimate complaints can be raised over the manner \n     in which the Snowbasin proposal has been maneuvered around \n     normal USFS channels and over the use of the Olympics as a \n     wedge to gain congressional support, there still is nothing \n     fundamentally objectionable about the land exchange itself. \n     As long as the USFS can be assured that it will obtain equal \n     value for those 1,320 acres, this is a development plan that \n     Utahns--and Congress--can and should support.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               State of Utah Concurrent Resolution No. 4\n\n Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah, the Governor \n                           concurring therein\n\n       Whereas the proper development of a year-round ski and \n     recreational resort in the\n\n[[Page S4773]]\n\n     Snowbasin area would be beneficial to the people of the state \n     of Utah;\n       Whereas the recent awarding of the 2002 Olympics to Salt \n     Lake City increases the ski and recreational opportunities of \n     the Snowbasin area;\n       Whereas Snowbasin has been designated as the site of \n     several 2002 Winter Olympic event, with pre-olympic events \n     scheduled for 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001;\n       Whereas these olympic and pre-olympic events add to the \n     urgency to develop the Snowbasin area;\n       Whereas approximately 55 years ago, 4,300 acres of land in \n     the Snowbasin area was transferred with little monetary \n     consideration from private ownership to the United States \n     Forest Service under the leadership of the Ogden Chamber of \n     Commerce to stop overgrazing and to develop a year-round \n     recreation area;\n       Whereas the Ogden-Weber Chamber of Commerce and many civic \n     leaders now favor the transfer of 1,320 acres of this same \n     land at Snowbasin to the Sun Valley Company for the purpose \n     of developing a year-round recreational resort;\n       Whereas the Sun Valley Company has agreed to acquire and \n     transfer into the public domain property of comparable value \n     as selected by the United States Forest Service in exchange \n     for the 1,320 acres received in the Snowbasin area;\n       Whereas Earl Holding, developer of world famous Sun Valley \n     Resort, has established a proven track record as a developer \n     of high-quality recreational resort facilities;\n       Whereas the proper development of the Snowbasin area would \n     increase tourism in the state of Utah and would be extremely \n     beneficial to the residents of northern Utah by creating \n     numerous jobs and business opportunities;\n       Whereas the state of Utah has expended an excess of \n     $14,000,000 to construct the Trappers Loop Highway for the \n     purpose of servicing the Snowbasin/Upper Ogden Valley area;\n       Whereas the delay in facilitating the exchange of the \n     number of areas requested by the Sun Valley Company could \n     hamper the state's hosting of several olympic and \n     international alpine skiing events and may make the \n     development of a year-round resort economically infeasible;\n       Whereas the exchange of property to the Sun Valley Company \n     would allow the United States Forest Service to acquire \n     additional property as an exchange that, if property \n     selected, would open up large areas of the public domain and \n     better suit the Forest Service's objective of preserving the \n     public land for public use than the retention of the proposed \n     transfer property;\n       Whereas the intended use of the property in question when \n     it was transferred into Forest Service supervision was to \n     develop a ski and recreational area; and\n       Whereas The United States Congress is currently considering \n     legislation that would complete the Snowbasin land exchange \n     and enable the timely construction of facilities at Snowbasin \n     needed for olympic and pre-olympic events: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, the United States Forest \n     Service, the United States Congress and President William J. \n     Clinton to enact Snowbasin Land Exchange legislation for the \n     purpose of preparing Snowbasin for olympic and pre-olympic \n     events, and for developing Snowbasin as a multi-use, four \n     season recreational resort area. Be it further\n       Resolved, that copies of this resolution be sent to the Sun \n     Valley Company, the United States Forest Service, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation, and President Clinton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/07/senate-section/article/S4770-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    GAYLE FITZGERALD CORY, A TRIBUTE\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on behalf of my fellow Senators, I would \nlike to take a moment to pay tribute to a dedicated Senate worker, a \ncourageous woman and a wonderful person. Gayle Fitzgerald Cory worked \nin the Senate for 35 years, serving in many capacities. She was \nindispensable to the late Senator Muskie for 22 years, holding \npositions from receptionist to executive assistant and making the \ntransition to the State Department with him in 1980. She was also a \nvalued member of Senator George Mitchell's staff as his personal \nassistant.\n  A person who has filled these roles can't help but accumulate a \ntremendous amount of knowledge on the workings of the Senate. Gayle \nFitzgerald Cory was exceptionally qualified to take on the position of \npostmaster in 1989.\n  Up until her retirement in 1995, Mrs. Cory worked hard for the U.S. \nSenate, she was experienced, organized and capable of handling any task \nor crisis that came her way. Most of all, she was a great person. The \npost office employees--indeed, everyone with whom she came in contact--\nappreciated her warmth and her sense of fairness. An extremely \nprofessional woman, she had an almost uncanny understanding of the \nspecial needs of the Senate, and she was instrumental in making it \nwork.\n  My condolences go out to her husband, Don, her three daughters, \nLaurie, Melissa, and Carol, and all the members of her large and loving \nfamily. She was a courageous, strong person and we will all miss her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/07/senate-section/article/S4773-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 2937, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2937) for the reimbursement of attorney fees \n     and costs incurred by former employees of the White House \n     Travel Office with respect to the termination of their \n     employment in that office on May 19, 1993.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n\n       Dole amendment No. 3952, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Dole amendment No. 3953 (to amendment No. 3952), to provide \n     for an effective date for the settlement of certain claims \n     against the United States.\n       Dole amendment No. 3954 (to amendment No. 3953), to provide \n     for an effective date for the settlement of certain claims \n     against the United States.\n       Dole motion to refer the bill to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary with instructions to report back forthwith.\n       Dole amendment No. 3955 (to the instructions to the motion \n     to refer), to provide for an effective date for the \n     settlement of certain claims against the United States.\n       Dole amendment No. 3956 (to amendment No. 3955), to provide \n     for an effective date for the settlement of certain claims \n     against the United States.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the bill that is \nbefore us--the bill to reimburse the people that were harmed in the \nunfair firing at the White House in January 1993, the bill that is for \nreimbursement to the people that are called the Travelgate 17.\n  Mr. President, I think it is very obvious that when politics stands \nin the way of resolving a right or wrong issue, politics always gets \ntrampled. Right means that politics has to be put to the side. Some \nexamples come to mind: The civil rights laws of the 1960's; the end of \nthe defense buildup in the 1980's; the Congressional Accountability Act \nof 1995, which I sponsored.\n  This bill before us falls into that category. It is to reimburse the \nTravelgate 7. Now, obviously, it is much less in scope than all of \nthese other major pieces of legislation I mentioned over the last 30 \nyears. However, let me make it very clear that it is a microcosm of the \nsame reality. It is a right and wrong issue. And politics is standing \nin its way. But I predict that politics will stand in its way only \ntemporarily. Travelgate is the story of an arrogant White House \ntrampling all over the rights of seven dedicated public servants.\n  The purpose behind the abuse was so that cronies of the President \ncould win the spoils of political gain for themselves.\n  One of these people was a rich Hollywood producer, friend of Bill, \nhigh-dollar campaign contributor, buddy and crony by the name of Harry \nThomason. The other was a distant cousin of the President's, Catherine \nCornelius.\n  The White House, apparently including the President and First Lady, \nunleashed the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue \nService, and the Department of Justice to harass these seven citizens. \nAs if that were not enough, the White House also used its authority and \nits access to the media to conduct a public smear campaign against the \nseven innocent people. Following something that is too customary in \nthis town, they used leaks, innuendoes, and falsities to continue their \npublic harassment even after their primary target, Billy Dale, was \nacquitted by a jury, and it only took the jury less than 2 hours of \ndeliberation to declare his innocence.\n  The net effect of all of this harassment took a real toll--these are \nreal people--not only on the seven employees but maybe even more so on \ntheir families as well. These innocent people\n\n[[Page S4774]]\n\nhad their reputations, their dignity, and their psychological well-\nbeing suffer at the hands of an irresponsible White House. This is a \nWhite House that to this very day refuses to accept its wrongdoing. No \none takes responsibility for their firings of these seven people.\n  What do we get out of the White House? All you get is finger \npointing. All you get is passing the buck. By the way, the harassment \ncontinues. But now it is not harassment from the White House; it is \nlegislative harassment as we have legislation here trying to right this \nwrong. So the legislation that has just been laid down for today's \ndiscussion, the bill we have before us is to make these seven innocent \npeople economically whole.\n  Well, maybe you cannot do that, but at least pay for their legal \nexpenses. I do not know how you can right the wrongs that have been \ncommitted, but at least there is precedent for legislation to pay for \nlegal expenses, legal expenses for people who were innocent, declared \ninnocent by a jury of their peers.\n  So activity moves from the finger pointing at the White House to \nactivity up here on the Hill in the legislative process, but the White \nHouse is still involved, fanning out its lieutenants to sabotage this \nbill in the dark of night. The objective of the White House and the \nopponents of this legislation, the people who are not willing to admit \na wrong in the firing of seven innocent people, is to bring this bill \ndown so that the President is spared the embarrassment of signing a \nbill, the only reason for the existence of which in the first place is \nthat the White House fired seven innocent people. In other words, I \nmight add, the same President who passed the buck in the first place in \nnot taking responsibility for the firings at the White House is behind \nthis effort to sabotage this legislation on the Hill to right this \nwrong.\n\n  The legislative harassment strategy began with Democrat Senators \nputting a hold on the bill. For those watching who maybe do not \nunderstand how Congress works, a hold is a way that any Senator can \nprevent a bill from being considered, and the instigator of any hold \ndoes not have to identify himself. He can do it in the secrecy of the \nCloakroom out of the public's eye. But last week the people with the \nhold were smoked out. The rock was lifted. And the instigators of the \nhold went scurrying for cover of darkness once again. Having retreated \nfrom the back room, they are now positioned at the next line of \ndefense, out on the floor of the Senate to use a legislative roadblock. \nIt is called muddying the waters, or in this case you might say the \n``whitewaters.''\n  This strategy goes like this: how can we as opponents bog down the \nbill on a technicality or some counter argument that sounds reasonable \nbut gives us sufficient cover so that we can filibuster the underlying \nlegislation, the Travelgate bill, that pays the legal expenses of seven \ninnocent people who were fired within the first month that the Clintons \ncame to office.\n  So the White House, getting their lieutenants on the Hill to take all \nthis activity against this simple little bill, comes up with a \ncounterargument: If the Travelgate seven are going to get reimbursed, \nwhy not reimburse everyone associated with the Whitewater \ninvestigation? And they also came up with a technicality. They say we \njust want to use this bill as a vehicle for other items that are on our \nagenda. They would argue it is our right as minority Members of this \nbody.\n  So here we are, Mr. President, with politics getting in the way of a \nright and wrong issue, where right ought to win out, but politics, if \nit is played correctly and sophisticated enough, can win. If we cannot \ndeal with apples, let us just throw in some oranges. Put it into the \nmix. Confuse the situation. So now in this Chamber to fool the public \nwe are dealing with apples and oranges legislation generated by the \nother side of the aisle because they want to protect the President not \nhaving to veto this legislation.\n  However, political barriers to correcting a wrong will not stand. \nUltimately, public opinion will weigh in against the Democrats and the \nWhite House on this issue. All the harassment strategies to save the \nPresident from embarrassment will only make the final embarrassment \nbigger and worse. It is inevitable. It is predictable. It will happen. \nYou cannot forever cover up wrong in our open society.\n  There is a moral to this story: Nothing is politically right which is \nmorally wrong. I wish to repeat the moral of the story: Nothing is \npolitically right that is morally wrong.\n  That is why all this political maneuvering is destined to fail. The \npublic will not tolerate political interference with righting a wrong. \nFrankly, it is time that the President of the United States, the \noccupant of the White House, take responsibility for his actions in \nfiring these seven dedicated public servants. What do we get instead? \nHe continues the campaign to prevent his own embarrassment over the \nfirings. The truth is if the firings and the circumstances were not \nwrong, there would be no embarrassment. But the obvious fact is the \nfirings were wrong.\n\n  Why should we expect the President of the United States to accept \nresponsibility for his actions? First of all, because he is the \nPresident of the United States. In that position, he is the moral \nleader of our Nation. A leader is expected to take responsibility for \nhis actions or for those who act in his stead. That includes both good \nactions and bad actions.\n  Furthermore, I think the President himself has spoken out very loudly \nand clearly about responsibility and, in his saying this, implied that \nhe saw the Office of the Presidency as one for moral leadership and he \nwas going to assume that moral leadership because of things that he \nsaid when he was a candidate. While running for office in 1992, he said \nthe following: ``Responsibility starts at the top. That's what the New \nCovenant is all about.''\n  In a further quote, and this was criticizing, in 1992, then-President \nBush, candidate Clinton had this to say: ``The buck doesn't stop with \nGeorge Bush; it doesn't even slow down there.''\n  I think it is fair to say that on this issue, the buck does not even \nslow down with the President. In fact, I have rarely seen a buck change \nhands so many times. From the perspective of the Office of the \nPresident and its occupant being moral leader for our Nation, what kind \nof example does that set for the American people? What kind of moral \nleadership is that? Each time that a leader fails to take \nresponsibility for his actions, he undercuts his moral authority to \nlead. Over time, a leader like that loses the confidence of those he is \nleading, the people of our country.\n  So, more so than anything else that deals with this issue, dollars \nand cents aside, righting wrongs aside, that is the issue here, that is \nthe reality of whether moral leadership is going to be the example at \nthe White House. The bill is all about Congress taking the initiative \nto right a wrong, and those trying to block it are conspiring against \nthe President taking responsibility for his mistakes. But the issue is \nmoral leadership of the White House, a President saying when he is \nwrong that he is wrong.\n  So I urge my colleagues on the other side to save the President any \nmore embarrassment. Stop legislative shenanigans. Work with us to do \nwhat little we can to repair what was unjustly done to seven dedicated \npublic servants, innocent by a determination of the jury, unfairly \nfired within just a matter of days of a new President being sworn in.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, again, speaking about the bill that is \nbefore us, the bill to reimburse Mr. Dale for his legal expenses that \nwere attributed to him in his defense when the jury found him innocent \nof the wrongdoing he was charged with supposedly at the running of the \nWhite House Travel Office and his firing by the White House, I want to \ncontinue my discussion of this legislation by referring to one of the \nevening news shows. I believe it is NBC that has a segment called ``In \nTheir Own Words,''\n\n[[Page S4775]]\n\nthat lets real people tell a story in their own words without the \nfilter of a journalist's slant on that story. I would like to do my own \nversion of ``In Their Words.''\n  On January 24 of this year, a hearing was held in the other body by \nthe Committee on Government Reform and Oversight. The witnesses \nincluded the seven fired from the White House Travel Office. I want my \ncolleagues to know firsthand of the indignity suffered by these seven \nat the hands of our leaders in the White House. So, for the Record, I \nwill quote these seven employees in their own words from their own \ntestimony, their own prepared statements before the House committee.\n  The first statement--and I am not going to quote the whole statement, \njust portions of it--the first statement is by Billy Dale, the person \nthat the legislation before us involves. He was former director of the \nWhite House Travel Office. These are a couple paragraphs from his \nstatement:\n\n       It was not easy for me or my family. We were subjected to \n     the most intense intrusions and harassment you can imagine. \n     We were sustained during those very difficult times by our \n     faith and the many friends and professional colleagues who \n     stood by our side.\n       I had hoped that after the jury found me not guilty so \n     quickly, we could return to the very quiet and simple life we \n     used to live. However, since the release of David Watkins' \n     memorandum describing how he was supposedly pressured to fire \n     the entire staff at the White House Travel Office, I have \n     been subjected to false attacks at least as vicious as the \n     ones I was tried and acquitted. This time, however, there is \n     no trial pending.\n\n  To further quote at another point in Mr. Dale's testimony:\n\n       What matters to me is that fancy lawyers and others who \n     speak for the White House not be allowed to get away with the \n     lie that my colleagues and I were involved in other kinds \n     of wrongdoing. It also matters to me that people not be \n     allowed to spread the equally vicious lie that I was \n     willing to plead guilty to embezzlement before trial. And, \n     finally, it matters to me that these same people not be \n     allowed to tell the public that the Travel Office was \n     cleaned up and is now managed better.\n\n  A further quote from Mr. Dale at another point in his testimony:\n\n       All these facts lead us to conclude that the financial \n     mismanagement that the White House says is the reason we were \n     fired is just a convenient excuse. If the President or the \n     First Lady or anyone else wanted us out in order to give the \n     business to their friends and supporters, that was their \n     privilege. But why can't they just admit that that is what \n     they wanted to do, rather than continue to make up \n     accusations to hide that fact?\n\n  Another person who testified before the House Government Operations \nCommittee is Barney Brasseux, and I quote from his testimony:\n\n       For me, the 19th of May, 1993 was the beginning of a \n     difficult time and the first of several eventful days that \n     turned my life upside down. I was fired, told to vacate the \n     premises within 2 hours, driven out of the White House in the \n     back of a cargo van with no seats, implicated by the White \n     House in criminal wrongdoing and placed under investigation \n     by the United States Justice Department, even though I had no \n     financial responsibility whatsoever in the office.\n       Many questions and concerns have been raised in these \n     reports regarding the handling of our termination. The manner \n     of our dismissal, the damage to our reputations, the impact \n     of this action on our families, the possible involvement of \n     the First Lady of the United States, and the role of the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation are just a few. All of these \n     issues are very important to me and I trust to you as well.\n\n  A further quote from John P. McSweeney. The title of his position at \nthe White House was assistant to the director, White House Travel \nOffice:\n\n       Although I have been a registered Democrat for 44 years, it \n     was not a political but a civil service appointment. This \n     came to an abrupt halt while I was on leave in Ireland when \n     my son Jim called to inform me that the evening news shows \n     had just announced that the entire staff of our office had \n     been fired and that the FBI was starting an investigation for \n     possible criminal activity.\n\n  Continuing to quote Mr. McSweeney:\n\n       Although the White House recognized that not all of us had \n     any financial authority, for the next 30 months we all became \n     part of a full-blown Department of Justice investigation with \n     Billy Dale as their target. For myself, it involved FBI \n     agents interviewing my neighbors, two grand jury appearances, \n     two Justice Department and FBI interviews, and one meeting \n     with the IRS, along with legal fees of over $65,000 of my \n     retirement funds.\n       Over time, where before I had been intimidated, it now \n     turned to complete frustration as the White House had free \n     reign with the media in putting out its story while we were \n     muzzled by the Justice Department. They presented me with a \n     letter that stated that I was not a subject or target of \n     their investigation at the present time, which meant that \n     anything I said could be used against me.\n\n  Again, from Mr. McSweeney, he had this to say:\n\n       We were already described as no more than glorified bellmen \n     for the press. I would only quote the President at his press \n     conference of last week when he said, ``an allegation is not \n     the same thing as a fact'' and also that [quoting the \n     President] ``the American people are fundamentally fair-\n     minded.'' [End of quote of the President.]\n\n  Mr. McSweeney goes on to say.\n\n       I would hope that he [meaning the President] would repeat \n     his statement to some of his spokesmen.\n       Along these same lines, during your hearings of last week, \n     a new so-what, who-cares attitude seemed to be the new theme \n     for some in this room. During a recent First Lady interview, \n     Mrs. Clinton expressed, as would any parent, how concerned \n     she was and the effort she had made to help her daughter cope \n     with hearing the many negative comments being made about her \n     mother.\n       Blanche Dale, unfortunately, was not able to do so for her \n     daughters over the past 30 months. She had to sit and watch \n     as her daughter Kim who, 2 days after returning from her \n     honeymoon, had to report to the Department of Justice and \n     show how she had paid for her wedding, her reception, her \n     honeymoon, and, since we were present at her reception, \n     answer questions about any discussions we may have had.\n       Her daughter Vickie, when interviewed by the Justice \n     Department, in explaining that she was giving her cash car \n     payments to her father so that he could deposit them in the \n     White House Credit Union for her, was asked if she was not \n     uncomfortable with giving her cash to someone who was \n     stealing money from the Travel Office.\n       To those who say so what, you should remember that the \n     American people may have a gray area on legalese, but they \n     know right from wrong.\n\n  That is the end of quoting from the House document.\n  The American people do know right from wrong. That is why a jury of \npeers of Mr. Dale acquitted him. That is why this legislation is before \nus, because the American people do know right from wrong. But the White \nHouse has not admitted right from wrong yet.\n  So, Madam President, I want to conclude by saying something that \nShakespeare had to say in the play ``Othello,'' because the character \nof Iago in that play seemed to sum up nicely what each of these seven \nemployees and their families went through. I will quote from \nShakespeare.\n       Who steals my purse steals trash. But he that filches from \n     me my good name, robs me of that which not enriches him, and \n     makes me poor indeed.\n\n  That is what we are talking about here, Madam President. And this \nbill before us does not even begin to address what really makes these \ncitizens poor. Money alone cannot do it, but this bill is a start. So I \nurge my colleagues to help make a start for them on their road to \nrecovery.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments about this \nBilly Dale bill.\n  As everybody knows, Billy Dale was unjustly persecuted. His \ncolleagues were mistreated. The costs to them are unfair. You would \nthink everybody in the Senate would want to immediately rectify all of \nthose wrongs. I hope that our colleagues on the other side will not \nfilibuster this because of their concerns about other legislation that \nthey will have an opportunity to bring up.\n  This is very, very important legislation. It is fair. It will \nestablish a decent resolution to what really has been awful. Let me \njust give the time line of some of the Travel Office events so that \neverybody understands, at least to a certain degree, what happened \nhere.\n  On May 19, 1993, the White House fired all seven Travel Office \nemployees. At least two of those individuals first learned about their \ndismissals on the evening news. Talk about a crass way of doing it. The \nWhite House first stated that the firings came as a result of an \ninternal audit revealing financial irregularities in the office.\n  Several months of independent review and oversight hearings uncovered\n\n[[Page S4776]]\n\nthe actual motivation for the firings. Certain people, hoping to \nadvance their own financial interests, attempted to destroy the \nreputations of the Travel Office employees and take over the Travel \nOffice business of the White House, and, I might add, some indication \nof the whole Government. These same persons used White House staff \nmembers to initiate a baseless criminal investigation by the FBI. It \nwas one of the low ebbs in criminal law enforcement in this country.\n  According to the congressional investigation, certain individuals \nwere responsible for the firings--Catherine Cornelius, a cousin of the \nPresident employed at the White House; Harry Thomason, a close personal \nfriend of the President and First Lady; Darnell Martins, Mr. Thomason's \nbusiness partner; and David Watkins, assistant to the President for \nmanagement and administration. These were the people primarily \nresponsible for the firings.\n  In December 1992, discussions took place between Ms. Cornelius and \nWorld Wide Travel, the agency that served the Clinton-Gore campaign, \nabout the eventual takeover of the White House Travel Office business.\n\n  In January 1993, Watkins hired Ms. Cornelius. Soon thereafter, the \nTravel Office began taking calls from Ms. Cornelius as the new head of \nthe Travel Office.\n  In February 1993, Ms. Cornelius provided Watkins with a proposal that \nwould make her a co-director of the White House Travel Office and would \nhire World Wide Travel as the outside travel specialist.\n  In April and May 1993, Ms. Cornelius began to focus on the Travel \nOffice and with Harry Thomason claimed that there were allegations of \ncorruption within the office. During this time, Ms. Cornelius and Mr. \nThomason pushed to have World Wide take over the Travel Office \nbusiness.\n  In May 1993, employees of the White House counsel's office, Ms. \nCornelius, and others met with the FBI regarding the Travel Office. \nAlthough the FBI was unsure that enough evidence existed to warrant a \ncriminal investigation, William Kennedy of the White House counsel's \noffice, former partner of the First Lady, informed Bureau agents that a \nrequest for an FBI evaluation came from the highest levels. At this \ntime, it was determined that the accounting firm of Peat Marwick would \nbe asked to perform an audit of the Travel Office.\n  On May 14, Peat Marwick's management consultants made their first \ntrip to the White House.\n  On May 17, Mr. Watkins and Mr. McLarty decided to fire the Travel \nOffice staff. Although Mr. Dale offered to retire, Mr. Watkins told him \nto wait until the review was complete.\n  On May 19, Patsy Thomasson informed Mr. Kennedy that a decision had \nbeen made to fire the travel office workers. Kennedy informed the FBI, \nwho warned him that the firings could interfere with their criminal \ninvestigation. Kennedy informed the Bureau that the firings would go \nahead anyway.\n  That same day, before the bodies were even cold, Mr. Martens called a \nfriend from Air Advantage to have her arrange the Presidential press \ncharters. Meanwhile, Mr. Kennedy instructed Mr. Watkins to delete any \nreference to the FBI investigation from talking points on the firings.\n  At 10 a.m. that same morning, Watkins informed the travel office \nemployees that they were being fired because a review revealed gross \nmismanagement in the office. They were initially told that they had 2 \nhours to pack up, clean out their desks, and leave. Watkins learned \nthat press secretary Dee Dee Myers had publicly disclosed existence of \nthe FBI investigation as well as the Peat Marwick review. Later that \nsame day, Myers gave another press briefing in which she denied that an \nFBI investigation had taken place. She claimed that the firings were \nbased on the Peat Marwick review.\n  Interestingly, the Peat Marwick review was not finalized until May \n21, 1993, 2 days after the firings. The report was dated on May 17, \nhowever. The report gave no assurances as to either its completeness or \nits accuracy. In any event, while the report found certain accounting \nirregularities, it found no evidence of fraud.\n  In May 1994, the General Accounting Office reported to Congress that \nwhile the White House claimed the terminations were based on ``findings \nof serious financial mismanagement weaknesses, we noted that \nindividuals who had personal and business interests in the travel \noffice created the momentum that ultimately led to the examination of \nthe travel office operations.'' GAO, the General Accounting Office, \nfurther noted that ``the public acknowledgment of the criminal \ninvestigation had the effect of tarnishing the employees' reputations, \nand the existence of the criminal investigation caused the employees to \nretain legal counsel, reportedly at considerable expense.''\n  Of course, as everyone in this body knows, Mr. Dale was the only \ntravel office employee to be indicted. And it took a jury only 2 days \nto acquit Mr. Dale after a 13-day trial.\n  There was no reason to indict Mr. Dale. There was no reason to \ntarnish the reputation of these White House Travel Office employees. \nThere was no reason to brutalize these people the way they were \nbrutalized. And there is no reason for us in this body not to pass this \nlegislation unanimously and to resolve this manner in an honorable, \ncompassionate, reasonable, honest, and decent way. That is what this is \nall about. This is to right a wrong, or a series of wrongs.\n  It may never fully resolve the tarnishing of the reputations of these \npeople. It may never do that. But at least we can do what we can do at \nthis late date, because of the injustices that were committed at the \nWhite House by certain White House employees and whoever those were who \nwere referred to as those at the top of the heap, at ``the highest \nlevels of the White House.''\n  Frankly, whoever they were, they ought to be ashamed of themselves \nbecause in all honesty, these poor people, whose situation we are \ntrying to resolve today, have been very badly damaged.\n  I do not know what it means, by ``the highest levels of the White \nHouse,'' but I have carefully stayed away from some of the \ncharacterizations that others have given, where there are some facts \nthat would indicate who are at the highest levels of the White House \nand who were at that particular time.\n  Just so everybody knows about what is going on here, this legislation \nprovides for payment of the legal expenses incurred by Billy Dale, \nBarney Brasseux, John Dreylinger, Ralph Maughan, John McSweeney, and \nGary Wright. The legal expenses are in connection with the wrongful \ncriminal investigation launched against these seven people subsequent \nto their firings.\n\n  Though Mr. Dale suffered the greatest financial loss, half a million \ndollars, the remaining six employees collectively incurred about \n$200,000 in their own defense. The appropriations bill for the \nDepartment of Transportation for fiscal 1994 provided approximately \n$150,000 in reimbursement of legal fees. This bill would provide the \nbalance.\n  This bill would not provide for compensation of all expenses \nassociated with the investigation into the Travel Office matter, such \nas legal costs incurred in preparation for appearing before Congress. \nBut it would provide for attorney's fees and costs that resulted from \nthese seven defending themselves against criminal charges.\n  The Travel Office employees will have 120 days after this legislation \nis enacted make a claim for legal expenses. All legal bills submitted \nwill be reviewed for their appropriateness and any reimbursement will \nbe reduced according to prior Department of Transportation \nreimbursements.\n  According to independent counsel statutes, attorneys' fees may be \nreimbursed to individuals confronted with the unique circumstance of \nbeing subject to the scrutiny of a Federal investigation. This is not \nsomething that the ordinary U.S. citizen is subject to. In the case of \nthe White House Travel Office firings, the staff of the Travel office \nwas investigated by the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, and the Internal Revenue Service. But for the fact that \nthey were Federal employees, who were fired by the White House, these \nindividuals would not have been investigated by these agencies. The \nWhite House was able to bring the power of Federal law enforcement to \nbear on otherwise\n\n[[Page S4777]]\n\nblameless individuals. And people know that they are blameless.\n  Reimbursement of legal fees under independent counsel statutes was \ndesigned, at least partially, because of the potential for political \nabuse of the investigative power of the independent counsel. The White \nHouse has the authority to wield tremendous power with respect to \nFederal investigations. None of the Travel Office employees held \nprominent posts in the White House, but they became a target of a \nFederal criminal investigation. These public servants never should have \nbeen scrutinized in this way and forced to defend themselves in this \nmanner.\n  Hamilton Jordan, who worked for the Carter administration, is an \nexample of a case in which attorney's fees were reimbursed. Mr. \nHamilton Jordan was investigated for charges of cocaine use. After an \nindependent counsel was appointed and the evidence was examined, all \ncharges were dropped. I felt that was a low point in our country's \nhistory. In defending himself through this ordeal, Mr. Jordan spent \nthousands of dollars in legal fees. Since the charges were baseless, \nCongress provided reimbursement of his legal expenses and related \ncosts. His legal fees were reimbursed, in part, because he was a \nFederal employee and would not, under ordinary circumstances, be \nsubject to an independent counsel investigation. The circumstances of \nthe Travel Office employees are similar in this respect.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues on the other side are not going \nto delay this bill. I hope that, as serious and as deeply as they feel \nabout other matters, that they will recognize the injustices that have \noccurred here and we will all vote 100 to zip to rectify these wrongs \nthat have occurred to these White House people, former White House \npeople.\n  Like I say, we may never be able to make it up to them because of the \ntarnishing of their reputations that occurred through this process. But \nwe ought to do the best we can, and that is what this bill is all \nabout. It is the right thing to do. It is the appropriate thing to do. \nIt is the compassionate thing to do. And I think it is a long overdue \nthing to do.\n  I do not know anybody on the other side who would vote against this. \nI do not know anybody on the other side who would differ with what we \nare trying to do here.\n  This has been a bipartisan effort. Like I say, 350 Members of the \nHouse voted for it, only 43 against it. I think it is time for us to do \nwhat is right here, and I hope my colleagues on both sides of the floor \nwill help us get this done today.\n  I see my colleague would like to speak. I have some other things I \nwant to say on another matter. Is it on this matter?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from Utah will \nallow me, I would like to make a few comments and maybe engage the \nSenator in a couple of questions, if that is permissible.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is fine. I will be happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Chair for recognizing me, and I also thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, for allowing me to make a few comments and observations, \nplus ask a couple of questions.\n  First, the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. President, just said \nthat the proposal to appropriate or to allocate some $487,000 to pay \nthe legal fees for Mr. Billy Dale is to right a wrong. I think this \nbody wants to right a wrong, and I think this body, if there has been a \nwrong committed in the Billy Dale matter, will support the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  However, before we do that, I think we need to really ask ourselves \nwhat we are doing here.\n  First, to right this wrong, as the distinguished chairman has \nmentioned, we are going to be overlooking a very, very large number of \nindividuals who have been wronged. Now, are we going to apply this same \ntest and this same standard, are we then going to try to right this \nwrong for many, many people who have come to testify before the Special \nWatergate Committee, who have testified before Kenneth Starr's grand \njury and before the trial in Little Rock, AR? What sort of a standard \nare we going to adopt for these individuals?\n  For example, Maggie Williams is the secretary to Mrs. Clinton at the \nWhite House. Today, she is not a target. Today, she does not expect, I \nassume, to be indicted. Today, there is no one who stands at the gate \nwith shackles or leg irons to take Maggie Williams off to jail, but \ntoday she owes over $200,000 in legal bills. This is not someone who \nmakes a great sum of money, relatively speaking, Mr. President. This is \nsomeone who, basically, was doing her job as she saw fit, along with \nmany other people who are involved in the White House and who have been \ncalled before the special committee and before Mr. Starr.\n\n  We have had 45 hearings and 5 public meetings. This committee has met \n250 hours. The committee has heard testimony from 123 individuals. They \nhave taken depositions from 213 individuals. Some of these witnesses \nhave testified and have been deposed two and three times. These numbers \ndo not include the hundreds of other citizens who have been deposed and \nappeared as witnesses before committees in the House of \nRepresentatives, the independent counsel, the RTC, and the FDIC.\n  Mr. President, I ask my friend from Utah, is there not some degree of \nsentiment or concern for these individuals? Perhaps I can pose that \nquestion to my friend.\n  Mr. HATCH. This is considerably different from Whitewater. I have to \nsay the Whitewater investigation is not completed. As a member of the \nWhitewater Committee, I have to say that there is an awful lot of \nundercurrent, an awful lot that is wrong with what went on in that \narea. There are a lot of unanswered questions. There are documents \nstill to be delivered. There are questions concerning each of the \nwitnesses who have appeared. I think until that is resolved, as was \nBilly Dale's, I do not think we can make a determination as to whether \nwe should get involved with attorney's fees.\n  Let us assume there is a tremendous injustice at the end of the \nWhitewater matter. I think you are going to have a rough time making \nthat case with all of what some would call the sleaze factor throughout \nthe Whitewater hearings and proceedings. But let us assume that it \nturns out to be the same as Billy Dale's and the White House Travel \nOffice employees' acquittal or even a clear-cut set of facts that there \nreally was nothing wrong and nobody did anything wrong. I personally \nbelieve that is going to be a hard conclusion to reach after having \nlistened and watched the Whitewater proceedings now for a long time. \nBut let us assume that happens. Yes, I would be interested in righting \nthat wrong as well.\n  In this case, we have come to a conclusion. I think the effective \nconclusion was when Billy Dale had to go through the litigation and the \ncourtroom proceedings, having been accused of criminal activity, having \nbeen indicted and having gone through a jury trial and having a jury of \nhis peers conclude that Billy Dale was an honest man. I think the facts \nshowed he was an honest man throughout this process.\n  I think that is completely distinguishable, at least at this time. \nNow, if at the end of Whitewater there are those who have been unjustly \ntreated in the same manner who had the same clear vindication that Mr. \nDale and his colleagues have, yes, this Senator would want to do what \nis right there as well.\n\n  Until it is concluded, I do not see how you can argue that is the \nsame situation. Although I have to tell you, I really believe there is \nfar too much of this stuff going on, these counteraccusations back and \nforth, and far too many things that are done on a political basis.\n  Frankly, one last thing, since Whitewater--let me just make that \npoint a little bit better, too. I think there is far too much politics \nplayed on both sides from time to time. But just to make the point on \nthe Whitewater, I have to say, the subject of Whitewater is the subject \nof an independent counsel investigation, which Billy Dale's was not, \nand subjects of an independent counsel investigation will have a right \nto be compensated for attorney's fees, assuming there is no\n\n[[Page S4778]]\n\nwrong, if there is no indictment handed down, and that is the way the \nlaw is. So there is a protection built in on the Whitewater matter that \nis not built in on the Billy Dale matter.\n  Be that as it may, my colleague has been a friend of mine for a long \ntime. He knows me, and I know him, and he is my friend. He knows if I \nthink there is an injustice, I do not care about the politics, I am \ngoing to try to right that wrong. In this case, I do not think anybody \ndenies there was an injustice. I do not think anybody denies there was \na series of wrongs. I do not think anybody denies his reputation and \nthose of his colleagues were besmirched and tarnished by inappropriate \naction by certain people at the White House and others. I do not think \nhe would deny at all there is no other way to get them reimbursed for \nthis travesty which happened to them other than our doing the right \nthing and compassionately standing up and saying we are going to \nreimburse them.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I think it is time to set the record \nstraight. The distinguished Senator from Utah has stated if Billy Dale, \nwho has been indicted and now we are about to pay his attorney's fees--\nif there is an indictment by the special counsel, by Kenneth Starr, or \nany other special counsel, if that indictment ever comes forth, then \nthe attorney's fees are not automatically paid, they are not reimbursed \nif there is an indictment by the special counsel.\n  We are carving out a very special, new area here, Mr. President, and \nI think we ought to all know what we are doing.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let us make it clear. If Maggie Williams, to use the \ndistinguished Senator's illustration, is not indicted, she is entitled \nto attorney's fees reimbursement. If she is indicted, she is not.\n  If she is indicted and she is tried in a court of law--and I do not \nmean to pick on Maggie. The Senator used the illustration. Let us use \njust a hypothetical. Let us say ``A'' is indicted. They go to the \ncriminal trial, and ``A'' is convicted. We are not going to pay the \nattorney fees in that situation. But let us say ``A'' is acquitted, \nthen I think it is an appropriate thing for us to come at that time and \nsee what we can do to right the wrongs that were there.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I think once again, Mr. President, we are setting out Mr. \nDale as a very special individual. This is special legislation to \nbenefit him. Others do not have the benefit of this special \nlegislation. I am simply saying that if we are going to do this for \none, I do not understand why we do not do it for others.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator would yield. I do not think we should do it \nprospectively. I think if we see wrongs, we can right them on the \nfloor. I do not see any reason to have any problem righting this wrong. \nIf there are wrongs that need to be righted in the future, as chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee I am going to do my best to right them. My \ncolleague knows that is so. I do not care about the politics and who is \non whose side. If I think it is wrong, we ought to do it. But I do not \nthink we should do it prospectively for a blanket righting of wrongs \nwithout knowing what case it is.\n  This is special legislation, there is no question about it. But, Mr. \nDale, Billy Dale, is a special case. He was singled out by the White \nHouse for an unjust prosecution, frankly, very unjustly so, wrongly so. \nI think, since my friend is from Arkansas and is the strongest \nsupporter of the President here, that he would give credibility to even \nthe President's comments that he thinks this ought to be righted, these \nwrongs ought to be resolved.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Once again, I think, Mr. President, we need to set the \nrecord straight. The White House did not prosecute Mr. Dale. The White \nHouse did not prosecute Mr. Dale. The Justice Department prosecuted Mr. \nDale. He was indicted by a grand jury. He was acquitted. Maybe that is \ngood. I am not here to argue that. I may very well support this, but \nwhat I would say----\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield? The Justice Department leaked his \nplea arrangements. The Attorney General is appointed by the White \nHouse. I am not blaming her. The White House has a certain element of \ncontrol there. White House officials brought in FBI people. They \ndirected the FBI to investigate this.\n  Frankly, without the White House, this travesty would never have \noccurred. It was people in the White House who absolutely were wrong. \nEverybody knows today who brought this about. I have to say, Billy Dale \nwent down the drain financially and reputationwise because of people \ndown at the White House, some of whom have greed on their minds with \noutside people, who did not care about Billy Dale, did not care who \nthey tramped on. They did not care about this poor little guy who \nserved eight Presidents, and his colleagues, and put them through an \nuntold amount of misery, that he still is suffering from, and has \nbroken them without any justification whatsoever, not any. Even Peat \nMarwick agrees with that.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Utah made an \nimpassioned plea for justice, an impassioned plea to, so-called, right \na wrong. I hope the Senator from Utah will apply that same passionate \nplea for justice to my sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I hope that the \nSenator from Utah will allow me, this Senator from Arkansas, to call up \namendment No. 3959 to this Travelgate proposal and allow a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution to go forth.\n  If I might ask the distinguished Senator, has the Senator filled up \nthe tree or is an amendment possible?\n  Mr. HATCH. The tree is filled up.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Is there any reason why we cannot amend this bill? I want \nto know that.\n  Mr. HATCH. What is the sense-of-the-Senate resolution?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I am glad the Senator asks.\n\n       Sense of the Senate for the reimbursement to certain \n     individuals for legal expenses relating to the Whitewater \n     Development Corporation investigation.\n       Findings. The Senate finds that--\n       (1) The Senate Special Committee to Investigate Whitewater \n     Development Corporation and Related Matters . . . has \n     required depositions from 213 individuals and testimony \n     before the committee from 123 individuals;\n       (2) many public servants and other citizens have incurred \n     considerable legal expenses responding to requests of the \n     Committee;\n       (3) many of these public servants and other citizens were \n     not involved with the Whitewater Development Corporation or \n     related matters under investigation;\n\n  And here, I say to my friend:\n\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) a legal expense fund should be established \n     to compensate individuals for legal expenses incurred \n     responding to requests by the Committee; and [finally]\n       (2) only those individuals who have not been named, \n     targeted, or convicted in the investigation of the \n     Independent Counsel relating to the Whitewater Development \n     Corporation should be eligible for reimbursement from the \n     fund.\n\n  If they are indicted, they do not get any compensation for their \nattorneys. If they are not, if they are not named, if they are not a \ntarget--how in the world can we keep bringing these people up here, \narraigning them before the committee, making them pay their own \nexpenses, making them absorb all these legal fees? How can we do it? I \nhope you will allow me to introduce and present this sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course, we cannot do that. First of all, there would be \nsomebody in here on every congressional hearing. So we cannot allow \nthat. That is way too broad. Second, you know, our bill does not cover \ncongressional hearings. This Billy Dale hearing does not cover \ncongressional hearings. I am talking about the bipartisan bill of both \nsides. It does not cover congressional hearings. They are not going to \nbe reimbursed for their attorney fees for that. They are reimbursed for \ntheir attorney fees to protect themselves from criminal charges.\n  Frankly, this is not going to reimburse Mr. Dale for everything he \nhas incurred. It certainly is never going to get his reputation back, \nalthough I think everybody who knows him and knows what happened \nprobably respects him even more today for having gone through what he \ndid.\n  Let me just make a point here. Even some of the most partisan people \nin the House were in favor of this bill. A person I have a lot of \nrespect for as one of the more intelligent Democrats in the House is \nBarney Frank of Massachusetts. This is right out of the Congressional \nRecord during the House debate. He said this:\n\n       Mr. Speaker, the Congress retains always not the right but \n     the responsibility to make\n\n[[Page S4779]]\n\n     judgments case by case. I think the gentleman from New Mexico \n     has fairly pointed out, should some other individuals come \n     before the Congress and be able to make claims that Congress \n     finds similarly meritorious, they may benefit. I do have to \n     differ a little bit with the argument that says, ``Well, we \n     should not do it for anybody if we cannot do it for \n     everybody.''\n\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       Mr. Speaker, we unfortunately rarely can do justice for \n     everyone. I have myself, because I served on \n     the Administrative Law Subcommittee, which dealt with \n     claims on the Immigration Subcommittee, been part of \n     bringing to this floor legislation that made some people \n     whole when other people similarly situated were not made \n     whole. We can never do it all. And I think it would be a \n     mistake to say either we do all of it or we do none of it.\n\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Mexico, who I \n     think stated it the best way we can. This neither sets a \n     precedent nor precludes someone. Any new case will be judged \n     on the same merits.\n\n  There is one of the leading Democrats on the Judiciary Committee in \nthe House, one of the brightest people in the House of Representatives, \na person I have worked with ever since he has been here, I have to say, \nsomeone who is known as a very intelligent, aggressive, and effective \npartisan in the Democratic Party, and someone whose liberal credentials \nI think would match anybody's over here. He made it clear that you just \ncannot solve every case with one bill.\n  I will just say this to my dear friend from Arkansas. I feel for \npeople who are called before congressional hearings. I do. I wish we \nnever had to call anybody, except to enlighten us and help us pass \nbetter legislation. I do think independent counsel are used far too \noften. I also think that far too often people do have to hire attorneys \naround here just to make sure they are protected and they have some \nprotection for themselves.\n  I understand that personally. There were very unjust accusations \nagainst me where I had to hire attorneys that cost me over \n$300,000 just to make sure that nobody pulls any dirty tricks on you. \nFrankly, nobody understands that. Nobody reimbursed me, I have to say. \nI think there are many, many other Members who have had similar \nsituations where they have been very unjustly treated and where they \nget stuck with attorney fees. I personally do not like it. I personally \nthink it is wrong.\n\n  In Whitewater, I think we do have to wait until it is over, at least \nuntil we conclude the hearings, and then determine if people are \nindicted--if they are indicted; if they are not, they are not--and then \ndetermine which cases are those where there has been injustice. It has \nto be on a case-by-case basis. That is my experience in the Judiciary \nCommittee. Otherwise, we would be the fountain of all money here.\n  Now, with respect to your amendment, I note that, No. 1, the \nWhitewater investigation is not complete. When it is, we can consider \nwhether or not we will compensate people for testifying regarding \nWhitewater. Your sense-of-the-Senate resolution would set a bad \nprecedent to provide compensation even before the investigation is \ncomplete.\n  No. 2, our bill, unlike your sense-of-the-Senate resolution, does not \nprovide compensation, any compensation, for those who might testify \nbefore the Congress. It provides compensation in this case for what are \nlegitimate reasons, what are compassionate reasons, what are honest and \njust reasons, that I think virtually everybody, except 43 Members of \nthe House, would agree with.\n  I think if my colleague would take my word for it, I certainly will \ntry to rectify any injustices that come in the future, whether from \nWhitewater or others, and I think maybe by remedying some of these \nthings, maybe we can get Members of Congress and other people who are \nso quick to smear people to not do so much because it will cost the \ntaxpayer occasionally to rectify these wrongs.\n  Frankly, I would like to get rid of the smear tactics in the White \nHouse, and sometimes in the Congress, and get down to doing our jobs \nand doing them modestly, without trying to make political advantage, as \nsome have done--I am not accusing the Senator from Arkansas of doing \nthis--as some have done in times past.\n  I think this is a completely distinguishable thing from Whitewater, \neven though I understand the distinguished Senator has many friends who \nhave been involved in the investigation and is concerned about them, as \nI would be if I was their Senator. I think, justly, he is raising these \nissues so we will be more sensitive about them in the future. I assure \nmy colleagues I will be sensitive about them.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I think there is another injustice here, \nand that injustice is that we are bringing this measure to the floor of \nthe Senate and we are being precluded from offering any amendments to \nit whatever. We cannot offer any amendments to it.\n  Now, I wonder how defensible that position is by the Senator from \nUtah, when all that I have here is a simple sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. It does not require anything. It does not appropriate one \ndime. It merely says that a legal defense fund should be established to \ncompensate individuals for legal expenses incurred, responding to \nrequests by the committee, and only those individuals who have not been \nnamed, targeted, or convicted in the investigation of the independent \ncounsel related to the Whitewater Development Corp. should be eligible \nfor reimbursement from the fund.\n  Does the Senator from Utah say that he is going to preclude me from \noffering this amendment, this simple sense-of-the-Senate resolution?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am saying that the Senator is already precluded because \nthe trees are filled up.\n  Second, we should just understand here, the reason why the trees were \nfilled is because this is a noncontroversial, bipartisan-supported, I \nthink, 100 to zip vote in the Senate, and some of our colleagues on the \nother side want to load it up with controversial partisan amendments.\n  Frankly, I would just like to pass the bill and find the right \nvehicle to bring up the partisan amendments. With regard to the \nSenator's sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which I think he would have \nto admit would not be binding on anybody, frankly, I think the Senator \nshould take my word that if there are injustices with these people, we \nwill work them out in the future. As chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I do not want any injustices there any more than I do in the \ncase of Billy Dale. Until the investigation is complete, I think it is \nuntoward for us to try to set up or even mention in a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution that we should set up a general fund to take care of \nthese things. We can take care of these things.\n  In the past when we have had injustices, we have come in with special \nbills like this to resolve them. That is the way they ought to be done. \nWe have not resolved all injustices in the past. I know some that \nshould have been but were not. In this case, this is one everyone \nadmits ought to be adjusted, except for 43 Members of the House of \nRepresentatives. I think everybody in the Senate thinks it ought to be \nadjusted and resolved. I personally want to get this resolved. I hope \nmy colleagues will let us do it. I think, of all the things to \nfilibuster, this should not be it.\n\n  I can see other heavyweight bills where there is widespread political \ndisagreement when a filibuster is legitimate. I would be the first to \nsay you have every right to do it. On this bill, I think it is \nunseemly. It smacks of looking like you are trying to protect a White \nHouse when we just want to get it over with, or I want to get it over \nwith and right this wrong. By dragging it out, you are saying you are \nnot willing to right a wrong.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, there is not one Member on this side of the \naisle of the U.S. Senate trying to slow this bill down. We are not \ntrying to slow this bill down. We are trying to offer a simple sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution. We have been locked out. We are not going to \nbe able to offer any amendments to this.\n  Now, another amendment that could slow this bill down--and I assume \nthe Senator from Utah is not going to let this Senator offer that \namendment, talking about ``to right a wrong''--and that is to deal with \nthe GATT loophole, the GATT loophole as it relates to Glaxo and Zantac, \nforcing the seniors of America, forcing the consumers of America and \nthe veterans of America to pay an unreasonable fee for Zantac and other \ndrugs, $5 million a day--$5 million a day. I do not see the Senator\n\n[[Page S4780]]\n\nup here saying we have to right that wrong.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Would you permit me to offer an amendment relative to \nrighting that wrong, to protect the consumers from these unfair drug \nprices?\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, first of all, it is not a \nwrong. The Senate Judiciary Committee just passed a bill out to resolve \nthat----\n  Mr. PRYOR. I want to talk about it.\n  Mr. HATCH. To resolve that matter, 10-7. That is the appropriate way \nto debate this. If the Senator disagrees with that bill, the Senator \ncan do so.\n  I think it is telling here that we have a bill which passed the House \n350 to 43 that the President said he would sign to right this wrong, \nthat my friends on the other side of the aisle are attempting to \nderail.\n  Mr. PRYOR. We are not trying to derail anything.\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure you are, if you vote against cloture. Keep in mind, \nif we have cloture, any relevant amendment--this is amendable by any \nrelevant amendment--if we get cloture, you can bring up any relevant \namendment you want. Of course, the GATT amendment is not relevant. Any \ngermane amendment, I should say.\n\n  I am really concerned that my colleagues on the other side are more \nconcerned about partisanship than righting wrongs. Everybody knows that \nthe GATT amendment which the distinguished Senator has tried to pass \nnow for months and which is heartfelt on both sides, is certainly not \ngermane to this bill. It is not relevant to this bill. It certainly \nwould cloud this bill, as would any other amendment.\n  We want to pass a bill that rights this terrific wrong to Billy Dale \nand to his colleagues.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I hope my colleague will allow me to say \nsomething. No one knows more than the distinguished Senator from Utah \nthat, under some conditions, relevancy does not matter as to an \namendment in the Senate. It does in the House but not in Senate. So set \nthat record straight.\n  Second, the Senator has mentioned that the Judiciary Committee on \nThursday, 10 to 7, passed out the solution to the Glaxo amendment.\n  Mr. President, what this did, this particular measure, I say in all \nrespect to the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the \nJudiciary Committee's proposal to correct the Glaxo issue made matters \nworse for the generic drug companies by adding 20 more months of patent \nprotection for Glaxo and for a handful of drug companies that are \nreaping a $5-million-a-day windfall from our error. That is what the \nbill did. This bill that came from the Judiciary Committee on Thursday \nadded additional obstacles. It added months and perhaps years of court \nlitigation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 12:30 \nhas arrived.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another 30 \nseconds for each of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. What in the world does the Glaxo thing or the Zantac thing \nhave to do with Billy Dale and getting compensation to Billy Dale? Tell \nme, what in the world does it have to do with this bill that everybody \nagrees ought to be passed, including the President?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Because it is based upon the same principle the Senator \nfrom Utah enunciated when he got up to speak. This is to right a wrong. \nThe GATT issue is to right a wrong. I subscribe to that same issue.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, there are two sides to that issue. Thus far, the \nJudiciary Committee has taken a side that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arkansas does not agree with. The fact is, there is a time to \ndebate that bill. Let us bring the bill up and have a full-fledged \ndebate, and I think everybody will realize there is much merit as to \nwhat the Judiciary Committee did.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask unanimous consent that the time before the recesses \nbe extended for 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/07/senate-section/article/S4773-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REAL WELFARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, while the discussion has been interesting, \nI want to bring to the attention of my colleagues an article on Sunday \nwith reference to the President's statement on welfare reform, which I \nthink is very significant. While the Congress tries to come together on \na welfare reform plan, it is very clear that the administration is \ntrying to move forward on its own to get things done which are real \nreform. He said--and I totally agree--``We have to make it clear that a \nbaby doesn't give you a right, and won't give you the money, to leave \nhome and drop out of school.'' The President said that in his weekly \nradio address.\n\n  The Executive order that followed up on that statement, I think, is \nreal welfare reform. What it does is simply require, through Executive \norder, without waiting on the Congress, that States require that teen \nmothers, who are having children, stay at home or live at home in adult \nsupervision, or go to school, and that if they do neither, their \nwelfare benefits would no longer be allowed to continue.\n  With this executive action, all 50 States will now be required to \nkeep teen mothers, who are on welfare and who have children, in school; \nand that for the first time, the administration will now be able to--\nand intends to--audit all of those States to make sure that, in fact, \nthey are doing that.\n  In addition, all 50 States will now be able to provide what are, in \nessence, rewards to encourage those who do stay in school, but also \nsanctions for those who do not. Teen mothers in all 50 States, who have \ndropped out of school, will now have to sign personal responsibility \nplans requiring them to get a job or go to school.\n  The whole idea behind this is self-sufficiency. It is clear that the \nwhole system has not worked. In addition, all 50 States will be \nencouraged to require minor mothers to live at home, or with a \nresponsible adult, in order to receive assistance.\n  Mr. President, it is clear, and we all know that about half of all \nwelfare recipients in our country have their first child as a teenager. \nIf we are really talking about true welfare reform, we have to \nencourage good behavior, staying in school, or living with an adult \nfamily, a mother and father, or a mother, or adult supervisor, to help \nprovide the training for that person.\n  This action by the President is part of an ongoing effort to try and \nreform welfare. The administration has given welfare waivers to allow \nStates to be creative to 37 of our 50 States, allowing them to impose \ntough time limits and tough, new work requirements. The whole idea is \nto be tough on work but good for children. It is high time that the \nCongress enact real welfare reform so that we do not have to continue \nto do it from an administrative standpoint.\n  But this was a very significant decision. I applaud the \nadministration and President for taking it. Last, I think we are making \nsome real progress in putting the welfare system back on the right \ntrack so that people will no longer have to be dependent on it.\n  It is clear, the President said once again, that having a child does \nnot give you a right; it really gives you additional responsibility. \nThis step on the part of the President will ensure that that \nresponsibility on the part of teen mothers, working with adult \nsupervision and going to school, is going to bring about real welfare \nreform.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/07/senate-section/article/S4780-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I and many others are very disappointed we \ncannot move forward on this legislation. I believe this legislation is \nvery important to provide relief for Mr. Dale and six other members of \nthe White House Travel Office. I think it is the right thing to do. To \nme, the bill is a decent gesture that Congress can make to seven \nindividuals who have been forced to endure a tremendous injustice. \nThese people were publicly, knowingly, and wrongly accused of severe \nimproprieties. They had their careers put in jeopardy, their finances \ndevastated and their reputations forever stained for what appears to be \nan effort for personal gain of insiders.\n  Three years ago when Billy Dale and the other members of the Travel \nOffice were fired, the statement released by the White House on the \nfirings was a source of immediate concern. It said:\n\n       Within the Travel Office, we found sort of gross \n     mismanagement, if you will. There is basically very shoddy \n     accounting practices, mismanagement and a number of other \n     things. In order to correct those, we thought it advisable to \n     take immediate action.\n\n  My concern over those firings was certainly not eased when it was \ndisclosed that the Travel Office staff was fired based on an audit that \nwas neither complete nor available to anyone for review. The Travel \nOffice staff was fired and accused of mismanagement without being given \nthe opportunity for a hearing or a chance to clear their names. \nFinally, travel business that was handled by salaried employees of the \nFederal Government previously and done on a noncommissioned basis was \nturned over to a Little Rock travel group.\n  At that time, I was ranking member on the Treasury, Postal \nAppropriations Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the funding \nfor the White House. I sent a personal letter to the President \nrequesting answers to the questions and the reasoning for selecting the \nLittle Rock travel agency.\n  Unfortunately, like so many things from the administration, we did \nnot get straight answers. There were half-truths and misleading \nstatements. What the White House should have done is have the courage \nto tell the public the individuals were fired so that business could be \ngiven to friends of the First Family.\n  But instead, the White House made the decision to question publicly \nthe integrity of seven career civil servants. Unfortunately for Mr. \nDale and his colleagues, they also launched an investigation and a \nprosecution and hid behind the accusations.\n  As one commentator stated:\n\n       The administration tried to transform a prosaic personnel \n     change into an act of moral heroism.\n\n  The President immediately absolved himself saying:\n\n       I had nothing to do with any decision except to save the \n     taxpayers and the press money. The only thing I know is we \n     made a decision to save taxpayers and the press money. That's \n     all I know.\n\n  The First Lady also denied any involvement. Then an embarrassing memo \nwas released from David Watkins in the White House laying the \nresponsibility for the firing squarely at the feet of the First Lady. \nDespite this memo, denials continued from the White House. She \nmaintains that she just ``expressed concern'' regarding mismanagement.\n  The White House remained unflinching in their refusal to admit that \nthe firings had anything to do with anything other than financial \nmismanagement on behalf of the Travel Office staff. It was undoubtedly \nto continue that perception that the White House pushed the Department \nof Justice on to Mr. Dale. They had a very weak case, and they went \nforward nevertheless at a tremendous personal and financial cost to Mr. \nDale.\n  Despite the White House spin and the efforts to lay the blame at the \nfeet of Mr. Dale and his colleagues, the facts have come out. These are \nnot pretty.\n  No. 1, a cousin of the President who had worked on travel during the \ncampaign wanted to head the White House Travel Office.\n  No. 2, a Hollywood friend of the President had an interest in an \nairline charter company that wanted to profit from the White House \nbusiness, and he was not happy the Travel Office was not giving him any \nopportunities.\n  No. 3, the relative of the President and the Hollywood friend \nconcocted stories of corruption and people on the take. The President's \ncousin even took documents and files out of the Office to try to make a \ncase against the Travel Office staff.\n  No. 4, according to the memo from David Watkins, the First Lady said \nwe would have hell to pay if we cannot comply with the First Lady's \nwishes to fire the staff.\n  Finally, the White House made a public statement accusing the staff \nof gross misconduct. The White House, despite longstanding policy to \nthe contrary, without checking with the Department of Justice, \ncontacted and politicized the FBI to try to back up their efforts.\n\n[[Page S4782]]\n\n  Unfortunately, after much personal harassment and great disruption \nand embarrassment to all of the members of the White House travel \nstaff, the punishment did not end there. Mr. Dale was indicted for \nallegedly embezzling funds. But, as all of us now know the jury found \nhim not guilty in less than 2 hours. As the distinguished chairman of \nour Judiciary Committee has noted yesterday, that is usually the amount \nof time it takes most juries to get organized. Talk about an open-and-\nshut case. That one was clearly it.\n  Mr. Dale said after his acquittal he was relieved and prepared to go \non with his life. Unfortunately, that is not what happened. Within \nweeks the Watkins memo surfaced--and it squarely contradicted the sworn \ntestimony of the First Lady before GAO investigators--and the Clinton \ndamage control team went into a full-court press. The White House spin \ndoctors, Anne Lewis, the Clinton campaign, and high-priced Washington \nlawyers, including Mr. Bennett, and even the First Lady herself in \ninterviews, continued to make allegations that had been thrown out in \nthe criminal proceedings against Mr. Dale and the White House staff.\n  I think enough is enough. The dedicated public servants who worked in \nthe Travel Office have suffered enough. I think that this bill is a \nsmall gesture which would not only offer some consolation to these \npeople, but help them get out of the financial hole this whole matter \nhas caused them. It was with great disappointment that we learned that \nthe other side has chosen to filibuster this. My only guess is that \nthis is an effort to save the President the embarrassment of having to \nsign this bill.\n  I urged last week that the majority leader bring this bill to the \nfloor so we could hear arguments against it on the Senate floor. I am \nstill waiting to hear any compelling argument. I appreciate the \nmajority leader having called it up. I hope that one of these days very \nshortly we can get on with doing a very simple act of justice by \nproviding compensation for some of the expenses and costs incurred. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I believe, considering the results of \nthe last vote, where it is very clear that there is a filibuster by the \nopposition to hold this bill up, it is important that the public have a \nchance to weigh in because this is such a political issue here trying \nto avoid this bill coming to the White House to save the President the \nembarrassment of signing it. When there are this much politics in the \nissue, and the public at the grassroots weigh in, they can make a \nconsiderable impact on the legislative process here in the Congress of \nthe United States.\n  This may be one of those times when the public can make a difference, \nbecause this is clearly such a political move by the other side of the \naisle. If politics wins out over right, then in the end wrong wins. It \nseems to me that the public will not want that to happen and they \ncannot allow that to stand.\n  This is such a clear-cut issue. First of all, there are seven \nemployees involved that were fired. We have already taken legislative \naction for the others, but for Mr. Dale, no, because at the time we \ntook action for the others, his trial was pending. Mr. Dale was \nsubsequently then found not guilty by the jury.\n  So now we are taking action to do for Mr. Dale the same as we did for \neverybody else. There was not any debate in this body whatsoever over \nthe action that we took on the others. It went through \nnoncontroversial. The situation with Mr. Dale should be handled the \nsame way. It should have gone through here in what we call wrapup at \nthe end of the day and do it where we do all the noncontroversial \nmeasures.\n  But what we have seen today is politics at its best--politics at its \nbest in the sense that the stonewalling is at its best, to see \nsomething that is right not to go on, not to go through, because there \nmight be some embarrassment for the President. The Democrats want to \nprotect the President from that embarrassment. Today what we have seen \nis kind of a drive-by sabotage of this effort to right the wrong that \nhas been conducted against Mr. Dale, because he was unfairly, \nwrongfully fired.\n  Maybe there is no question he could have been fired, but the point is \nhow the White House has tried to explain it and supposedly explain it \naway as a legitimate way of doing business. All the harm that has come \nto the family, not only of the employee who was fired, but the family \nbecause they have been wrongly treated, wrongly treated by a person who \nought to know because he preaches the communitarian spirit that we \nought to have one toward the other. That is what the President of the \nUnited States preaches.\n  We ought to have charity. This does not show the charity that the \nPresident preaches that we all ought to have one toward the other when \nsomebody is wrongfully fired, when you bring the FBI and the Justice \nDepartment to bring a guy to trial. Then he has gotten off, and then we \nare trying to right that wrong by covering the legal expenses of Mr. \nDale. It is wrong for the other side, acting at the behest of the White \nHouse, to avoid embarrassment for  the  White  House  for  this  all  \nto  go on and then at the other time preach a spirit of charity and \ncommunitarianism towards one another in this country.\n  The whole effort is being sabotaged. Worse yet, it is being sabotaged \nwithout even the other side engaging in much debate on the issue. They \nhave really succeeded in legislative harassment of Mr. Dale, the same \nsort of harassment, just in another environment, that has been done \nagainst Mr. Dale by the White House, by the Justice Department, by the \nIRS. Thus continues, as I see it, the White House campaign to avoid \nembarrassment on this issue.\n  It is very clearly a clear-cut, right-versus-wrong issue. Politics \nhas won out this day. The President continues to avoid responsibility \nfor his actions. The victims continue to be wronged. That is why when \nit is so clear-cut, when our judicial system has cleared somebody, then \nI think it is a time for the American people to weigh in.\n  I ask the American people to make their voices heard on this issue, \nto hold the President's feet to the fire. Even if you are a Democrat \nout there in Main Street America, it seems to me that you want your \nPresident to do what is right. What is right is to sign this \nlegislation, to call off the hordes on Capitol Hill that are preventing \nthis measure from coming to a vote, and have the President demonstrate \nhis charitable attitude that he preaches. Tell the President of the \nUnited States to show moral leadership, to do the right thing, to sign \nthis bill.\n  Lastly, if politics wins in this instance, then it wins over right. \nWhen that happens, politics wins over right, then wrong wins. The \npublic cannot allow this to stand.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk \nproceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/07/senate-section/article/S4780-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4782-S4783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REPEAL THE GASOLINE TAX\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, there is a growing concern in our country \nabout the rise of fuel prices, the rise of gasoline prices. Obviously, \nthe President shares this concern. We have committee hearings underway. \nWe have studies. We have investigations.\n  We all know that there is only one thing we can do that is going to \nbring down gasoline prices immediately. In fact, we have the capacity, \nby acting now, to bring down the cost of filling up the gas tank on \nyour car, on your van, on your truck. We can save you about $1 a fill-\nup by repealing the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline that was adopted \nin 1993.\n  That gasoline tax increase did not go to build new highways; it went \nto general revenue. What we would like to do today is repeal that \ngasoline tax. We would like to repeal that tax on highway gasoline, on \nhighway diesel fuel, on railroad diesel fuel, on inland waterway diesel \nfuel, on aviation gasoline, on noncommercial jet fuel, and on \ncommercial jet fuel. We would like to repeal that 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax \non each of those fuels, do it today and have that repeal in effect \nuntil the end of the year, giving us an opportunity to write a budget \nand to institute a permanent repeal as part of that new budget.\n\n[[Page S4783]]\n\n  It would be our goal today to pay for this loss of revenue by cutting \nthe overhead and travel budget of the Energy Department and by selling \na very small part of the spectrum, something that the President has \nsupported at a level of $38 billion of sales, something that the \nCongress is on record in favor of. On a $19 billion sale, we would have \nroughly a $2 billion sale as part of this package.\n  If you want to bring down the price of gasoline at the pump, if you \nwant, by Friday morning, to have every filling station in America going \nout, opening for business, bringing down their posted price by 4.3 \ncents a gallon, saving every motorist in America about $1 when they \nfill up their tank, there is only one thing we can do, and that is \nrepeal this tax on gasoline.\n  I hope we can do it today. I hope the House can act quickly, that the \nPresident will sign it, that we can grant relief. What a great thing it \nwould be to do it on tax freedom day, when the average American family \nhas worked from January 1 until today just to pay taxes.\n  For the first time this year, they are working for themselves. Today \nwould be an excellent day to repeal this tax, to give relief to \nmotorists and, in the process, let working families keep more of what \nthey earn.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I particularly thank the Senator from Texas, \nwho first raised this issue several weeks ago, and I thank him for his \nleadership. I think it would be an excellent day, since today is tax \nfreedom day. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement here.\n  I think repeal of the gas tax will pass. The Senator from Texas has \noutlined how we pay for it--the spectrum sales, which is about $2.5 \nbillion in savings, and the Energy Department, about $800 million over \nthe next 7 years. This would repeal it through the end of this year, \nand the Budget Committee would then come forth with repeal thereafter.\n  I also add that, of course, it is tax freedom day, and a lot of \npeople have noted that. I am not certain how many taxpayers have \nthought about it, but, as the Senator from Texas pointed out, tomorrow \nthey are sort of on their own. For the first 128 days, they have been \nworking for the local, State, and Federal Government, just to pay their \ntaxes. That is on the average.\n  Since President Clinton came on board, we have added 1 week to that \nbecause of the big, big tax increase in 1993 of $265 billion to $268 \nbillion. So it has already been extended. You have to work an extra \nweek, after 3 years of President Clinton, to get to tax freedom day.\n  Some would say, well, 4.3 cents is not really worth it. I think that, \nfrom the standpoint of sending a signal to the American people, we are \nserious about tax reduction, serious about tax freedom day. It is not \njust a day to make an appearance somewhere or make a statement on the \nSenate floor. We are serious about it.\n  As the Senator from Texas pointed out, this 4.3 cents is not going \nfor highways, or bridges, or mass transit, or construction of any kind. \nIt is going for deficit reduction. I have voted for tax increases in \nthe past, as has been pointed out by my colleagues on the other side, \nto build highways and bridges. That is what we thought the fuel taxes \nwere all about.\n  In 1990, for a very short period of time, we had to divide a 5-cent \ntax increase between the deficit and the trust fund so that we could \nget our colleagues on the other side to go along with the budget \nagreement of 1990. That would have expired at the end of 5 years. But \nbefore that expiration date occurred, the big tax bill of 1993 took \nthat 5 cents and put it all in the trust fund, but then added 4.3 cents \nto deficit reduction. Therein lies the problem of today. We have a \npermanent 4.3 cents gas tax for deficit reduction.\n\n  The people who build highways, who travel our highways, and use mass \ntransit can understand if you are doing it to make the highway safer, \nfor better transportation, better highways, and mass transit, but not \ndeficit reduction. So we need to cut taxes for the average family. We \nalso need to go back and look at some of the things that were vetoed \nlast year, such as the $500-per-child tax credit, the expanded IRA's, \ntax relief for education expenses, estate tax relief for family \nbusinesses, marriage penalty relief, and a whole host of things we \nthink are good incentives and should be adopted and would create jobs \nand opportunities.\n  American families--at least the ones I visit with--think they are \npaying enough in taxes. As I said, they are paying a lot more because \nof the legislation that was passed in 1993, without a Republican vote \nin the House or the Senate.\n  So today I am introducing, along with Senator Gramm, and others, \nlegislation repealing the 1993 gas tax hike. I am going to ask in a \nmoment unanimous consent to bring the gas tax repeal to a vote on the \ntaxpayer bill of rights. The taxpayer bill of rights 2 is pending at \nthe desk. We can bring that up, offer an amendment, have 30 minutes of \ndebate, and vote on it. It would then go to the House, and we will have \nrepealed the 4.3-cent gas tax.\n  I hope we can have an agreement on this. It seems to me that we know \nit is going to pass. It is going to happen one of these days. It may as \nwell happen today, as the Senator from Texas pointed out, on tax \nfreedom day. So this would be a good day to indicate that we are \nserious about it.\n  There is some question as to whether the repeal would result in lower \ngas prices for consumers. On Friday, I was in Virginia at an Exxon \nstation with Senator Warner, Congressman Tom Davis, and others, and we \nwere assured by the owner of the station--in fact, he is the owner of \nseveral Exxon stations--that, obviously, it was their intent to pass \nthe 4.3 cents on to consumers. That is how they do business. They know \ntheir customers, and the customers are going to know whether or not it \nhas been passed on to them.\n  Our amendment is drafted to ensure that this happens by providing an \nimmediate tax cut against other applicable excise taxes. We also \nrequire that the Departments of Justice, Treasury, and Energy study \nfuel prices in June, July, and August 1996, to determine whether the \ngas tax repeal is passed through to consumers. Those Departments would \nbe required to report back to Congress by September 30.\n\n  We also propose a sense of the Congress that the benefits of the gas \ntax repeal be made immediately available to consumers. So we have \nlistened to the concerns expressed by our colleagues. We had the same \nconcerns. We believe the benefits will go to the consumers. Just to \nmake certain and erase any doubt or skepticism, we have added these \nprovisions.\n  Repealing the 1993 gas tax will cut driving costs for families who \ndrive to work, to school, to worship, or on vacation. There are many \nreasons for the skyrocketing gas prices. Maybe they will go up. We are \nnot suggesting that the repeal of the gas tax is going to put the halt \nto rising gas prices, but they will be at least 4.3 cents less. It is \none way of cut driving costs for American families and businesses. I \nthink it is something we should do, something we will do. Also, we \nwould like to scrap--and at the appropriate time we will talk about it, \nlater this year--the current tax system and replace it with a flatter, \nfairer, and simpler system that no longer discourages savings and \ninvestment, economic growth, and job creation.\n  So I urge my colleagues not to object, so we can get on with the work \nof debating this. It should not take long. It is a fairly clear-cut \nissue at stake. I will now propound the unanimous-consent request, and \nI understand the distinguished Democratic leader may have some request \nof his own. I propound this request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/07/senate-section/article/S4782-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4783-S4786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 2337\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 374, H.R. 2337, an act to \nprovide for increased taxpayer protections; that one amendment be in \norder to the measure, which will be offered by the majority leader, \nregarding the gas tax repeal; that no other amendments or motions be in \norder, other than a motion to table; further, that immediately \nfollowing the disposition of the Dole-Gramm amendment, the bill be read\n\n[[Page S4784]]\n\nthe third time, and the Senate proceed to passage of the measure, as \namended, if amended, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, let me \nbegin by saying that I believe this whole effort has a lot more to do \nwith politics than the price of gasoline. We all know what is going on \nhere. We all recognize what day it is.\n  We all ought to recognize, as well, that this is the first time in \nour recent history--perhaps in 100 years--that we have been able to \nreduce the deficit for 4 years in a row--4 years in a row.\n  So, Mr. President, we find ourselves in a situation here where, \nbecause we were able to show some courage and send the right message to \nthe American people 4 years ago with regard to meaningful deficit \nreduction, now the American people are less in debt and have less \ndifficulty visualizing ultimate success with regard to a real balanced \nbudget than they have had in generations.\n  So, Mr. President, a lot of our colleagues are very concerned about \nwhat this really means. If we can find so convenient an offset, what is \nwrong with dedicating that offset to real deficit reduction, rather \nthan a gesture which may or may not help the American consumer?\n  I reserve the right to object now because, I must tell you, I am not \nconvinced that a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which is all this is, \nwith regard to ensuring that the consumer gets the benefit, is going to \nprovide any confidence to anybody out there. We cannot accept a simple \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution as our only message to the American \nconsumer that indeed they are going to benefit. With every 1-cent \ndecrease in the tax, we are talking about a billion dollars in new \nprofit to the oil companies.\n  And so, Mr. President, because we do not have that assurance, because \nwe really think this merits some debate, I would ask that Senator \nDole's request be modified to permit other amendments to be offered \nfrom our side of the aisle. Otherwise, this will be the fifth or sixth \nbill to which Democrats are completely precluded from offering any \namendments.\n  We cannot accept that. If we want to serve in the House, we ought to \nbe in the House. If we want to serve in the Senate, we ought to have a \ngood and open debate about this bill and all other bills that come \nbefore us. That is what the Senate process is all about.\n  So unless we can ensure that other amendments will be offered, then I \nwould object, but I will offer that as a modification and ask unanimous \nconsent.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is asking unanimous consent to \nmodify the unanimous-consent request----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Of the Senator from Kansas?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will reserve the right to object.\n  First of all, if the amendment is to make certain that the savings \nare passed on to the consumers, I am not certain how that is going to \nbe implemented. I cannot imagine how the Federal Government can in \nevery case determine that in every service station in America--I do not \nknow how many thousands there are--savings are passed on to the \nconsumer. That might take an army of additional Federal employees.\n  We do require in our bill that the Department of Justice, Treasury, \nand Energy study fuel prices and make certain it is passed through and \nreport back to Congress by September 30.\n  I assume, if we found cases of price gouging, then we could take \nappropriate action. I do not know how we would do it in advance, how we \nwould monitor, police such an effort all across America. So I do not \nknow what else--we did it to indicate our concern, too. Obviously, \nconsumers want to get a price decrease. They are not looking for repeal \nof the tax and then nothing changes for the consumer.\n  So I say if the amendment is with reference to the gas tax, we might \nbe able to reach some accommodation, but I assume the Senator has in \nmind other amendments that reach far beyond the gas tax. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader will yield to allow me to \nrespond, the answer is in the affirmative. Obviously, we have attempted \nin good faith to offer the minimum wage amendment to a number of other \nbills simply because, as the minority, we do not have the opportunity \nto have an up-or-down vote on the minimum wage. Studies have shown that \nan increase in the minimum wage provide over 100 times more benefit to \nthe consumer and to the average working family than this meager amount \nof tax relief will provide.\n  So what is wrong with having a good debate on this and other \namendments? That is really the essence of the Senate. It is to have a \ndebate about amendments, offered by the minority or the majority, to \nimprove legislation--make it more responsive to people. We are simply \ntrying as best we can to protect our rights in this case as we have in \nso many other cases. That seems to me to be the price of working \nthrough legislation on this bill and on other bills.\n  So, yes, it is our intention to offer the minimum wage amendment and \nother amendments to this bill as the current majority did when they \nwere in the minority.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object, I \nhave thought about this a great deal. I would be prepared to go, I \nthink, further than many of my colleagues would be prepared to go. We \nwould call up another revenue bill--and there are some on the calendar, \nI guess; H.R. 2684 comes to mind--and modify the text of that with the \nrepeal of the gas tax and that would be considered, 1 hour of debate--I \nknow the Senator from Massachusetts would only take 30 minutes on the \nminimum wage proposal; it is in the Record a couple of times--and then \nI would offer an amendment which would be the amendment discussed by \nthe Senator from Massachusetts on minimum wage, 45 cents and then 45 \ncents, which would raise it from $4.25 to $5.15, and we would add to \nthat the so-called TEAM Act.\n\n  So it would be repeal of the gas tax, the minimum wage proposal \ntendered by my colleagues on the other side, with the TEAM Act, and we \nwould have 1 hour on that and then we would vote.\n  Now, that seems to me to address all the concerns raised by my \ncolleagues on the other side. It would be the win-win that I read about \nover the weekend. You would have repeal of the gas tax, and you would \nalso have the adoption of the minimum wage which would take you to \n$5.15. I am not certain it could be done by July 1. It will take \nprobably longer than that to implement the first increase, and then the \nsecond increase would take place a year from then.\n  So if that offer would be acceptable to the Democratic leader, it \nseems to me that would answer all of his concerns; it is the minimum \nwage proposal discussed on the other side of the aisle; it is the gas \ntax repeal that I think many of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle would vote for, and it would contain a measure reported out of \nthe Labor Committee called the TEAM Act.\n  I think that might be one way to resolve this, and we would have that \ndebate, have it this afternoon, repeal the gas tax, pass the minimum \nwage, and send it on to the House. We would be happy to do that at this \npoint.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just respond briefly, and I know \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is prepared to respond as \nwell. We have discussed as many scenarios as the imagination will \nallow. This is yet another iteration.\n  Basically, all we have said is that we want an up-or-down, clean \nvote. There are a lot of scenarios that could bring that about. This is \nanother example. Senator Lott and I have discussed many different ways \nin which to do this. But we still have not been given the assurance \nthat we could have an up-or-down vote on freestanding legislation. So \nif the majority leader is now proposing that as an option, not marrying \nthe two but have them freestanding, we will consider that. That is not \nmy understanding, however. I will yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the distinguished majority leader yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield to the Senator from Texas, and then I will be happy \nto\n\n[[Page S4785]]\n\nyield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the tragedy of this thing is that 23 \npercent of this gasoline tax we are trying to repeal today is paid by \nfamilies that make less than $20,000 a year. So whatever we are going \nto do in the future about allowing management and employees to get \ntogether and talk about safety measures, something that I think makes \nperfectly good sense--I understand the National Labor Relations Board \nintervened and stopped companies from talking about safety clothing for \npregnant women, and that is what the TEAM Act is trying to provide, to \nallow supervisors and workers to get together as teams--I am for that.\n  I know the distinguished minority leader is for raising the minimum \nwage. The point is we can today cut the gasoline tax by 4.3 cents a \ngallon, we can lower the cost of filling up your tank by the end of the \nweek by a dollar a tank and 23 percent of those savings will go to \nfamilies that make less than $20,000 a year.\n  Can we not do this one thing to help the very people whom we say we \nare helping with these other provisions? Can we not move ahead with \nthis one provision today and debate these other provisions tomorrow? I \ndo not see why we want to hold this up. The American people are \nstrongly for it. I have heard the distinguished minority leader say \nthat he does not object. We could pass this today. The House could pass \nit tomorrow. The President could sign it on Thursday. And Friday \nmorning when filling stations all over America open, the posted price \ncould come down by 4.3 cents a gallon, saving a dollar a tank for \nworking people.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator from Texas yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I do not control the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader controls the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. My point is that this is something that helps everybody, \nand 23 percent of the benefits of repealing this gasoline tax accrue to \npeople who make $20,000 or less. Let us help them today and then we can \ndebate whether something else helps or hurts tomorrow.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I just say that we would like, of course, first of all, to \njust pass the repeal of the gas tax today. We have the taxpayer bill of \nrights at the desk. We can amend that and send it back to the House, as \nI said earlier. I think it would be an overwhelming vote. We have it \npaid for. We are not going to add to the deficit. Keep in mind, this \n4.3 cents does not go to highways or mass transit; it goes to deficit \nreduction and that is the big difference.\n\n  But in response to the indication from the distinguished Democratic \nleader that they would like to offer additional amendments, it occurred \nto me if we are prepared to repeal the gas tax, which I think a \nmajority of both sides are for here, and are prepared to bring up the \nminimum wage that the other side has talked for, but with just little \namendment called a TEAM Act, we ought to be able to come together on \nthis. Everything they want is in the package, except we have one little \npiece. The TEAM Act amends Federal labor laws to make clear that \nemployers and employees may meet together in committee or other \nemployee involvement programs to address issues of mutual interest.\n  Who could be opposed to that, the employers and employees sitting \ndown and talking about issues related to quality, productivity and \nefficiency, as long as they do not engage in collective bargaining? Who \nis opposed to this? Guess. The labor bosses. When the labor bosses say, \n``We are opposed,'' it reverberates on the Senate floor.\n  So we are ready to, I guess, accommodate our colleagues on the other \nside in nearly every instance except in this one area. We would hope we \ncould have an agreement. We could go ahead and finish this afternoon; \nhave a couple of hours debate and pass it. If we cannot pass it, just \nrepeal the gas tax in itself, then let us double up and repeal the gas \ntax, pass the minimum wage with the TEAM Act added to it, and send it \non to the House. It seems to me that would be one way to satisfy \nconcerns of Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I am sure the Senator is aware that \nthe value for the average family with the 4.3-cent elimination of the \ngas tax, if it is passed on--and I think, as has been pointed out here, \nthere is no guarantee it would be passed on--would be about $28 a year. \nThe increase in the minimum wage is $1,800 a year, for those who are \nworking on the bottom of the ladder. So the idea that was suggested by \nthe Senator from Texas that ``why do we not just do what we can this \nafternoon and leave that to future times?'' is, I think, unpersuasive.\n  Let me ask the leader, as I understand, on the measure that is \ncurrently before the Senate, H.R. 2937, the reimbursement of the White \nHouse Travel Office employees, as I understand from the parliamentary \nsituation, it is not in order for either the minority leader or myself \nto offer the minimum wage amendment on that. Am I correct on that? Am I \ncorrect?\n  Mr. DOLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am correct on it. Now, as I understand it, the \nproposal that is being put forward by the majority leader in effect \nwould foreclose any opportunity under his unanimous consent agreement \nearlier to have any up-or-down vote on independent legislation with \nregards to the increase in the minimum wage.\n  Mr. DOLE. It contains the increase you suggested in the minimum wage, \n45 cents and 45 cents.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just finally, I am puzzled by the need for attention--\nfor cooperation that the Senator points out, because, under Senator \nKassebaum's bill, under the findings, she points out that employee \ninvolvement, which operates successfully in both unionized and \nnonunionized settings, has been established by over 80 percent of \nemployers, the largest employers in the United States, and exists in \n30,000 workplaces.\n  That is already in effect at the present time, according to Senator \nKassebaum's findings. In her report it says the survey found that 75 \npercent of responding employers, large and small, incorporate some \nmeans of employee involvement in their operations. Among larger \nemployers, where there are about 5,000 or more employees, the \npercentage was at 96 percent.\n  So I am just wondering, while many of us wonder about the wisdom of \nputting in the law another piece of legislation that is unnecessary, \nwhy we ought to confuse that with the proposal of an increase in the \nminimum wage which the overwhelming majority of the American people \nsupport, and, in fact, the leader himself has supported four out of \nfour times--opposed it eight times in the past but has voted in favor \nof it in the past, and obviously thought it was meritorious then. Why \nshould we wait for an early resolution of that issue, rather than to \nfollow the suggestions of the leader? Is the leader telling us that is \nthe only way we are going to have an opportunity to address this issue?\n  Mr. DOLE. If the Senator will yield, I guess it is the other way \naround. Your leader is telling us the only way we can move the Senate \non anything is to vote on your version of the minimum wage.\n  We have a majority in this body. We have some responsibility to \nadvance legislation, and there is a lot of it on the calendar we would \nlike to advance, including reconsideration of the constitutional \namendment for a balanced budget and other matters that have a great \nimpact. We have tried to work it out in discussion. Maybe I understand \nwhy it cannot be worked out. But it seems to me we have now suggested--\nif we cannot do it today just with my first request, then I am prepared \nto make a second request that would deal both with the minimum wage and \nthe TEAM Act and the gas tax repeal.\n  The TEAM Act, we are advised by the committee that it is necessary \nbecause of the 1992 National Labor Relations Board decision. I do not \nsee what is wrong with employers talking to employees, but the unions \ndo not like it. The labor bosses do not want their people talking to \nanybody in management. So they have sent the word down we cannot have \nthis, and if we have to filibuster this, we will filibuster this.\n\n[[Page S4786]]\n\n  The facts were pointed out by the Senator from Massachusetts--what \ndifference does it make if we have it codified? So we are prepared to \ntake it up right now and pass the bill. But if my colleagues on the \nother side want to filibuster their minimum wage proposal and repeal of \nthe gas tax, then they certainly are going to have that opportunity \nstarting tomorrow.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield to my colleague, the Democratic \nleader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I admire the majority leader a great \ndeal, as he knows. We all know what he is trying to do.\n  We all know that the President, for good reason, opposes the TEAM \nAct, especially in its current form. Why? Because it gives license to \ncompanies to set up rump organizations to negotiate with themselves. \nThat is what this is all about. This is not talking to employees. As \nthe Senator from Massachusetts has indicated, they can do that right \nnow. What they cannot do is set up rump organizations to negotiate with \nthemselves and claim some new victory here. That is what this is all \nabout.\n  So that is what I said earlier, if you will recall. I said if the \ndistinguished majority leader is prepared to separate the issues, the \nTEAM Act and minimum wage, so we are not amending a bill that is going \nnowhere, we will take a look at that. But that is not what I understood \nto be the suggestion here.\n  So, again, as I said, we want to be real here. If we can be real--if \nwe can come up with a scenario that we know will really work--then we \nare prepared to negotiate in good faith and come to some resolution \nhere. But to add this amendment to a bill that the distinguished leader \nknows is going nowhere is not a deal at all.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, will the Senator yield \nfor one moment?\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am rather new at this, but it seems to me, \nwhen you get what you want plus you get a little icing on the cake, you \nget to vote to repeal the gas tax, you ought to take it. But now we are \ntold--I did not know the President was opposed to this. I thought \ncertainly he would be flexible on something like this. He probably is. \nBut I know the labor unions have been in town and they dumped $35 \nmillion into different races, and they have certain priorities. I \nthought their priority was passing a minimum wage increase, not killing \nthe TEAM Act, which is really minor. It is minor legislation.\n\n  So here we are prepared--I will probably get a lot of criticism on \nthis side for doing this, but I am prepared to make this very generous \noffer to give my colleagues on the other side of the aisle a chance to \nvote to repeal the gas tax and to have their minimum wage proposal \nadopted. Who could be opposed to that? All we ask for is just one \nsmall, one little amendment. It probably would be hardly noticed by \nanybody. It simply says that employees can talk to management. They can \ntalk about--in one case, they were talking about no smoking policies, \nand that was a violation of the NLRB. It seems to me we need to have a \nlittle common sense enter this debate.\n  I have listened. I have been persuaded by the Senator from \nMassachusetts we ought to take 30 minutes and pass a minimum wage, and \nwe can add another 30 minutes for the repeal of the gas tax. Then we \nwill put in 10 minutes for this little, tiny piece that nobody really \ncares about called the TEAM Act. Then we would have a package that we \ncould all be proud of and we could accommodate the concerns of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle--I hope. I have discussed \nthis with the majority whip. I think he is willing. I think my other \ncolleagues may not be so willing, but they are prepared to accept this \nprocedure if we can only convince our friends on the other side that we \nare now willing to give them what they want if they will just say yes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will simply state----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the majority leader yield for a brief intervention \nfor one question?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would urge my leader to accept that proposal if the \nSenator would be willing to say that the workers will be selected by \nthe employees rather than by the boss of the company. If you want to \nadd that, I urge we move on ahead and get on with the business. That \nseems to me to be reasonable, that those who are going to represent \nworkers will be selected by workers instead of the company. If the \nmajority leader wants to make that as an amendment to give support to \nthe TEAM Act, I urge we accept that this afternoon.\n  Mr. DOLE. The bill already ensures workers will retain the right to \nchoose an independent union in the case of collective bargaining. I \nwill be happy to consult my colleague, Senator Kassebaum, chairman of \nthe Labor Committee, and run that by her and see what she thinks of it. \nI have not discussed that. I hope we will not scuttle this whole \npackage over some little modification that may or may not be necessary.\n  So we are prepared now, or a half hour from now, to proceed, and I \nknow my colleague from South Dakota--I guess maybe to clear up the \npresent point, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are two unanimous-consent requests \npending.\n  Mr. DOLE. I object.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. And I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to both, and the majority \nleader has the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I want to ask a question. It is a legitimate question. If \nwe can all--almost all can--agree that the minimum wage increase is a \ngood idea, the repeal of the gas tax is a good idea, and the passage of \nthe TEAM legislation, as the majority leader described it, is a good \nidea, why should we not just take these up separately, debate them \nseparately and vote on them separately? The ones that are good will \npass, and the ones not good will not pass. What is wrong with doing \nthem separately?\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me make it clear, some of my colleagues do not think \nminimum wage is a good idea. I read some of your colleagues feel the \nrepeal of the gas tax is not a good idea and some of your colleagues \nfeel the TEAM Act is not a good idea. So if you put them all together, \nit is not quite the good idea as taking them up separately, but when \nthey are together, it becomes a fair idea that will get us enough votes \nto pass.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will wait until the majority leader is finished.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as I understand, everything has been \nobjected to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. So where are we?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/07/senate-section/article/S4783-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4786-S4791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WHITE HOUSE TRAVEL OFFICE LEGISLATION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. H.R. 2937 is the business.\n  Mr. DOLE. That is the Billy Dale legislation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Massachusetts, we \ncan arrange to modify, chop a limb off the tree here, if we can agree \non an amendment process.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Why do we not just accept the pending amendment, which \nwill open up the slot, and let us offer the minimum wage?\n  Mr. DOLE. We could not do that, but I think we can work out \nsomething. If you would rather have it on the Billy Dale travel matter \njust by itself, we can probably accommodate. But based on what the \nSenator from Massachusetts indicated--and I think we are closer maybe \nthan we have been--I am going to ask the majority whip if he would \nvisit with the Senator from Massachusetts. Let me again indicate, I did \nnot think we would be rejected when\n\n[[Page S4787]]\n\nwe offered our colleagues what they wanted. But we have been rejected. \nSo we will try maybe a different approach. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum, unless you want to go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are obviously in a situation now where \nnothing is going to get done. I think the President's answer to the \nquestion is the right one. We are not going to get anything done. We \nare not going to get the Travel Office issue done, we are not going to \nget the gas issue done, we are not going to get the Amtrak \nauthorization or anything else done until we can resolve this impasse.\n  I know the majority leader is acting in good faith to try to find a \nway with which to do that, but we will remain committed to ensuring our \nrights as the minority to offer these amendments until we can have that \nassurance.\n  I think the distinguished Senator from Louisiana said it as clearly \nas anyone can. If they are good bills, regardless of whether there is \nopposition, you could argue about the merits of the bill, but they are \nbills offered in good faith. They ought to be voted up or down, \nindependently of one another. Mixing them, as is now being proposed, \nclearly obfuscates the question and ultimately defeats the purpose.\n  I hope we can recognize that instead of continuing to be mired in \nabsolute paralysis. We do not want to continue that. We want to find a \nway out, but we are not going to give up our rights. We are certainly \nnot going to give up the opportunities we need to raise the issues we \ncare deeply about.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think there is probably one more \nrefinement we could make, and then if cloture was invoked on the \namendment, the Dole amendment, then we could divide the issue: division \nI being minimum wage and division II being the TEAM Act, and then we \ncould have a separate vote on each of those.\n  It seems to me that would be going one step further, and then if \nthere were majority votes for the TEAM Act, that prevails, and if there \nare majority votes for minimum wage, then there are separate votes on \neach issue, if that will resolve the problem.\n  My view is, if my colleagues in the minority are entitled to vote on \nwhat they want, why are not my colleagues in the majority entitled to \nvote on what they want to vote on? We are told we cannot pass anything \nunless those in the minority vote on what they want to vote on. I had \nproblems at the policy luncheon explaining that to my colleagues in the \nmajority. The minority has that right. Do we have that right to vote on \nwhat we want to vote on? It should not be debatable.\n  So maybe there is another way we can attack it, and we will certainly \nlook for that. We would like to resolve this issue today if we can. Tax \nfreedom day does not end until midnight, so we have several hours here. \nI will ask the majority whip to get to work and see what we can come up \nwith.\n  It was our mutual understanding that legislation on the gas tax \nrepeal through December 31 of this year would be offered today. Due to \nongoing negotiations on the spectrum language in the bill, I hope that \nlanguage will be prepared for introduction tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for \nthe minority leader in this exchange effectively. But as he has pointed \nout, we are foreclosed from offering any amendments to H.R. 2937, which \nis before the Senate. We were foreclosed from offering amendments on \nthe illegal immigration bill. We had cloture imposed and the request \nthat was made would have foreclosed us from any opportunity of voting \non minimum wage or on the gas tax repeal legislation.\n  I want to say, quite frankly, I understand the position which has \nbeen taken by the majority leader where he says, ``Well, if the \nmajority wants to vote, why shouldn't the majority vote?'' The problem \nis the minority happens to be the majority with regard to minimum wage. \nWe have the majority of the U.S. Senate on the issue of the minimum \nwage. That is the reason that the majority ought to be able to vote and \nnot be denied that opportunity to do so.\n  I, quite frankly, with all respect, find it exceedingly difficult to \nunderstand the rationale for denying us the opportunity to deal with \nthis issue up or down. We have done it in the past. The majority leader \nhas voted in favor of that legislation in the past four times since he \nhas been in the House and the Senate. He has voted against it eight \ntimes. He has voted for it in the seventies and eighties. We had hoped \nhe would vote for it in the 1990's. That legislation, it is my \nunderstanding, were separate pieces of legislation. That is all we are \nasking, do what we have done before and permit the Senate to address \nit.\n  So, Mr. President, it is important to know that we have every \nintention of offering that amendment on every piece of legislation that \nis going to come through here. We can go through these gymnastics in \nterms of denying Members the opportunity to raise issues and present \nthem to the Senate, although that is inconsistent with the great \ntraditions of the Senate over a long period of time. Maybe that is the \nway it is going to be run at the present time, but that is certainly \ninconsistent with the Senate that I have seen here, both under \nRepublican and Democratic leaders, for over a period of some 30 years.\n  I hope that we will have the opportunity to work out this impasse \nbecause, basically, all we are talking about is trying to provide for \nworking families who work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year the \nopportunity to get a livable wage to provide for themselves and their \nfamilies. There is a great deal of rhetoric on this floor about the \nimportance of work, and yet we have a key opportunity to do something \nto reward work, working families, which we have done under Republicans \nand Democrats alike over the history of time, and for over 60 years, \nand yet we are being denied that opportunity to do so now. I think that \nis often a tenable, unfair position to assume.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am more than glad to get into a discussion \non the action of the TEAM Act. As I mentioned earlier, even from the \nexisting findings by our committee, it indicated this kind of \ncooperation is taking place today with some 80 percent of the largest \nemployers. From those surveyed, 75 percent of responding employers, \nlarge and small, have incorporated means of employee involvement in \ntheir operations. That is happening at the present time.\n  The question is whether those who are going to be representing the \nemployees are going to be the representatives selected by the employees \nor whether they are going to be selected by the company store or the \ncompany union. That is the basic issue. No one is against cooperation. \nWe are in complete support for cooperation. With all respect, the case \nin 1992, the Electromation case, does not deny the opportunity for that \nkind of cooperation.\n  We have supported that type of cooperation that we have seen in the \nState of Washington where employers and employees worked effectively \ntogether to reduce occupational health and safety risks and have seen \nabout a 38- or 40-percent reduction in workers' compensation, and the \nassociated industries in that State have said that it saved \nmanufacturers about $1 billion over the last 6, 7 years.\n  That is happening today. That is happening today. We are all for \nthat. That can take place today. It is happening in the State of \nWashington and the State of Oregon. Basically, what this proposal is is \nan antiworker and an antiunion kind of a proposal. I do not question \nthat that is the position of the majority. They have been opposed to \nthe minimum wage. They are opposed to Davis-Bacon to try to provide a \nconstruction worker with an average of $27,000 a year. They oppose \nthat.\n  They put further restrictions on the earned-income tax credit which \nis for workers making below $25,000, $27,000 a year, a program that \nPresident Reagan warmly endorsed as the best antipoverty program that \ncan help have a positive impact on children. They are against that \nparticular program as well. They have come out here with\n\n[[Page S4788]]\n\nopening up the pension programs for workers to permit corporations to \ntake those pensions that did not belong to the corporations. We voted \non that, and in spite of the fact we voted on it, the same provision \ncame right back out after the conference.\n  The families of workers have taken it on the chin with the proposed \nreduction in education programs, the largest one that we have had in \nthe history of the country, which we have defeated, and also the \nassaults on the increase in the Medicare Program and standards for \nnursing homes on Medicaid. These are the parents of working families.\n\n  So the idea that we have under the proposal of cooperation, the TEAM \nAct, and to say, ``Look, all we want to be able to do is, in a \ncompetitive society, permit workers and employers to be able to work \ntogether to increase productivity,'' that is taking place all over this \ncountry. The report from our Committee on Human Resources indicates \nthat, not only in the bill itself, in the findings, but also in the \nreport.\n  There is something more behind it. And that is, instead of the \nworkers being able to be chosen by their fellow workers to represent \ntheir interests, the boss gets a chance to do it. The boss gets a \nchance to set the agenda. The boss gets a chance to--the CEO of that \ncompany--to say when they will have those meetings. The CEO has a \nchance to decide whether these employees will continue to serve. That, \nmy friends, is a dramatic change in the whole question of collective \nbargaining, and it deserves some debate.\n  This is not about cooperation in the workplace. It is far from it. We \nwill have a chance to address that issue. It is a serious issue. We \nought to have an opportunity to address it and to consider it. As I \nsaid, if the majority leader wanted to make sure that the employees \nthat are going to be represented in that negotiation and in that \ncooperation are going to be employees that are selected by their fellow \nworkers, by the unions in the companies and plants where they are \nunionized, and by the workers themselves in other plants, then we can \nmove, I think, in an important way toward attempting to try and deal \nwith this legislation in a very expeditious way. But that is not at the \nbottom of it. We know what is driving this legislation. It is \nantiworker legislation. It deserves to come under the debate and \ndiscussion here on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I have just received a letter that has been sent by \nSecretary Reich on the TEAM Act. I will just take another moment of the \nSenate's time. I see others who want to address the Senate. This is a \ncopy that was sent to the chairman of the committee and to the ranking \nminority member.\n       Dear Chairman Kassebaum: We understand that your Committee \n     may consider S. 295, the ``Teamwork for Employees and \n     Managers Act,'' on Wednesday, April 17. This bill would amend \n     section 8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to \n     broadly expand employers' abilities to establish employee \n     involvement programs. I am writing to emphasize the \n     Administration's opposition to S. 295, and to urge your \n     Committee to not order the bill reported.\n       Section 8(a)(2) of the NLRA states that it is an unfair \n     labor practice for an employer to dominate or interfere with \n     the formation or administration of any labor organization. \n     This provision protects employees from the practice of \n     unscrupulous employers creating company, or sham, unions. \n     Although S. 295 does not state an intent to repeal the \n     protection provided by section 8(a)(2), S. 295 would \n     undermine employee protections in at least two key ways. \n     First, the bill would permit employers to establish company \n     unions. Second, it would permit employers, in situations \n     where the employees have spoken through a democratic election \n     to be represented by a union, to establish an alternative, \n     company dominated organization. Neither of these outcomes is \n     permissible under current law nor should they be endorsed in \n     legislation. Either one would be sufficient to cause me to \n     recommend that the President veto S. 295 or other legislation \n     that permits employers to unilaterally set up employee \n     involvement programs.\n       The Administration supports workplace flexibility and high-\n     performance workplace practices that promote cooperative \n     labor-management relations, but has concerns about the impact \n     of the TEAM bill. Current interpretations of the law permit \n     the creation of employee involvement programs that explore \n     issues of quality, productivity, and efficiency.\n\n  Just as I said.\n\n       Current interpretations of the law permit the creation of \n     employee involvement programs that explore issues of quality, \n     productivity, and efficiency.\n       It should be noted that the National Labor Relations Board \n     has recently decided five cases involving employee \n     involvement programs. In two of the five cases the Board \n     found that the cooperative group at issue did not violate \n     section 8(a)(2). The other three present classic cases \n     supporting the concerns voiced above. Moreover, it appears \n     that several more cases are pending before the Board which \n     concern the relevant issue.\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Administration opposes the \n     enactment of S. 295. If S. 295 were presented to the \n     President, I would recommend that he veto the bill.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this report from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert B. Reich.\n\n  The point is, Mr. President, as the letter indicates, this \nlegislation, for the reasons outlined here, and that I stated very \nbriefly, would provide a dramatic change in the current law. The idea \nthat we could dispose of it in 10 or 15 minutes--that was going to be \nsuggested for it--I think demonstrates a real disrespect for the \nlegitimate rights of workers in this country to be able to pursue their \ninterests, both those that are unions as well as those that are \nnonunion. It is too important a bill and too important a concept to be \ntreated trivially. We will have more to say at an appropriate time. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, at the request of the distinguished majority \nleader, I will be happy to meet with the Senator from Massachusetts and \ntalk about a procedure whereby these various bills could be brought up \nfor consideration in the Senate later on today or certainly tomorrow.\n  I will repeat what the leader just said. This is a case where the \nmajority has offered a deal to the Democrats that they ought to just \nsay yes to. It is a fair proposal. As a matter of fact, the leader \noffered not one, not two, but three proposals as to how we can get \nthese issues up for consideration.\n  First, he urged that we not hold up this White House travel matter, \nthat we go ahead and proceed with the legislation that will allow for \nBilly Dale to be reimbursed for his expense that he had to very \nunfairly endure.\n  As a part of that, the leader asked that we be able to go ahead and \nbring up this afternoon the gas tax repeal amendment. That was objected \nto.\n  He then said, we could come up with a procedure that could be offered \ntomorrow whereby we could consider the gasoline tax repeal, the minimum \nwage that the Senator from Massachusetts has been so aggressively \nadvocating, and the TEAM Act, which I want to point out right at the \nbeginning is supported by the chairman of the Education and Labor \nCommittee, supported by Senator Kassebaum from Kansas, and one that has \nbroad support, not only from employers, but from a lot of employees \nthat would like to work together with the employers on these issues. I \nwill talk more about that in a moment.\n\n  He said we will get all three of them up, have a chance to discuss \nthese issues, and be able to vote on it. That was objected to. Now, the \nminority leader got an opportunity to have the minimum wage considered, \na repeal of the gas tax, which the American people overwhelmingly \napprove, with this one small addition of the TEAM Act. That was \nobjected to. They got what they were asking for. They just do not seem \nto be able to say yes to a fair offer from the majority leader.\n  Then, the third proposal he made was, look, we will just consider \nthem independently, separately. We will have the minimum wage that can \nbe offered and voted up or down, the TEAM Act can be offered and voted \nup or down. Apparently that is objected to. The indication is that the \nminority would even filibuster a fair offer where each side gets to \noffer a proposal they feel strongly about. We would have a vote, and go \nforward. But that, once again, as I say was objected to.\n  I really think the American people need to take a look at what the \nmajority leader just did. He offered not one, two, but three very fair \nproposals on how we can proceed on these issues. I will talk to the \nminority leader and to the Senator from Massachusetts more about that.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the proposals we have been talking \nabout. On the gas tax repeal, I want to remind\n\n[[Page S4789]]\n\nmy colleagues that this was included in the tremendous tax increase \nthat was passed with no Republican votes in 1993. This 4.3-cent \ngasoline tax would not go into the highway trust fund as we have most \noften done in the past, but would go into the General Treasury, into \nthe dark, deep hole of the General Treasury and, as a matter of fact, \nprobably made no contribution to reducing the deficit, but it did raise \ngasoline taxes.\n  Now, the minority leader said that we are now looking at deficits \nthat have gone down, but the fact of the matter is we have more debt \nnow than we have ever had in the history of this country. The debt has \ngone up. It continues to go up. If we had gone along with the \nPresident's proposals, there would be no end to $200 billion deficits \ninto the future. We also have the highest tax burden on the American \npeople right now than we have ever had in history--not just income \ntaxes, but gasoline taxes, estate taxes, all the myriad of taxes the \nAmerican people have to deal with. That is why we go right up until May \n8 where people finally get a chance to get out from the burden of taxes \nto make use of their own money without it being taken for taxes.\n  It is a very fair proposal that we repeal this 4.3-cent gasoline tax \nand that we not allow this money to go into the General Treasury. We \nshould have a gasoline tax go to build roads and bridges. We need that \nall over this country. We have highways and bridges that are \ndeteriorating, need work, and the highway trust fund is not being \nreleased so that the bridges and highways can be improved. It is \nargued, well, 4.3 cents a gallon does not amount to much. Tell that to \npeople driving 40 miles, 50, or 60 miles a day round trip or more to \nget a job, in many rural States in America. It adds up to over $25 \nbillion over the next 7-year period. This is a lot of money.\n\n  It is one way we can provide some immediate relief on the gasoline \ntax increase, or gasoline price increase that we have seen. It would go \nto the people. There is no way that these companies and gas stations \nwould just take that 4.3 cents and absorb it. They would pass it on to \nthe people. It was a telling point that the Senator from Texas made \nthat 23 percent of the taxes that have paid for this is from families \nthat make $20,000 a year or less. They are the ones that are hit the \nhardest by this gasoline tax.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the TEAM Act because I think a lot of \nmisinformation has been given. Over many years, the Federal Government \nlaws have more or less assumed that workers and managers have an \nadversarial relationship. We should not have that. I think we are \nbeginning to get away from that. Managers and employees should be \nworking together. The attitude over the past 50 years has been that the \nemployers and the employees really cannot work together to improve \nefficiency and productivity. The TEAM Act responding, though, to the \nNLRB, the National Labor Relations Board, a decision in 1992, the \nElectromation decision that has had significant consequences in recent \nmonths and in the last 2 years. There is beginning to be, now, a \nmovement away from the cooperation that we had seen over the past few \nyears.\n  Yes, there are currently 30,000 companies with workplace cooperative \nprograms, but this decision and others have put a chill on that. There \nis an effort to move away from this cooperation. This act, the TEAM \nAct, just amends the Federal labor laws to make clear that employers \nand employees can meet together, in committee, or other employee \ninvolvement programs to address issues of mutual concern. Perhaps it \ncould be smoking or it could be something that involves the quality of \nthe workplace or productivity and efficiency--as long as they do not \nengage in collective bargaining.\n  There are a couple of other points that have been overlooked in some \nof the things that have been said on the floor today. The bill does not \nallow employees or employers to establish company unions or sham unions \nthat undermine independent collective bargaining. So that is a mistake \nwhen it is inferred that there will be these company unions that would \nbe formed. The bill ensures that workers will, however, be able to \ncontinue to retain the right to choose an independent union to engage \nin collective bargaining.\n\n  What we are talking about here is freedom of employers and employees \nto work together. That is not a big issue that is going to stir up a \nlot of controversy except for the labor union bosses. I repeat, even \nthe workers, even employees like these arrangements. That is why in \n30,000 instances it has been occurring. But it has been drifting away \nbecause NLRB is putting out decisions that undermine this type of \ncooperation, this type of freedom of employees and employers to work \ntogether.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look at this TEAM Act. I will work \nwith the Senator from Massachusetts and others to see if we can come up \nwith a very fair package that will allow us to vote on all three of \nthese issues. Then we will have dealt with them, and in a reasonable \namount of time. The TEAM Act is not new. It has been reported out of \ncommittee. It is ready for consideration by the Senate. I am sure the \nmajority leader would say we would allow adequate time, but after a \nperiod of debate there would be a vote here on that without a lot of \namendments to completely take it apart.\n  We could have adequate debate on the minimum wage issue and on the \nrepeal of the gas tax. All three of these issues could be addressed and \nwe could move on with the business of the Senate. We have other issues \nthat are very important that we would like to get debated and completed \nsoon. We would have the budget resolution coming up next week. We need \nto get these issues addressed this week and move to budget and the \nappropriations process. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, what the majority leader has presented to \nthe Senate as an option is the old idea of mix and match. My wife tells \nme it is a great idea when you are shopping for clothes that you go out \nand mix and match and buy different things and try to mix and match \nthem until you come up with a pretty good outfit. The problem is mix \nand match does not work in dealing with legislation. It may be a good \nway to buy clothes but a lousy way to legislate.\n  If you have three good ideas for bills, what is wrong with bringing \nthem to the floor and debating? What is wrong with after you have dealt \nwith the first, bringing up the second, follow the rules of the second, \nand then move on to the third. Let the Senate vote on each one of the \nappropriations. Why try and mix and match pieces of legislation that do \nnot fit? When you are buying clothes and you mix and match and you buy \nthe wrong size or color combination, you come out with a lousy product. \nThe same is true when you try and put together pieces of legislation \nthat do not fit, that are not the same color, that are not the same \nsize. You come up with something that makes no sense. Mix and match may \nbe good for buying clothes, but it is not for passing legislation.\n\n  I suggest that what we ought to do is look at each one of these \npropositions and talk about, then debate them. Some have merit, some \nhave less merit, and some, I think, should not be passed at all. But \nthere is no reason that I can see that you should somehow bundle \neverything up and have one opportunity to vote up or down. If you have \nbad items with good items, it just did not fit and should not be put \ntogether. They should be voted on, should be debated, and we should \nfollow the rules of the Senate in considering legislation when it comes \nup in an orderly fashion.\n  I want to comment on the idea of repealing the 4.3-cent gas tax that \nhas been suggested by the majority leader. I think it is an idea \nwithout merit. I think it is clearly a political idea, and being from \nLouisiana I have no problems with political ideas if they work. But if \nthey do not work, a political idea is bad public policy.\n  Here is a case of exactly that. I will comment on why. No. 1, it is a \ndagger to the heart of any effort to balance the budget. In 1992, \nbefore we had the 4.3-cent gas tax, the Federal deficit was $290 \nbillion. People in this country said, ``Senator, do what is necessary \nto reduce the Federal deficit, get us on a slope, a downward path \ntowards a balanced budget.'' Congress took some tough steps. No one \nsaid it would be easy. Our constituents said, ``Do it,''\n\n[[Page S4790]]\n\nand we passed a budget reconciliation bill that had the 4.3-cent gas \ntax in it.\n  Today, instead of having a $290 billion Federal deficit, economists \nand the CBO tells us the projected deficit for this year is $140 \nbillion. Did that just happen? No, it happened because Congress had the \ncourage and the guts to do something to bring the deficit down, to cut \nit by over 50 percent, which is where we are today. The first time \nthings get tough, people start running for cover, and the first cover \nis, let us repeal the 4.3-cent gas tax. But let us just do it until \nafter the election. Is that the clearest political proposition that you \ncould possibly ask for in a political year? I think it is.\n\n  When we passed the 4.3-cent gas tax, after we passed it, the price of \ngas at the pump was lower than before. Do you know what caused all of \nthat? The whole thing I thought everybody really believed in--it is \ncalled supply and demand. When you have a shortage of supply and a high \ndemand, the price for the product is going to go up. When the opposite \nis true, the equal opposite result is also true. When you have an \nexcess of supply and low demand, the price goes down.\n  I thought our colleagues on this side of the aisle were real \nbelievers in the marketplace. And the marketplace is what has caused, \nalong with other congressional actions, a spike in the price of gas \nbetween the months of April and May.\n  Interestingly enough, last year, if anybody wants to look at the \nrecords--not Democratic records or Republican records--prices at the \ngas pump have increased before by 6 cents a gallon between April and \nMay. And, as normal, toward the end of the summer and early fall, the \nprice started going back down. At the end of the year for 1995, the \naverage price of gasoline in this country was lower than it ever has \nbeen in recorded history, when adjusted for inflation, which is the \nonly fair way of looking at it. It was lower in 1995 with the tax than \nin 1994, which was lower than it was in 1993, which was lower than it \nwas in 1992, which was lower than it was in 1990. And you can go all \nthe way back to about 1920. But what the 4.3-cent gas tax helped us do \nwas to reduce the deficit from $290 billion down to $140 billion. It is \na consumption tax. It all went for deficit reduction, which my \ncolleagues on that side of the aisle said is the most important thing \nwe can do--get the deficit down. We got it down. And the first time it \ngets a little difficult, everybody runs for cover--well, not everybody, \nbut a large number run for political cover because we have had some \ncomplaints in that the price of gas is too high.\n  Instead of saying to our constituents, ``Let me tell you what really \ncaused it. We produced 8 percent more heating oil over last year \nbecause we had colder weather.'' That is not the fault of anybody in \nCongress. That is just what happened. That was nature. The colder \nwinter meant that we produced 8 percent more heating oil than gasoline.\n  In addition, something that Congress did was, we took the speed limit \noff and people started driving faster. Guess what? When you drive \nfaster, you burn more gasoline. When you use more, it is going to cost \nmore. Remember the law of supply and demand? People are using \nsubstantially more gas because of the repeal of the speed limit.\n\n  In addition, because of the Clean Air Act, which most Members \nsupport, and which I support, we told refiners in this country--\nparticularly in California--``You are going to have to change your \nrefinery, tear it down and rebuild it so you can now produce \nreformulated gasoline.'' Guess what? When they are not able to produce \ngasoline, you have less on the market and the price will go up as well.\n  I will give you another item that I think is one of the major things \nthat has been done. Today, cars do not get as good gas mileage as they \ndid when we were concerned about the price of gas, 4 out of 10 cars in \nAmerica average about 14 miles per gallon. People are buying utility \nvehicles, larger cars, and they drive faster and further, and they are \nusing more gasoline. Is it any surprise why the price of gas has gone \nup in the country?\n  For the life of me, I cannot follow anybody's argument that when you \ntake the 4.3 cents off of the refineries at the pipeline, that it is \ngoing to automatically translate into 4.3 cents less at the pump. When \nI first heard this idea, I said the other day that lowering the gas tax \nby 4.3 cents has as much to do with lowering the price to consumers at \nthe pump as spitting in the ocean does to raising the sea level, \nbecause there is absolutely no correlation that if you lower the tax \nthat is paid for by oil and gas companies, they are going to \nnecessarily pass it on to consumers at the pump--just like they did not \nincrease and pass the increase on to the consumers at the pump when we \npassed it back in 1993. After we passed the increase, the price of gas \nat the pump was substantially lower than it was before we passed the \ngas tax. Why? The law of supply and demand. The price of crude oil \nstarted coming down, and the price of gas continued to go down. \nConsumers were not affected by the adding on of the 4.3 cents at that \ntime.\n  I suggest that unless my colleagues on this side of the aisle or on \nmy side of the aisle want to come in here with price controls--remember \nthose, wage and price controls both?--come in here and mandate that \neverybody pass it all the way down the line to the consumer, there is \nabsolutely no guarantee, or even a reasonable expectation that a \nconsumer is going to really see the difference at the pump. So I think \nwe have to be very careful, because I am concerned, as one member of a \ngroup that is trying to reach a balanced budget in a bipartisan \nfashion, where are we going to make up $30 billion in lost \nrevenues, which can go to balancing the budget. If we lose this 4.3-\ncent gas tax, where will it come from? I heard a colleague on the House \nside suggested that we could cut education. Are we that weak in this \ncountry that we are willing to say we are going to cut education in \norder to pay 4.3 cents less at the pump? Is there no concern about our \nfuture and the future of our children, and we are willing to say we are \nso weak politically that we are going to cut education in order that we \ncan have a 4.3-cent lower price at the pump, which is not guaranteed at \nall? Maybe all the oil companies--and my State has a few--will have a \n4.3-cent increase in their profits per gallon, but there is no \nguarantee that the consumer will benefit. But to cut education to pay \nfor this? Where are our priorities? Have we lost sense of the fact that \neducation is the most important thing to do for our children and for \nfuture generations? Are we willing to say we are going to cut education \nbefore we stand up and do what is right regarding this? I think that is \nthe wrong priority.\n\n  I heard somebody else say, ``Let us sell the spectrum.'' We have \nheard that before. Boy, we have sold the spectrum more than we have \nsold the Brooklyn Bridge. Every time they want something, they say, \n``Let us sell the spectrum, and we are not going to step on anybody's \ntoes.'' We are going to get $30 billion from selling the spectrum--\nagain? For what purpose?\n  I think that we have to be very careful about doing something in a \npolitical year and making it last only until the next election, which I \nthink is very clear; you can see through it as clear as pure water. A \nlot of people talk about a flat tax. A flat tax is a consumption tax. I \nbelieve we ought to be taxing productivity less and consumption more. \nThis proposal goes exactly contrary to that. We are taking a \nconsumption tax, which, hopefully, regulates behavior in a proper way, \nand makes people more conscious about driving habits, and use it for \ndeficit reduction. Instead we are chucking it and saying we would \nrather increase the deficit or cut education, or go back to selling \nsomething that we have sold so many times before that nobody believes \nit will ever work.\n  The final point I want to make, Mr. President, is that the market \ndoes work. The marketplace does work. That is a fundamental principle \nin this country--that the law of supply and demand in this country \nworks. This is from April 26. I am reading from the prices of crude oil \non a weekly basis, west Texas intermediate crude oil prices, or the \nprices posted once a week for the price of oil per barrel. ``When the \nprice of oil per barrel goes up, eventually it works its way down to \nthe price of gasoline at the pump, and it goes up. But when the price \nof crude oil per barrel goes down, it generally takes about a month \nbefore it reaches the price at the pump. In this case, I will\n\n[[Page S4791]]\n\nshare this with my colleagues because it is an indication of what is \ngoing to happen. If we just wait and have some political courage for a \ncouple of days instead of running off and doing something that I think \nis damaging--as I said, a dagger to the heart--to a balanced budget in \nthis country, the average price of west Texas intermediate crude on \nApril 26 was $23.80 a barrel. The price of west Texas intermediate \ncrude at the close of business on May 3 was $21.36 a barrel.\n\n  That is a 10-percent drop in 1 week--a 10-percent drop per barrel of \ncrude oil in this country in 1 week, from April 26 to May 3.\n  Mr. President and all of my colleagues, I suggest that if you just \nhang around here a little bit longer, you will see that drop in the \nprice of crude by 10 percent is going to be reflected in the \nmarketplace. If we believe in the marketplace, which I think we should, \nthat is going to be reflected in the price of a gallon of gas at the \npump. I think that is the way this country ought to address this \nproblem.\n  What we have before the Senate is a political idea that does not \nwork, and political ideas that do not work are bad ideas, and sometimes \nI think too often politics makes bad policy, and this is an example, I \nthink, of exactly that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/07/senate-section/article/S4786-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4791-S4792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNDERMINING THE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe it appropriate at this time to \nreview where we stand because there has been some discussion that has \noccurred since the majority leader came to the floor and outlined a \nproposal. Maybe his proposal has been obfuscated a bit because it was \nsuch a clear and fine proposal that people are trying to undermine it. \nBut the fact is that what the majority leader suggested was you can \nhave your vote. You can have your vote on minimum wage. You can have \nyour vote on repealing the gas tax.\n  All we are asking is that in this process of having those two votes, \nwe also have a vote on something called the TEAM Act, which is not, as \nthe Senator from Massachusetts said, all that big a deal because so \nmany companies have already signed off on it.\n  Yet now we hear from the other side that they essentially intend to \nfilibuster an attempt to increase the minimum wage and to reduce the \ngas tax, to roll it back, simply because of this TEAM Act proposal. \nThat is pretty outrageous.\n  In a moment, I would like to talk a little bit about what that \nproposal is because I think you need to understand that basically what \nwe are hearing is a party has been captured by a constituency and is \nallowing that constituency to stand in the way of good policy.\n  But let us talk about the gas tax first. Why should we not repeal \nthis tax? To begin with, it was sold under false pretenses. Three years \nago, when this administration proposed this gas tax, they began by \nproposing a Btu tax, if you remember that, where they were going to tax \nall energy consumption in this country. States like New Hampshire and \nother States that depend on oil to heat our homes would have been hit \nwith this tax at the home heating level and at the gasoline pumps and \nthroughout the system that delivers energy to their communities.\n  That was such an outrageous idea that even Members on the other side \nrejected it. So the administration backpedaled and said, well, no, we \nwill not do the Btu tax; we will do a gas tax. But at the exact same \ntime we were hearing from the other side of the aisle that the taxes in \nthe package which the President proposed 2\\1/2\\ years ago or 3 years \nago were only going to affect the rich. In fact, the present Democratic \nleader, who was not the Democratic leader at that time, came to this \nfloor and said this tax package is only going to affect people earning \nmore than $180,000 or companies that make more than $560,000 a year.\n  That was the tax package that was sold to the American people, that \nwas passed on to the American people's back and which included $295 \nbillion of new taxes, the largest tax increase in history delivered to \nus by this President and Members on the other side of the aisle when \nthey were in the majority 2\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  Nobody on this side of the aisle bought that. We did not buy it for \nfairly obvious reasons. No. 1, a gas tax is not a tax on people who \nearn $180,000 a year. When you pull into your gas station, your \nattendant does not ask you, ``Do you make $180,000 a year?'' before he \nhits you with the tax. He has to collect that tax whether you make 10 \nbucks a year or whether you make $1 million, whether you are in a small \nstruggling company driving a pickup or whether you have a fleet of \ntrucks. He still has to hit you with that tax.\n  So this was not a tax on the wealthy. This was a tax that was \nactually targeted in, as was pointed out by the Senator from Texas, on \nlow- and middle-income people disproportionately because they have to \npay the same rate of tax as people in the high incomes, and 23 percent \nof this tax falls on people with incomes, I believe, as the Senator \nfrom Texas said, under $20,000, or something like that. A very low \npercentage comes out of people with higher incomes. So it was a \ndisproportionately unfair tax when it was put in place and remains so, \nand it should be repealed.\n\n  So why is the other side resisting repealing it? Why? Because big \nlabor is upset, the Washington big labor leadership, the big bosses \nhere in Washington are upset. That is why they are opposing repealing \nthe gas tax.\n  Now we come forward, and we on our side of the aisle say, OK, we will \naccept your proposal on the minimum wage, we will accept the Kennedy \nlanguage as proposed to increase the minimum wage. We ask that you \naccept our proposal to repeal the gas tax at the same time. We allow \nyou to divide the votes. Just give us the chance to get both on a \nmajority vote instead of having to have a filibuster around here where \nyou have to get 60 votes.\n  What does the other side say? Nope. Sorry. We will not take the deal. \nWe cannot accept that deal any longer. We are not that interested in \nincreasing the minimum wage that we are going to stand in the face of \nthe big labor bosses here in Washington who do not want this little \nthing called the TEAM Act. So we have the opposition, the other side of \nthe aisle, saying essentially that two major points they consider to \nbe, I suspect most of them, good policy--one, repealing this incredibly \nregressive gas tax that was put on 2\\1/2\\ years ago and, two, raising \nthe minimum wage--are going to be held up because of what was described \nbasically by the Senator from Massachusetts as an inconsequential \namendment dealing with a minor point of labor law. Why? Because they \nhave gotten the telephone calls from a couple streets over that said \nunder no circumstances is TEAM Act going to pass this House.\n  But what is this horror called TEAM Act? It is not much, folks. TEAM \nAct just simply says what used to be the law and what most people think \nshould be the law and what was the law up until 1992, I believe it was, \nwhen something called the Electromation was passed by the NLRB, the \nNational Labor Relations Board.\n  Essentially, it says that people can get together in their \nworkplace--what a radical idea--people can get together in their \nworkplace and they can talk about issues that involve quality and \nproductivity and efficiency. I think most of us have heard of things \nlike TQM, the philosophy of management that basically grew out of the \nDeming approach which essentially revolutionized Japan and made them \ncompetitive in the world.\n\n  TQM is where you have a Deming approach, you have a team approach to \nmanaging the workplace. That is basically what TEAM Act does. It says \nyou can have a TEAM Act approach operating in the workplace.\n  Now, you cannot do it under this bill, under TEAM Act, in any way \nthat would undermine the independence of the collective bargaining \neffort. You cannot establish a company union. The specific language \nsays that you cannot establish sham unions. But you can get together to \ndiscuss things like smoking policy; you can get together to discuss \nthings like productivity: How do you make the place work better? \nWorkers happen to be the best source of good ideas in many instances, \nand probably in most instances actually, certainly in large \ncompanies. The chance to bring them together in working teams works for \nJapan. It produces products in a much more efficient and effective way\n\n[[Page S4792]]\n\nthere. And it works here. It works very well here. It was working here \nquite well, extraordinarily well, until 1992 when, as a result of this \nNLRB decision, that policy was brought into jeopardy.\n\n  So this bill simply clarifies the policy. It says you cannot set up a \nsham union, cannot set up a company union, you cannot use this to \nundermine collective bargaining, but you can allow people to get \ntogether to talk about how they can make the workplace work better. \nThis concept of team effort in the workplace is what is holding up \nrepeal of the gas tax and increasing the minimum wage.\n  When people are cynical about Washington I guess sometimes they have \na right to be, because what you have here is a money talks situation. \nThe big labor bosses here in Washington have committed publicly, it has \nbeen reported across this country, $35 million to defeat members of the \nRepublican Party running for reelection to Congress--$35 million. That \nis a lot of money. And money appears to talk, because the phone calls \ncome in and the decision has been made to take down two items which, at \nleast on that side of the aisle, although there are some on our side of \nthe aisle who have reservations about some of these proposals--take \ndown two items which have pretty much universal support and which were \nviewed as good policy: repealing the gas tax, which is regressive, and \nraising the minimum wage, simply because it affronts the big labor \nbosses here in Washington that we would try to make the workplace have \na more cooperative atmosphere.\n  It is pretty outrageous but that is where we stand today. That is \nwhere we stand after the majority leader's proposal was rejected. Not \nonly did the majority leader propose that, he went even an extra step. \nHe said not only am I willing to give you a vote on repealing the gas \ntax, increasing the minimum wage, and also the TEAM Act issue, but I \nwill let you even divide the question. He went so far as to say you can \nhave your up-or-down vote on the minimum wage and you can have your up-\nor-down vote on gas tax. And that was rejected. That was exactly what \nhas been asked for here for months by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Yet, suddenly we see the priorities. We see the priorities of the \nliberal side of the aisle. It is not this low-income worker about whom \nwe have heard so much, it is not the person who has to pay that extra \namount at the gas pump who is maybe having trouble making a living but \nmaybe has to buy gas to get to work--it is not that person the other \nside of the aisle has as their No. 1 priority. No, it is some guy \nsitting in some building here in Washington who happens to have a big \nlabor job. So that is what this is down to.\n\n  This is a simple question of money talks. It is regrettable. \nHopefully the other side of the aisle will see this more clearly and \ncome to their senses, because this proposal the majority leader has \noffered is an extraordinary generous act on his part to try to resolve \nsome fairly complex questions that have been confronting this \nlegislative body.\n  I yield the remainder of my time and make the point of order a quorum \nis not present.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PELL.

Mr. President, there is good news and better news in \nthe world today with regards to the progress and the stability of \ndemocratic procedures around the world. We are, as is evidenced from \nthe day's proceedings, already well into our election season, though \nthe actual election will not be held until next November, as has been \nour practice over the last two centuries.\n  It is possible in a country such as ours to take for granted \nnational, State, and even local elections, as a part of the rhythms of \nour life. Yet, they are rare in the world. In the whole of the \nmembership of the United Nations, some 185 countries now, there are \nonly 7 States which both existed in 1914 and have not had their form of \ngovernment changed by violence since then.\n  We are joined in that very special group, by the United Kingdom, four \nformer members of the British Commonwealth--Canada, Australia, New \nZealand, and South Africa--and Sweden. I would add Switzerland, though \nit is not a member of the United Nations.\n  Of the great powers of the world, the newest to begin a process of \nchoosing leaders by elections is Russia, the Russian Federation and \nother members of the former Republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist \nRepublics.\n  Yesterday, we learned with understandable anxiety that on Sunday \nMajor General Aleksandr Korzhakov, the close aide and security advisor \nto President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, stated that it might be necessary \nto cancel the Presidential elections scheduled for June. He stated that \nthe country was not ready to make a decision. It is clear his concern \nis that if the country were to make a decision now, it might not choose \nMr. Yeltsin.\n  Mr. President, this will be the second Presidential election in \nRussian history. To his great credit, yesterday in Moscow, Mr. Yeltsin \nsaid that the election would not be postponed; it will take place as \nscheduled. Mr. Yeltsin went on to instruct General Korzhakov not to get \ninvolved in politics and to refrain from making such statements in the \nfuture.\n  On the other hand, in his statement, Mr. Yeltsin refers to his \nopponent, who is associated with former Communists in Russia and who \nhas a program very much opposed to the economic reforms Mr. Yeltsin has \nbeen pursuing, albeit at times erratically, by stating that, \n``Korzhakov is not alone in thinking that a Gennadi Zyuganov victory \nwould start a civil war.''\n  Now, those are ominous terms, sir. Mr. Zyuganov is the candidate \nconsidered to be Mr. Yeltsin's chief opponent, and he represents a \nrevival of Communist thinking and organization to some extent. The word \n``civil war'' takes us back to the events of 1917 when the Bolsheviks \nseized power from a moderate provisional government, potentially a \ndemocratic government. Those events in St. Petersburg in the Winter \nPalace in 1917 are well-known to us --and were followed by four years \nof intense, agonizing war across all of Eurasia. A war in which the \nUnited States was involved with troops in Murmansk, Vladivostok, and \nelsewhere, as were the British and the French. The outcome was the \ntriumph of the Soviet Union and the horror that followed for nearly \nthree-quarters of a century, until its final dissolution in 1991.\n  We can only wish the democrats, or if you like republicans, well in \nthe Russian elections. We should take note of how very tentative these \nadvances can be, and take into account those who are voicing concern \nover the prospect of an election in which the outcome would result in \ncivil war.\n  By extraordinary contrast, Mr. President, the Republic of India today \nconcludes the third and final day of the largest election in human \nhistory. Some 590 million Indian citizens are eligible to vote in three \nseparate days of balloting: April 27, May 2, and today, May 7. This \nwill be the 11th national election since the founding of the Republic \nof India in 1947. A very large proportion of the electorate will have \nvoted in some 800,000 polling places.\n  The task of keeping the polling stations open is formidable, yet the \ntask is being accomplished and it suggests the magnitude of the \nachievement. In so doing, India continues to exist as a democracy, in \ndefiance of just about everything that those who profess to know about \nthe subject would argue are required as preconditions necessary for a \ndemocratic society. Yet India continues to remain a firm democracy and \nto exhibit an extraordinary commitment to law and to civic process.\n  Here is a country with 15 official languages, not to mention English \nwhich,\n\n[[Page S4793]]\n\nas Prime Minister Nehru described, enjoys ``associate status.'' In \naddition, some 50 major regional languages. It is a country that \nstretches from the Himalayas in the north to Cape Comorin far into the \nIndian Ocean, approaching the Equator. It is the second most populous \nnation on Earth. There has never been a country of this size able to \nhave regular and free, democratic elections. They are not without \ndisturbances, few elections are anywhere; however, we do know that \nthere will be a government formed in the aftermath of this election. \nThere will be no civil war. There will be no civil unrest. There will \nbe an acceptance of a democratic process without parallel in the \nhistory of mankind. It should cheer us up and make us realize that the \nlast half century has not been for nothing. The current possibilities \nof a democratic society around the world are perhaps beyond what anyone \ncould have imagined a century ago, and they are thriving and proudly \nprevailing on the subcontinent of India, in the Republic of India.\n  I am sure the entire Senate will wish to congratulate the people of \nIndia and all who have participated in this election. We take no \nposition whatever as to the outcome. There are any number of parties \nwith capable candidates. At the present time, the balloting should have \nbeen concluded, it being past midnight in India. Soon we will know the \noutcome.\n  It fell to that singular commentator, William Safire, in the New York \nTimes, to note this event in a remarkable column in which he observes \nthe Indian achievement. I think we should note the contrast of this \nachievement with the People's Republic of China which, though \ncomparable in size, has never had an election of any kind.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Safire's column be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 2, 1996]\n\n                          The Biggest Election\n\n                          (By William Safire)\n\n       Washington.--In 1975, when Indira Gandhi assumed \n     dictatorial control of India and threw her opponents in jail, \n     President Ford asked his U.N. delegate, Daniel P. Moynihan, \n     what to make of that.\n       ``Look at it this way, Mr. President,'' said Moynihan with \n     a courtier's irony. ``Under your Administration, the United \n     States has become the world's largest democracy.''\n       When Mrs. Gandhi later confidently stood for election, \n     India's voters threw her out. Freedom was back, and the U.S. \n     happily became the world's second-largest democracy.\n       This week, with dignity, honest balloting and relatively \n     little violence, 400 million of India's citizens--65 percent \n     of eligible voters, higher than here--go to the polls to \n     select candidates from 500 political parties. It is the most \n     breathtaking example of government by the people in the \n     history of the world.\n       Americans don't hear a whole lot about it. President \n     Clinton is busy being campaign manager for the Labor party in \n     Israel's May 29, election, in effect telling Israelis to vote \n     for Shimon Peres or else.\n       When he is not intervening shamelessly in Israel's \n     political affairs, Mr. Clinton is barnstorming with Boris \n     Yeltsin, trying to help him defeat Yavlinsky's reformers and \n     Zyuganov's Communists in Russia's June 16 election. \n     Washington is also headquarters for the Clinton campaign for \n     the U.S. Presidency, where he beefs up beef prices to \n     consumers while pouring strategic oil on troubled motorists. \n     But in all the campaigning, no mention is made of India, \n     where voters outnumber those in Israel, Russia and the U.S. \n     combined.\n       As a result of this uncharacteristic White House \n     forbearance, television coverage here about the biggest \n     election has been next to nil. Not only do Americans not know \n     for which Indian candidate to root, but hundreds of millions \n     of voters are forced to go to the polls ignorant of Mr. \n     Clinton's preference.\n       Why? Do nearly 900 million Indians not matter? American \n     lack of interest is not new; a former Foreign Minister of \n     India, one of Nehru's acolytes, told a U.S. envoy: ``We would \n     far prefer your detestation to your indifference.''\n       One reason is that India strikes a holier-than-thou \n     diplomatic pose, remaining nonaligned when there is no longer \n     one side to be nonaligned against. Year after year, India is \n     near the top of the list of nations that consistently vote \n     against the U.S. in the United Nations.\n       We're wrong to let that overly irritate us. China votes \n     against us, too, and unbalances our trade and secretly ships \n     missiles to rogue states and jails dissidents and oppresses \n     Tibet and threatens Taiwan and (cover the children's eyes) \n     pirates our CD's--but we care more about what happens in \n     China than what happens in India.\n       That's a mistake. Contrary to what all the new Old China \n     Hands and other Old Nixon Hands tell you, India will draw \n     ahead of China as a superpower in the next century.\n       Yes, China's economic growth rate has doubled India's, and \n     China's Draconian control of births will see India's \n     population exceed China's soon enough, to India's \n     disadvantage. But China does not know what an election is. \n     Despite the enterprise and industriousness of its people, \n     despite the example of free Chinese on Taiwan and the \n     inspiration of the dissident Wei Jingsheng, jailed in \n     Beijing, China is several upheavals and decades away from the \n     democracy India already enjoys.\n       Without political freedom, capitalism cannot long thrive. \n     Already the requirements of political repression are \n     stultifying the flow of market information in China, driving \n     wary Hong Kong executives to Sydney. The suppression of \n     dangerous data undermined technology in Communist Russia; it \n     will hurt China, too.\n       Though more Chinese are literate, many more Indians are \n     English-literate (more English-speakers than in Britain), and \n     English is the global language of the computer. American \n     software companies are already locating in Bangalore, India's \n     Silicon Valley. Bureaucratic corruption scandals abound; \n     India's free press reports and helps cleanse them, China's \n     does not.\n       I'm rooting for Rao, the secular Prime Minister, who is \n     more likely to move toward free markets than Vajpayee, his \n     leading opponent. But whoever wins, it's a glorious week for \n     the world's largest democracy.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I take the liberty of extending the congratulations of \nthe U.S. Senate to the Government and peoples of India on the \nconclusion of this, the 11th national election as an independent nation \nin the world: proud, increasingly prosperous, and with every \nexpectation of becoming more so.\n  I thank the Senate for its courtesy and allowing this interruption. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/07/senate-section/article/S4792-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4793-S4801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TEAMWORK FOR EMPLOYEES AND MANAGEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, let me just comment on two things very \nbriefly that, apparently, are going to be joined in the vote tomorrow. \nLet me say that if they are joined, I, if no one else, am going to ask \nfor division on the question, so we can vote separately on these \nissues.\n  One of the issues is whether to repeal the 4.3-cent gasoline tax. I \nknow it was very controversial as we argued about it here. But it was \nvery interesting that after it passed, I went back to the State of \nIllinois and, up until a few days ago when it was raised again as an \nissue, of the 12 million people in Illinois, do you know how many \npeople talked to me and complained about the gasoline tax increase? Not \na single one. My guess is--and I see my friend Senator Moynihan on the \nfloor--that not a single citizen of New York complained to Senator \nMoynihan about the 4.3-cent tax.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Not a one.\n  Mr. SIMON. My guess is that in the State of Tennessee people were not \ncomplaining. I talked to one of our colleagues from a western State, \nand they were not complaining. One of the advantages, Mr. President, of \nnot running for reelection is, a year ago, just about this time, my \nwife and I took off for Spain and Portugal, flew to Madrid--at our \nexpense, I hasten to add, not at the taxpayers' expense. And we rented \na car and drove around Spain and Portugal. The highways were better \nthan our interstate highways. But I paid $4.50 a gallon. People talk \nabout being overtaxed in the United States. In some areas, our taxes \nare excessive. But we have, next to Saudi Arabia, the lowest gasoline \ntax of any country in the world. If you were to ask, ``What can we do \nto improve the environment?'' one of the things we could do, frankly, \nis not to lower the gasoline tax, but to increase it. We ought to be \nincreasing it to spend money to build our highways and use it on mass \ntransit and that sort of thing. So I think any move to lower that tax \nis shortsighted.\n  And then the distinguished Congressman from Texas has suggested that \nwe take the money from education. I cannot imagine anything more \nshortsighted. We need to invest more in education, not less. That just \nabsolutely does not make sense.\n\n[[Page S4794]]\n\n  I hope we will reject this thing that emerged in this political \nseason, the season that is frequently called the ``silly season'' by \nobservers, and rightfully so.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will my friend from Illinois yield for a question?\n  Mr. SIMON. I am pleased to yield to my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I very much agree with his comments and would add that, \nafter the 1993 deficit reduction legislation, the price at the pump--\nwhen that small tax increase took effect--was lower than when it was \nenacted.\n  Perhaps the Senator from Illinois also saw in the Wall Street Journal \nan article today under the section called ``The Economy.'' It is \nheadlined, ``Economists Say Gasoline Tax Is Too Low.'' The subhead is, \n``GOP's Proposed Rollback Is Seen Aggravating Deficit.'' This is by \nJackie Calmes and Christopher Georges. It begins:\n\n       Republicans seeking to gain political mileage from a lower \n     gasoline tax can't look to economists to support their case.\n\n  Not that economists are infallible. Who is? But they make that point.\n  I do not have to explain the term ``externalities'' to the learned \nSenator from Illinois. Gasoline costs you, air pollution costs you, as \ndo the wear and tear on the environment and infrastructure, and so \nforth. You have to pay for that. You better be careful about how much \nyou do because the costs that you have not paid for keep mounting.\n  I wonder if he has not read this. Would he wish to have it printed in \nthe Record at this point?\n  Mr. SIMON. I have not seen it. I think it is an excellent suggestion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 7, 1996]\n\nEconomists Say Gasoline Tax Is Too Low--GOP's Proposed Rollback Is Seen \n                          Aggravating Deficit\n\n               (By Jackie Calmes and Christopher Georges)\n\n       Washington.--Republicans seeking to gain political mileage \n     from a lower gasoline tax can't look to economists to support \n     their case.\n       Though the joke has it that you could lay all of the \n     economists in the world end-to-end and never reach a \n     conclusion, there is widespread agreement in the field that \n     the federal gasoline tax of 18.3 cents a gallon is too low.\n       Nevertheless, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole is aiming for \n     a vote as early as today to repeal the Clinton \n     administration's 4.3-cent-a-gallon increase in the gasoline \n     tax. At the same time, the politics-conscious White House and \n     congressional Democrats aren't about to stop it, despite \n     concern in both parties about worsening the budget deficit.\n       With the recent spike in prices at the pump, Republicans \n     and their presumed presidential nominee, Sen. Dole, seized \n     the idea of repealing the 1993 tax increase, partly as a way \n     to divert attention from the Democrats' popular efforts to \n     raise the minimum wage. But they have been stymied by the \n     search for savings to make up for revenue that would be lost; \n     each penny of the gasoline tax adds up to revenue of about $1 \n     billion a year.\n       ``Repealing the tax isn't going to solve the problem [of \n     recently higher prices], and it's going to hurt the \n     deficit,'' says Nada Eissa, an economist at the University of \n     California at Berkeley. ``I don't think it's a sound \n     approach. I just think we should allow the markets to work . \n     . . and this is a case where the market is working.''\n       At the school's Burch Center for Tax Policy and Public \n     Finance, economist Alan Auerbach says he found a near \n     consensus in support of a significant boost when he surveyed \n     about 30 economists at a conference in February. More than \n     half said the federal levy should be $1 a gallon or higher. \n     The sentiment among economists for a higher tax, Mr. Auerbach \n     quips, ``is right up there with free trade,'' an issue on \n     which there is virtual unanimity.\n       Economists cite various factors to justify a gasoline tax. \n     Chief among them are the environmental and health costs of \n     air pollution, along with the costs of traffic congestion, \n     and road construction and repair. ``When people consume gas, \n     they impose harms on other people that they aren't paying for \n     otherwise. They crowd the freeways and pollute,'' says David \n     Romer of the University of California at Berkeley.\n       Separately, the proponents of an increase point to foreign \n     producers' control over oil supply, and favor a gasoline tax \n     that is high enough to stem U.S. demand. Fighting pollution \n     and dependence on foreign supply ``both are reasons for why \n     this federal tax should be higher than some other tax,'' says \n     Joel Slemrod at the University of Michigan, ``but what the \n     optimal level is, I don't know.''\n       To a lesser extent, economists cite the need to cut chronic \n     federal deficits, which was the primary purpose of the 1993 \n     increase. In addition, when compared with other industrial \n     nations, the federal gasoline tax is low, they note.\n       A number of economists contacted yesterday said they simply \n     haven't done the research needed to determine the optimal \n     level for a gasoline tax or whether they would even support \n     raising it. Glenn Hubbard of Columbia University, who served \n     in the Bush administration's Treasury Department, said he and \n     other economists are reluctant to address the size of the \n     gasoline tax separately from the test of the Tax Code. But \n     given the chance to rewrite the code, he added, ``most \n     economists would say increase the gas tax and reduce some \n     other tax.''\n       In recent years, advocates of a higher federal tax have \n     ranged from Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, \n     who has proposed an unspecified increase as a conservation \n     move; to White House Budget Director Alice Rivlin; and \n     billionaire-politician Ross Perot.\n       Mr. Auerbach dismissed Congress's effort and Democrats' \n     acquiescence as ``silly,'' and other economists privately \n     condemn it as political pandering. But the tax-repeal drive \n     isn't without supporters in the profession. ``I think we \n     should be looking for opportunities to reduce taxes,'' says \n     John Taylor at Stanford University,though he adds that his \n     preference is for tax cuts that promote savings or investment \n     rather than consumption.\n       At Duke University, economist W. Kip Viscusi found in a \n     1994 study for the environmental Protection Agency that \n     federal gasoline taxes just about covered their pollution and \n     traffic costs--before the Clinton increase. ``The bottom line \n     is,'' he says, ``we're roughly at the right level.'' And if \n     the government wants funds to cut the deficit--as the 1993 \n     increase was designed to do--he says, ``there are better \n     energy targets to pick on.'' Coal, heating oil and diesel \n     fuel are undertaxed, Mr. Viscusi says, given their pollution \n     and other external costs.\n       Even Congress' economists acknowledge their effort is \n     grounded in politics, not economics, Texas GOP Sen. Phil \n     Gramm, a former professor who takes credit for the current \n     repeal vogue, says simply, ``When I get a chance to cut taxes \n     on working people, I take it.''\n       Another conservative Texan and former professor, House \n     Majority Leader Rep. Richard Armey, says simply that ``it's \n     an opportunity . . . to repeal the Clinton gasoline tax of \n     1993.'' Mr. Armey caused a stir over the weekend by \n     suggesting that the revenue loss be made up by cutting \n     spending on education.\n       The White House and Democrats in Congress have shown little \n     appetite to try to block a repeal, and instead have \n     concentrated on efforts to modify it. In particular, they \n     want to add language ensuring that oil companies reduce their \n     pump price rather than pocket the amount. But with or without \n     such an amendment, the repeal is likely to pass--with \n     bipartisan support.\n       ``If we can provide some relief through tax reduction, it \n     would be the overriding consideration regardless of what bona \n     fide arguments one can make on conservation and other \n     issues,'' says Senate Democratic Leader Thomas Daschle.\n       At least as important, Democrats don't want to risk the \n     political momentum they have built in recent weeks by \n     hammering at the GOP on job-security issues, and they are \n     leery of falling into the same trap that has ensnared \n     Republicans on the minimum-wage issue: taking a political \n     beating for opposing a questionable, though wildly popular, \n     measure.\n       ``It's completely presidential politics,'' says Sen. Kent \n     Conrad (D., N.D.,). But, like the administration, he \n     indicates he will support repeal if Republicans offer a \n     suitable method to replace the lost revenue.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if I can add one other thing to my friend \nfrom New York, and that is this: I, candidly, do not know how he voted \non increasing the mileage from 55 to 65 miles an hour. But when we vote \nto increase the mileage from 55 to 65 miles an hour----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. You vote to increase the demand for gasoline.\n  Mr. SIMON. Precisely.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Something called the ``market'' comes along and the \nprice rises because of the demand. The supply has not instantly \nresponded.\n  Mr. SIMON. If I may ask the Senator from New York, would it be \nsomewhat inconsistent for people to complain about the high price of \ngasoline and vote for this drop in the 4.3 cents and having voted for \nan increase in the mileage from 55 to 65?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I say to my friend that not only would it be \ninconsistent, but to allude to a point he made earlier, it would be \n``silly.''\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague from New York.\n  Let me mention one other thing that is, apparently, part of this \ntripod we are going to be voting on one of these days, and that is the \nTEAM Act. This is the euphemism for what is basically an antilabor bill \nthat emerged from the committee on which I serve. I think we need \nbalance in this field. We cannot go too far in the direction of labor. \nWe cannot go too far in the direction of\n\n[[Page S4795]]\n\nmanagement. But just as we have moved away from self-restraint in this \nbody in terms of politics, we have become excessively partisan. So the \nsame thing has happened in labor-management relations.\n  It used to be that when you had a Democratic President, you had a \nslight shift in the National Labor Relations Board in the direction of \nlabor; and when you had Republicans, a slight shift in the direction of \nmanagement, but a pretty good balance. Then during the Reagan years, it \nwent way out of balance. I think we did a great disservice to the \nprocess. I am pleased, incidentally, to see things like employee \nownership of United Airlines. I think that, plus profit sharing, are a \nwave of the future in terms of avoiding some of the labor-management \nproblems that we have had.\n  But it is interesting that someone like George Shultz--and we think \nof him as the former Secretary of State, but he also served as \nSecretary of Labor--said that we have an imbalance in this country that \nis not good for labor or management and not good for productivity in \nthis country. And so we ought to view any changes in labor-management \nrelations with great caution.\n\n  What the TEAM Act does--an acronym that inaccurately describes \nthings--is basically permit a company to establish a company union. \nThat is not in anyone's best interests. It is going in under the hidden \ncloak that this is a way to have teams, quality teams set up to work on \nsafety and other problems in industrial production.\n  There is no problem in that field. In fact, between 1972 and 1994, \nthere were only two employee committees that were rejected by the \nNational Labor Relations Board where there were not other factors of \nunfair labor practices involved. In terms of employee committees, it is \ndealing with a nonproblem. But it is dealing with it in a way that I \nthink creates what appears to be good things, but they are really \ncompany unions moving away from traditional unions. I think that is not \na good thing.\n  Some people have said, ``I can't understand why we have this growing \ndisparity between working men and women and those who are more \nfortunate.''\n  One of the ways you can judge that is to look at union membership. \nWhy is that disparity not so great in Canada, Germany, Great Britain, \nFrance, Japan, and other countries? Are these not free market \ncountries?\n  Yes, they are free market countries. But in those countries, you have \n33 percent, 40 percent, sometimes 90 percent union membership among the \nworking men and women. In the United States, because of the barriers we \nhave put up to organizing, it is 16 percent among our total work force, \nand if you exclude governmental unions it is down to 11.8 percent.\n  That is not a healthy thing for this Nation. That is one of the \nreasons, frankly, we have not made progress in some issues like other \ncountries have. We are the only Western industrialized nation to have \npeople without health insurance--41 million of them. We are the only \nWestern industrialized nation to have 24 percent of our children living \nin poverty. That is not an act of God. There is no divine intervention \nthat says children in the United States have to live in poverty while \nchildren in Italy and Denmark and France and Great Britain and other \ncountries have a much smaller percentage. It is the result of flawed \npolicy. And I think if we pass this legislation, we will compound the \nflawed policy.\n  I trust, Mr. President, that we will not pass this particular portion \nof the bill that we may be voting on, and I assume it will be tomorrow. \nIf it should be passed, I trust that the President of the United States \nwould veto it. I think we have to maintain balance. This bill moves \naway from that balance.\n  Mr. President, I note the presence of the distinguished junior \nSenator from Missouri, and I know he is going to get up and agree with \neverything I have just said. It may be that he will differ on a point \nor two. But I do at this point want to yield the floor and again urge \nmy colleagues to keep in mind what we need is balance in labor-\nmanagement relations. This bill moves away from that balance and does \nnot serve the Nation well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend, the Senator from \nIllinois, in whose State I spent some time this morning. I have to say \nthat I highly respect the senior Senator from Illinois. He is right. I \nwill differ with him, but I will not disagree in a way that would be \ndisagreeable.\n  No one really challenges the need for balance in the culture or in \nthe society, but I think the balance should be struck by American \nworkers. The decision about how many people should be in labor unions \nand how many people should not be in labor unions should not be \nsomething we manipulate from the U.S. Senate. Rather, the decision \nabout who is in a union or who is not in a union should be left to \nAmerican workers. We have a system in the United States, the National \nLabor Relations Board, which is designed to ensure that there is no \noppression or coercion of workers in unduly restricting their access to \nlabor organizations. In the same light, the National Labor Relations \nBoard also should make sure that there is no coercion in forcing people \nto be a part of labor organizations.\n  More importantly than trying to strike a balance from Washington, DC, \nby trying to impose a certain level of unionism on this country in \norder to match France or Germany, or England, we should provide \nAmerican workers with the ability to strike that balance for \nthemselves. Frankly, I do not want to be like France or Germany or \nEngland. I have not noticed a great stream of immigrants from the \nUnited States to France, Germany or England. The big stream of \nimmigrants is from other countries to the United States.\n  It always confounds me a little bit when people in this Chamber hold \nup what happens in other places as a reflection of what the United \nStates should become. Sure, there are free economies, but I will \nguarantee you they are not as free as the economy of the United States. \nAnd the reason people make the tough journey--and they have for \ncenturies--to these shores is because there is greater freedom here and \nthat is because we do not try to impose decisions on people from \nWashington, DC. We try to let people make the decisions, and that same \nideal should ring true in the case of the TEAM Act.\n  What is the TEAM Act? What has happened that has provoked the Senate \nto consider something that would fundamentally adjust the way in which \nwe allow workers to interrelate with their employers or companies?\n  Maybe it is best to start at what is our overarching goal? Here we \nstand in 1996, 3\\1/2\\ years from the turn of the millennium. What do we \nwant to do? What should our policy be? What do we want? I think we want \nAmerican society to survive in the next century. And I believe that we \nknow we can survive if we are productive and if we are competitive. We \nhave had some real challenges to our productivity and to our \ncompetitiveness in recent years.\n  Just a couple decades ago some folks from the Far East--instead of \nEurope--made a real run at the United States. They began to teach us \nsome lessons which first were outlined by an American professor but \nfirst were embraced by the Japanese. These were the lessons about how \nsuccessful we all could be if employers tapped their workers as a \nresource to help both workers and companies do their very best to \nimprove the product, to streamline production, to improve safety, to \nimprove conditions in the work environment, that if workers could help \nmake improvements, you could develop a higher quality and greater \nefficiency. That enhanced productivity--the quality and efficiency \ntogether equal productivity--would mean a surge in the marketplace, and \nit did. The Japanese with their auto production and electronics \nproduction nearly displaced the United States. However, we have made a \ncomeback.\n  How have we made a comeback? We made a comeback when we recognized \nthe Japanese principles that were initially discovered and taught in \nsome of the business schools of this country--the principle that \nrecognized the value of workers. These principles say that no one will \nknow the industrial process quite as intimately as the person who is on \nthe line and that person has\n\n[[Page S4796]]\n\nsomething extremely valuable to contribute.\n  And so American industries started to say let us have meetings. Let \nus get the workers together and let us discuss how we can improve our \nstanding--when we have improved standing and improved productivity, we \nhave improved job security. When we do a better job, when we produce a \nbetter product, we are going to do better and it will lift us all. It \nwill lift the employer. It will lift the employees. We will deal \ntogether as associates, and we will move forward.\n  As a matter of fact, there is a wonderful company in the State of \nMissouri. The name of the company is EFCO, E-F-C-O. They make what is \nknown as architectural glass. If you are going to build a skyscraper \nand you are going to cover it with glass, you figure out the dimensions \nof each pane and then order the glass to fit your individual project. \nYou figure out if it is going to have gas between the panes of glass or \ntinting to make the building more energy efficient. EFCO was that kind \nof company except and it had about 100 employees. They decided they \nwanted to be a leader in the industry. So they began asking their \nemployees how to do it. They developed these techniques for asking \nemployees how to make a more better product and how to improve the \nefficiency of production. They asked the employees if they had any \nideas about safety so they could improve the safety, how they could \nincrease quality, how they could have on-time deliveries. They were \nonly having about 75 percent on-time deliveries when they started these \ncommittees, and recently, after doing this for quite some time, they \nwere up to the high 90's in on-time deliveries. Everything was going \nwell. The workers were earning more. The company exploded from 100-plus \nworkers to over 1,000 workers, supplying architectural glass to people \nnot only in this country but around the world.\n\n  All of a sudden a grievance was filed that these committees are an \ninappropriate act and that somehow, this is some phony union.\n  I want to be clear and distinct about my disagreement with the senior \nSenator from Illinois, who said the TEAM Act permits a company \nbasically to establish a company union. Not so. The workers would have \nevery opportunity, and never lose their opportunity, to petition the \nNational Labor Relations Board to certify a union on the premises of \nthese plants. There is no part of the TEAM Act which says that if you \nestablish these company committees to improve communication, to elevate \nproductivity, to lift worker satisfaction, that it in any way prohibits \na union from being established. It is just wrong. It is inappropriate, \nit is inaccurate, it is a misrepresentation of the bill to say that it \npermits a company union. It does not. But it does authorize companies, \nif they want to, to tap the most vital and essential resource that a \ncompany has, and that is the people who work there.\n  EFCO got to talking to people, and some of the people in these groups \nsaid you ought to let us do things this way, to have our vacations so \nwe could be happier workers and be more productive, and to think about \nthis in terms of the way you compensate us.\n  A grievance was filed saying that this was somehow a company union, \nbecause the company dominated the committees by providing something as \nfundamental as a paper and pencil, because there were discussions of \nthings that related to employment and because the company did not \nignore the discussions but actually took them to heart. Therefore it \nwas disqualified as if it were a union.\n  Let me just say a couple of things about that. No. 1, Missouri \nworkers and American workers are not stupid. I spent a lot of time on \nmy campaign working in the plants in Missouri and since I have been a \nSenator, I have gone back to work in the plants. These workers know \nwhether they are members of a labor union or not. They know whether \nthey are in a discussion group or not. I do not have such a low regard \nfor the workers in my State to think that they cannot tell the \ndifference between a discussion group and a labor union. As a matter of \nfact, it is strange to me to see those individuals who fear these \ncommittees, because individuals who work in these settings are happier \nand more productive. Maybe they think they do not need a union as much. \nThat could be. I would not argue with that. If they are getting along \nwithout one, they might not want to pay union dues. That could be the \ncase and it would remain their choice.\n  But these workers know whether they are in a union or not. It is \nstrange to me that while employers are highly valuing employees--and do \nnot have a low estimation of who these workers are, what they are, and \nwhat they can achieve--and those who are representing the organized \nlabor interests in America are saying that these highly valued \nemployees are being confused about whether this is a union or not.\n  I want you to know that, from my experience, none of the employees \nwho have participated in these activities--that I know of--confuses \nthese committees with a labor union. But nonetheless, the National \nLabor Relations Board brought an action against EFCO, the company I \ntalked about that went from 100-plus employees to 1,000 employees, to \nstop them from valuing their employees. The NLRB said it was an unfair, \ninappropriate labor practice to have this kind of discussion, this kind \nof interrelationship, and this utilization and tapping of a wonderful \nresource of informed and enthusiastic workers to improve their \nproductivity. What a terrible thing.\n\n  This win-win situation is now illegal. An interesting question is \nwhether it is illegal to have these kinds of discussion groups if there \nis a union on the premises. The answer is--not at all. As a matter of \nfact, in a union setting, these committees are just fine. There is no \nproblem. In my opinion, this is a discrimination against companies and \nworkers who decide they work better and choose to work better absent a \nunion.\n  My colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, says we need balance. \nIt seems to me, if this is a device that is available to union \nfacilities, it ought to be a device that is available to groups of \nworkers and their employers when those groups of workers have chosen--\nnot to be unionized. If we are talking about balance here, the balance \nought to be that workers make the choice, not that we manipulate the \nchoices from here in Washington, DC.\n  These are win-win situations. There is a very simple question here. \nAre we going to forbid employers and companies in America from \nconsulting with workers to improve productivity, to improve safety, to \nimprove worker satisfaction, to build job security? Are we going to \nmake that illegal?\n  Are we going to continue to allow that to be the source of conflict \nwith an enforcement agency of the Government that says: Whatever you \ndo, you cannot ask your workers what would be a better way to do \nthings? You cannot ask them how you could better improve their safety? \nYou cannot ask them how you could make the output more efficient so \nthey can be more competitive around the world and thereby protect their \njobs? Are we going to maintain a system that says you cannot do that? \nOr are we going to say: Wait a second, we are going into the next \nmillennium and we have to be competitive with people from Singapore, \npeople from Taiwan, people from China--1 billion plus people--\nenergetically pointed toward the United States and the world as a \nmarketplace, who want to compete with us. Or are we going to say to \nemployers: You cannot talk to your workers to find out what is \nefficient and what is inefficient?\n  As I look toward the next century and as I look at my children--you \nknow, one is just out in the workplace now. Two are still involved in \neducation. I hope one of them is going to graduate next Saturday. But \nin the workplace, what kind of a team do we want to play for? Do we \nwant to have a team where we hobble the real stars? The real stars of \nthe competitive productivity of the United States are the workers. Are \nwe going to say we want to tape their mouths shut, we want to rely only \non the individuals in the board room? Do we want to rely only on the \nguys who come out with the fancy degrees? Or are we willing to hear the \nvoice of the people from the shop floor who are able to say: You know, \nI have looked at this and I have been working on this and I believe if \nwe just swap positions in the process, this for that, it would be a lot \nsafer; or, we\n\n[[Page S4797]]\n\ncan eliminate this step in the production and we can be a lot more \ncompetitive.\n  I frankly believe, as we face this next millennium, we can no longer \nafford a NLRB that goes to the companies and says, ``Unh-unh, shame on \nyou for talking to the workers.'' Eighteen cases were pursued by the \nNLRB since 1992 saying you cannot talk to the workers about improved \nconditions, you cannot confer with them about how to have an increase \nin your safety, you cannot ask them to help you figure out how to be \nmore competitive.\n  We have had about 30,000 employers trying to use these methods in \nresponse to the competitive surge from across the ocean, from Japan and \nothers who are using these techniques. Let me say American workers have \nthe right to opt for union membership. They have the right to ask for \nit. They have the right to petition for it. That right would persist. \nNothing is done to change that by the TEAM Act. They would have the \nability to ask that unions be organized and they would have the entire \nframework of the NLRB to make sure that any election is a fair \nelection.\n  But I think, for us to say we do not want to be able to use the \nresource that workers present as a means of improving our productivity \nis a terrible violation of basic sound public policy principles. It \nundervalues the American work force substantially. It ignores the fact \nthat, of those who make a contribution, I believe the contribution of \nthe worker is high on the list.\n  You know, this was a theme of President Clinton's State of the Union \nMessage. He kept talking about teamwork. He said what we cannot do \nseparately we ought to be able to do together. He talked about \ncooperation. He said, and I agree and I quote: ``When companies and \nworkers work as a team, they do better, and so does America.'' Not only \ndo I agree with that, I do not think I could have said it better \nmyself.\n  This just appears to be one of those disparities. I do not think he \nmeant to say, ``When union companies and union workers work as a team, \nthey do better and so does America.'' I am sure that is true, but to \nlimit that to 11 percent of the work force--as the senior Senator from \nIllinois said, 11.8 percent of the work force in the United States, \noutside of government, has decided to be represented by a union--to \nlimit the ability to confer and to have those advantages to only 1 out \nof 10 workers seems to be a terrible way to structure and to establish \nthe potential for this country to succeed in the next century.\n  I believe that it is the fundamental responsibility of Government--\nthis is at the base of it all; this is why we are here--to establish an \nenvironment in which people reach the maximum of their potential.\n  Government ought to be an institution which promotes growth, not \ngrowth in Government, but growth for people, for individuals and for \ninstitutions, for citizens and for corporations. And if we are a \nsociety of growth, we will succeed. And if we are a society of \nshrinkage, we will not.\n  Now, are we going to grow by using the entire array of talents in our \nculture, or are we going to say to 9 out of 10 workers, ``You can't \ncollaborate, you can't confer with, you can't discuss, you can't make \nsuggestions.''\n  When the EFCO case, to which I have referred, was handed down by the \njudge, the judge said, ``This is good for the workers, this is good for \nthe company, this is good for the community, but the technical aspects \nof the law require that I stop this procedure.'' And we want to say, \n``You're right, judge, it's good for the workers, it's good for the \ncompany, it's good for the community, and we want to change the law \njust to allow it to be possible for the 9 out of 10 nonunion workers to \nbe able to confer with their employers in the same way that union \nworkers do in terms of making suggestions for increased productivity.''\n  I believe that the TEAM Act should be enacted. It must be enacted if \nwe really care about American workers. Let me just say, we are talking \nabout 9 out of 10 workers in the American workplace. A lot has been \nsaid about the minimum wage. The minimum wage affects fewer than 5 \npercent of the workers in this country. We are down at very low levels \nof people who are affected. I think minimum wage affects about 3.1 \npercent of the population. Here we are talking about something that \naffects the entire population, the ability of this whole society to \nmove forward competitively.\n  I see my friend, the Senator from Vermont, on the floor. Mr. \nPresident, does the Senator desire to speak on this issue?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I certainly do desire to speak. I, first \nof all, commend my good friend from Missouri for a very articulate and \nwell-stated position on the TEAM Act. I would like to provide some \ndifferent perspectives, both historical and with respect to the minimum \nwage, at some point. I will be happy to proceed now or as soon as the \nSenator from Missouri is through.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am very pleased to yield the floor. I, \nof course, cannot yield but to the Chair, but in respect to my \nunderstanding and awareness that the Senator from Vermont is here, it \nis my pleasure to yield the floor and to thank the Chair for his \nindulgence for my opportunity to support what I believe is a \nfundamental ingredient of the success and the survival of this society \nin the next century, productivity and competitiveness when we call upon \nworkers and allow them to make a contribution which will allow us to \nsucceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to pursue TEAM Act. I must say, \nit is difficult for me, from analyzing the circumstances which brought \nabout TEAM Act, to understand why anyone would disagree with going back \nto what everybody presumed the law to be.\n  First of all, let me make it clear, I am in favor of the minimum \nwage. I am one of those Republicans who is in favor of the minimum \nwage. So the minimum wage and TEAM Act are not linked, other than from \nperhaps some political aspect. But to me, the TEAM Act is essential in \norder to continue the increasing productivity of this Nation. But my \ncolleagues better understand the TEAM Act and how it came about and why \nwe are in this difficulty.\n  Let me take you back 40 years. Forty years ago, I was a senior at \nYale University, and I was a student studying industrial management, \nindustrial administration. At that time, we were studying what ought to \noccur for the future to improve productivity and to build an industrial \nmight in this Nation which would allow us to proceed with the greatest \npossible benefit to workers and to management.\n  It was an interesting time and there was a great debate going on in \nour Nation as to what we should do as we moved into the future.\n  It was also an interesting time, of course, because we had a certain \nman called Joseph McCarthy in this Senate who was very concerned about \ncommunism and anything that smacked of communism seemed to be sort of \nin ill repute. Thus, when you started talking about workers getting \ntogether with management and those kind of things, it raised some \nconcern with some people.\n  It also was a time when the unions were trying to organize and become \nmore forceful and protect the rights of workers. But those in the \nacademia were discussing the philosophies of the two systems and how we \ncould better get together, workers and management, working together in \nAmerican society to bring about higher productivity and to bring about \nbetter rewards to the workers.\n  So we discussed the many things which, at that time, were very \ninnovative and novel and hardly discussed before. I wrote my senior \nthesis on how we could try to improve the productivity of workers and \nthe workers' plight in our Nation. I remember at that time writing and \ndiscussing about options of profit sharing, profit sharing with stocks, \nprofit sharing period, stock options, and even as far as putting a \nmember of the unions or workers on boards of directors.\n  A considerable amount of effort by the academia went into outlining \nand defining these. The only problem was, the only ones who were \nlistening were the Japanese, the Germans, and others. So when the \nMarshall plan came in, along with all of our wealth that we shared in \norder to bring about the industrial might of those nations in Europe \nand Asia, the only ones who took the ideas that were expressed by those\n\n[[Page S4798]]\n\nwho were trying to look to the future to try and provide a better lot \nfor workers and higher productivity for industry, were the Japanese, \nthe Germans, and the Europeans.\n  So what we have seen that has occurred over the past 40 years is that \nin those nations, the concept of the TEAM Act, which we are trying to \nbring in here again, was incorporated fully; in fact, in Germany, even \nmore so than anywhere else, where you do have members of the workers or \nthe labor unions participating in the boards of directors.\n  What has evolved in Japan, for instance, is an incredible social \norganization in their school system to teach teamwork, teamwork among \nall classes, teamwork to bring about the ability to work together. And, \nthus, you have seen a closer relationship in those nations with the \nworker and management than you have in this Nation.\n  A decade or so ago when our Nation found itself beginning to be \noutshone in productivity and in the marketplace because of the \nincursion of automobiles in this country from Europe and from Asia, \nwhich practically wrecked our automobile industry, the kind of skills \nthat are necessary in our industries now, which are far different from \nwhat they were in the fifties wherein you spent your time just stamping \nsomething or pushing one button or all of the things that were in mass \nproduction in those days have evolved into a work force that needs to \nhave technical skills to understand the workings of the machines, the \ncomputerization of machines--all of these skills in the mass production \nprocedures.\n  These resulted in those countries, Japan and Malaysia, all of these \nthat had taken this advice of working together and figuring out how to \nimprove productivity--they found that the best providers of \nimprovements in the productivity were the workers themselves; whereas, \nin this country we just turned around and we kept trying to do quality \ncontrol. We would bring things back and repair them.\n  The Japanese and Germans learned the best place to stop is when you \nare in the production line. You find out you are producing too many \nthings that are wrong, you find out what is going wrong and have the \nworkers work with you to find out what is going wrong. So their \nproductivity improved. The number of malfunctions or nonworking pieces \nproduced were reduced substantially by working with the workers.\n  It took us quite awhile to learn that. But now we have learned that. \nAt a time when we now have thousands and thousands of these teams that \nare working together to improve productivity in this country, to make \nsure that we can outdo the Japanese, can outdo the Germans--and we have \nbeen successful. Yes, we have been successful. There are shining \nexamples of that, Motorola and others, who learned the teamwork process \nand have now superseded in the markets in Asia in direct competition. \nWe are winning. We are doing it.\n  Now what happens? All of a sudden the NLRB comes out with its \ndecision: ``You cannot do that. No. You formed a union here, and you \nhave got to go through all the election processes or you can't meet.'' \nWhat is going to happen? If we do not pass the TEAM Act, thousands of \nthese teams are going to be destroyed. The productivity gains that we \nhave made over the past decade, which have been going on for some 40 \nyears in Europe and Japan, all that we have learned will be destroyed.\n  Why in the world would the unions oppose this? Well, it is simple. \nThey are threatened. They are nervous because they have been going \ndown. They did not want to do anything that would in any way enhance \nthe workers and the management to get together to improve productivity \nunless they are union people. Well, that may be fine, but that is not \nthe way to do it. You have to prove, through the reasons that you give \nthe workers to join, that they want to form a union; but you should not \nkill the productivity which is now beginning to come up by throwing all \nof these--I think the Senator from Missouri mentioned maybe up to \n30,000 of these teams that are out there. If we do not do something \nhere, if we do not do it quickly, then all those productivity \nmechanisms are going to be destroyed.\n  So it boggles my mind to think that anyone can oppose a provision in \nthe law that says, ``Hey, if you want to work, sit down and you can \ntalk about improvements,'' because if there is no improvement, if there \nis no productivity, there is no profit. If there is no profit, there is \nnothing to split. So let us get the profit first, and then we will \nworry about how you bargain or are considered about how to cut the \nprofits up.\n  That is a separate issue all right. That is for the unions. If you \nget into that kind of discussions, yes, maybe you are getting into \nunionism. But there is certainly no disagreement with the fact that if \nthere is not a profit, there is not anything to split. So why kill off \nthe mechanisms to provide the profit?\n  So I say that I hope that Members of this body will recognize that \nthe issue being created here is one that is so dangerous to the \nnational productivity right now that, if we did not do something to \nprove and to improve upon the ability of our workers to interact and to \ncooperate and to learn the skills necessary to bring about \nproductivity, we will find ourselves in the not-too-distant future of \nhaving a situation where we have destroyed the great improvements that \nwe have been making over the last decade in productivity.\n  So I just cannot impress upon my colleagues how important the TEAM \nAct is. If you do not believe so, talk to your businessmen and talk to \nthe workers in those plants that are not unionized who believe very \nstrongly that the best way to cooperate, to get a profit and to learn \nhow to split the profits is through improving productivity. If we do \nnot pass the TEAM Act, we are about to see that great movement forward \nin productivity disappear. So I hope our colleagues will support the \nTEAM Act. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I certainly want to commend the Senator \nfrom Vermont for his outstanding remarks regarding the TEAM Act. He \ntalks about productivity and about these fundamental communications.\n  I have here in my hand a document which lists the illegal subjects of \ndiscussion as they have been decided in different cases.\n  The Union Child Day-Care Center case of 1991 said it was illegal to \ndiscuss allowing employees to use company vehicles to obtain lunch. \nTherefore, if there was some sort of discussion that said, ``Well, if \nwe could just occasionally use one of the company vehicles to go get \nthe lunches, we could * * *,'' it would be illegal.\n  Here is another example. It says an impermissible topic is, ``In-\nplant cafeteria and vending machine food and beverage prices.'' So, if \na discussion group said, ``You know, we need to lower prices on some of \nthese things. This concessionaire you have got running the vending \nmachines around here * * *,'' it would be illegal.\n  Here is a third example: ``Company provided meals'' is an \nimpermissible topic. If the discussion group said, ``You know, we could \nget some more done if you guys could provide some meals or help us with \nour eating * * *,'' it would be illegal.\n  ``Abolishing a paid lunch program'' was found to be illegal, \naccording to the Van Dorn Machinery Co. case.\n  Here is another example that is really troubling, a whole category of \nsafety topics that it was illegal for workers to talk to their employer \nabout.\n  ``Safety labeling of electrical breakers.'' I should think we would \nwant workers to be able to talk to their employers about conditions of \na safer workplace. Workers, individually or collectively, should be \nable to say ``these things are not labeled properly as `illegal'.''\n  ``Tornado warning procedures.'' It is illegal for workers to talk \nwith their employers about that, according to the Dillon case.\n  ``The purchase of new lifting equipment for the stock crew.''\n  Rules about fighting--if there is a fight that breaks out among \nemployees, American workers must say, ``no, we can't have anybody talk \nto the employer about how to settle it.''\n  I think these are obviously the kinds of things that workers should \nbe consulted about, and they should be given an opportunity.\n  ``Safety goggles for fryer and bailer operators.''\n\n[[Page S4799]]\n\n  ``The sharpness of the edges of safety knives.''\n  Here is a case where employees could not talk to their employers \nabout a smelly propane operation, propane being an explosive gas, \nburnable gas. I would want to be able to talk about that.\n  The case of the E.I. DuPont case, which was a 1993 case. The subject \nwas safety. ``No. You can't allow workers to talk.'' Of course American \npublic policy should encourage rather than discourage employers from \ndiscussing safety issues.\n  ``Drug use and alcohol testing of employees.'' That could not be the \nsubject of discussion. It is no wonder that the Senator from Vermont is \nso compelling in his arguments about this whole situation when he says \nthat we need to be able to discuss these things. This is not the old \ndays of the 1930's.\n  I thank the Senator for bringing out the fact that there were times \nwhen America marched forward by having adversarial fights between labor \nand management--between employers and employees. I think we will march \nforward much more quickly and competitively if we can have the benefit \nof the wisdom of workers in solving some of these fundamental problems.\n  Every once in awhile you hear about these teams, and you think they \nmust be talking about advanced circuitry. Sometimes they are. But \nsometimes they are just talking about, ``Hey, we'd better make sure \nthat the safety procedures are good enough here in the event we have a \ntornado.'' According to the rules as they now stand, if you want to \ndiscuss how you evacuate the building in the event of a tornado, you \nviolate the law. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator from Missouri for his very \narticulate and well-expressed opinions here. I am hopeful that when our \ncolleagues listen and understand what we are talking about here, this \nTEAM Act, we will move through and do what we must do, and that is \nimprove our productivity in this Nation.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, one of the things that workers want to \ntalk to their employers about, and they want to talk to us about, is \ntheir ability to resolve the tension that exists between the workplace \nand their families. Most of the men and most of the women in today's \nmodern work force feel a tension between serving the needs of their \nfamilies and being on the job.\n  If we were really concerned about workers, we would also direct our \nattention to the substance of the Fair Labor Standards Act. This \narchaic rule literally makes it illegal if an hourly worker goes in on \nFriday afternoon and says, as an employee, ``I have to go see Sally get \nan award at the honors program at the high school this afternoon. Can I \nmake up the time on Monday?'' Our labor laws make that illegal for the \nemployer to let the employee just make up that time on Monday. We have \na situation where we have so many people now trying to juggle both work \nand family--I do not need to go through the statistics.\n  In the 1930's, when we created the Fair Labor Standards Act, we had \nfewer than 16 percent of the women of childbearing age in the work \nforce. Now 75 percent of all the women with children 6 and under are in \nthe work force. We have just a dramatic difference. We need to make it \nas easy as we possibly can for these people to accommodate the needs of \ntheir children. This can be accomplished by having flexible work \nschedules, by allowing individuals, if they are asked to work overtime \nsometime, to say, ``I'll take it in comp time, time and one-half, in \nterms of time off.''\n  We accorded this privilege to the Federal Government in 1945. That is \nhow long they have had the potential of not taking overtime but just \ntaking comp time for people who would rather have time than pay. Since \n1978, we have had a flexible work arrangement for Federal employees \nwhich allowed those who are running the Federal Government and the \ndifferent departments to say to their employees, ``If you need to take \n2 hours off on Friday afternoon you can make those 2 hours up on \nMonday.'' The Federal employees have had it in terms of comp time for \nover half a century; in terms of flexible time, for 18 years.\n  However, the rest of the American workplace still finds itself \nrigidly confined and the family disadvantaged substantially by the fact \nthat it is illegal for someone to say, ``Make up the 2 hours on Monday \nafternoon. We are glad to have you go and participate with your \nfamily.''\n  I have introduced legislation to address this. It is called the Work \nand Family Integration Act. It is the way to build a better workplace \nfor the next century, recognizing and reflecting the needs, concerns, \nand the difficult challenges that families face now. It does not allow \nany employer to demand or extract any overtime in any way without \npaying time and a half for it in accordance with the traditional rules. \nBut, if the worker desires, the worker could shift some of his workweek \nfrom 1 week to the next with the managers or the employers' agreement.\n  We held a hearing on this in the committee and people were talking \nabout snow days here in Washington. A whole group of employees were \nsnowed out on Friday. Their employer was not allowed to let them make \nthat 8 hours up 2 hours at a time in 4 days the next week. As a result \na whole group of workers lost a whole day's pay. I am talking about 300 \npeople at one plant because our labor laws prohibit the making up of \ntime once you cross the end of a week.\n  Now, it seems to me if the employees request and the employer is \nwilling to accommodate, we should have flexible work arrangements. \nAlso, we should allow--if the employer asks someone to work overtime--\nthe employee to choose to take that overtime not in extra money but in \ntime and a half off. As a matter of fact, that comports with, \nobviously, what the Federal Government has suggested is available for \nits own employees for the last 50 years, but it is something where the \naverage worker just does not have equality with the Federal employees.\n  I believe this is a measure which ought to be supported if we really \ncare about workers. Mr. President, 60-some percent of all the men in \nthe culture say they want to spend more time with their families. Give \nthe employers and the employees an opportunity to work together to \nspend more time with their families.\n  I was stunned with a statistic I read the other day that 30-some \npercent of all the men in America said they had passed up promotions in \norder to spend more time with their families, and 60-some percent of \nthe women in America said they had passed up promotions. When people \npass up a promotion that means they are not living or working at their \nhighest potential. It means their employers know they could do a \ndifferent kind of job, a better job, more demanding job, and it means \nthe person knows they can do it, but they do not want to sacrifice the \nfamily. So we end up deploying our resources, our great human talent, \nat lower than optimal levels because people are protecting their \nability to work with their families.\n  Why do we not say we will allow you to protect your ability to work \nwith your family by giving you flexible working opportunities like we \nhave in the Federal Government. Just extend to the private sector what \nwe have in the Federal Government. We should do that so we get the \ngreater productivity and output from the workers across America. If we \nhave higher productivity and output and we have more time with our \nfamilies, we have more worker satisfaction, I can guarantee that will \nbe a formula for success and survival into the next century. Whether we \nsink or swim depends on our ability to be competitive. We have rules \nfrom 60, 70 years ago s which make it impossible for us to survive. It \nis like swimming across the lake with a sack of cement. It is heavy to \nbegin with, but when it solidifies it is a weight to carry and we need \nto shed this kind of impediment. We need to free individuals to make \nthese requests and agreements.\n\n  Some say, ``Wait a second, some might be abused by their employers.'' \nWe have the Department of Labor, an army of wage and hour enforcement \nindividuals. There would be no ability to compel anything that is not \ncompellable now. All we want to do is free these friends, the employers \nand employees to work cooperatively so they can accommodate the needs \nof their families. I think it is something which ought to be done. As a \nmatter of fact,\n\n[[Page S4800]]\n\nit is something with which the administration agrees--at least \nrhetorically.\n  I was pleased to note from the Bureau of National Affairs, the Daily \nLabor Report, Vice President Gore, May 3, called on U.S. employers to \ncreate father-friendly workplaces. Addressing a Federal conference on \nstrengthening the role of fathers in families, Gore ``urged American \ncompanies to give employees flex time opportunities to expand \noptions.'' Now, wait a second. We have the Vice President of the United \nStates saying we need flextime, legislative proposals before the \nCongress which would provide for flextime, the President of the United \nStates having said we need to work together as teams in his State of \nthe Union Message, but a promise they will veto employee option \nflextime and comp time.\n  Again, we have the dysfunction between the speak and the specifics, \nbetween the rhetoric and the reality. It is high time we say to \nAmerican families, ``We want to do more than talk about you. We want to \ndo more than say we need family-friendly and father-friendly work \npolicies.'' We ought to be willing to say, ``Yes, the American worker \nin the private sector deserves the same kind of opportunities to work \ncooperatively, to arrange to meet the needs of her family, his family, \nmeet that need just like Federal employees.'' In 1978 we started \nflexible scheduling in the Federal Government as a pilot project. In \n1982, we extended it. Along about 1985 we decided, hey, this is good \nenough to put right into the law. We have a report to congressional \ncommittees from the United States General Accounting Office, ``The \nChanging Work Force: Comparison of Federal and non-Federal work family \nprograms and approaches,'' that documents the fact this is available. \nIt is available and it is working in the Federal Government. But we are \nafraid to extend it, afraid to offer this opportunity to people in the \nprivate sector.\n  I cannot believe it. Do you know what Federal workers said about \nthis? Overwhelmingly, ``We like it, we want it, we must have it, we \nshould continue to have it,'' when they talk to their employer about \nconditions of employment. President Clinton, the President himself, in \n1994, put out an Executive order that this is a good deal, best thing \nsince sliced bread. This is something you cannot argue with. He says we \nshould extend this, make sure that every person in the executive \nbranch, even those in the White House, have this capacity. It is good \nenough for the White House--if it is good enough for Pennsylvania \nAvenue--it is good enough for Main Street, USA.\n  If we really care about workers, and I believe we must, if we really \ncare about our fellow Americans, we must care less about special \ninterests who are afraid if we make workers happy they might not join \nunions. I think what we have to say is: How do we confront the \nchallenges of the next century? How do we make sure that America does \nnot slip? How do we make sure there is a job base, an industrial \ncapacity competitive enough that when our children and grandchildren \nneed jobs and when the other countries of this world come fully online \nwith a competitive challenge--how do we make sure we are ready to meet \nthat challenge?\n  Can we do it with a law that was passed in the 1930's and says that, \n``Well, shucks, we cannot allow Americans to accommodate the needs of \ntheir families. We certainly would not want people in the private \nsector to have the same benefits the Federal employees have for \naccommodating those needs. We have to be very much afraid if these \nworkers get too happy, either conferring with their employers or \ncooperating so that they can see the soccer game or watch the awards \nceremony that the special interests in this country will not make it. \nWell, I think you and I understand, and I think down deep we all know \nthat it will not do much good to have healthy special interests if the \nnational interests go down the drain.\n  As we look to the next century, I think we have to look to those \nnational interests: Flexible work arrangements are important in helping \nmothers and fathers be deployed in the workplace to the maximum of \ntheir capacity and to accommodate the needs of our families. We have to \nlook after American families. Yes, let us let workers talk. Let workers \ntalk to their fellow employees and employers about things as \nfundamental as tornado drills and whether the propane is leaking out of \nthe tank and whether the electrical circuit breakers are properly \nlabeled. Let us not assume they cannot do that unless they first call \nin the union. Let us not underestimate the value of the American \nworker. Let us capitalize on the value of the American worker.\n  If we really care about America's workers, we will do things for all \nof them, for the vast majority of them, like flex time and the TEAM \nAct, which invites the entirety of the population to flourish. Sure, I \nunderstand concerns about the tiny, narrow fragment of people on the \nminimum wage. However, well over half of those people are part of \nhouseholds that make over $45,000 a year. I think the number is 57 \npercent. I started working way below the minimum wage, a third below \nthe minimum wage. I am glad somebody did not tell me it was ``because \nyou are not worth the minimum wage; you are useless.'' I may have been \nuseless at the time, but somebody agreed to pay me 50 cents an hour \nwhen the minimum wage was 75 cents, and I got my start. I do not think \nI have missed a day of work since. There are those in my home State who \nthink I am still worth about 50 cents an hour, but my view is that my \nwork and my values should be determined by what I can produce. I should \nnot be told if I cannot produce at one level, that I am worthless and \nworth nothing at all.\n  Let me just make one other comment about another topic. I do not see \nanyone else seeking the opportunity to speak. There is a lot of talk \nabout gasoline taxes. Frankly, I think the most recent gas tax, the one \npassed in 1993, was mislabeled. It was a tax on gasoline all right, but \nit went someplace else. Prior to that time, gas taxes were all spent to \nbuild highways and roads. But the gas tax in 1993, the most recent one \nthat added significantly--about 25 percent--to the gas tax we already \nhad, or more, I guess, that gas tax went into the general fund. So when \nthe Senators from a variety of jurisdictions get up and say we need gas \ntaxes because they build highways, the general fund does not build \nhighways. The highway trust fund builds highways. The last gas tax was \nnot a demand for more road-building capacity. It was a demand that \npeople who drive perhaps would subsidize social programs.\n  Now, that bothered me because I think the gas tax that builds \nhighways is really a reasonable, uniquely sensible approach. The people \nusing the highways are paying for the highways. How wonderful. \nGovernment ought to work that way. The more you drive, the more you \npay. The more you drive, the more you use the highways. Makes sense. \nBut, no, in 1993 they decided--and I opposed it. I was not here, but I \nwas opposed to it. That was not the right way to do things, to take \nwhat people were trusting to be a gas tax and put it in the old general \nfund so it would support social programs.\n  I have to say I am distressed by that because it says that we are \ngoing to put a tax on drivers, and we are going to use that to support \nsocial programs, and that means people who live in the outer-State \nareas--a lot of people in the West where they drive long distances when \nthey go to work--are going to be asked to subsidize social programs at \na higher level, to bear an inordinate cost, to bear an unusual share of \nthese social programs.\n  Well, you all know, and I know, that the social programs have driven \nthe deficit in this country, which is about $5 trillion now. A newborn \nchild owes $19,000 the day he or she is born. The idea of trying to \nfigure out ways to keep displacing the burden of taxation, to load it \nup on the guys out West, or the people who are in the nonurban areas, \nto drive just for the privilege of driving, they are going to have to \npay an inordinate share of these other programs. That, to me, is a \nbankrupt concept.\n  It might be different if we had passed the gas tax to pay for what \nthe gas really uses, and that is the highways. But this is not one of \nthose situations. I opposed it because it is not one of those \nsituations, and I would favor the repeal of it because it is not one of \nthose situations. We do not spend the money in the highway trust fund \nwe have now. We use it to mask the deficit in part of the flim-flam of \nWashington economics. To add an additional gas\n\n[[Page S4801]]\n\ntax as additional flim-flam to spend on a variety of other Government \nprograms that have not really gotten us far, except into debt, I think \nhas moved us in the wrong direction. I personally will be glad to \nsupport a repeal of the gas tax, because I believe that, as it relates \nto taxes, America is running out of gas. We are tired of taxes. We \nrealize that we have them at a higher and higher level.\n  Last week, the Department of Commerce released the data for this last \nyear, and we have had the highest tax rate from the Federal Government \nwe have ever had in the history of America. We fought the world wars \nand charged American citizens less than we are charging them now. We \nspent our way out of the Depression and charged America less than we \nare charging now. It is time for us to come to grips with the \nresponsibility we have to put Government under control, to change the \nWashington-knows-best way of doing business. It is time for us to be \nsober about our responsibilities as it relates to the hard-earned money \nof our constituents. As it relates to taxes, America is running out of \ngas. It should be running out of a gas tax which was inappropriately \nlevied in 1993 and should be appropriately repealed by the U.S. \nCongress in 1996.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe).

Madam President, I rise today to join with many of my \nfriends and colleagues in acknowledging a red letter day. Today is tax \nfreedom day--the day the American family breaks the shackles placed on \nthem by high taxes in this country, the day when Americans can stop \nworking for the Government and start working for themselves.\n  Not until May 7, 1996, do average families actually earn enough money \nto start paying their own bills instead of the Government's. Not until \nMay 7 do average Americans have after-tax money to pay for their \nhouses. Not until May 7 do average Americans have after-tax money to \nbuy food and clothing for their families.\n  And, never has tax freedom day occurred so late in the year. Look at \nthe calendar: 1996 is more than one-third over. Americans work one-\nthird of the entire year just to support governments.\n  I often wish the big spenders both in Congress and in the executive \nbranch would stop thinking in terms of revenue and start thinking in \nterms of what revenue really is--taxes. We need to measure this burden \nand talk about it in personal terms, not just in vague budget-speak. \nYou know, there are folks in America to whom $100 million is a lot of \nmoney--not just a mere point one on a computer printout.\n  To help illustrate this problem, I would like to take a closer look \nat the tax burden of a family from my home State of Utah:\n  A Utah family of four with an estimated median income of $44,871 pays \napproximately $8,800 in direct and indirect Federal taxes. On top of \nthis outrageous amount, they must also pay over $5,700 in State and \nlocal taxes, bringing the total family tax burden to $14,538. This is \nan effective tax rate of 32.4 percent.\n  Now, while a family income of about $45,000 might sound like quite a \nbit of money in some parts of the country, I think few people, besides \npossibly President Clinton, would venture to call this family of four \nrich.\n  Madam President, as you can see, the tax burden of a family with this \nincome is astronomical. However, the cost of the Federal Government to \nthem does not end with these taxes. In order to accurately estimate the \nGovernment's true burden on Utah families, we must also calculate the \nregulatory costs and their effect on the prices of goods and services. \nWe must factor in the higher interest rates that families must pay as a \nresult of the Federal deficit.\n  In essence, Federal, State, and local taxes on the family are all \nincreased by excessive Federal borrowing. Excessive Federal regulation \ncombined with the increase in interest payments raises the Government's \ncost by $8,600. Thus, the estimated total of Government costs to this \ntypical Utah family is over $23,000. That is about 52 percent of their \nincome. Utah families deserve better. Every American family deserves \nbetter.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 was predicated in large part on the \nidea that the American public could spend their money more effectively \nthan the Federal Government could spend it. Not only did the Balanced \nBudget Act contain a bona fide plan for balancing the budget within 7 \nyears, it also contained a number of tax reductions geared to helping \nAmerican families and to spurring economic growth.\n  A balanced budget is not a new idea. Until the mid-1930's, this \nGovernment regularly managed to balance its books every year except in \nwartime; and, even then, the debt was repaid as soon as possible after \nthe crisis was over. But, in the 1960's, things really got out of hand. \nEntitlements flourished. And, of course, less and less restraint on \nspending meant more and more taxation. Big government means big taxes.\n  However, President Clinton chose to veto the Balanced Budget Act. He \nchose to camouflage his reluctance to cut Government spending and taxes \nwith demagoguery. He claimed that many of the tax cuts in this package \nwere targeted to benefit the rich, regardless of the many studies that \ndemonstrate why this is not true.\n  He claimed that these tax cuts came at the expense of programs \nintended to aid the poor and the elderly. But, let's be clear about \nthis: budget experts have made it very clear that these programs must \nbe controlled independent of a tax cut package, not because of one.\n  And, let's be clear about something else as well: Balancing the \nbudget\n\n[[Page S4802]]\n\nshould not provide the excuse for not enacting tax cuts. That has been \na convenient rationale for those who want to spend and spend. For \nalmost the last half century, Government has spent $1.59 for every new \ndollar in taxes. Government isn't taxing the American people to \neliminate the deficit; it is taxing people in order to spend.\n  In 1993, President Clinton worked hard to push through Congress--by a \nbare one-vote margin in the House and a tie-breaking vote in the Senate \nby Vice President Gore--one of the largest tax hikes in history.\n  In 1994, Republican candidates for Congress pledged to cut taxes. In \n1995, they delivered. Today, the only thing that stands between the \nUtah family--as well as millions of other American households--and tax \nrelief is Bill Clinton.\n  One of the most misunderstood items of the tax cut package is the \ncapital gains tax cut. The truth is that a capital gains tax cut is an \ninvestment incentive, and every American could gain from this tax \nreduction. Let me give you the facts, Mr. President.\n  From 1985 to 1992, over 7 million taxpayers had a capital gain each \nyear. And, 62 percent of these returns reporting capital gains came \nfrom taxpayers reporting $50,000 or less--$50,000 or less--of adjusted \ngross income. We are not talking about a millionaire's tax break. \nCapital gains relief will benefit millions of American taxpayers.\n  Moreover, it is estimated that about 12 million lower and middle-\nincome workers participate in some sort of stock equity plan with their \nemployers. Further, many millions more own investments in stocks, \nbonds, and mutual funds. In fact, 52 percent of the 30.2 million \nfamilies that own mutual funds report incomes of $50,000 or below, and \n80 percent of these families report incomes of $75,000 or below.\n\n  Thus, capital gains realizations are hardly the exclusive domain of \nthe rich. And these examples do not even touch on the economic \nbenefits--such as new job opportunities--that would result from the \nunlocking of this estimated $8 trillion of unrealized capital gains \nthat now sit waiting for the right incentive to come along and unleash \nit.\n  The list of other tax provisions that could reduce the burden of this \naverage Utah family goes on.\n  For instance, the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 included an extension \nof the research and experimentation tax credit. This credit is very \nimportant to the research-intensive high technology industries that \nsupply my State with thousands of jobs. It is this type of tax \nincentive that ensures Americans that high-paying, high-skilled jobs \nwill stay in the United States and not be exported to countries that \nare more tax-friendly. It is this type of treatment that allows \nbusinesses to be competitive and makes the United States an attractive \nbase for many research-related companies.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 also included a $5,000 credit for \nqualified adoption expenses. As anyone who has tried to adopt knows, \nadoptions are not cheap.\n  Families that are willing to take a child into their home are often \ndeterred by the initial legal and medical expenses that can easily cost \nover $20,000. This $5,000 credit would allow the typical Utah family \nsome much-needed relief by allowing them to offset their adoption \nexpenses with a dollar for dollar credit that could be carried forward \nfor up to 5 years.\n  One of the tax provisions that would have provided considerable \nrelief to this same Utah family is the tax credit for children. The \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995 would have provided a $500 per child \ncredit. Of course, because Utahns have larger than average families, \nthe citizens of our State would have greatly benefited from this \nprovision. But, most American families could benefit from this break as \nwell.\n  The credit would have reduced the tax burden for a family with two \nchildren by $1,000. I am sure this Utah family would have a million \nbetter ways to use this money.\n  So, how much did President Clinton's veto of the Balanced Budget Act \ncost this Utah family, consisting of a mother, a father, and two \nchildren? Let's see how much:\n\n       $1,000 in tax credits for children.\n       $217 in marriage penalty corrections; and $5,000, if this \n     family had tried to adopt a child.\n       And since this family would fall into the 15-percent tax \n     bracket, they would have only paid a 7.5-percent tax on any \n     capital gains that year--an additional 7.5-percent cut in \n     their tax burden.\n\n  President Clinton's veto of the Balanced Budget Act cost this family \na minimum of $1,217. And, this figure does not even take into account \npossible tax savings from capital gains tax rate reductions, the \nadoption credit, the enhanced IRA provisions, or the increase in the \ntax credit for health insurance for the self-employed.\n  It also does not take into account the substantial savings that would \naccrue to this family on mortgage interest, auto loans, student loans, \nor other private borrowing given that a balanced Federal budget would \nlower interest rates an estimated 2 percent.\n  Although President Clinton was unwilling to enact the Balanced Budget \nAct's program of tax relief, he now has the opportunity to repeal at \nleast one of the taxes he placed on the American public in 1993--the \n4.3-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax.\n  It is remarkable to me that the Clinton administration decried the \nBalanced Budget Act for its so-called harm to the poor and to seniors--\nbut exactly who does the White House think is paying the biggest price \nfor this gas tax hike? The gas tax is a particularly regressive tax. \nWho pays the most? The working poor and those on fixed incomes, that's \nwho.\n  On Friday, the Finance Committee held hearings on the repeal of the \n4.3-cents-per-gallon gas tax. Although there is some debate regarding \nhow much of an immediate drop there would be in the price of gas as a \nresult of this repeal, many experts agree that the price of gasoline \nwould be 4.3 cents per gallon less than what it would otherwise be. It \nis no secret that these excise taxes are passed on to the consumer.\n  So, in observance of tax freedom day, I call upon the President to \nwork with Congress not against it. It is time to for him to put down \nthe veto pen and think about the American family--about this family of \nfour struggling in Utah. It is time to lower the national tax burden \nand return this money to its rightful owners--American families. The \ncurrent law is taxing us to death.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/07/senate-section/article/S4801-4", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4802-S4804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-2417.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, with respect \nto stalking; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     the interstate stalking punishment and prevention act of 1996\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \nstrengthen the protections our society offers to stalking victims, \nthose individuals whose stories we so often hear only after they end in \ntragedy.\n  My bill would make it a felony for a stalker to cross State lines \nwith the intention of injuring or harassing the victim. It would make \nit a felony to place a stalking victim in reasonable fear of death or \nserious bodily injury in violation of a protective order by such \ntravel. And it extends that protection of law to members of a victim's \nimmediate family as well.\n  Freedom from fear is one of the most cherished advantages we are \nsupposed to enjoy in our country, but stalking victims have been robbed \nof that freedom.\n  Their victimization is made worse because currently, restraining \norders against stalkers issued in one State cannot be enforced in \nanother State. If the victim leaves the State--to work, to travel, to \nescape--they lose their protection. Many times victims are told to put \nsome distance between themselves and their stalker, perhaps they are \neven counseled to move far away.\n  Under such circumstances, stalking victims must go through the time-\nconsuming process of obtaining another restraining order in a different \njurisdiction. We all know the wheels of justice grind slowly. Time is \nwhat many stalking victims don't have. In such situations, time is what \ndetermines whether they live or die.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will give stalking victims \nthat time they need. It will protect victims regardless of where they \ngo. Victims will no longer be trapped in their own states in order to \nbenefit from the shelter of law. In addition, this bill allows the \nresources of the FBI to be applied against interstate stalkers to \nprevent the intimidation of victims, or their coming to actual harm.\n  Just as importantly, this legislation goes beyond last year's \ndomestic violence legislation by expanding the definition of a stalking \nvictim from offender's spouse or intimate partner to simply victim. \nMany people are stalked by someone other than a spouse or intimate \npartner, often someone they know only slightly or don't know at all. \nCommon sense tells us they need protection as much as those stalked by \na spouse or romantic partner. This provision alone would double the \nprotection we now can provide stalking victims.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear to my colleagues that we are \nnot federalizing the crime of stalking. Stalking is and will remain a \nState crime, subject to State jurisdiction and\n\n[[Page S4805]]\n\nsanction. But under the bill I am proposing, if a stalker crosses State \nlines, then Federal resources can be brought to bear to ensure the \nstalker is caught and stopped, the same protection we provided last \nyear for victims of domestic violence.\n  The legislation also protects victims who live or work on Federal \nproperty: military bases, post offices, national parks, and other \nlocations\n  This bill sends an unmistakable message. Its penalty provisions are \nstiff. We will be putting predators on notice that if they are \nconvicted of crossing State lines to stalk a victim, they risk: 5 years \nin prison; 10 years if their victim comes to serious harm or if a \ndangerous weapon is used; 20 years if stalking results in permanent \ndisfigurement or life-threatening injury; or life in prison if their \nvictim dies.\n  Mr. President, this bill bridges the gap between law enforcement \nauthorities in different States. It will allow us to stop stalkers who \nmight otherwise duck under the net when they cross State lines, doing \ngreat damage to their victims.\n  If our society is serious about stopping the intimidation and actual \ninjury that result from stalking in countless communities every day, \nthis law is long overdue.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lautenberg, and \n        Mr. Pell):\n  S. 1730. A bill to amend the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to make the \nact more effective in preventing oil pollution in the Nation's waters \nthrough enhanced prevention of, and improved response to, oilspills, \nand to ensure that citizens and communities injured by oilspills are \npromptly and fully compensated, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n          the oilspill prevention and response improvement act\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill entitled the \n``Oilspill Prevention and Response Improvement Act.''\n  As its name suggests, the bill has two purposes. First, it will help \nto prevent oilspills. Second, it will improve the response to the \nenvironmental and economic injuries from oilspills that do occur. It \ndoes this by increasing access to funds and by providing measures to \nmake sure that both types of injuries are redressed.\n  Before getting into the substance of the bill in more detail, let me \ndescribe briefly how it came to be.\n  Generally speaking, the bill is a response to lessons learned from a \nnumber of recent oilspills that have spurred requests for oil pollution \nreforms. Of these spills, the one of most interest to me occurred a \nlittle over 3 months ago when a barge, the North Cape, ran aground just \noff of the coast of my State of Rhode Island. Despite valiant efforts \nby the Coast Guard and others, the grounding resulted in the largest \noilspill in Rhode Island's history.\n  By the time the leak was contained, nearly 800,000 gallons of oil had \npoured into our coastal waters. Of course, much of the spilled oil \nended up on our beaches, along with the carcasses of many fish, birds, \nand thousands of lobsters.\n  As chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over oil pollution--\nEnvironment and Public Works--I convened the committee twice to examine \nFederal oil pollution legislation in light of the North Cape incident \nand the other recent oilspills.\n  The first time was for a field hearing that took place in \nNarragansett, RI. It examined the Nation's oilspill pollution laws in \nthe context of how they operated during the North Cape spill. The \nprincipal law we evaluated was the Oil Pollution Act, better known as \nOPA, which was enacted in 1990, after the infamous Exxon Valdez spill.\n  The second hearing in Washington, DC, took a broader approach. It \nlooked at the issues raised during the Rhode Island hearing and \nassessed the possibility of improving OPA to prevent and better respond \nto oilspills.\n  In these hearings we learned that, overall, OPA is working pretty \nwell. In comparing a similar oil spill that occurred in Rhode Island \nwaters in 1989, the World Prodigy spill, with this year's North Cape \nspill, the hard work of Rhode Islanders was evident in both cases. \nHowever, such efforts clearly met with better results in the North Cape \nspill. The difference was OPA.\n  The clear consensus of all witnesses who testified before the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee is that OPA is a valuable piece \nof legislation. It has produced faster and more effective spill \nresponses throughout the last 6 years.\n  Nevertheless, there is room for improvement. On the prevention side, \nfor example, several witnesses suggested how OPA can be strengthened so \nthat we can avoid having to respond to an oilspill at all. The general \nconsensus was that equipping oil-carrying tank vessels with double \nhulls is far and away the best way to prevent oilspills.\n  The other set of issues that emerged related to response. For \nexample, agencies have struggled to coordinate and agree on how to \nproceed with decisions related to the reopening of closed fishing \ngrounds. Lobstermen and fishermen have found it difficult to secure \nshort-term financial assistance under the act. Finally, questions have \nbeen raised about the availability of the $1 billion oilspill liability \ntrust fund to pay for the toll on fish and wildlife injured by a spill.\n  The issues raised during our hearings set the stage for the bill \nintroduced today. Let me now explain how the bill addresses these \nissues and how it improves prevention and response to oilspills.\n  First, the bill reduces the likelihood that oilspills will occur in \nthe future. It does so through the use of both carrots, or incentives, \nand sticks, or regulations.\n  On the incentive side, the bill recognizes the key role of double \nhulls in spill prevention. Indeed, this is why OPA mandates that all \nmajor vessels be double-hulled no later than the year 2015. But the \nbill also recognizes that converting the Nation's oil-carrying fleet \nwill be costly.\n  The bill gets around financial concerns by providing an inducement to \nthose operators who take the initiative and convert to double hulls \nbefore the mandate kicks in. Currently, there is a cap in OPA \nestablishing a ceiling on the amount of liability for a vessel that \nspills oil. However, there are a host of exceptions to that limit, \nwhich has led some oil shippers to assert that the liability cap is \nmeaningless. This bill greatly reduces the chances that an oil carrier \nwho converts to a double-hull vessel will have to pay more than the \nliability cap established in OPA. It does this by limiting the \nconditions under which the cap can be exceeded for such an operator to \nthose in which the operator has been grossly negligent or has engaged \nin willful misconduct.\n\n  The bill directs the Coast Guard to issue operational rules within \nthe next 3 months and structural rules within the next 8 months for \nsingle-hulled tankers and barges. It also requires final rules to be \nissued for the tug boats that tow such barges. The purpose of these \nrules is to enhance protection of the marine environment by reducing \nthe likelihood of an oilspill.\n  OPA as originally enacted required the Coast Guard to issue the rules \nfor tankers and barges nearly 5 years ago. This bill says: Enough is \nenough when it comes to delay. If the Coast Guard does not get out the \nrules when it says it will, interim prevention measures such as \nrequiring a vessel to have an operable anchor and man on board, or an \nemergency barge retrieval system, will automatically go into effect. In \naddition, minimum under-keel clearances also will be required.\n  On the response side, the bill will reduce the economic hardship and \nenvironmental damage caused by a spill. To limit financial injury, for \nexample, it requires that advance procedures are developed for the \nreopening of affected fishing grounds. These procedures will make sure \nthat such reopening occurs as quickly as possible consistent with \npublic health and safety. Advanced planning also will ensure that \nbureaucratic in-fighting does not hold up reopening.\n  To mitigate environmental harm, the bill provides greater access to \nthe oilspill liability trust fund, to information, and to scientific \nexpertise. This will allow response personnel to better minimize harm \nto the marine environment in the aftermath of a spill.\n  Finally, the bill will help make financial assistance available right \naway for those whose livelihoods are affected by a spill. It achieves \nthis purpose in two ways.\n  First, it makes clear that a person injured by a spill may receive a \npartial\n\n[[Page S4806]]\n\nsettlement in the short term without waiving the right to full \ncompensation. Injured parties will no longer have to wait before \npursuing a claim while their rent and grocery bills pile up.\n  Second, the bill allows major oilspills to be declared major \ndisasters and thus, to qualify for Federal major disaster relief. Such \nrelief carries with it the availability of immediate funding.\n  Overall then, the Oilspill Prevention and Response Improvement Act \nbuilds on the successes of OPA, yet it addresses the lessons learned \nfrom OPA's shortcomings. While the bill puts tougher prevention \nmeasures in place, it also gives operators the necessary incentives to \ntake such measures. And in the event an oilspill does occur, it creates \na response scheme that truly addresses economic and environmental \nlosses.\n  The bill also reflects an attempt to respond to calls to reform the \nNation's oil pollution laws in an expeditious and effective, yet \ndeliberate and precise, way. I am confident that the bill is broad \nenough to bring about meaningful reform yet narrow enough to enlist the \nsupport necessary to become law.\n  In closing, I would like to thank the two primary cosponsors of the \nbill, Senator Lieberman of Connecticut and Senator Lautenberg of New \nJersey. Both of these colleagues of mine on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee have worked diligently with me to make it a better \nproduct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators \nChafee and Lieberman in introducing legislation to reduce the risks of \noil spills.\n  Mr. President, as the terrible Exxon Valdez incident demonstrated in \n1989, oil spills can have disastrous consequences for our environment \nand our communities. I visited Alaska soon after the Exxon Valdez \naccident, and the devastation was overwhelming. Nobody could leave that \nsite without feeling a great sense of responsibility for preventing any \nsimilar disasters.\n  Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to prevent a recurrence \nof similar disasters. Among other things, the act established tough new \nstandards for vessels carrying oil. Under the act, all such vessels \nmust have double hulls by the year 2015. In addition, the Act required \nthe Coast Guard to issue regulations to improve the seaworthiness and \nspill prevention capabilities of single hull vessels by 1991.\n  Mr. President, on March 30, 1996, the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee held a hearing on the implementation of this Act. What we \nlearned was very discouraging. The structural requirements for single \nhull regulations are 4 years overdue. The Coast Guard, despite \nadmitting that it had sufficient funds to implement that requirement, \ncould not give the Committee a rationale for the delay.\n  The recent spills of single hull tankers point to the need for better \noperations and better structural measures to reduce oil spills.\n  The bill we are introducing today will require several common-sense \nimprovements on single hull ships. These improvements include:\n\n       Requiring that barges over 5,000 gross tons in the open \n     ocean or coastal waters have at least one crew member on \n     board and an operable anchor;\n       Requiring the presence of an emergency system on a vessel \n     towing a barge that would allow the vessel to retrieve the \n     barge should the tow line be ruptured; and\n       Requiring vessels to meet minimum under-keel clearance \n     levels when entering or leaving a port.\n\n  In addition, the bill will require the Coast Guard to issue final \nregulations to improve the seaworthiness and spill prevention \ncapabilities of single-hull vessels no later than July 18, 1996; 5 \nyears after the original deadline. If the regulations are not \npromulgated by that date, then proposed regulations already developed \nby the Coast Guard would automatically become effective. These proposed \nregulations would require all vessels to have double-hulls on their \nsizes or their bottoms. Alternatively, vessels could include \nhydrostatic loading systems, which help prevent spills by equalizing \nthe pressure of the oil on the vessel with the outside water pressure. \nUnder hydrostatic loading, in the case of a rupture, water enters the \nship rather than the cargo of oil entering the ocean.\n  In addition, the bill includes incentives to convert the present \nsingle-hull fleet to the safer double-hull vessels. Under the bill, any \nship that is replaced by a double-hull vessel before double-hulls are \nrequired will be subject to a liability cap that can only be waived if \nthere is gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n  Mr. President, anyone who saw the devastation of Prince William \nSound--such an invaluable natural resource--will understand the \nimportance of preventing oil spills in the future. This is true not \njust in Alaska, but also on the Delaware River, in New York Harbor, and \nin the Rhode Island Sound, and throughout our rivers and coasts.\n  The rivers and channels around my State of New Jersey are very \nvulnerable to spills. Because of inadequate channel depths, most of the \ncrude oil in large ships moving into the Port of Newark must be \ntransferred to smaller vessels, a practice called lightering. These \ntransfers at sea between ships increase the likelihood of spills. It is \nonly the exceptional abilities of the pilots serving the Port of New \nYork and New Jersey that have prevented repeated spills in our region.\n  Nevertheless, lightering increases the threat of frequent oilspills. \nTo reduce that threat, the bill requires the Coast Guard to develop \nrequirements for lightering operations that are to provide substantial \nprotection to the environment as is economically and technologically \nfeasible.\n  Mr. President, the Committee on Environment and Public Works will \nhold hearings on this legislation this year. I look forward to working \nwith Senators Chafee and Lieberman, and the other members of the \nCommittee, to make any needed refinements in the legislation, and to \napprove the bill without delay.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, earlier this year I shared with my \ncolleagues news on what has been identified as the worst oilspill in \nRhode Island's history.\n  That January spill was the genesis for the legislation that I am \njoining the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee] in introducing \ntoday.\n  As many of you may know from news accounts, the barge North Cape, \ncarrying a cargo of about 4 million gallons of heating oil, and the tug \nScandia grounded off the southern Rhode Island coast.\n  The grounding followed a fire that broke out on the tug, later \nengulfed the vessel and required the subsequent last-minute evacuation \nof the captain and crew by the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  That evacuation was successful because of the enormous courage and \nskill of the Coast Guard rescue team, who did not hesitate to put \nthemselves at great personal risk to rescue the captain and crew.\n  It was under extraordinarily difficult winter storm conditions that \nthe Coast Guard effected the rescue and attempted, unsuccessfully, to \nprevent the barge and burning tug from running aground. The barge, \ndragging the burning tug, grounded in shallow water off Matunuck Point \nBeach, near Point Judith.\n  Pounded by strong winds and high seas, the 340-foot, single-hull \nbarge began to spill oil from holes in at least two places.\n  Transportation Secretary Frederico Pena joined me and other Federal \nofficials in Rhode Island to evaluate the spill, as efforts continued \nto contain the escaping oil and off-load what oil remained aboard the \nbarge.\n  Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Almond called for Federal help, declared a \nstate of emergency and said the spill was ``the worst in Rhode Island's \nhistory and one of the worst ever off the coast of New England.''\n  The toll on marine life was heavy. Thousands of oil-coated lobsters, \ndead and living, washed up along several hundred yards of beach near \nthe barge.\n  Dozens of seabirds died and scores more were coated in oil and their \nhabitats fouled.\n  The barge grounded close to Moonstone Beach, a breeding ground for \nthe endangered piping plover and the Turstom Pond National Wildlife \nRefuge, an environmentally fragile habitat.\n  Fishing was banned in hundreds of square miles, from Point Judith \nsouth to waters east of Block Island. In addition a number of \nshellfishing areas were closed and both took a long time to reopen.\n  The good news is that Rhode Islanders rose to the occasion. Hundreds \nof Rhode Islanders, their efforts coordinated by Save the Bay, helped \nby\n\n[[Page S4807]]\n\ncleaning everything from beaches to birds.\n  Additional good news came with a phone call from President Clinton to \nGovernor Almond, assuring him that funds would be made available for \nthe cleanup and fishing industries.\n  Mr. President, I raised a number of questions at the time and \nobserved how unfortunate it was that the barge was not of the new \ndouble hulled design, which I have long advocated.\n  I understand that the barge leaked from 9 of its 14 containment \nholds. A double-hull might have made all the difference between an \nincident and a disaster.\n  At the time, I also observed that everyone would benefit from a \nthorough review of the coordination of our emergency response to \noilspills.\n  The bill we are introducing today is a result of such an inquiry, \nconducted by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee under \nSenator Chafee's excellent leadership.\n  Our bill offers insurance incentives for oil barge owners who \nexpedite conversion of their barges to double-hulled vessels. It also \nsets a deadline for the U.S. Coast Guard to issue new standards for oil \nbarge design and operation.\n  The bill requires oil barges to have crews and workable anchors or a \nretrieval mechanism. It gives oilspill victims and scientists easier \naccess to the oilspill liability trust fund and sets standards for the \nclosing and reopening of fishing grounds after a spill.\n  Although it is not a panacea and will not prevent future oilspills, \nour bill goes a long way toward improving the safety of oil barges and \nsetting a clear course for the response when a spill does occur. As we \nall know, those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. \nThis bill codifies what we have learned and lessens the chance that the \ntragedy that struck us in January will be repeated.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Bennett and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 1731. A bill to reauthorize and amend the National Geologic \nMapping Act of 1992, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n       The National Geologic Mapping Reauthorization Act of 1996\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my purpose here today is to \nintroduce on behalf of myself and my cosponsors Senators Bryan and \nBennett, a bill to reauthorize the highly successful National Geologic \nMapping Act of 1992. The act established a cooperative geologic mapping \nprogram among the U.S. Geological Survey, State geological surveys, and \ngeological programs at institutions of higher education in the United \nStates. The goal of this program is to accelerate and improve the \nefficiency of detailed geologic mapping of critical areas in the Nation \nby coordinating and using the combined talents of the three \nparticipating groups.\n  Detailed geologic mapping is an indispensable source of information \nfor a broad range of societal activities and benefits, including the \ndelineation and protection of sources of safe drinking water; \nassessments of coal, petroleum, natural gas, construction materials, \nmetals, and other natural resources; understanding the physical and \nbiological interactions that define ecosystems, and that control, and \nare a measure of, environmental health; identification and mitigation \nof natural hazards such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, \nsubsidence, and other ground failures; and many other resource and \nland-use planning requirements.\n  Only about 20 percent of the Nation is mapped at a scale adequate to \nmeet these critical needs. Additional high-priority areas for detailed \ngeologic mapping have been identified at State level by State-map \nadvisory committees, and include Federal, State, and local needs and \npriorities.\n  Funding for the program is incorporated in the budget of the U.S. \nGeological Survey. State geological surveys and university participants \nreceive funding from the program through a competitive proposal process \nthat requires 1:1 matching funds from the applicant.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me to ensure the \ncontinued efficient collection and availability of this fundamental \nEarth-science information.\n\n

Mr. President, today is tax freedom day, the day that \naverage Americans can expect to quit working for the Government and \nbegin working for themselves and their families.\n  Mr. President, it has taken the average American 128 days this year--\nthe 128 days leading up to tax freedom day--to earn enough to pay the \ntax collectors at the Federal, State, and local levels. Had the average \nworker devoted every dollar earned every day for the last 128 days, not \nto food, clothing, or shelter, but exclusively to paying off his tax \nobligations, it would be only now that his tax bill would have been \nsatisfied and he could begin working for himself.\n  May 7 is the latest tax freedom day ever--6 days later than it was \nwhen President Clinton took office in 1993. In other words, it will \ntake the American people an extra 6 days--nearly a week--to pay for all \nof the additional taxes that have been imposed during President \nClinton's time in office.\n  Mr. President, it is no wonder that Americans are anxious about their \neconomic security. The harder they work, the more the Government takes. \nCompared to the 3 percent of income paid in taxes in 1948, the average \nfamily now pays nearly 25 percent of its income in taxes to the Federal \nGovernment. Add State and local taxes to the mix, and the burden \napproaches 40 percent.\n  That is why Congress passed the tax relief bill last year--to begin \nto roll back the huge tax increase that President Clinton imposed in \n1993. We want to see that the American people can earn more, keep more, \nand do more with their families, their churches and synagogues, and \ntheir community.\n  President Clinton says he wants to help the middle class, too. Why, \nthen, did he veto last year's tax relief bill? Seventy percent of the \ntax reductions would have gone to those with incomes under $75,000. \nLooking at the tax relief bill in detail, it included a new deduction \nfor interest on student loans, a $500-per-child tax credit, a tax \ncredit for adoption expenses, and marriage penalty relief. Those four \ncomponents alone made up 64 percent of the tax relief provided by the \nlegislation. In fact, the Heritage Foundation had estimated that 47,552 \nlow-income taxpayers in Arizona--3.5 million nationwide--would see \ntheir entire income tax liability eliminated as a result of the $500-\nper-child tax credit alone. But President Clinton said no to tax \nrelief.\n  In fact, the President is still trying to justify his 1993 tax \nincrease as a tax on the wealthy. Tell that to the millions of \nAmericans who are struggling to cope with the soaring price of gasoline \nmade worse by the Clinton gas tax increase. I am sure they would be \nsurprised to learn that they are among the wealthy the President talks \nabout so cavalierly. They are the ones paying the higher gas tax.\n  Young couples working two jobs and earning a combined total of only \n$30,000 would be surprised to learn that they are among the wealthy \nthat President Clinton talks about. With two children, they would have \nsaved $1,000 on their taxes if the $500-per-child tax credit became \nlaw. President Clinton vetoed that relief.\n\n  I am sure the older American who has an income just over $30,000 a \nyear would be surprised to learn that he is one of the wealthy the \nPresident is so fond of taxing. He was hit with the Clinton Social \nSecurity tax increase in 1993.\n  According to the Tax Foundation, total Federal taxes on a median-\nincome family--not the rich, but an average family--increased by more \nthan $2,000 during the Clinton years. Just about everyone across the \ncountry has felt the ill effects of President Clinton's economic \npolicies.\n  When the President talks about taxes, it is always in terms of what \nit means to the Government--can the Government afford tax relief for \nthe middle class? How much more can it squeeze out of working \nAmericans? Well, I think we have to begin to consider how taxes affect \nworking people's budgets. After all, it is Government that is supposed \nto serve people, not the other way around. A government that \nconfiscates nearly half of its citizens' hard-earned income has, in my\n\n[[Page S4809]]\n\nopinion, lost sight of why it was created and just who it was intended \nto serve.\n  With that in mind--and recognizing that various levels of government \nalready take far too much of a family's income in taxes--I recently \nproposed a constitutional amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 49, to \nrequire a two-thirds majority vote in the House and Senate to increase \ntaxes. Twenty Senators cosponsored the resolution. The House of \nRepresentatives debated a version of the initiative, known as the tax \nlimitation amendment, on April 15.\n  Mr. President, according to a recent Reader's Digest poll, the \nmaximum tax burden Americans believe a family of four should bear is 25 \npercent. That is not just the amount of Federal income taxes, but taxes \nfrom all levels of government, including Social Security taxes, sales \ntaxes, excise taxes, and State and local taxes. As I noted before, \nhowever, the average family feels a tax bite of nearly 40 percent--\nalmost twice what the public believes is a fair amount of tax.\n  Even though the tax limitation amendment only applies to new taxes, \nit has the tax collectors and the Clinton administration squealing. \nThey cannot stand the thought of not being able to take more out of the \ntaxpayers' pockets.\n  Mr. President, there is no small irony in the fact that the Clinton \ntax increase of 1993 passed only by a simple majority--and not even a \nmajority of elected Senators at that. Vice President Gore broke a 50 to \n50 vote tie to ensure passage of the tax increase bill--higher taxes on \ngasoline and Social Security, and job-killing taxes on small \nbusinesses. Yet, while the largest tax increase in history became law \nwith the bare minimum of votes, it will take a two-thirds majority vote \nin each House to enact our tax relief bill over President Clinton's \nveto.\n  Well, many of us believe that it ought to be just as hard for \nPresident Clinton to raise taxes as it is for Congress to cut them. \nThat is the very premise of the tax limitation amendment--to make \ngovernment think of tax increases, not as a first resort, but as a last \nresort.\n  President Clinton, who always seems to think of tax increases as a \nfirst resort, not only wants the American people to accept his tax \nincreases but believes that his 1993 budget plan helped the economy. \nThe facts just do not support that contention.\n  A recent report by the Heritage Foundation found that the Clinton tax \nincrease has cost the country a total of 1.2 million additional private \nsector jobs between 1993 and the end of 1996. Every household in \nAmerican has lost a total of $2,600 in after-tax income as a result of \nsluggish economic growth. Personal savings are off by about $138 \nbillion. Some 40,600 new businesses were never started. 1.3 million new \ncars and light trucks were never produced. A total of $208 billion in \nlost economic output.\n  What the Heritage Foundation refers to the Clinton crunch--the dual \neffect of declining real wages combined with higher taxes--has cast a \ndark shadow over the economy. Since January of 1994, the number of \npeople working more than one job has gone up 17 percent. The number of \nwomen working more than one job has gone up 21 percent. President \nClinton talks about the number of jobs created during his \nadministration. Yes, there are more, but the fact is that more than a \nthird of the new jobs have gone to people taking an extra job in order \nto make ends meet.\n  How has the Federal Government fared while people's incomes have been \nstagnating and their jobs are put in jeopardy? It seems to be doing \npretty well.\n  Revenues to the Treasury have increased from $1.15 trillion in 1993 \nto an estimated $1.43 trillion this year--up almost 25 percent--thanks, \nin large part to the Clinton tax increase.\n  The President just forced Congress to add another $5 billion to the \nFederal budget 2 weeks ago. That is $5 billion more for the government, \nnot American families, to spend.\n  President Clinton's budget for fiscal year 1997 would even add 13,700 \nfull-time Washington bureaucrats to the Federal payroll.\n  In other words, the era of big government is not over. If President \nClinton has his way, it will continue to grow and flourish at the \nexpense of hard-working taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, there is a way to put a stop to this continuing \nassault on taxpayers. It is the tax limitation amendment. It would make \nit harder for Congress to raise taxes any further, requiring a two-\nthirds vote of each house on tax increase bills. It would have \nprevented the Clinton tax increase from becoming law in 1993 and \nthereby promoted more vigorous economic growth across the Nation.\n  Many of us will try to roll back the Clinton tax increase, or parts \nof it, like the gas tax. With the tax limitation amendment, however, we \ncan also make sure that tax freedom day comes no later than May 7 in \nany future year. Hopefully, it will come a lot sooner.\n  The time for the tax limitation amendment has come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/07/senate-section/article/S4808-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE JEWISH WAR VETERANS\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Jewish \nWar Veterans in the year of the organization's 100th anniversary, and \nto pay tribute to the members of their faith who have fought and died \nin the service of their country.\n  The JWV is the oldest active veteran's group in the United States. \nFounded by veterans of the Civil War, the first members pledged to \ncombat the powers of bigotry whatever the target, and to assist \ncomrades and their families in need. They also pledged to gather and \npreserve the records of patriotic service performed by members of the \nJewish faith. In the 100 years following, the JWV has been a crucial \nforce in documenting the contribution Jews have made to America's \nmilitary.\n  From the American Revolution to the Persian Gulf war, hundreds of \nthousands of Jewish-Americans have fought bravely in defense of our \nNation and its democratic ideals.\n  The JWV has also made important contributions to the lives of their \nfellow Americans at peace. Its members have been leaders in the fight \nagainst racism and anti-Semitism in this country, and have used the \nstrength of their organization to improve the care and well-being of \nveterans of all denominations.\n  Today the Jewish War Veterans continue to do important work in \ncommunities throughout the Nation. Members volunteer their services to \nassist disabled and hospitalized veterans of all races and religions, \nand serve the community through education programs and scholarships. \nThey have assisted Americans young and old, Jewish and non-Jewish. I am \nproud that so many members of the JWV live in my home State of New \nJersey, and I congratulate them on their centennial anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/07/senate-section/article/S4809-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4809-S4810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MALLORY ROME\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to inform my \ncolleagues that Mallory Rome of Killington, VT, has been selected to \nreceive the prestigious James Madison Fellowship. I commend the \nfoundation for their decision to select Mallory--a Vermonter who has a \ndeep commitment to teaching.\n  As most Americans learn at an early age, James Madison is the \n``Father of the Constitution.'' He sponsored the first 10 amendments \nand there is probably no single individual who had more involvement \nwith drafting this remarkable document that has served our country so \nwell. It is fitting that Congress established the James Madison \nFellowship Program in honor of this great American.\n  Each year, fellowships are awarded to individuals who are interested \nin pursuing a career in education and who desire to concentrate their \nstudies in American history or political science. Mallory has worked \nvery hard to earn this fellowship. This month, she will graduate from \nYale University. Her 4 years there have prepared her well for this \nfellowship and her future career. Mallory has already interned for the \nTeach For America Program and worked as a teaching assistant at a \nsummer school.\n  I am confident that the foundation will be proud that it awarded this \nfellowship to Mallory. I know that her family and Vermont are already \nproud of her and I wish her the best in the future.\n\n[[Page S4810]]\n\n\n\n        WOUND, OSTOMY, AND CONTINENCE NURSES SOCIETY CONFERENCE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to welcome the 28th \nannual Wound, Ostomy and Continence Nurses Society [WOCN] conference to \nSeattle, WA, June 15-19, 1996. The theme of the conference, ``The \nFuture is Ours to Create,'' will focus on future opportunities and \nchallenges relating to the changing and expanding role of enterostomal \ntherapist nurses, and other nurses specializing in wound, ostomy, and \ncontinence care.\n  Founded in 1968, WOCN is the only national organization for nurses \nwhich specializes in the prevention of pressure ulcers and the \nmanagement and rehabilitation of persons with ostomies, wounds, and \nincontinence. In addition, WOCN is a professional nursing society which \nsupports its members by promoting educational, clinical, and research \nopportunities, to advance the practice and guide the delivery of expert \nhealth care to individuals with wounds, ostomies, and incontinence. I \napplaud them for their commitment and dedication to their work.\n  In this age of changing health care services and increasing costs, \nthe WOCN nurse plays an integral role in providing cost-effective care \nfor their patients. This year's Seattle conference will provide a \nunique opportunity for WOCN participants to learn about the most \ncurrent issues and trends related to their practice. I am honored that \nWOCN has chosen Seattle to host its conference and wish them every \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/07/senate-section/article/S4809-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PRUDENTIAL SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY AWARDS\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this morning I was privileged to \nhonor North Dakota's recipients of the 1996 Prudential Spirit of \nCommunity Award, Kendal Alexander, a student attending the Erik Ramstad \nMiddle School in Minot, and Jessica Schmidt, from Minot High School \nMagic City Campus. Kendall and Jessica are among 104 honorees \nrepresenting each State, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico that \nwere selected to receive the Prudential Spirit of Community Award in \nrecognition of their exemplary contributions to community service.\n  The Spirit of Community Initiative was organized last year by the \nPrudential Insurance Company of America, in partnership with the \nNational Association of School Principals to encourage community \ninvolvement by young people, and to recognize community service \ncontributions of America's youth. In the first year of the program, \nmore than 7,000 young people working in various community service \nprograms across the country were considered for the Prudential honors. \nOne hundred four finalists were selected to receive the Prudential \nSpirit of Community recognition, an award including a silver medallion \nand a $1,000 cash award.\n  Mr. President, at a time when so much attention in the press is \nfocused on the problems of youth, I think it important to highlight the \ncontributions of young people like Kendal and Jessica who are working \nto improve their communities, and to provide services to individuals in \nneed.\n  Kendal was honored for his work with a local food bank, highway \nimprovement, to develop safe activities for children during Halloween \nand to assist senior citizens in nursing homes. Jessica, as president \nof the Minot High School Key Club, organized programs for nursing home \nresidents, and a senior's prom for senior citizens in the Minot \ncommunity. Kendal and Jessica deserve our sincere appreciation for \ntheir efforts to improve our communities. We can be proud that they are \nso committed to helping others, and that they represent our future. I \nalso want to commend the Prudential Insurance Co. and the National \nAssociation of School Principals for establishing this outstanding \nprogram, and particularly, for encouraging young people to become \ninvolved in their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/07/senate-section/article/S4810-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE FORT PECK RURAL COUNTY WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Madam President, I want to again reiterate my strong \nopposition to the so-called gas tax cut. I have labored on the Energy \nCommittee for 21 years and 4 months. An awful lot of that time has been \nspent preaching about conservation and how we must achieve some degree \nof energy independence.\n  It has not been too long since cars were lined up at the service \nstations. Getting their gas tanks filled was a 1 to 2 hour proposition. \nHow soon we forget. There were cries then that we ought to raise the \ngasoline tax by as much as $1 per gallon. I was never for that. The \nreason I was never for it is because people in my State, which is \nmainly rural, have to drive many miles to go to work and do errands. In \na rural State people drive from their homes to work in communities 25 \nmiles away. That is a 50-mile-a-day commute. A 50-mile commute a day \nwith a $1 per gallon gasoline tax adds up to a staggering burden on \nmiddle- and low-income workers.\n\n  I have, however, always been a strong champion of fuel efficiency. \nThe first year I was in the Senate under the leadership of Scoop \nJackson, who was chairman of the Energy Committee, we forced the \nAmerican automobile industry to achieve fuel efficiency standards, \nwhich they did not want to do. At that point, it was already apparent \nto anybody who watched that the American people had become rather \ncaptivated by small Japanese-made automobiles that were getting 35 to \n50 miles a gallon. The automobile industry assured Senator Jackson and \nother Members of the Senate that requiring them to achieve some kind of \na national fuel miles-per-gallon fuel standard would be disastrous for \nthem.\n  In truth the car companies were wrong. We imposed Corporate Average \nFuel Economy [CAFE] standards on the automobile industry. We told them \nthat by 1985 they had to achieve an average national fuel efficiency \nstandard of 27.5 miles per gallon per fleet. At that time in this \ncountry, the national average of all vehicles on the road, and that was \nroughly 30 million fewer cars than we have now, was a little over 13 \nmiles per gallon.\n  You did not have to be a rocket scientist to know if we were using \n6\\1/2\\ million barrels of gasoline a day that if you could improve fuel \nefficiency like that, with a snap of a finger, by one-third, you could \nhave cut the import of oil into this country by 2 million barrels a \nday. At that time, the United States was producing between 60 percent \nand 65 percent of its own needs. Just parenthetically, today we produce \nabout 50 percent and we import the rest. It is easily the single \nbiggest contributor to our trade deficit.\n  In the 1980's we also raised the gas tax. The Federal gas tax had \nbeen 4 cents for a very long time. The tax was raised twice in the \n1980's and twice again in the 1990's. Today it is 18.3 cents a gallon. \nIn the past, we have always put gasoline taxes into the transportation \ntrust funds to be used for building highways and for mass transit.\n  In the summer of 1993, as we labored in this body to honor a \ncommitment that the President had made during his campaign that he \nwould cut the deficit in half during his 4-year term, he sent a \nproposal to the U.S. Congress. He said if you adopt this proposal it \nwill reduce the deficit by $500 billion over the next 5 years. We have \ndone this precisely the way the people around the coffee shops say they \nwant it done--$250 billion in new taxes, $250 billion in spending cuts.\n  How often have you heard people say, ``I would not mind paying more \ntaxes but they will just spend the money.'' Believe you me, there has \nalways been enough action taken around here to give credence to that \nidea. Every poll shows the American people would opt for a plan if it \ncuts spending dollar for dollar against tax increases. So we raised \nincome taxes on the wealthiest of Americans and we raised the gasoline \ntax by 4.3 cents a gallon.\n  What was that 4.3 cents per gallon tax worth? Over a 5-year-period it \nwas worth $24.5 billion. That total package was worth $500 billion over \na 5-year period, so we said.\n  In fact, Madam President, as of this moment, it is headed toward \nbeing $700 billion in deficit reduction. How did we pass it? At that \ntime what some of us like to refer to as the ``good old days,'' we had \n56 Democratic Senators, 6 voted no, 50 voted aye, and Vice President \nAlbert Gore sat in that chair and voted to break the tie of 50-50, and \nwe passed that deficit reduction package, which included this 4.3-cent \na gallon gas tax.\n  Now we are back, and everyone wants to balance the budget. The \nAmerican people have issued a nonnegotiable demand that they want the \nbudget balanced. I happen to believe that any time the American people \nspeak almost with one voice, they are heard here. So this body for the \nfirst time since I have been in the Senate has gotten serious about the \nbusiness of balancing the budget.\n  Let me digress to say this, Madam President. The Presiding Officer is \na member of the Republican Party. I am a Democrat. There are 53 \nRepublicans sitting on the other side and there are 47 Democrats \nsitting on this side. In truth, this ought to be pleasing to the ears \nof the American people. We would all agree on about 90 percent of what \nwe believe to be the core values of this country. Madam President, 90 \npercent of the core values that have made us a great Nation. And we \nare, make no mistake about it.\n  One of the values that every Democrat and every Republican and \nvirtually everybody in the country would agree on is we should balance \nour budget. Where did we diverge? A couple of my very good friends on \nthis side of the aisle are no longer here, and they are no longer here \nbecause they had the courage to be one of the 50 to vote for honest-to-\nGod deficit reduction. If we had not done that, we would be looking at \na $290 to $300 billion deficit today. One of the reasons the American \npeople are feeling slightly better is that this year the deficit is \ngoing to be $144 billion--less than half what it was projected to be \nand less than half what it would have been if a few people had not \nscrewed up their nerve and been courageous enough to vote for something \nthat was obviously unpopular. Nobody wants to vote for a tax increase \nof any kind. I wish I could just wave a wand and vote to repeal the \n4.3-cent gas tax and say, ``Well, we will take care of the deficit some \nother way.''\n\n[[Page S4812]]\n\n  Madam President, this is the first time we have attempted to undo any \nportion of that deficit reduction package of 1993. I am opposed to it \nbecause I lost two good friends who were courageous enough to vote for \nit. I am opposed to it on energy efficiency grounds, and I am opposed \nto it because you cannot balance the budget and keep giving away the \nTreasury.\n  It is really slightly hypocritical to ask the people of this place to \nrepeal the 4.3-cent gasoline tax which will cost us, just for the \nremainder of this year of 1996, about $3 billion? If we take the 4.3 \ncents tax off for the ensuing 7 years, you are talking about $32 \nbillion.\n  Where are you going to get the money to offset that? The majority \nleader in the House of Representatives said, ``Well, let us take it out \nof education. We are not getting a very good bang for the buck on our \nmoney for education. We will take it out of education.''\n  Madam President, the rules of the Senate do not permit me to say what \nI really would like to say about that. But needless to say, that is a \ncrazy idea.\n  Somebody else has said, ``Well, we are getting ready to impose a tax \non the banks and S's to go under the so-called SAIF to pay off the \nbonds that we issued to bail the S's out. So we will just take it out \nof the savings and loan insurance fund.\n  You think about that one. We are going to reduce the gas tax 4.3 \ncents a gallon and make it up by charging the same amount to people of \nthis country because they have deposits in the bank. That is passed on \nto the consumer one way or another. If we make the banks and the S's \npay more into the insurance fund, they will pass it on to the \ncustomers. So if you say, ``Well, we will take the gas tax off, but we \nwill pick it up over here in the bank fund,'' I do not consider that \nthe most enlightened solution either.\n  Madam President, 3 weeks ago the price of oil was $24 a barrel. \nYesterday it was $21 a barrel--12.5 percent less than it was 3 weeks \nago. It takes a while before that reduced price of oil works its way \nthrough the pipeline, and the consumers get the benefit of it. But the \nEnergy Information Administration says by October the price of oil will \nbe $17 a barrel.\n  I wish to goodness we could get this Presidential election over with \nso we could start talking seriously about things that really matter \ninstead of playing around with things like this for whatever political \nimpact they might have in November.\n  Madam President, how are we going to tell the American people that \ntheir gasoline prices are going to go down 4.3 cents a gallon? Answer. \nWe are not, because we do not have any way of knowing that. The oil \ncompanies can put that 4.3 cents a gallon in their pocket.\n  But more to the point, how do we make up the $3 billion we are going \nto lose? Nobody has said yet anything credible. No credible offer has \nbeen made as to how we are going to offset it. I frankly think the \npolitics of this thing is not on the side of the proponents.\n  Yesterday, I had 150 people in a committee room over in the Dirksen \nBuilding, members of the chamber of commerce from my State. They were \nall here for their big national shindig. So for openers I just asked, \n``How many people here would like to repeal the 4.3 cents per gallon \ngas tax?'' This is the chamber of commerce; these are business people \nnormally who dislike taxes intensely. I did not embellish. I did not \ntry to argue one way or the other. I just asked the question point \nblank. Five people. ``How many would like to leave the gas tax alone?'' \nRoughly 70 to 90 voted to leave it alone.\n  Today, the rural cooperatives were in town. I heard the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota today say that farmers use six to seven times \nas much gasoline as the ordinary driver uses. There must have been \nabout 75 people at the meeting today. ``How many of you would like to \nrepeal the 4.3-cent gas tax?'' Three. All the rest were opposed.\n  So for all of the reasons I have enumerated plus others--and I will \nnot take additional time, Madam President, because we are ready to shut \nthis operation down for the night, but for all of those reasons and \nmany more, the repeal of the 4.3-cents-per-gallon gas tax is a foolish \nidea.\n  And I am not going to vote for a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget, which is an equally foolish idea. So many people in this \nbody treat the Constitution like it is a rough draft that they are \nsupposed to finish up somehow or other.\n  Everybody wants to amend the Constitution. I do not. I have only \nvoted for one amendment, and I intend to think twice before voting for \nanother amendment. I do not like a lot of the Members of this body \ntampering with what Madison and Adams, Hamilton and Franklin did 207 \nyears ago.\n  Madam President, if we ever debate this gasoline tax, which I \nunderstood we were going to take up today, I will be back in the \nChamber largely repeating what I just said plus some additional things. \nBut I can tell you the American people are not behind this. They do not \nwant it. If you want to do something to please the American people, get \nthe budget balanced. Do not be tinkering around with the politics of \nthe 4.3-cent gasoline tax. And above all, do not ask me to vote to undo \nthe deficit reduction we have going which has been successful to a \nstaggering degree. We should not start unraveling it now because there \nis a Presidential election in November.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/07/senate-section/article/S4811-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
