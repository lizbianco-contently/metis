Mr. President, I note that my colleague, who is \nmanaging the VA-HUD bill, which is before the \n\n[[Page S 14224]]\nSenate today, will speak on environmental matters in our legislation. \nBut before he does, I wanted to bring to the Senate's attention the \ndeath of someone who really has been an outstanding American citizen.\n  Bessie Delany died Monday at the age of 104 in her home in Mount \nVernon, NY. Many Americans know her as part of the Delany sisters. Dr. \nBessie Delany and her sister, Sadie Delany, lived through the most \nremarkable period in American history, from about the 1880's all the \nway until now. They saw the end of slavery. They lived through the era \nwhere people moved from the South. Bessie Delany was one of the first \nAfrican-American women to become a physician in the United States. She \nwas the second African-American woman to practice dentistry in New \nYork, having graduated from Columbia University in 1923.\n  About 5 years ago, she and her sister became famous when they wrote, \ncoauthored with Amy Hill Hearth, a book called ``Having Our Say: The \nDelany Sisters' First 100 Years.'' In April, a play opened on Broadway \ntelling their story.\n  I read their great book called ``Having Our Say,'' and it is a \nremarkable tribute of courage, character, and competency.\n  Both of these women overcame incredible odds to make a substantial \ncontribution to the American community. And overcoming all of the bias \nrelated to racism, all the obstacles for which there were very skimpy \nopportunity structures available to them, both--one went on to be a \nteacher, and Bessie Delany became, as I said, a physician.\n  All of America is sorry to see Dr. Bessie Delany move on. We are very \nsorry about her death. We extend our sympathy to her family. But as a \ngreat tribute to her and her remarkable life, I really encourage all \nwho are listening here to go to the library and get this remarkable \nbook, ``Having Our Say,'' because in listening to what the Delanys say, \nboth this remarkable teacher and this remarkable physician have a lot \nof lessons to teach us and to give us, also, a navigational chart for \nthe healing that needs to go on in our society.\n  So to Dr. Bessie Delany, wherever she is in God's great glory, we \njust thank her for what she has done for this country. We express our \ncondolences to her sister Sadie. And as a tribute we urge you read this \nremarkable book about their lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/26/senate-section/article/S14223-7", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14224-S14245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are anxiously awaiting colleagues who \nwant to come down and either offer amendments or debate the measures \nbefore us. Several of our colleagues have expressed an interest in \nspeaking on the space station. We have a 1\\1/2\\-hour time agreement, \nequally divided. At least on our side, that time is almost completely \nused up.\n  So, if anybody feels the need to speak for the space station--it \nmight also be true for those opposing it--this would be a good time to \ncome. We would like to hear what they have to say. But as we indicated \nyesterday, the majority leader and the Democratic leader, as well as \nthe rest of us, know we have to get these appropriations bills finished \nby September 30, and our ability to begin the recess on October 2 \ndepends upon our completing this work. So we are pressed for time. We \ndo invite anybody who has measures or has views on measures that will \nbe on this bill to come down and address them now because this will be \nthe best time to do so.\n  But since we do have some time, I thought it might be helpful for my \ncolleagues who may be getting all kinds of calls from organizations \nthat are opposed to measures that we put forth in the bill to explain a \nlittle bit about what we have done in the EPA section. The National \nWildlife Federation has a hotline going out saying there are damaging \nriders; we are doing all kinds of terrible things to the Environmental \nProtection Agency. The National Audubon Society says we are crippling \nthe Agency and there is a backdoor attempt to strike out provisions in \nthe EPA laws.\n  Frankly, that is just not true. The environmental progress in this \ncountry has been significant. We have in the last 25 years come a long \nway toward cleaning up our environment. I am very proud of the progress \nwe have made. I want to see that progress continue.\n  But I think we have come to the point now where we demand that the \nprogress be on the basis of common sense, of justifiable actions, of \nusing sound science, of not duplicating efforts, and making sure that \nthe dollars we spend on the environment, whether they are appropriated \ndollars or whether they are dollars that others, State governments, \nlocal governments, not-for-profits businesses, and individuals have to \npay to comply with the environmental laws are spent properly.\n  Now, let me go through, for the benefit of my colleagues and those \nwho may be watching, the so-called riders or legislative provisions \nthat are included in this bill. The recommendation of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee has seven legislative provisions within EPA. \nAll but one of the so-called riders in the House bill have not been \nincluded in this measure. The committee in the Senate limited the \nprovisions in our bills to ones that have been included in previous VA-\nHUD bills or other legislation or that eliminate duplication or \nunnecessary spending. Let me tell you about the provisions.\n  First, we would prohibit the EPA from requiring centralized \ninspection maintenance facilities in fiscal year 1996. This is the same \nlanguage that was included in the National Highway System bill, \nsupported by a large number of Senators. It is clear that the \nprovisions for central inspection and maintenance are going to cause \ntremendous headaches without the benefits that are needed, and we can \ndo it in a less intrusive, bureaucratic way.\n  Second, this measure, as reported out of the committee, would \nprohibit the EPA from requiring employers to adopt car-pooling plans in \nfiscal year 1996. This language is one of the House riders. It is the \nsame language included in the fiscal year 1995 rescission bill. If \nworkers in America want the Federal Government telling them how they \ncan get to work and demanding putting restrictions and requirements on \nhow they go to work, then they should not support this rider. I do not \nbelieve, talking to the people in my State, that they want the Federal \nGovernment telling them how they get to work in the morning and how \nthey get home in the evening.\n  Third, we would in the committee recommendation prohibit EPA from \nregulating radon and several other drinking water contaminants in \nfiscal year 1996 unless the drinking water law is reauthorized. It is a \nvery important measure pending before the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee to reauthorize the safe drinking water law. I think the \nprovision that we have in this measure is fully consistent with the \nattempts by the EPA, which itself has been trying to negotiate \nextensions to court-ordered deadlines for low-priority contaminants. \nFor each of the contaminants in question, the risk is relatively low or \nthe science is not fully supported by science-based rulemakings. This \naction has been requested by the National Governors' Association, the \nLeague of Cities, the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, the \nAmerican Waterworks Association, the National Association of Water \nCompanies, the National Rural Water Association, and the Natural Water \nResources Association.\n  Frankly, there has been a lot of concern these days about E. coli and \ncryptosporidium, and these agencies want local water systems to devote \ntheir time and their resources to keeping those known, dangerous \ncontaminants out of the water supply. To the extent that they are \nrequired to test for and develop means of dealing with other low-\npriority contaminants where the science may be uncertain, it will take \naway from their efforts to keep the water supply system clean from \nthese dangerous, well-recognized, well-defined contaminants.\n  Fourth, we would prohibit EPA from requiring in fiscal year 1996 the \nuse of \n\n[[Page S 14225]]\nMTBE in Alaska because of health concerns raised there associated with \nthe use of MTBE. There have been serious instances where MTBE use has \nthought to cause very serious health effects. This provision was \ncarried in the fiscal year 1994 VA-HUD bill and does not exempt Alaska \nfrom clean air requirements. It is saying, do not require something \nthat appears to be causing very significant health problems in Alaska.\n  The next one would prohibit EPA from adding new sites to the \nSuperfund national priorities list in fiscal year 1996 unless requested \nby the Governor or tribal leader unless or until the Superfund law is \nreauthorized. Everyone recognizes that the Superfund law badly needs \nrevision. The Superfund law has generated a tremendous amount of \nresources going to lawyers and for administrative costs. A report done \nby the General Accounting Office at our request shows that only about \n30 percent of the Superfund sites currently being worked by the EPA \ninvolve current risk to human health or even potential risk to human \nhealth under current usages.\n  We think the time has come to reauthorize the Superfund law to bring \nsound science and to target the resources. Therefore, we say do not \nmove forward expanding the reach of Superfund until it is reauthorized \nand Congress has had an opportunity to act on the substantive \nrequirements in the Superfund legislation.\n  This language was included in the fiscal year 1995 rescission, \nadopted, and signed into law by the President this summer. It is \nconsistent with the committee's decision to limit Superfund spending to \ncurrent health risks pending reauthorization.\n  The next measure in the bill authorizes an exemption from water \npretreatment standards for industrial discharges to the Kalamazoo water \nplant if environmental standards are met through a local pretreatment \nplant. This provision has been narrowly crafted, and it will not result \nin any environmental degradation. It will prevent duplicative and \nunnecessary water treatment construction. Kalamazoo has already entered \ninto a plan to be financed by the major industrial concerns in that \ncity to deal with the effluent from their plants.\n  Since Kalamazoo is getting a water treatment plant financed by those \nwho are making the discharges, it does not make any sense to go forward \nwith an overlapping, a duplicating requirement to have another \ntreatment plant to do exactly the same thing when one is already being \nfinanced.\n  Next, we would prohibit EPA from enforcing the foreign refiner \nbaseline for reformulated gasoline. This is the same provision as \nincluded in the fiscal year 1995 VA-HUD bill, and it would ensure quite \nsimply that foreign refiners are held to the same higher environmental \nstandards as domestic refiners. If we do not do this, foreign refiners \nwill be able to send in products that do not meet the environmental \nstandards that we expect of our domestic refiners.\n  Mr. President, what sense does that make? Why should we give foreign \nrefiners a free pass to send in products that have not met the same \nstandards that we require of our domestic refiners? I think this is \nanother sound environmental measure that is included in this bill. I \nurge my colleagues, and those who are interested, to look at the \nenvironmental impacts of these provisions.\n  The final one I want to talk about would eliminate duplicative and \nwasteful efforts by the EPA. This would prohibit the Environmental \nProtection Agency from vetoing decisions made by the Corps of Engineers \nregarding wetlands permits in fiscal year 1996.\n  The provision is intended to keep EPA from overfiling or second-\nguessing the Corps of Engineers. It will streamline the corps' \npermitting process. EPA still has a wide range of responsibilities \ndealing with wetlands. We are not changing those. We are only saying to \nthe EPA and to all of the affected landowners that you have a right to \nget an answer, a final answer from one Federal agency.\n  The Corps of Engineers operates with EPA in the regulation of \nwetlands. Where does it make any sense to the landowner who goes to the \nCorps of Engineers and says, ``OK, here is what I propose to do. Grant \nme a permit,'' and, as it stands now, the Corps of Engineers can say, \n``OK, you meet all our standards,'' and then the next day the EPA comes \nin and says, ``Oh, but we don't like what the Corps of Engineers did''?\n  Frankly, this is a duplicative, wasteful, and, I think, \nunsatisfactory service to our citizens to say that you are going to \nhave to take two chances to get the Federal Government to tell you they \ndo not like what you are doing. We have standards, and the Corps of \nEngineers is to follow those standards. Why do we give the power to the \nEPA to come in and say, ``Oh, well, you may have satisfied the Corps of \nEngineers, but you don't satisfy us''?\n  As Senators know, the corps has the authority and the expertise to \nadminister the Wetlands Program, and it does not, in my view, make any \nsense to say that the same law can be administered by two separate \nagencies, particularly when we are in a time of strained budgets when a \nsecond agency should not be duplicating the efforts of the first one. \nThat is why we say, ``EPA, if the corps has already done it, go on and \ndo the other work you are supposed to do; don't second-guess the \ncorps.''\n  The Senate should know this provision does not affect the multitude \nof other EPA authorities under the Clean Water Act. It in no way \nundermines wetlands protection. According to the Corps of Engineers, no \nother Federal regulatory program gives two agencies different authority \nover the same permit decisions. I understand there are some who believe \nthis redundancy is defensible. During the committee markup, some \nMembers suggested that they would offer an amendment to strike the \nprovision on the floor. If so, we will be happy to discuss it.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the House did include a provision in \nthe bill preventing funding for the entire 404 wetlands permit law, \nnoting that it was necessary to provide Congress additional time to \ndetermine the proper management of the Nation's wetlands.\n  The Corps of Engineers, as we all know, has the responsibility of \nadministering the day-to-day permitting. The States, EPA, the National \nOceanographic and Atmospheric Agency, Fish and Wildlife, and Marine \nService also have roles. There are pages and pages of regulations and \nmemorandums of agreement governing the complex permitting process.\n  Under section 401 requirements, for a 404 permit to be issued, the \ncorps must first obtain a certification from the applicable State--the \nState--that water quality standards will not be violated as a result of \nthe discharge of fill material. This essentially gives the States veto \nauthority over permit applications. It guarantees a State role in the \nprocess.\n  Of the additional resource agencies, EPA is perhaps the most \ninfluential. Besides having authority under section 404 to veto permit \ndecisions, EPA is responsible for developing guidelines, known as \n404(B)(1) guidelines, which are the substantive environmental criteria \nthat are binding on the corps in the permitting process.\n  To me, it makes no sense to say that once you have laid out all those \nstandards, once the Corps of Engineers has gone through the process, \nonce they have gotten the approval of the State and they are following \nthe EPA regulations, if they grant a permit, EPA should come in and \nsay, ``Oh, we don't agree with the corps' action.'' If there is one \nthing that constituents in my State are fed up with, it is being told \ntwo different things by two different Federal agencies. They expect the \nFederal agencies who serve them to give them one answer and to give \nthem the right answer.\n  This measure would say, ``Corps of Engineers, if you grant a permit, \nthen we are not going to have the EPA using its time and resources to \ncome in and change the direction given to the person, the individual or \nthe organization, applying for that permit.''\n  I hope that those who hear scare stories about the provisions in this \nbill will take a look at the substantive provisions and realize they \nare necessary to streamline and to ensure the effective administration \nof the Environmental Protection Agency, to ensure we continue the \nprogress that we have made and must continue to make toward assuring a \nclean environment for ourselves and our children. \n\n[[Page S 14226]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \ninternational space station program. This program is out of the \nplanning stages and is well underway. The space station is real. Space \nshuttle missions in support of phase one of the station program began \nin February 1994. The most recent phase one mission ended with the \nsuccessful return of astronaut Norm Thagard from his record breaking \nstay in space. Over 48,000 pounds of station hardware have been \nmanufactured and 75,000 pounds will be completed by the end of this \nyear.\n  The space station is real to communities, students and teachers \nthroughout the Nation. Teachers are already using space station \nconcepts in the classroom. Students have participated in activities \nincluding living in a bus outfitted as a space station, complete with \nliving facilities, experiments, and communication to Earth. Today the \nspace station is capturing the imagination of the leaders of the future \nand encouraging students to study math, physics, chemistry, biology, \ngeography, and Earth science.\n  When I grew up as a boy, we had tree houses, and you would have a lot \nof activity playing in tree houses. I think you will see space station \nhouses in trees and other locations that kids will be playing in as we \nmove forward and start moving toward the deployment of the space \nstation.\n  Benefits of the station program are already being realized. \nResearchers seeking to develop a station bioreactor for cell cultures \nhave developed a way to grow tumor tissues outside the body, so \nchemotherapy and other treatments can be tested without harm to the \npatient.\n  The space station will create a permanent orbiting science institute \nin space capable of performing long duration research in a nearly \ngravity-free environment. Research in medicine, materials and \nprocesses, engineering and technology will have immediate, practical \napplication for life on Earth and will create jobs and economic \nopportunities today and in the decade to come. Information gathered \nabout how humans react and adapt to weightlessness will allow \nscientists to further understand conditions such as balance disorders \nafflicting 90 million Americans, osteoporosis affecting 24 million \nAmericans, and cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in \nthe United States. Every dollar spent on the station is spent here on \nEarth and will provide an excellent return on investment. If planned \norbital research in combustion science improves combustion processes \nonly a modest 2 percent, then the annual savings would be approximately \n$8 billion a year in the cost of energy produced through combustion in \nthe United States.\n  In June 1995, the General Accounting Office completed a review of the \ncurrent estimated cost of the space station program. The GAO concluded \nthat ``the program has made major progress since last year in defining \nits requirements, meeting its schedule milestones, and remaining within \nits annual operation budgets. Nevertheless, the program faces \nformidable challenges in completing all its tasks on schedule and \nwithin its budget.'' Of course the station program faces challenges as \ndoes any new endeavor. However, we should judge the ability of NASA to \nmeet these challenges on the performance of the station program since \nit was redesigned in 1993. As the GAO discovered, NASA is performing as \npromised and is successfully meeting the stated objectives of the \nstation program.\n  It is unfortunate that the biggest challenge the station program \nfaces appears to be the Congress of the United States, specifically a \nsmall handful of Members who continue to offer legislation aimed at \nterminating the station program. Since the inception of the program, \nvotes have been held over 18 times on the station. We must continue to \nreject these attempts and continue our support of the space station \nprogram. We owe this to the future of the citizens of the United States \nand to all the people of Earth.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily society aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2777\n\n (Purpose: To make available $38 million for construction at the Spark \n  M. Matsunaga Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Hawaii)\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2777.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 22, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n       Sec. 111. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     title, the amount appropriated by this title under the \n     heading ``Departmental Administration'' under the paragraph \n     ``construction, major projects'' is hereby increased by \n     $38,000,000.\n       (b) Of the amount available under the paragraph referred to \n     in subsection (a), as increased by such subsection, \n     $38,000,000 shall be available for construction at the Spark \n     M. Matsunaga Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, \n     Honolulu, Hawaii.\n       (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the \n     amount appropriated by this title under the heading \n     ``Departmental Administration'' under the paragraph ``general \n     operating expenses'' is hereby reduced by $38,000,000.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this is a very simple, forthright \namendment. It calls for the completion of the Spark M. Matsunaga \nMedical Center in Honolulu. It provides for $38 million.\n  Mr. President, there are 127,600 veterans residing in the State of \nHawaii. The State of Hawaii is one of only two States in our Union \nwithout a VA hospital. The other State is the State of Alaska. Per \ncapita spending in the State of Hawaii is the lowest in the Nation.\n  At the same time, Hawaii has the highest ratio of veterans per capita \nand the highest proportion of disabled veterans over 65 years of age or \nolder.\n  In World War II, the State of Hawaii, which was then a territory, 50 \nyears ago, had more volunteers per capita than any other State or \nterritory of our Union. While serving far fewer veterans, the State of \nMontana and the State of Wyoming have two VA hospitals apiece. We have \nmore veterans, but we have none; they have less veterans, but they have \ntwo apiece.\n  In the case of Wyoming, the veteran population is less than half of \nthe State of Hawaii. South Dakota, with 42,000 fewer veterans than \nHawaii, has three VA hospitals. We are still waiting for our first VA \nhospital.\n  The current system in Hawaii is a fragmented one. It is costly. It is \ninefficient and places the quality of care rendered to veterans at a \ngreat risk.\n  We receive fine service from Tripler Army Hospital, our major \nmilitary facility in Hawaii. Inpatient care at this great institution \nis dependent upon space availability. If there is no space, we are the \nlowest priority. The veterans are the lowest priority, and \nunderstandably so.\n  Mr. President, as we downsize our military, that downsizing will also \naffect Tripler Army Hospital.\n  What does that mean? Fewer beds, fewer nurses, fewer doctors, and \nwith the veterans as the lowest priority, I do not think I need to draw \na picture for my colleagues.\n  Today, many of the united hospital services such as cardiology, \northopedics, ophthalmology--severe limitations and restrictions are \nplaced upon veterans in Hawaii. For example, at this moment, VA \ncardiology and orthopedic patients are evaluated by visiting \n\n[[Page S 14227]]\nPalo Alto, CA, VA physicians. They come around about twice a year. As a \nresult of that evaluation, they are shipped to a facility on the west \ncoast, usually in the State of California.\n  Mr. President, I think all fairness and equity would lead us to \nconclude that to ask our veterans to undergo long, long, separations \nfrom their families 2,500 miles from home is not acceptable. I think \nall physicians would suggest that from the standpoint of long-term \ncare, that is not acceptable.\n  In 1993, 950 qualified veterans were denied service in Hawaii; in \n1994, 1,300 qualified war veterans were denied inpatient service in \nHawaii. This year, through the month of May, because of the lack of \neligibility and lack of services, 582 war veterans were denied service.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I am \nfully aware of the problems we have. I am fully aware of the budgetary \nconstrictions that we are required to live under. I know that my \nchairman, the Senator from Missouri and the ranking member, the Senator \nfrom Maryland, have done their utmost in their effort to accommodate \nthe veterans of the State of Hawaii.\n  As it is commonly said, one cannot squeeze blood out of a turnip. It \nis not my desire to do that.\n  Reluctantly, I will be withdrawing this amendment with the hope that \nmy colleagues from Missouri and Maryland will sit down and work \ntogether with the veterans of Hawaii to see if something can be done.\n  This can be a national disgrace. We have the highest per capita \nveteran population, the lowest per capita spending, the highest per \ncapita disabled veterans, highest per capita volunteers, and no \nhospitals.\n  Other States with less than Hawaii have three or two. All we are \nasking for is one. And the one we are asking for is not a hospital. It \nis a medical center, which is one grade below a hospital.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope that my patient colleagues from this \nsubcommittee will join with me in trying to work out a solution for \nthis. I would be glad to do that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be permitted to withdraw my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, first I would like to thank my \ncolleague, Senator Inouye, for his extraordinary advocacy in behalf of \nAmerican veterans. As the ranking minority member on this bill, it \npains me and grieves me that a Senator who bears the permanent wounds \nof war, who wears with pride the Congressional Medal of Honor, must \ncome before the U.S. Senate and plead for a VA hospital; an American \nhero coming to speak in behalf of all other veterans of all other wars \nsaying: Please give me a medical center to meet the needs of other men \nand women who served in the military, who themselves bear the permanent \nwounds of war.\n  What we face here is the fact that in Hawaii there is a unique \nsituation because of its geographic location. They cannot go to the \ntrauma centers. Everything has to be in Hawaii. Also, there has been a \nunique linkage between veterans and military hospitals.\n  So I want to acknowledge the validity of the Senator's plea. I want \nto acknowledge the validity of the plight of veterans in Hawaii. I \npledge to him the desire, the deep desire, to work with him to ensure \nthat the Hawaiian veterans have the medical care that they need and \nthey deserve, and how we could do a linkage with perhaps the military \nhospitals and perhaps the private sector.\n  But I believe that if we are as creative in helping these veterans \nwith their medical care as we have been in other areas of national \ndefense and security, we will be able to do this.\n  I also thank the Senator for withdrawing the amendment, though I know \nit is deeply troubling to him to do so. But we have no money in this \nbudget. The only way we could have funded it is if we had gone to the \nbacklog claims. Right now there is a waiting list of over 6 months to 3 \nyears for veterans trying to process their claims for their pensions \nand their disability benefits. American veterans should not have to \nstand in line for 6 months or more because of the sluggish nature of \nthe bureaucracy with the way they have modernized, and so on.\n  So we have now put resources in to deal with the backlog of claims. I \nam glad we are going to let that stand.\n  Again, I would like to thank the Senator for his defense of America, \nfor the worthy nature of the Congressional Medal of Honor which he \nwears and which I see on his lapel this morning, and for his defense of \nveterans who in many ways do not have a voice; and, of course, for his \nown constituents of Hawaii.\n  I also want to acknowledge the staunch defense of veterans and health \ncare of my colleague, Senator Akaka.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Maryland \nfor her very sensitive and generous concern. But much as I would be \nmost proud to wear a Congressional Medal of Honor, my medal is one \nnotch below, the Distinguished Service Cross. But I thank my colleague.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Well, if I had the opportunity to award the Senator a \nmedal, I believe he deserves the highest recognition for his gallantry \nand his bravery.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I echo the generous words of my good friend \nand colleague, the ranking member, the Senator from Maryland. I too \nappreciate the very strong advocacy of the very able senior Senator \nfrom Hawaii. He has met with us and talked from his very heartfelt \ncommitment to the veterans of Hawaii, and he has talked about the \ndifficult situation that the veterans there face. I know how long and \nhard he has worked on the project.\n  We were unable to put construction funding in fiscal year 1996 for \nany major new construction. As the Senator from Maryland pointed out, \nwe fear that the offset would have taken away vitally needed funds for \nhandling claims of veterans.\n  Second, the committee agreed to a moratorium on new medical \nconstruction projects, as recommended by the General Accounting Office \nand the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. The committee's decision \nwas driven by budgetary concerns, as well as based on the fact that the \nVA is on the verge of a major reorganization which may result in \nsignificant changes to its facilities' needs, and we hope a better \ndirection of care.\n  The Hawaii project would require an additional $60 million in \nconstruction costs in the future, and another $100 million to operate \nwhen it opens.\n  Having said that, we look forward to the Veterans' Administration \nreorganization plan. It is intended to change the VA into a managed \ncare operation. As part of this reorganization, the VA must develop a \nlong-term strategic plan for medical care, recognizing the change in \ndemographics of veterans population, and a shrinking budget.\n  The General Accounting Office has found that there are additional \nunused facilities. In the 1993 report, the General Accounting Office \nfound that the Tripler Army Hospital--with which the Veterans' \nAdministration has a sharing arrangement--had capacity and ``Demand for \nVA-sponsored care at Tripler has consistently been well below the 69-\nbed constructed capacity'' at Tripler.\n  As a result of these things, I think the VA should look to increasing \nits sharing arrangement with Tripler and community facilities in order \nto meet the needs of Hawaii's veterans.\n  I fully understand and I am sensitive to the Senator's concern that \nthe VA is sending veterans to the west coast for treatment at the Palo \nAlto VA Hospital. I agree with the Senator that this is an \nextraordinary inconvenience. VA has in the past sent cardiology \npatients to the west coast when services were not available to Tripler \nArmy Hospital because VA says it is less expensive than treating the \nveterans in a community hospital.\n  I assure the Senator from Hawaii that I will work with him to see \nthat the VA discontinues the practice and treats veterans in community \nfacilities when services at Tripler are not available.\n  I pledge to work with the Senator from Hawaii to ensure that excess \ncapacity at Tripler may be used by veterans.\n  I have offered an amendment, which I would like my distinguished \ncolleague from Maryland to review to see if we \n\n[[Page S 14228]]\nmay be able to agree on that amendment, and to see if this will meet \nthe needs of the Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator that this is very \nacceptable to me because it ensures that the veterans of the State of \nHawaii are given appropriate equal access to veteran medical care \ncommensurate with the medical care provided in the 48 contiguous States \nso that the veterans of Hawaii are not penalized for their geography.\n  I also want to acknowledge, with the Senator from the majority, that \nthe VA is organizing and modernizing its delivery of care, moving from \nstrictly and chiefly a trauma model to continuing care, emphasizing \nprimary care, to decentralize the services.\n  So I think we are all in agreement with this. I think this is an \nexcellent amendment. If it meets with the concurrence of the senior \nSenator and the junior Senator from Hawaii, it is fine with me. I think \nit is excellent.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to thank the chairman of the \nsubcommittee for his very understanding and sensitive response to our \nconcerns. We look forward to working with him to someday come up with a \nsolution that will be mutually acceptable for all of us.\n  But in the meantime, the amendment, I think, will serve our veterans \nvery well.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set \naside the pending committee amendments to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2778\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure that veterans in the State of Hawaii are given \n        appropriate and equal access to VA-funded medical care)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk in behalf of \nmyself, and Senators Mikulski, Inouye, and Akaka. We will leave it open \nfor others to join as cosponsors, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Akaka, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2778.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 22, line 5, insert: ``Sec. 111. The Department of \n     Veterans Affairs shall provide hospital care and medical \n     services to eligible veterans in the State of Hawaii at \n     levels commensurate with levels of care provided in the \n     forty-eight contiguous states. The Secretary shall utilize \n     the contract authority prescribed in 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1703 to \n     treat eligible veterans residing in the State of Hawaii \n     wherever appropriate.''\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as I indicated, we do share the grave \nconcern both Senators from Hawaii have for veterans care in the State \nof Hawaii.\n  I urge my colleagues to accept this amendment. I believe the junior \nSenator from Hawaii wishes to speak, after which, if there are no \nfurther discussions on it, I think we can proceed to a vote without a \nrollcall.\n  Mr. AKAKA addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in support of the committee action. \nI commend my colleague for taking this issue forward, and I thank the \ncommittee for its considerations.\n  I stand today just to impress the Senate with the fact that the Aloha \nState, the State of Hawaii, has needed a veterans hospital for many \nyears. Since 1987, our predecessor in the Senate tried to establish a \nveterans hospital in Hawaii.\n  Hawaii is one of two States that has no veterans hospital. Although \nthe VA operates 172 medical centers throughout the Union, including a \nhospital in Puerto Rico, the Department has never established a medical \ncenter for veterans in the 50th State, and this is the reason why my \ncolleague and I have been pressing for this.\n  Under the circumstances, we will certainly accept the committee's \naction. And again I wish to thank the committee for what they are \ndoing. This is a step in that direction, and we will be back to ask for \nmore help for our veterans. We have 130,000 veterans in the Pacific, \n120,000 from Hawaii and another 10,000 in the Pacific from Guam and \nSamoa. We take care of these veterans, and we still do not have a \nhospital there.\n  So, Mr. President, I look forward to a day when we can come back and \nseek a full-blown hospital that will help the veterans of the Pacific. \nI thank my colleague and the committee for their efforts.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I do not believe there are any other \nSenators seeking to be heard on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment 2778 by the Senator from Missouri [Mr. \nBond].\n  The amendment (No. 2778) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to make several comments about the \nunderlying bill.\n  First, I have a comment I should like to direct to the managers of \nthe bill. I am a member of the subcommittee, and I wish to congratulate \nthe Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Maryland for the \noutstanding way in which they have handled this particular piece of \nlegislation. It has been a difficult time, and they have been faced \nwith difficult questions and challenges. So I am grateful for my first \nexperience as a member of the Appropriations Committee to serve on this \nsubcommittee and watch Senators Bond and Mikulski work through these \nvery difficult issues.\n  There is one specific issue about which I have talked to Senator Bond \nthat I would like to make mention of in the Chamber to make sure it \ndoes not get lost. This has to do with the expiring contracts under HUD \nhousing programs. In the city of Salt Lake, where we are enjoying boom \neconomic times, the vacancy rate for many of these houses is around 1 \npercent. If people who have contracts that expire are forced to leave \ntheir housing at the moment of that expiration, they will have a very \ndifficult time finding additional housing.\n  I have talked to the chairman, Senator Bond, about this issue and \nasked him to please work with the authorizing committee to see if there \ncan be an extension of those contracts under this circumstance so \npeople who are in this kind of housing are not faced with the immediate \nchallenge of finding housing in an extremely tight housing market. He \nhas assured me of his willingness to work on this issue, and I publicly \nthank him for that assurance and tell him that I will be working with \nhim in any way I can to see that this problem gets resolved.\n  The second issue I should like to discuss has to do with the space \nstation, about which we have heard so much on this floor in the last 24 \nhours or so.\n  The Senator from Arkansas, with his traditional persistence, has once \nagain challenged the wisdom of the space station and will once again \nbring the Senate to a vote on whether or not this should be continued. \nHe does this in every session of Congress, as is his right. Many of us \nadmire him for his tenacity on issues in which he believes strongly. \nEach time he has failed.\n  I rise to say that I think he should fail this time as well. In my \nopinion, the space station should go forward for a variety of reasons, \nmany of which were outlined by our colleague from Ohio, Mr. Glenn, last \nnight. I will not take the time to repeat all of the tangible benefits \nthat the Senator from Ohio listed, but I will call the attention of the \nSenate to his presentation because it was an excellent one.\n  There is an interesting juxtaposition of events in this debate for \nme. Just last week, in Utah, we have had the fourth edition of Space \nTalk, a conference on space that I had the honor to originate back in \n1992.\n  In 1992, there were not very many people who were interested in \ncoming. I was then a candidate for the Senate, and they thought it was \njust an election year gimmick for me to get some out-of-State speakers \nto come to the \n\n[[Page S 14229]]\nState and, hopefully, get a little press and link that press to my name \nand thereby help me in the campaign. But I promised on that occasion \nthat if I were elected, I would continue this annual conference on \nspace and the issues of space that have grown into Space Talk.\n  I am delighted to be able to report to the Senate that Space Talk has \ngrown every year, has been more and more successful every year, and \nthat the centerpiece of Space Talk in terms of public awareness has \nbeen the exhibit at the Utah State Fair.\n  When we first put it on 3 years ago, NASA was a little nervous about \nbringing exhibits all the way to Utah, but they were willing to try it. \nWe got the appropriate cooperation from the State fair board and the \nUtah National Guard and mounted the exhibit.\n  NASA was stunned at the response that came from the citizens of Utah \nin general and the schoolchildren of Utah in particular. Space Talk \nbecame the No. 1 attraction at the Utah State Fair, and fair officials \nsaid to us, ``You must bring this book next year,'' which we did. And \nthen again this year NASA brought a mockup of the space station to \nSpace Talk, and once again this year it was the No. 1 attraction at the \nUtah State Fair. Many schoolteachers would plan field trips to the \nState fair just to come to Space Talk, so that the schoolchildren could \nget the educational experience of finding out about space.\n  The space station mockup this year made a strong point of outlining \nthose portions of the space station that would be built by other \ncountries.\n  ``This would be the Japanese section of space station,'' we were told \nas we walked through the mockup. ``This is where the Europeans will be \nworking. This is where the Russians will be,'' and so on, demonstrating \nthat the space station is not only a technological breakthrough for the \nUnited States, but it represents an international exercise in \nunderstanding and cooperation that can have fallout far beyond the \ntechnological areas, but in the diplomatic area as well.\n  So, coming off this successful and growing support for our Nation's \nspace program in Utah, I come now to the floor of the Senate to find \nonce again an effort to cut back our activity in space and particularly \nwith respect to the space station.\n  Now, Mr. President, there is a quote that has been used many times. \nBut I am going to repeat it. I have discovered since I have been in the \nSenate that there is no such thing as repetition. We go on again and \nagain and again and always act as if it is new. I think my friend from \nArkansas will understand that, because most of the arguments he is \nraising against the space station are repetitious of arguments he has \nraised before.\n  So I think this quote deserves repeating. It is by the historian \nSamuel Eliot Morison. He said, ``America was discovered accidentally by \na great seaman who was looking for something else. When discovered, it \nwas not wanted, and most of the exploration for the next 50 years was \ndone in the hope of getting through or around it. America was named \nafter a man who discovered no part of it. History is like that. Very \nchancy.''\n  We look back on Columbus and his activity here and Amerigo Vespucci, \nafter whom it was named, and the lack of activity that he put forward \nhere, and we see the truth of the historian's comment, ``History is \nlike that. Very chancy.'' But as we look at history as a whole, we \nrealize that out of the chanciness of history comes a whole series of \nunexpected benefits or, in some cases, unexpected difficulties.\n  I was interested, Mr. President, at one of the Space Talk \npresentations to be told by one of our speakers that prior to the great \nEuropean era of discovery in exploration when the Europeans ended up \ncoming to these shores and for them discovering what is now called \nAmerica, there was another nation that was a great explorer nation, \nsending out ships onto the uncharted seas for the sole purpose of \nseeing what they could find. The ships of this great nation ended up \nultimately on the shores of what we now call Africa, a tremendously \nexotic discovery for those who sailed the ships. The great nation that \nsent those ships out on that discovery mission was China.\n  Now, whoever governed China in those years decided that they had \nbudget problems at home and that it was time to cut back on the \nexploration, that they had more urgent budget pressures domestically, \nand so they stopped their exploration. They brought the ships back, and \nthey became wholly insular in their administration.\n  I have stood upon the Great Wall of China, which I think stands in \nhistory as one of the prime examples of a public works project gone \nwrong. They started building it and they simply could not stop. And so \nin their budget priorities to do something for home, they built the \nGreat Wall that stands in great disrepair, and it serves primarily now \nas a tourist attraction. They turned their back on the exploration that \nwould have made the Chinese, and not the Europeans, ultimately the \nmasters of the world, as the Europeans picked up the challenge of \nexploration, not knowing what they were going to find, not knowing what \nthe return would be, but, in fact, laying the groundwork for the \nability to govern the entire world.\n  Mr. President, history is like that. Things start out very small, \nwith unintended consequences later on. We do not know who first thought \nof the notion of interchangeable parts, the idea that instead of \nbuilding every carriage fresh and new as a single work of art, you \nwould build a series of axles, every one exactly alike that would be \ninterchangeable with each other so you could assemble a whole bunch of \ncarriages. But upon the principle of interchangeable parts rests the \nconcept of mass production and ultimately the entire industrial \nrevolution, a simple little idea that somebody started somewhere, we do \nnot know, upon which the entire world was changed.\n  Just when we get used to that concept, let us think then of the \nnotion of digital code. Somewhere, somebody--probably the historians \nknow this name, but I do not--came up with the idea that a switch is \neither on or off. And if you line up enough switches in a row, you can \ncreate a computer that by calculating whether this row of switches are \neither on or off, can do calculations beyond the human ability to do \nthose calculations.\n  So early computers were built with the understanding that a \ntransistor was either on or off. And those computers were created \nprimarily to make calculations concerning ballistic projectiles for \nwartime. If we shoot this, what is the trajectory it will follow? We \ncannot figure it with pen and pencil or even slide rule. Let us get a \nbunch of switches lined up and put electricity through them; and \nthrough writing digital code, we figure that out.\n  From that, of course, has come the entire information revolution that \nhas changed all of our lives, and an idea that someone who started out \nhad no concept of. Now we come, of course, to the space station.\n  Can I tell the Senator from Arkansas what is going to happen in the \nspace station? No; I can tell him the experiments that will be run. I \ncan tell him the efforts that will be made. But I cannot tell whether \nor not some discovery as simple but as far reaching as the notion of \ninterchangeable parts or the notion of digital code will come out of \nour activities on space station.\n  We do know the kinds of things that can happen on space station. It \nwill serve as a laboratory for materials processing in zero gravity. We \nhave never been able to do that before. There are a myriad of \nindustrial and scientific research projects that can be run in that \nkind of an environment. It will provide a platform for astronomical \nobservations, the study of our Earth's development and current \nconditions. Then it will provide a base to further the exploration of \nthe solar system as the first component in a space-based international \nindustrial park.\n  Well, maybe we cannot put a dollar value on this. And unable to put a \ndollar value on this, maybe we should do as the ancient Chinese \nmandarins did and say, ``Bring the ships home. Let us spend our time \ntaking care of our domestic priorities. Leave that for some future \ntime.''\n  I believe if we do that, the human spirit to explore is sufficiently \nstrong elsewhere that we will see someone other than the Americans take \nover this lead. I think we will see Europeans or someone else, maybe \nnot yet on the screen, some Asians, perhaps, as those \n\n[[Page S 14230]]\neconomies become stronger, step into the void that we will create if we \nabandon this leadership challenge.\n  So, Mr. President, I rise once again in support of space station. I \nrise once again in support of the spirit of exploration. I rise once \nagain in support of the great human spirit of adventure that has served \nus so well throughout the centuries. And I call upon us not to make the \nmistakes of others who have turned their back on this only to discover \nin subsequent years that other human beings have not lacked this spirit \nof exploration, and the torch is passed from American hands to those \nwho might wish us ill.\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I support the space station and \nurge the rest of the Senate to do likewise.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2776\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). Under the previous order, the \nhour of 11 a.m. having arrived, the Senate will resume consideration of \nthe Bumpers amendment No. 2776, on which there will be 90 minutes of \ndebate equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute just to thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah for his very, very compelling arguments \nwith respect to the space station. I think his historical perspective \nadds a great deal to this debate. I find it a very compelling argument.\n  I also want to say I appreciate his comments with respect to the \nproblems faced with housing where housing is in short supply, as in his \nState. He has been a very forceful advocate for assuring that those \npeople who depend upon assisted housing in Salt Lake City and other \nUtah communities not be thrown out. We are working with him and other \nMembers to give HUD the opportunity to make sure that people do not \nlose very scarce public housing.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Does the Senator from \nAlaska wish time from the Senator from Missouri?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I did not know there was controlled time.\n  Mr. President, I would like 4 or 5 minutes to discuss a situation in \nmy State and to ask a question of the managers of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n\n\n                Typhoon Oscar and Emergency Relief Funds\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Typhoon Oscar, which came across the \nNorth Pacific, has wreaked havoc in the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska. I \nhave been on the phone yesterday and today following reports we \nreceived over the weekend concerning the effect of this typhoon. It has \ncaused flooding of many rivers, the Kenai River and the Skwentna River.\n  The damage runs from Seward, AK, over to Kenai. It is threatening the \nAlaska Railroad. As it goes down into Seward, they apparently lost part \nof that railroad bed already. The area has now been declared to be a \ndisaster area under State law, and we are waiting to have the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, FEMA, people come into the area to \ndetermine what is going to be available to assist in terms of recovery \nfrom this disaster.\n  The Kenai River is on a rampage. Unfortunately, it has destroyed a \nconsiderable amount of work we did to rehabilitate that river in the \nlast 2 years in order to protect it. It is the greatest king salmon-\nproducing river in the world. It is a substantial disaster for the area \nbecause of the loss of homes and really the loss particularly of \nrecreation facilities along the river.\n  I have come to the floor because I am aware, as a member of the \ncommittee, of the report on the pending bill that indicates that there \nare no new funds provided for disaster relief in this bill. The report \npoints out that the reason is that in the emergency funding bill of \nthis year, 1995, Congress made available and the President approved \n$6.55 billion to be added to the disaster relief fund.\n  I am sorry I was not aware of the controlled time situation, and if I \nam taking time from my friend from Arkansas, I will be glad to try to \nwork that out with him.\n  I would like to ask the managers of the bill about this disaster \nrelief fund. The question has now been raised with me that the money in \nthe fund has already been earmarked for previous disasters and whether \nthere is going to be money available during this period.\n  Obviously, the final result of FEMA will not be known for a period of \nweeks. I am going to dispatch two of my assistants to go to the area \nthis evening to make sure that we are getting all the coordination we \ncan among the Federal and State and local people because, as I said, it \nis a very serious flood. It is already above the 100-year-flood mark on \nthe Kenai River. That means we are going to have even more damage than \nwas estimated.\n  The damage in the one area alone of the Kenai is somewhere between $6 \nmillion and $10 million in terms of just immediate damage. I do not \nknow what it is going to be in terms of the loss of roads and railroad \nbed and tank farms and all the rest.\n  May I ask the chairman of the subcommittee, in terms of the report, \nit indicates there is currently a fund balance of approximately $8 \nbillion in disaster relief. Has that been earmarked already? Is that \navailable for disasters such as the aftermath of Typhoon Oscar?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, first, let me thank the Senator from Alaska \nfor bringing this to our attention. The areas of which he speaks I am \nvery familiar with. The Senator has been a leader in restoring the \nhabitat on one of the most pristine rivers in America, certainly a \nnational treasure. We are deeply saddened by the damage and by the \nenvironmental destruction that is going on there.\n  I will say to the Senator from Alaska that we did not include funding \nin this bill for the disaster relief fund because there is currently an \n$8 billion balance, none of which is earmarked. So long as the \nPresident declares a disaster in Alaska, those funds are available to \nmeet the needs.\n  I join with the Senator in urging the people of FEMA to respond to \nprovide assistance and assess the damage to make the necessary steps to \ndetermine whether a Presidential disaster declaration is appropriate \nand to lend all appropriate assistance. We have great concern for the \nresidents in that area and also for the tremendous natural resources, \nas well as the human infrastructure that has been built there.\n  We are very sorry to learn of this problem and assure the Senator \nfrom Alaska the funds are available should a Presidential disaster \ndeclaration be made, and we urge FEMA to respond to the Senator's \nconcerns as quickly as possible.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I echo the chairman's comments, first to \nthe people of Alaska, of our deep concern. As the Senator knows, I have \nvisited Alaska. Though I do not have intimate knowledge with the \nspecifics of the areas that he has talked about, I can only imagine the \nreally sad impact. We believe in helping communities to be able to \nrebuild themselves and restore themselves. I hope that the President \nwill declare this a disaster area.\n  How we ultimately fund the actual disaster account is a subject of \nwhich we have had extensive hearings for which we would require an \nauthorizing solution. I know this is not the time or the place to \ndebate that. I think that is a good topic for 1996.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I want to make certain it will not be incumbent upon me \nto offer an amendment at this point to put money into the disaster \nrelief fund because of the feeling that there is a zero amount in this \nbill. The indication was there would be none available in fiscal year \n1996. It is my understanding this $8 billion is available and carries \nover to the next year; is that correct?\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I do thank the managers of the bill for \ntheir response. I am certain this will be welcome news to the people of \nsouth-central Alaska. In 1986, we had an epic flood in this region. It \nwas declared to be the 100-year flood. As I said, this flood this year \nexceeds the limits of the 1986 flood, so we have really a new record in \nterms of flood in the area. It is going to involve a considerable \namount of not only disaster assistance but work to try to find some way \nto handle these floods as they are coming \n\n[[Page S 14231]]\ninto this area, because we are having really new stages on these two \nrivers as they reach flood stage.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record following my \nremarks the report on this flood that appeared in the Anchorage Daily \nNews of Saturday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be sending two of my assistants up to look into \nthis, including Mr. Staser, who is with me right now. He is formerly \nwith the Corps of Engineers. We would like to do everything we can to \nassist in bringing this to a speedy conclusion. This is a tough time \nfor Alaska, as I am sure everyone knows. We are near freeze-up now. \nThis kind of disaster coming right at the tail of the fall period, \nwhich is not too long in this area, can mean real difficulty. If we do \nnot get assistance in there this year in time to take care of these \nproblems before the freeze-up there, we will be in real trouble. I \nappreciate the offer of assistance from my two friends. I appreciate \nthe courtesy of the Senators. I will not offer the amendment under the \ncircumstances.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n            [From the Anchorage Daily News, Sept. 25, 1995]\n\n                       Kenai Rushes Into Big Eddy\n\n                            (By Tom Kizzia)\n\n       Rising flood waters hit homes along the Kenai and Skwentna \n     Rivers on Friday, while residents of other Southcentral \n     Alaska communities began repairing facilities damaged in \n     flooding this week.\n       In Girdwood, city and state workers were moving heavy \n     equipment to Glacier Creek in an effort to protect a bridge \n     from the muddy torrent. Flood waters also damaged the road \n     leading to the Crow Pass trail head, prompting the U.S. \n     Forest Service to close the road.\n       An icy Kenai River current several feet deep pushed through \n     the Big Eddy area in Soldotna Friday afternoon, shoving \n     picnic tables and propane tanks downriver. Recreational \n     trailers and camps were under water in the low area, which \n     sits in an oxbow of the river.\n       ``This is some serious stuff going on here,'' said fishing \n     guide Joe Hanes, who had his boat tied off to the deck of his \n     home at Big Eddy as water raced through his foundation \n     pilings. He said the river was 3 feet over its banks at noon \n     Friday.\n       Swollen by rain in the mountains of north of Seward, the \n     Kenai River has risen more than 5 feet at Cooper Landing \n     since Tuesday, putting it about 2 feet above flood stage, \n     according to the National Weather Service. Roads in the Kenai \n     Keys subdivision were under 3 feet of water.\n       Forecasters predicted the river would peak in Soldotna \n     about midday today.\n       The Kenai flood appeared to be undoing some of the work \n     done by landowners to halt erosion and improve fish habitat \n     along the river's banks. Fragments of boardwalks and floating \n     docks were mixed in the debris floating downriver Friday.\n       ``I think this took people by surprise,'' said state park \n     superintendent Chris Titus. ``Everyone was focused on what \n     was happening in Seward and the eastern Kenai Peninsula. We \n     haven't gotten a lot of rain here.''\n       State park officials closed the Kenai to boat traffic \n     Friday afternoon because some fishermen continued to dodge \n     floating oil drums and cottonwood logs in their pursuit of \n     silver salmon. The boats also were creating wakes that in \n     some cases sent water spilling into homes in low areas.\n       Three days of heavy rain in the western Susitna Valley \n     brought heavy flooding Friday to Skwentna and the Lake Creek \n     area. Residents gathered at the Skwentna Roadhouse, as 50 to \n     75 buildings had been hit by the flood, according to \n     Matanuska-Susitna Borough officials.\n       Joe Delia, who runs the Skwentna post office, said at least \n     six homes there were flooded and several boats had been swept \n     away. Water lapped at the edge of the runway and had \n     surrounded the school, he said. The river itself slowed as it \n     spread across the flat land adjacent to its former banks, but \n     the main channels remained turbulent and full of debris.\n       ``It's pretty hairy in some places,'' he said. ``There's \n     cottonwoods, and big rafts of timbers and rollers 2, 3, 4 \n     feet high in some places.''\n       Gov. Tony Knowles on Friday declared the Kenai Peninsula \n     Borough, Mat-Su Borough and the Municipality of Anchorage, \n     which includes Girdwood, disaster areas. The proclamation \n     qualifies the areas for emergency state funding. Knowles said \n     the state was backing an application for federal disaster \n     assistance for the Seward area, where officials are \n     estimating $4 million to $6 million in damage from floods \n     this week.\n       Flooding wiped out parts of several waterfront roads in \n     Seward and poured silt into the city's harbor. The state \n     ferry had to be diverted from Seward to Homer because \n     officials thought the docking area had been filled in with \n     silt from the Resurrection River. Railroad service has been \n     suspended indefinitely.\n       City spokeswoman Linda Murphy said less rain fell this week \n     than in the fall of 1986, during the last epic floods in \n     Seward. But damage from the Resurrection River this time was \n     worse, she said.\n       ``When all this is over, we need to stop Band-Aiding (the \n     Resurrection River) and fix it,'' Murphy said. ``I'm not sure \n     how. But we can't continue the way we've done.''\n       Murphy said inmate volunteers wearing plastic trash bags \n     for rain protection were filling sand bags at Spring Creek \n     Correctional Center, the state maximum-security prison in \n     Seward.\n       The Old Glenn Highway between Palmer and Anchorage was \n     closed Friday morning at the Knik River bridge after water \n     ran across the road north of the bridge, said Mat-Su Borough \n     spokeswoman Pat Owens. Water from the Knik River covered \n     roads in the nearby Windsong subdivision, but houses there \n     were still above water, Owens said. Much of Knik River Road, \n     which starts on the south of the bridge, was also closed \n     after a creek near Mile 2 sent more than 2 feet over it.\n       Residents of low areas in Seward and along the Kenai and \n     Knik Rivers were being warned about possible contamination of \n     well water by the flooding. Residents should contact nearby \n     offices of the Department of Environmental Conservation about \n     testing their water, disaster officials said.\n       Borough officials were also worried by swollen creeks and \n     rivers in the Lake Louise and Nelchina areas, where hunters \n     of moose and caribou may find themselves trapped. Owens said \n     airplanes are searching the area, and helicopters may be \n     called in to lift out hunters who might otherwise try risky \n     river crossings.\n       The week's heavy rains were the result of an unusually \n     powerful low pressure system that move north of the Pacific, \n     mixing with the remnants of Typhoon Oscar, said Richard \n     Hanas, lead forecaster at the National Weather Service in \n     Anchorage.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2776\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 45 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, is the time just used by the Senator from \nAlaska charged against our time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has not been charged to either side. \nSo the Senator from Arkansas has 45 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I said about all I know to say yesterday afternoon \nabout this subject. I do not know that anybody listened, and I do not \nknow that anybody is listening this morning. But when you are talking \nabout $94 billion, somebody ought to be listening.\n  Just for openers this morning, I want to recommend to my colleagues \nan article that appeared last year in Newsweek magazine, which I will \nbe delighted to furnish to anybody who is curious. It is called ``NASA \nSpace Station Zero Boondoggles; $11.9 Billion Has Been Spent So Far. \nCan Anybody Explain What it is Supposed To Do?'' That is the headline. \nIt is a very telling article. It does not answer the questions because \nNASA cannot answer the questions. Here is one paragraph in this \narticle, and it is replete with similar paragraphs.\n\n       Yet, with the silly problems of the space station \n     corrected, the serious ones stand, in greater degree, still \n     unanswered. What's it for? ``It is primarily a research \n     platform,'' said Randy Brinkley, manager of the space station \n     office at the Johnson Space Center. ``There will be life \n     science, but we haven't finalized what. Really, it is hard to \n     answer that question.''\n\n  As for its prospects as a research platform, the National Research \nCouncil, a preeminent organization in this field, says the station \n``cannot be supported on scientific grounds.'' Many scientific \norganizations have announced opposition to the space station.\n  Mr. President, if you want to get up and argue or if any Senator \nwants to argue that the space station is going to cure cancer, AIDS, \narthritis, or multiple sclerosis, be my guest, I will listen very \nintently. We have been in space for 30 years. The Russians have had \nspace stations up since 1971--seven of them. I want the opponents of \nthis amendment to tell the Senate what we have accomplished so far as \nlife science is concerned. Name me the pharmaceutical companies who are \ncontributing their own money to the space station. Name me one medical \nresearch organization in America that is contributing a thin dime to \nthis gigantic research laboratory in space. Every single scientist \nworth his weight in the country, every single medical researcher in the \ncountry says you cannot justify this on the grounds that \n\n[[Page S 14232]]\nyou are going to get some kind of life-saving pharmaceuticals out of \nit.\n  As a matter of fact, the American Physical Society said, on January \n20, 1991: ``Scientific justification is lacking for a permanently \nmanned space station.''\n  Dr. Bloembergen and Dr. Rosenthal, both at Harvard, say you cannot \njustify this because, so far as we can tell, there is absolutely \nnothing to get out of it.\n  As for microgravity. Well, we can do research in almost zero gravity. \nSo what. You can do that on Earth and in satellites. One semiconductor \ncompany president has said, ``Do not build that thing because you think \nyou are going to get gallium arsenide wafers out of it; we do not want \nthe wafers.'' It is an utter, utter waste of money to try to grow \ncrystals in space. You might grow some, but you can never make anything \neconomically viable.\n  And then the spinoffs--if there are so many spinoffs, why is American \nindustry not hot to contribute to this almost $100 billion project? It \nwill certainly run well over $100 billion over the next 17 years; $94 \nbillion is the present estimated cost of the space station. Bear in \nmind, that assumes everything is going to go split perfectly. No \ndisasters on the launch pad, no malfunctions like on Apollo 13, no \ndebris in space hitting the station or any of the shuttles, or anything \nelse. No, you get it for $94 billion only if everything goes absolutely \nperfectly.\n  I heard the junior Senator from Texas last night talking about \nVelcro. I covered that as well as I could yesterday in talking about \nspinoffs, such as Tang, the orange juice substitute that the astronauts \ndrink. It has been around for 35 years, long before we ever went to \nspace. Then there is Velcro and magnetic resonance imaging. The space \nprogram had absolutely nothing to do with any of those things. Yet, \npeople continue to talk about those spinoffs. I am willing to admit \nthat we got one spinoff. We got a space suit. The demand for space \nsuits is not just great enough in this country to warrant a $100 \nbillion expenditure. I do not want one. I do not have a friend that \nwants one.\n  I will tell you what it is all about. Right here on this chart. \nEighty-six percent of the money spent for 14,000 jobs goes to \nCalifornia, Texas, Alabama, and Florida. So the Senators, as far as I \nam concerned, from those States, get a pass. Go ahead and vote for it. \nFor the other 46 States, who put more into the space station of their \ntax money than they get back, what is your excuse? Now, it is not \nunusual around here for people to vote for big expenditures because \nthere are some jobs in their State. I have done it, and we all do it. \nIt is not unusual to vote for big-ticket items that big corporations \nwho have big PAC's and big contributors want. I want to tell you before \nyou vote, remember that 86 percent of all the money is going to these \nfour States.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, we had a revolution last fall. The Republicans \nwiped the Democrats out. Everybody has been analyzing it ever since. \nWhat happened? How did it happen? Why are the people so upset? Why are \nthey mad?\n  I do not know the answer to it. I wish I did. I think it is a serious \nquestion. Certainly it is serious for my party.\n  Let me make a couple of observations. We are getting ready to spend \n$32.7 billion over the next 7 years on this space station.\n  Now, let me ask you, where is the money coming from? Take your \nchoice. I want you to listen to this: $32.7 billion for the space \nstation, which has absolutely no tangible payback to the American \npeople.\n  Where do we find the money to do it in these budget constrained \ntimes? As I say, take your choice. We are cutting education over the \nnext 7 years $40 billion. What do you get out of this? A lot of \nignorance.\n  We are cutting the earned-income tax credit, according to the Senate \nversion, $40 billion, which represents a $457 annual tax increase for \nthe poorest 17 million people in America who work, that are not on \nwelfare.\n  Ask yourself, is it fair to penalize the people who are working to \nfeed, clothe, house, and educate their children and the lowest paid \nworkers on Earth trying to stay off welfare? Is it fair to levy a $457 \ntax increase against them to pay for the space station? If you believe \nthat, vote against my amendment. If you think this country will be \nbetter off when we cut education by $40 billion over the next 7 years \nin order to fund the space station, you vote against my amendment.\n  If you think it is right to cut Medicare by $270 billion--and I am \nwilling to participate in some of that; not to provide this massive tax \ncut we are talking about, but simply because we do have to do something \nto salvage Medicare--do you think it is fair to cut Medicare by $40 \nbillion of that $270 billion in order to pay for this?\n  Do you think it is fair to cut $180 billion in Medicaid which \nprovides health care for the poorest of the poor--yes, working people, \ntoo--to pay for this? If that is what the revolution last fall was \nabout, then God save America.\n  What else are we doing? We are spreading the already terrible \ndisparity of income in this country. Everybody knows and they talk \nabout it, but nobody wants to address it. The disparity between incomes \nin America is twice as great as any of the 18 developed nations on \nEarth. The only country even close is Britain and we have a 2-to-1 \nmargin on Britain.\n  How do we rectify this? We raise taxes for the poor, we cut health \ncare for the poor, and we provide $250 billion in tax relief--for the \npoor?; no--for people who make over $100,000 a year. That includes \neverybody in the U.S. Senate.\n  Yes, Senators, you will get a nice tax cut next year. So what happens \nto the working poor who have two or three children and because of the \nexemptions for those children do not make enough money to pay taxes? Do \nthey get any of it? No.\n  When you read in the paper that the tax increase proposed by the \nRepublicans provides $500 tax credit for each child, do not believe it. \nThat sounds so good. Is that not wonderful? That is a family issue, is \nit not? We will give it to families.\n  One of the biggest hoaxes ever pulled off in this country--yesterday, \nI alluded to a woman I knew who is a waitress. She has two children. \nShe has to keep both of them in day care in order to work and stay off \nwelfare. The chances of her getting $1,000, $500 for each one of her \nchildren, is point blank zero. But Members of this body, Members of \nthis body who have children will get it. All of this so we can pay for \nthe space station?\n  I could go on and on. The list is endless.\n  I saw in the reconciliation bill passed out of the Senate Energy \nCommittee big relief for the oil companies, the biggest corporations in \nAmerica, if they drill below a certain depth in the Gulf of Mexico or \noff shore. It seems they they cannot take care of themselves. We have \nto give them a big tax royalty bonus to drill.\n  The Minerals Policy Association says there are 625 applications for \nlands that have billions and billions of dollars' worth of gold, \nplatinum, palladium, silver underneath it, from the biggest mining \ncompanies in the world. What do we do? We mandate that the Secretary of \nInterior give them a deed as we have done on 3.2 million acres of lands \nin this country since 1872.\n  The 625 applications for deeds which Secretary Babbitt will have no \nchoice but to deliver to the biggest mining companies on Earth for \n$2.50 to $5 an acre has over 15.5 billion dollars' worth of gold, \nsilver, and hard-rock minerals under it.\n  How are we going to pay for that? You already heard me give speech \nafter speech on that subject. We are going to cut $70 billion off of \nwelfare--very popular in this country. Those worthless, no-good, \nshiftless people on welfare. Some of them are indeed no-good, shiftless \npeople. But some of them simply did not happen to choose their parents \nas well as I did. That is their only sin. They did a lousy job of \npicking their parents.\n  What are we going to do? We are going to bless the poor unless they \nget pregnant at the age of 17. What are we going to do with food \nstamps? We are going to cut food stamps. Maybe we can get a few more \nhomeless people on the streets. All so we can pay for the space \nstation.\n  Mr. President, the National Institutes of Health, who do honest-to-\nGod research--go out to the National Institutes of Health and ask what \nhave they done. They have developed antibiotics; they have developed \nall kinds of drugs \n\n[[Page S 14233]]\nthat give AIDS patients a little longer life; chemotherapy for cancer \npatients. They are doing honest-to-goodness research--a new chicken pox \nvaccine for our children, a new hepatitis vaccine for our children. Not \none person in America quarrels with that priority.\n  I had pneumonia twice before I was 6 years old and all my mother and \nfather could do was pray. There were no antibiotics, nothing. When I \nwas in the Pacific in World War II, we took sulfur to keep from getting \nmalaria, sulfur developed by the National Institutes of Health. You \nwill not get sulfur, you will not get penicillin, you are not going to \nget anything out of this $100 billion expenditure.\n  I might just say here that the 40,000 physicists in this country \nbelong to an organization called the American Physical Society. Do you \nknow who one of the strongest opponents of the space station is? It is \nthe American Physical Society. Do you know why? Because they know the \nbenefits are very, very minimum and the costs of real research very, \nvery great. They have a 50-percent backlog at NIH of applications for \ngood research. And, yet, this space station is like Rasputin. You \ncannot kill it. There are too many big corporations, too many jobs--\n14,000 jobs at $147,000 each. I would like to go to General Motors and \nsay, ``You know I come from a poor State. We need jobs. We will give \nyou $147,000 for every job you create in Arkansas.'' General Motors \nwould say, ``Where would you like for us to locate?'' That is what \nthese jobs cost, $147,000 each.\n  You can buy chicken downtown at the Giant grocery store for 69 cents \na pound. But once you deploy this thing and you start sending chicken \nup to them to eat, it is $12,880 a pound. For 10 years of the operation \nof the space station, we will spend $25 million every day. Can you \nfathom such a thing?\n  For every pound of water we send to the astronauts to drink, $12,880 \na pound. That is in today's dollars; it will be more by then.\n  Your mother used to tell you, ``Oh. Such and such is worth its weight \nin gold.'' The space station cost 25 times its weight in gold. That is \nright. The weight of the space station is 25 times the cost of its \nweight in gold.\n  Carl Sagan says the only scientific reason in the world to build a \nspace station--and he is not alone; every single physicist in the \ncountry says--the only justification for the space station is to \nexplore Mars and beyond.\n  So when you vote against this amendment today--and a majority of \nSenators will. This is my sixth year, I guess, to try to kill it. When \nyou vote no today, you are going to be voting to go to Mars. In today's \ndollars that is $500 billion. That is twice NASA's budget every year \nfor 20 years to go to Mars. Why? Because it is there. It is like \nclimbing a mountain.\n  Mr. President, Carl Sagan, as I was about to say, is a fine man, a \ngood scientist, and he favors the space station because he says it will \nhelp us go to Mars. He says the only justification for this is to \nexplore Mars and beyond. If you believe that, vote against this \namendment. I would like to go to Mars. I would like to be able to fund \nthis space station if we had a balanced budget and if we were not \ncutting every defenseless person in America.\n  So, Mr. President, I have other people who are here who wish to \nspeak. I thank them for it. But one final point on international \ncooperation, which Carl Sagan says he thinks justifies this program, is \nthat the Russians are going to participate. Do you know why? We are \ngoing to give them the money. We are going to give them the money. And, \nby the way, where are the launches in Russia going to come from? There \nwill be no launches in Russia. The launches will come from Kazakhstan, \nnot Russia, where the cosmonauts of Russia are located.\n  So I would like to say, for gosh sakes, colleagues, do your duty in \nthe certain knowledge that my amendment will be defeated, and what a \ntragedy. Our priorities are so terribly skewed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the chairman, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment proposed by \nSenator Bumpers to shut down the space station. He is correct when he \nsays every year for the last 6 years he has introduced this amendment \nto eliminate all funding for the space station, in effect killing the \nprograms that have provided most of the technological advance and \npromises for many more, and, of course, it promises to have many more \nto come.\n  Mr. President this program is probably one of the most vital programs \nwe have when we start talking about science and technology and \nresearch, and it is a catalyst that spurs the curiosity of all the \nyoung people going into those fields. The space station is the driving \nforce for emerging science and technology and the inspiration for young \npeople. It makes them want to excel in the sciences and, of course, in \nmath. To dampen the spirit of our children to succeed in science and \nmath, and that education, would be by dampening this space station and \nkilling their hopes for the future. You cannot put a price tag on that. \nThere is no way to measure that. But I know one thing; it is not \nmeasured in dollars and cents.\n  The international space station is the most important U.S. space \neffort since the Apollo program, and its foundation for the future in \nhuman space flight programs in the post-cold-war era. It combines \nAmerica's technological mastery, the United States' international \nleadership, and the pioneering spirit from which Americans find \nthemselves in the center of modern history.\n  Nobody supports reducing the Federal deficit or balancing the budget \nmore than I do. But we also have to worry about the pioneering spirit \nthat really is the foundation of building this great country. We cannot \nafford not to do that.\n  Let me make an analogy. Let us draw from another time. Maybe it is a \npretty important time for the State from which Senator Bumpers comes \nfrom. But let us compare this time to the time of President Thomas \nJefferson when he requested support of the Lewis and Clark expedition \nthat finally led to the Louisiana Purchase--or it was after the \nLouisiana Purchase. At the time of Jefferson's request, about half of \nthe Federal budget was going toward debt retirement and interest on the \nnational debt. He requested $2,500 for that expedition. We all know \nwhat that expedition did for our country. Personally, I know what it \ndid for my State--not my home State of Missouri but of my home State \nnow of Montana.\n  Today the interest on the national debt is around 14 percent of the \nFederal budget, and the space station request is one-seventh of 1 \npercent of the Federal budget.\n  So I would say that both the President and the Congress have the \nmultiyear balanced budget plans, and the full funding of the space \nstation which is included should stay there, and is a bold step. And \nanother bold step would be making that investment in the future. It is \nthe right way. It is the right thing to do.\n  America does have a role in shaping the future of humanity in the \n21st century, and it should be no less than what it was. It has been \ngreat. But also it is our big step in space. There are many \njustifications that are cited for the program: It stimulates technology \nand provides commercial opportunities. And if we will look to see the \ndirection in which we are going, we are going in that direction; more \ncommercialization will be a part of NASA.\n  The fundamental reason though basically is it expands the frontier, \nthe frontier of knowledge and understanding, a frontier where humans \ncan live and work.\n  The space station is an international space station. It is a \ncooperative program. It draws the resources and the scientific \nexpertise not of just the United States but 13 nations. So cancellation \nwould severely undermine the credibility of this country with its \ninternational partners. International investments in the station are \nsubstantial and represent the centerpieces of the space program of our \ninternational partners.\n  I chair the authorizing committee of NASA. It has had its troubles in \nthe past, but for the last 3 years it has been within, and sometimes \nunder, cost and schedule, and that has been something unusual, because \nwe have taken a personal interest in NASA to make sure it does what it \nis supposed to do, when it is supposed to do it, within budget. \n\n[[Page S 14234]]\n\n  We have tried to iron out its problems. We have a director who, \nbefore he was ever told there were going to be cuts, walked up to the \nbar and said, ``I will take $1 billion out of my budget a year for the \nnext 5 years if that will help you on the Hill to balance your budget \nand still keep this very vital, important program underway.''\n  This Thursday, aboard the space shuttle, the United States will \nlaunch its second microgravity laboratory which will be in space for 16 \ndays. The mission will be a precursor to the space station laboratory. \nWe will try out a lot of things.\n  I held a hearing last May on the space station. From that hearing, \nthe subcommittee determined that NASA has overcome some of those \nproblems I was talking about earlier and they are ready to come up to \nthe bar, deal with those, finish the development, and start using this \nunique laboratory that we will use for a long, long time.\n  By the way, Lewis and Clark had their problems getting started, too. \nThey underestimated by a factor of three the number of people required \nto execute the expedition. So what else is new? Everything we have done \nalways operated under Murphy's Law: Anything that can go wrong will.\n  But if you look at the history of our space program, from the day of \ninception, when we had a President stand up in this town and inspire \nthis country to reach out into space, it has probably been one of the \nmost successful that we have ever undertaken, especially going into the \nunknown, dealing with technologies that were unknown at the time.\n  Today, our manned flight program represents the pinnacle of human \nachievement and it transcends everybody in this country. It is a center \nof pride. It is that part of America that is the example of what we are \nas a people. We are a curious people. We are people who reach out. Only \nthis country can do it. And some pride has to be taken for that.\n  I am committed to this project, not merely because of the high \ntechnology jobs it brings to 37 States, but because it is the right \nthing to do for America.\n  I noticed with interest the map of the Senator from Arkansas. I did \nnot see Montana as one of those blackened in places that receives all \nthe aid money. But I know the effect it has on our young people \nwhenever a shot goes up, and as we perform some of the successful \noperations in research and development practices in space. We should \nnot be so shortsighted to shackle ourselves to this planet. After all, \nspace is the next frontier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BURNS. That concludes my remarks. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, by consent of the Senator from Arkansas, I \nyield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] has \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is not a debate between those who \nsupport a space program and those who do not. It is not a debate about \nwhether there ought to be a pioneering spirit in this country. The \nquestion is, Should we build this space station? I have supported the \nspace program. I think some of the things we have done in our space \nprogram have been breathtaking. I am enormously proud of our astronauts \nand the people who have developed this space program.\n  The question for this Congress is, should we build this space \nstation? The point is that the purpose for which the space station was \noriginally developed represents a purpose that the space station can no \nlonger achieve. Most of the scientific data indicate to us that if we \nbuild this space station as it is now conceived, it will represent a \ngiant funnel through which will go an enormous amount of research \ndollars, taking away from so many other important research projects--\nyes, space research projects --that there simply will not be enough \nmoney available for things we are doing because it will all be sunk \ninto this space station.\n  So it is not about the space program. It is not about the pioneering \nspirit. It is about this space station. It is about choices, hard \nchoices, tough choices. I suppose everyone here would say if we can do \nit all, let us do it all. Let us build the space station. But the \nforced choices as a result of the fiscal policy problems in our country \nneed to make us look at all of these issues and say, are there ways for \nus to do this better, less expensively? Must this be a manned space \nflight in a space station? Can there be microgravity experiments and \nwork done in space with automated space flights?\n  The answer is, of course, yes. It is less expensive to do it that \nway, in fact. So I am supporting the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Arkansas. He is correct about other choices, as well. He said this \nis a set of choices. If we do not build the space station, what else \ncan we do? What else needs to be done in this country? I said a year or \nso ago, when I was in the Chamber, nobody is going to give a plaque to \nthe Senator from Arkansas for coming here trying to kill something. \nThere will be a banquet someplace tonight in town, I am sure, where \nsomeone is going to invite a Member of Congress and give him a plaque \nin recognition of his achievements.\n  What are his achievements? For helping that group or that industry or \nthat organization build something or get something, the man of the year \nprobably, or the woman of the year. That is the honor. Nobody is going \nto give a plaque to the Senator from Arkansas for trying to kill the \nspace station. But he comes to the floor with an amendment which raises \na critically important question for this Senate: Is this the way we \nshould spend our money? Will this advance our interests? Will it \nadvance our space program, in fact? That is the question he raises.\n  This is an interesting time. We have already been told just recently, \na week or two ago, that we must now advance a program called star wars \nor the antiballistic missile system, and we must deploy it almost \nimmediately--1999, the first deployment. We can afford that. We can \nafford trucks the Department of Defense did not order, jet airplanes \nthey said they did not want. We say, well, we cannot afford, however, \nHead Start for 350,000 kids that are now getting Head Start. So we are \ngoing to take 350,000 kids and say, ``We are sorry; we cannot afford \nyou and the Head Start Program.'' We are going to say to 600,000 kids \nin inner cities, disadvantaged kids, ``We are sorry. We do not have \nenough money for summer jobs for disadvantaged youth.''\n  We are going to say to 170,000 veterans who are incapacitated, \n``We're sorry, we're cutting your benefits.'' We are saying, ``We're \nnot very interested in a real serious review of whether the space \nstation makes good research and scientific sense in this country's \nfuture because this is our pioneering spirit and our international \nagreements and what we've been doing, so let's keep doing what we've \nbeen doing.''\n  It seems to me if there is a status quo around here, it is the folks \nwho every year trod over to the Chamber to vote no on an amendment that \nasks us to review whether this is something this country ought to \ncontinue to do.\n  Now, I stand here today with the Senator from Arkansas. And let me \nend where I began. I am not opposed to the space program. I have \nsupported much of the space program. A young astronaut from North \nDakota, Rick Hieb, has been on many space missions and was one of the \nfellows up in the space station Endeavor when they grabbed the Intelsat \ntraveling 16,000 miles an hour with a 10,000 pound satellite in outer \nspace. They worked for 4 days to try to fix this Intelsat. Many of us \nwatched them working for 5 or 6 hours in space.\n  I am enormously proud of what they have done in the space program. \nThis is the question: Is this in the advancement of the space station? \nI think not, and I support the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I want to thank the chairman of the committee and the \nranking member for leading in the effort once again for the 20th time \nto support the space station.\n  In fact, Congress has reaffirmed year after year that it is committed \nto the space station and the new endeavors that are being made every \nday because we are willing to take this chance to go out and look for \nnew industries and look for new technologies. \n\n[[Page S 14235]]\n\n  I have two points, Mr. President. First, we are not doing the space \nstation alone. This is not any longer just a U.S. mission. It is an \ninternational mission. We have international partners. Many countries \nin Europe, Japan, Canada, and Russia are putting money into this \nprogram because they know this joint effort is so very important. Are \nwe going to be a bad business partner? That is the question here. Are \nwe going to say, ``Yes, put in $4.5 billion,'' which our international \npartners have done, ``but we are not really committed. We are going to \nwalk away from this project after we have told you that we are going to \ndo it.''\n  Mr. President, I do not think the United States is going to be a bad \nbusiness partner. And, in fact, I think if we did the ethical thing, if \nwe did decide to walk away from it, we would have to reimburse the $4.5 \nbillion to the partners that have put up the money. That would be a \nterrible waste. It would be the wrong thing to do. That is on the \nbusiness side. That is on just being a good partner. That is on ethics.\n  Let us talk about the merits, and that is my second point. Let us \ntalk about the merits. You heard people say that the science is not \nthere; this is going to crowd out other science projects. In fact, this \nis a science project that has cut its budget, that has streamlined, \nthat has not put its head in the sand to say, ``Oh, we are scientific, \nwe cannot cut our budget.'' In fact, we have cut our budget $40 \nbillion. We are cutting by streamlining the project.\n  But the point is, there are things being done in the space station \nthat cannot be done in any other way. And that is because the \nmicrogravity conditions that we find in space are so important for \ncancer research, especially women's cancer research, such as breast \ncancer and osteoporosis, which hits women the hardest. Those can only \nbe done in the microgravity conditions which cannot be duplicated on \nEarth. So we are looking at scientific advances that cannot be done in \nany other way but this one. And we are on the brink of making \nbreakthroughs.\n  We also are on the brink of learning how we are going to be able to \nlive better in space. And, Mr. President, we have to be looking to the \nfuture. We have to see what kind of environment there is, what we can \nget from the environment and the environmental lessons that we learn in \nspace. So the science is good.\n  Mr. President, we have been able to grow in this country. We have \nbeen able to absorb the immigrants that come to our country, the new \npeople that grow up in our country because we have been willing to do \nthe basic research that may or may not produce something. We know it is \nalways chance when you go out and you burst forward to do the new \nthings that have not been done before. We have been willing to do that \nin America. We have been willing to spend that extra money to try to \nfind out what the new technologies are and to grab those new \ntechnologies and turn them into new products, new technologies, and the \nnew jobs that go right down to the grassroots of the success of our \ncountry and our economy.\n  We have been willing to do that. That has been the hallmark of our \ncountry. We have the can-do spirit. We are the leaders of the world in \nresearch and technology and development. We are acknowledged as that. \nAre we going to turn around and say, ``No, let's be stagnant. Let's \nlook back 200 years ago and see what was done then. We don't need to do \nany more. We have actually done everything that we need to do now.'' If \nwe do that, Mr. President, that is the beginning of the end of this \ndynamic country that is the greatest superpower in the world.\n  That is not America, Mr. President. That is not the way we have built \nthis country, and it is not the way we are going to keep this country \nstrong, we are going to keep our economy vital, we are going to create \nthe new jobs for the young people coming out of high school and \ncollege, the immigrants that come into our country looking for the \nopportunity that this country has always provided.\n  We are going to continue to have those opportunities and to make \nthose opportunities by investing in research. Our research budget in \nthis country used to be about 4 percent. Now it is below 2 percent. We \nmust not walk away from that in the name of cutting spending. That is \neating our seed corn. Our seed corn is what gives us the opportunity to \ncreate those new technologies that will absorb the new people in our \nsystem and keep us vibrant and robust.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would be happy to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Could the Senator elaborate on what the space station \nmeans to the women's health agenda? As the Senator knows, we worked on \nwomen's health on a bipartisan basis, particularly in the area of \nbreast cancer and ovarian cancer and others. Could the Senator take a \nsecond or two to elaborate on that? And I would like to thank her for \nworking on a bipartisan basis.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I appreciate the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator, all time has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If I can have a minute to answer, I would be happy \nto. But I understand if others are seeking to speak, that----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I will elaborate.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Because we have done it on a bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. BOND. I will yield 2 additional minutes to be shared by the three \nof us. In my comments, I want to express my thanks to the Senator from \nTexas, who led us on a tour of the Johnson Space Center in Houston and \nhas been a strong proponent of space exploration. I thank her for her \ncomments.\n  I now ask her to respond to the question raised by the ranking \nmember.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the chairman for letting me have this minute \nto respond to my colleague, because her point is so very important. And \nthat is, Senator Mikulski and I and the other women Senators have \nlooked at the amount of money that has been spent on women's health in \nthis country. It is appallingly small, Mr. President. The women's \nhealth issues have not been addressed to anywhere near the degree that \nwould be required according to the number of people in our country who \nare stricken by these women's diseases.\n  In fact, we are on the cusp, because of the space station and because \nof the microgravity conditions, of being able to have breakthroughs \nboth in breast cancer research and osteoporosis. That is why this is so \nvery important for us to continue. I appreciate the emphasis of the \nSenator from Maryland on women's health care issues, and it is because \nof her leadership that we all know that women's health care research \nhas not had the funding that we have needed through all these many \nyears, and now is the time that we have the ability to do it. I \nappreciate her support in a bipartisan way for us to be able to \ncontinue the space station, which is going to give us the chance to \nhave those breakthroughs that we hope will be able to cure breast \ncancer and stop osteoporosis, which is causing so much pain for the \nelderly people in our country. I thank Senator Mikulski.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I will use 1 minute of speaking on this \nand will speak again on my own time.\n  I believe the American people want us to work on a bipartisan basis \nto save lives and to save jobs in the United States of America and to \ndevelop those lifesaving techniques that we can export around the \nworld. Working on a bipartisan basis, we have worked on saving lives, \nand the special emphasis on women's health care that we have done on a \nbipartisan basis has been extraordinary.\n  Let me tell you what working together has meant and working with \nNASA. It means that for the victims of osteoporosis, NASA has developed \ninstruments to measure bone loss and bone density without penetrating \nthe skin that is now being used in hospitals. It also means that in the \nabsence, that research equipment developed by the space station is \nalready paying dividends on the ground by growing ovarian tumor samples \nin NASA's new cell culturing device, called a bioreactor, so that \ntumors can be studied outside the body without harm to the patient and \ndeveloping the technique to intervene.\n  This is an enormous breakthrough, and while we are concentrating \nusing \n\n[[Page S 14236]]\nspace science focusing on ovarian tumors, this will have incredible \nconsequences also for brain tumors and other diseases that are terminal \nbecause of a tumor effect.\n  This is absolutely crucial. Working with the NIH on joint ventures, \non hormonal disorders, immune system dysfunctions and also on heart \ndisease, now the No. 1 killer of women in the United States of America, \nshows this. I know that the Senator from Texas is aware that because of \nour efforts, NASA and NIH have entered into a joint agreement on how we \ncan do things in space that we could never do here. By doing things in \nspace collaboratively, it will not only be in the laboratory, it will \nbe in the doctor's office and in pharmaceutical devices we can sell \naround the world. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nMaine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 8 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COHEN. Madam President, I thank my friend.\n  Madam President, if this were construed to be an antiwomen's health \nissue vote, an anti-breast-cancer vote, an anti-ovarian-cancer vote, I \nwould not be on the floor supporting the Senator from Arkansas. I have \nnever known him to be antiwomen. I have never known him to cut back on \nfunds for research, be it for osteoporosis or cancer of any form. In \nfact, he has probably been one of the leaders in favor of more \nresearch.\n  So the notion that somehow this vote, by failing to support the space \nstation, is now going to be an antiwomen's health vote, is that what we \nhave come to?\n  Madam President, I would like to support the space station, which \nwill cost probably about $100 billion. I would even like to support the \nB-2 bomber, which the occupant of the chair also supports. That is \nanother $30 billion. And we are probably going to get both. Probably \nwhen all is said and done, we are going to have another $130 billion \njust in these two programs.\n  By the same token, we stand over here on this side of the aisle and \nwe talk day after day about budgets, about how we have to save money \nfor our children, the crushing debt we are putting on their shoulders. \nWe heard words quoted from Jefferson and the implication from President \nKennedy. Maybe we should say we will pay any price, will bear any \nburden, will borrow any money in order to build a space station, \nwhatever its costs, whatever the merit of the scientific experiments. \nLast year, we heard the debate on the NAFTA vote. Maybe the giant \nsucking sound we are going to hear will be all those dollars being \ndrained into a large black hole.\n  Madam President, 2 years ago, this program was on the verge of being \nterminated, and at that time, in a desperate effort to save it, the \nClinton administration brought Russia into the program and they \nasserted this was going to reduce the cost by nearly $2 billion, down \nfrom $19.4 billion to $17.4 billion, and that promise of $2 billion of \nsavings was critical to saving this particular program.\n  I was suspicious at those claims. I asked the GAO to make an analysis \nof those claims, and they found that $2 billion savings to be about as \nthin as the space through which the space station is going to fly. As a \nmatter of fact, the Russians, by coming into the program, are actually \ngoing to cost us almost $2 billion more. Contrary to the claim of \nsaving $2 billion, it is going to be about $2 billion more.\n  NASA failed to take into account and to identify the additional costs \nof involving the Russians in our program. It reminds me somewhat of the \nSteve Martin routine where he says:\n  ``I can tell you how to make a million dollars and pay no taxes. The \nfirst thing you do is make a million dollars. The second thing, you pay \nno taxes. Then when the IRS shows up, slap yourself on the forehead and \nsay, `I forgot, I forgot.' ''\n  What NASA has forgotten to do is to identify the additional $1.4 \nbillion in costs of bringing the Russians into the program by forcing \nus to have to accommodate their technologies with ours and match them \nup.\n  But beyond that, we have heard a lot of talk about being a good \nbusiness partner, about this being an international project. Indeed, it \nis. Just yesterday, the trade press reported that officials at Russia's \nMission Control Center at Kaliningrad said low salaries are making it \ndifficult to prepare, with Johnson Space Center in Houston, to run the \ninternational space station.\n  And Russia is not the only international partner backing away from \nthis program. Canada already reduced its commitment. Yesterday's press \naccount indicated Italy is backing away from its contribution to the \nspace station and wants other European countries to pick up the slack. \nAccording to the media reports again yesterday, German and French \nofficials are calling Italy's action the death knell for European \nparticipation in the United States-led effort.\n  If any more of our partners decide to cut back, guess where the cost \nis going to come from? Good old Uncle Sam is going to have to cough up \nthe money our international partners are starting to back away from.\n  NASA says this program is going to cost roughly $71 billion. Given \nthe fact that the average cost overrun in NASA programs is about 77 \npercent, it should come as no surprise that this program will probably \ncome nearer to $100 billion. But even if you assume it is going to come \nin right on target, $71 billion is something that we cannot afford for \nthe Russian Alpha station any more than we could have afforded the $120 \nbillion space station Freedom which the administration terminated back \nin 1993. Neither can our children, from whom this money is going to be \ncoming. NASA cannot afford it. As the GAO and CBO both warned in \nseveral dire reports, NASA's budget over the next 5 years falls $10 \nbillion short. They cannot account for how they are going to come up \nwith another $10 billion to fund the programs already scheduled for \ntheir funding.\n  So we have so much money going into the space station now that they \nare not going to be able to carry on the kind of programs that are \ngoing to be necessary for them to carry out their mission.\n  Another disturbing discovery by GAO is that most of the research \nproposals submitted to NASA for funding were described as being rather \nmediocre or even worse. Nearly two-thirds--nearly two-thirds--according \nto the GAO, said they were not considered scientifically meritorious by \nscientific peer review panels. We heard a lot about all the experiments \nthat are going to take place only in space, and yet two-thirds of the \nproposed experiments are not supported by scientific peers.\n  Madam President, the reason I rise in support of the amendment is \nthat we cannot, on the one hand, continue to talk to our colleagues and \nour countrymen and women about the need to restrain spending, and then \ncome up with B-2 bombers that we have to fund at $30 billion or come up \nwith a space station that will cost another $100 billion. And there may \nbe no end in sight, indeed, as far as infinity itself may carry us into \nspace, as to how much this program is ultimately going to cost.\n  On the one hand, we are cutting back from major programs--from \nMedicare, from homeless, from Head Start and all those that have been \narticulated--and we are going to commit endless billions of dollars to \nthis program with no end in sight. For that reason, Madam President, I \nrise in support of the Senator's amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I yield 8 minutes to the very \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio who comes to this body with a great \nknowledge of space and speaks on the basis of his personal knowledge, \nas well as his legislative experience.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank my distinguished colleague for his great, kind \nremarks.\n  Madam President, I think this country became what it is, largely \nbecause we were a research-oriented Nation.\n  We expressed our curiosity; curiosity became a way of life. We \napplied it to everything. We applied it to medicine, teaching, \nagriculture, government. How can we do things better? What new things \ncan we learn and put to use? One thing we have learned, even though \nevery time we set out for research it is \n\n[[Page S 14237]]\nnot a 100 percent home run, the money spent on research seems to almost \nalways have a way of coming back and giving us tremendous benefits not \nseen at the outset.\n  Here, for the first time in all the tens upon tens of thousands of \nyears of human history, we have the chance to do research away from the \nconfines of mother Earth. It is stimulating and interesting. I meet \nalmost daily with young people in school groups, who want to talk about \nthis. It has stimulated their curiosity, our work in space. I think it \nis much more than a childhood interest in wanting to fly. The space \nprogram is stimulating their interest in science, math, and \nexploration. Along with this interest, we are getting the benefits for \nfuture generations. Research in microgravity is in keeping with the \nlong American tradition of research in medicine, teaching, agriculture, \ngovernment, and continuing this curiosity that has been the hallmark of \nAmericans since our founding days.\n  The space station is the greatest international scientific \ncooperative effort ever put together. In addition to the very real \nimportance of international cooperation, there are very specific \nbenefits which will accrue to each one of us here. Now these benefits \nare not in areas like Velcro and Tang and some of the things we were \ntalking about on the floor here last night. All of those things were \ninvented long before the space program. So those were not benefits that \ncame out of this program.\n  But what we are talking about is very basic, fundamental research--\nresearch that may give us benefits in how we cope with osteoporosis, \nwhich causes hundreds of thousands of broken bones every year; it is a \nweakening of the human body. It may give us a new approach on colon \ncancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer. This is not theoretical now. \nWe are working with a bioreactor, which was mentioned by Senator \nMikulski a few moments ago.\n  We actually have tested a bioreactor in space successfully. Why is \nthat important? Because a bioreactor is capable of more accurately \nsimulating how tissues grow in the body than any other way of tissue \nculturing. If you experiment in a lab here on Earth using traditional \ntissue culturing mechanishm, the usual outcome is that the tissue \nsettles to the bottom of the test tube, or Petri dish, or whatever. In \nspace using a bioreactor, tissues grow in three dimensions, much more \nsimilar to what you find in the human body. As we have shown on the \nlast Space Shuttle flights that used the bioreactor, cultures can be \ngrown at least twice as large as any in a similar situation here on \nEarth. This could give us a whole new approach to colon cancer, breast \ncancer, and ovarian cancer. When you culture things like this in space \nand they grow to a larger size and you learn how to work with them \nbetter there and bring them back to Earth, it could give a whole new \napproach. AIDS, osteoporosis, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer are the \nchief focus of attention so far.\n  I ask, what if we have a new breakthrough in just one of those areas? \nIt may be worth everything spent on the whole space station program by \nitself if just one of these cultures coming back now--and we had \npictures of them on the floor yesterday--gives us a clue as to how to \ntake care of the problems of AIDS-HIV, ovarian cancer and breast \ncancer. Current digital technology gives us a 5 times more accurate \ndiagnosis of breast cancer over previous technologies. This exists \nright now because of the space program. So when we say there has not \nbeen anything coming out of this program, it is just not true.\n  Osteoporosis is another one that is particularly amenable to the \nresearch in space because that occurs in the astronauts at an \naccelerated rate over and above anything that occurs here on Earth. One \nof the major areas of research in biotechnology is to provide research \nresults that can revolutionize drug development. There are current \nprojects for AIDS and emphysema by major pharmaceutical firms.\n  I add, when the Station opponents say nobody wants these programs and \nthere is no basic support for the research here, that is just not true. \nMany companies and research laboratories --the National Research \nCouncil, Bristol-Myers Pharmaceutical Research Institute, and a policy \nadopted by the American Medical Association--support the space station. \nThere are also different medical centers, a whole list of them here. I \ndo not have time in my 8 minutes to go into them this morning.\n  In addition to biotechnology, biomedical, and biological research, \nmuscle and bone growth, NASA is aiding in the development of techniques \nfor counteracting the effects of aging, and on down the line--material \nscience, combustion science. At the last international consortium on \ncombustion, over 10 percent of the papers were given on findings out of \nthe space station. If we make a small step forward in combustion \nresearch, who knows what energy savings we can make here on Earth.\n  Another area is low temperature microgravity physics. These are \nthings that are of benefit right now, and they are not things that are \njust going to be looked at in the future. These things are in research \nand giving results right now.\n  As I said, I think money put into our research program in this \ncountry has paid off at the outset more than anything we have seen. \nRight now, our problem is that many of the companies that did basic \nresearch, and were willing to put money into the 5-, 10-, 15-, even the \n20-year programs, are cutting back. They are cutting back on the money \nthey are putting into research at the same time we are proposing that \nwe cut back on Government research. This, at a time when we are moving \ninto new international competition, where we need more research, more \nof the new, more curiosity in how we deal with these matters for the \nfuture, so that our children have the good jobs of the future right \nhere. Nothing is as stimulating to our children right now as this \ninterest in the space program and their interest in science and math \nand exploration. The space station literally has become symbolic of the \nUnited States and how we look at our future.\n  I will point out one other thing. There is about one-fourth of the \nspace station already built. We do not talk about that much. We have \nput together 50,000 pounds of this 400,000-pound station; 60,000 pounds \nalready has been put together by our allies that are working together \non this project. So we have about a little over one-fourth of the \nproject--the space station--that has already been built. So it is not \njust something that it theoretical out there, that if we chop the \nbudget, we save all the money. We do not. That is not the main reason \nfor going ahead with the program. The reason is the potential for \nresearch that we have for the future.\n  Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator is up.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 14 minutes. The \nSenator from Arkansas has 7 minutes 52 seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my distinguished colleague from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I first would like to deal with a \ncouple of rebuttals on issues that came up. The distinguished Senator \nfrom Arkansas talked about how Carl Sagan had opposed the space \nstation. I would like to bring to the Senate's attention that Carl \nSagan, since his book was published, has now endorsed the international \nspace station. We now have the endorsement of the Planetary Society. He \nalso talks about how the American Physical Society does not endorse the \nspace station. I would like to bring out that the Institute for \nElectrical and Electronic Engineers does; the American Astronautical \nSociety does; the AMA does; the American Women's Medical Association \ndoes.\n  Now, Madam President, I was once a skeptic of the space station. I, \ntoo, wonder if we were building this huge technological endeavor to be \na condo in the sky for astronauts to be able to jump to Mars. I no \nlonger share that belief. Why? First, on the drawing books is no plan \nor no budget for us to take manned space flights to Mars in this \ncentury. But there is a space station that is not going to be a condo \nfor astronauts, but it is going to be a space \n\n[[Page S 14238]]\nlab for American scientists and ingenuity. That is why I support it.\n  Now, like you, Madam President, I am a hands-on, get-out-and-about \ntype Senator. I did not want to make my mind up on the basis of memos \nand papers about pie-in-the-sky or space-station-in-the-sky activity. I \nwent down to Houston. I went to where they are actually working on what \nthe future of the space station is. I was impressed, and I came back a \npassionate supporter of the American space station because of its \nimpact on saving lives, saving jobs, and making sure that we have \nlifesaving devices and pharmaceuticals, and once again America has jobs \nin the scientific area but in the blue-collar manufacturing area.\n\n  I saw what are the projected activities for being able to do life \nscience and microgravity research.\n  Now critics could say, ``Point to one thing that the space station \nhas done in life science.'' We cannot because the space station is not \nyet flying. We can point to what NASA has already done in the area of \nmedical research and life science.\n  The Senator from Ohio, an astronaut Senator, has said it. Who are you \ngoing to believe? Some wonky report from a critic? Or are you going to \nbelieve one of the most famous Senators in the world?\n  I put my belief in John Glenn. I put my belief in what I saw at \nHouston. I put my belief in the fact that what NASA has already done is \ncome up with a pacemaker that can be programmed outside of the body, a \ncold suit which has been developed to improve the quality of life of MS \npatients. I could go on about other activities. NASA has a clear, \ndemonstrable record on what it has already done in life science. One \ncan only estimate what it will mean in the future.\n  We also have an international impact. We are not in this by \nourselves. We are in it with the Europeans, the Japanese, and the \nCanadians. We have a treaty relationship with them to build this space \nstation. To abrogate that responsibility puts at risk the credibility \nof the United States with its international partners.\n  I believe that is a mistake. Yes, the Russians are in it. We used to \ncompete with the Russians. Now we cooperate with the Russians to make \nsure that we make maximum use of our financial resources and maximum \nuse of our scientific capability.\n  Is this not what we dreamed about when the cold war came down? That \nwe would put our hand out with the Russians, and in the area of \ncivilian research that in no way weakens our national security, we \ncould put our best minds together? Is that not one of the dreams of the \ncold war, that by working in space out there we can further peace and \nscientific advancement here?\n  That is what America is all about. We are known for our social \ninventions, like our Constitution and our democratic framework, and our \ntechnological inventions. People come from around the world to do that.\n  Now, when we build the space station, we do not do it alone. We have \ninternational partners. We have the best minds here collaborating with \nthe best minds over there, to go into space, to come back and save \nthose jobs, save those lives, right here in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I am for the space station.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Dorgan and Senator Baucus be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  I tell you who I put my confidence in: Every physicist in America who \nsaid you cannot do one thing in space that you cannot do on Earth for a \nlot less money.\n  I put my faith in the guy who runs the Johnson Space Center. There \nwill be life sciences here, but we have not finalized that. Really, it \nis hard to answer that question. This is the man who runs the program.\n  I intentionally did not bore the Senate today with the myriad of \nhundreds of quotes from every physicist, virtually every medical \nresearcher in America, all of whom say that this is a terrible, \nterrible way to spend the taxpayers' money when it comes to research.\n  The Senator from Ohio, John Glenn, and I came to the Senate at the \nsame time. We have been close, steadfast friends ever since. There is \nnot anybody in the body for whom I have greater respect.\n  It pains me when we disagree, which we do strongly on this issue. I \nknow Senator Glenn's great talents. He is a genuine, certified America \nhero. But even Senator Glenn will only tell you what we hope to do.\n  I tell you, we have been hoping for 30 years. That is how long we \nhave been in space--30 years--and I am still waiting for somebody in \nthe Senate not to just talk about AIDS and cancer and multiple \nsclerosis, but to tell me what the space station has done. I can tell \nyou--zip, zero, for AIDS and cancer.\n  When it comes to women's health issue, I thank the Senator from Maine \nvery much for pointing out that nobody has been stronger for medical \nresearch in this country than I. I sit on the committee that \nappropriates money for the National Institutes of Health so I know how \nthey are starved to death. They are located in Maryland. They cannot \neven begin to get the money they need to do the research that needs to \nbe done.\n  When have you seen a story out of NIH on what we are doing on \nhepatitis? What we are doing on Lyme disease? Cancer? Chemotherapy? \nAlmost daily there are reports from the National Institutes of Health \non gigantic medical advancements.\n  I invite Members to tell me in 30 years when have you seen one single \nannouncement come about as to what we have done for the welfare of our \npeople from the space station.\n  I believe strongly in the space program. I will tell you that I \nbelieve strongly they are cutting back on space programs that I applaud \nand you applaud in order to make room for this thing which Newsweek \ncalled a boondoggle.\n  What is it for? Why, I have heard talk about children getting \nexcited. It is a new frontier. It is all those things. I get excited \nabout Apollo 13. I get excited when I see astronauts retrieving a \nsatellite. But that does not mean I have to take leave of my senses and \nvote for $100 billion project--$100 billion.\n  Do you know what children in this country are entitled to? They are \nentitled to grow up secure from crime on the streets. They are entitled \nto grow up not hungry. They are entitled to grow up with an education \nso they can do honest-to-God research when they are adults. They are \nentitled to grow up in a decent home that does not leak, that is warm \nin the wintertime.\n  What is the U.S. Congress doing? We are assaulting the children of \nthis Nation, cutting food stamps, cutting housing, cutting education. \nEducational loans will be cut $8 billion more over the next 7 years \nthan this thing will cost.\n  I look at it and I cannot believe it. I wonder, what kind of values \ndoes this place have? I believe in research. I believe in women's \nhealth issues. I defy anybody to show me where I ever voted against it. \nI do everything I possibly can from my position on the Health and Human \nResources Subcommittee on Appropriations.\n  Betty Bumpers has spent her entire public life taking advantage of \nthe fact that her husband was Governor and Senator to bring \nimmunization programs to every State in the Nation. The pharmaceutical \ncompanies of this country have been champs in the area. They have \ndeveloped new vaccines--not on the space station; they did it in their \nlaboratories.\n  I agree with Carl Sagan. I agree with every physicist in the country \nwho says there is only one rationale for the space station--that is to \ngo to Mars. If you want to go to Mars, fine. We went to the Moon.\n  I went down to the Johnson Space Center to see what we got. We got \nsome drillings. It was exciting. I got as teary eyed as any Member of \nthe Senate when Neil Armstrong stepped off, but I did not say I wanted \nto waste $100 billion because I am excited today, not at the expense of \nthe tremendous needs of this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  Madam President, we have had some very spirited debate. Let me \naddress some of the points that have been raised by my good friend, the \nSenator from Arkansas. \n\n[[Page S 14239]]\n\n  He has made very compelling arguments about how we have not learned \nanything from the space station. Small wonder, when we have not built \nthe space station. It is not up there yet. It has not done anything \nyet. We have had successes exploring in space but we have not built a \nspace station.\n  The people would have been up there who are doing research said we \nneed to have that permanent presence in space so we can find out over \ntime how these experiments work. That is the whole purpose. If we \napplied that test to all basic research, that you cannot support basic \nresearch until you show what it has done, we would be shutting down \nfederally funded facilities at universities and every other scientific \norganization because you do not know what you will get from basic \nresearch until you get there.\n  Certainly, I will go with the scientists who are planning on the \nexperiments that will take the time that a space station can afford \nthem to determine what the impact of microgravity and the other \nexigencies of space produce in scientific research.\n  Now, the question is raised about the National Institutes of Health. \nNASA and NIH have executed 18 cooperative agreements since 1992, and \njoint activities have included scientific workshops, ground-based and \nflight investigations, other specialized activities such as the space \nline reference system developed by the National Library of Medicine. \nNASA expects an expanding level of cooperation with NIH as research \nenters the space station era.\n  NIH researchers are expected to use the space station's next \ngeneration life-support sciences facilities, including the human \nresearch facility, the gravitational biology facility, and the \ncentrifuge facility in pursuit of national biomedical research goals.\n  We have heard the figure bandied about that the space station costs \n$94 billion. More than half of that, to be quite frank with my \ncolleagues, to set the record straight, comes from the shuttle. That is \nhow we get up there. That is costing $50 billion. I hope the objective \nof this amendment is not to kill the space shuttle and kill all space \nresearch. I think that would be a double tragedy. Recall that the total \n$94 billion not only funds the shuttle, it funds the building and the \noperation of the space station. We do not justify other programs this \nway by saying the total cost of 20 years of operations is such. We talk \nabout the yearly cost. We could have tremendous figures if you took any \nprogram and built the continuing costs over years. We judge them on an \noperational year-by-year cost.\n  This idea that we are going to make great savings overlooks the \ntremendous potential for great contributions to our scientific and \nengineering knowledge from the space station.\n  Yesterday, my good friend from Arkansas quoted extensively from Carl \nSagan and quoted all the arguments that Carl Sagan had made to support \nthe position of the Senator from Arkansas that we ought to cancel the \nspace station. The Senator from Maryland said it very well. But let me \njust quote from a letter dated July 24, 1995, from the same Carl Sagan. \nHe said:\n\n       For Congress to cancel the space station now would cause \n     huge disruptions in many local and regional economies, and, \n     worse yet, it would scar our national psyche. It would end \n     the rationale for America's manned space program, and with it \n     would die some of the spirit of a great nation bold enough to \n     seek great achievements.\n\n  Madam President, it would be a tragedy, an utter tragedy, to kill the \nspace station. It is the most ambitious and exciting program since the \nApollo program of over 25 years ago.\n  I, with my son, enjoyed the smashing success this year of the movie, \n``Apollo 13,'' that drew in millions of people--those who recall those \nglory days, a time when America set ambitious goals and moved to \naccomplish it; and those who are too young to have lived through those \nheydays yet are naturally drawn by its spirit of exploration, bravery, \nand discovery. That is the spirit that made America great.\n  The international space station will mark America's next great step \nin this endeavor. The station will become a visible symbol of our \ncommitment to the future as our children will watch it move elegantly \nacross the nightly sky.\n  Although the space station has many of the same characteristics as \nthe Apollo program, it is also different in important ways. The Apollo \nprogram was motivated by the cold-war need to beat the Russians to the \nmoon. Space station, in contrast, will involve the cooperation of 13 \nnations, making it the largest cooperative science program in history. \nThe international partners have spend billions on the program to date. \nInstead of beating the Russians, we will be working closely with them \nto build a better, more robust orbital laboratory.\n  It is time to stop with these incessant attempts to kill the space \nstation. Over the last 4 years, there have been 13 attempts in the \nHouse and Senate to kill the program and all have fortunately failed. \nLast year, a resounding 64 senators voted against this amendment and I \namong them. The arguments used by station opponents this year are the \nsame old, tired arguments that have been used in years past--the claims \nwere not true then, and they are not true now. Here are some of the \nfacts:\n  First, the space station is no longer a dream but a reality. Thanks \nto prior year congressional commitments, the program has finally \nentered a period of stability. After a tumultuous decade, NASA has a \ndesign and schedule that work. There is not talk of redesigns or \nrestructuring today, only building hardware. About 50,000 pounds of \nhardware have been built already. Some 75,000 pounds of hardware will \nbe built by the end of 1995. The final contract has been signed between \nAmerican and Russian companies for the first piece of the space \nstation--the FGB module--scheduled for launch in November 1997. \nConstruction is underway in Moscow.\n  Second, the space station is perfectly on schedule and on budget. \nNASA has kept its promise to maintain the first element launch in \nNovember 1997, and at a total cost of $17.4 billion through the end of \nconstruction in 2002. The space station has successfully gone through \nits first incremental design review. NASA has identified no technical \nshow-stoppers to building this space station.\n  Third, a streamlined management team is in place. NASA has reduced \nits in-house work force on the program by 1,000 people--from 2,300 to \n1,300--and is managing the program better than ever. NASA and the space \nstation's prime contractor, Boeing, signed a $5.63 billion contract \nearlier this year to build the space station. This contract reflects \nNASA's new procurement philosophy of motivating contractors to avoid \ncost growth, and includes incentives for getting the job done for less \nthan the target cost, and penalties if there are overruns. This is \nexactly the kind of procurement reform that's needed.\n  Fourth, cooperation with Russia is working as planned. NASA has made \ntwo space shuttle flights to Russia's Mir space station already this \nyear. The first shuttle rendezvoused with Mir, and the second docked \nwith it--the first United States-Russian docking in 20 years. These \nflights proved not only the technical feasibility of our two countries \nworking together in space, but the political feasibility as well. With \neach of these flights--and another is scheduled in 6 weeks--we learn \nmore about working together and overcoming technical and cultural \nbarriers. The inclusion of Russia will enable space station to be \ncompleted 15 months earlier than the previous design and have more crew \nand more research volume--all at a savings of approximately $2 billion \nto United States taxpayers.\n  Fifth, this program is not a budget buster. It fits within the budget \nresolution. The House version of the budget resolution specifically \nincluded space station funding all the way to the end of construction \nin 2002, and the conference agreement with this body provides $2 \nbillion more in function 250 than the House did. We can balance the \nbudget and invest in the future.\n  Sixth, space station will not undermine the balance among NASA \nprograms in human spaceflight, science, technology, and aeronautics. \nThis very bill shows how NASA can afford space station, Mission to \nPlanet Earth, new aircraft technology, a new reusable launch vehicle, \nand a host of other programs, while maintaining that balance--which is \nso crucial to NASA's future. With the zero-base review \n\n[[Page S 14240]]\nchanges that NASA is now implementing, NASA can afford this program, \nand so can the Nation.\n  This country must continue to invest in the future. A research \nlaboratory in space can provide unimaginable benefits to the American \npeople. The space station is the only facility where research can be \nconducted for long durations in microgravity. This unique environment \nhas only begun to be explored scientifically. American taxpayers are \ncertain to benefit, just as they have from other basic research, and \nprobably in ways we least expect.\n  This amendment to terminate the space station threatens the very \nexistence of the U.S. human space flight program and would abdicate \nU.S. world leadership in the largest international science project in \nhistory. With only 2 years left before the first launch, I hope this \nwill be the last of a long line of attempts to end this program and its \ndefeat will send a strong message of commitment to finish the job we've \nstarted. I strongly oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I ask for an additional 2 minutes for a \ntotal of 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, what is the time remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes fifty-three seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask for an additional 2 minutes on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas will have 4 minutes, and 2 minutes will be \nadded to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, the Senator from Missouri, who is my \ngood friend, says the Senator from Arkansas is making the same old \ntired arguments that he has made every year. He is absolutely right. A \ngood argument against the space station is like a value. It does not \nlose its power just because time elapses. The same arguments that I \nmade against the space station 6 years ago are just as compelling today \nas they were 6 years ago.\n  We talk about the Russians participating and how wonderful \ninternational cooperation is. You think about that. The reason the \nRussians are cooperating is because we are going to give them the money \nto cooperate. So much for their cooperation. The Italians and the \nCanadians are cutting their contributions, and Germany and France are \ndiscussing reformulating their contribution to the space station. Why \nnot? They know the United States will pay the difference.\n  Madam President, here is a quote that says it all. James Van Allen, \nastrophysicist, discoverer of the Van Allen radiation belt, a premier \nphysicist, said:\n\n       With the benefit of over three decades of experience in \n     space flight, it is now clear that the conduct of scientific \n     and application missions in space by human crews is of very \n     limited value.\n\n  That is echoed by every premier scientist and physicist in America.\n  Dr. Van Allen goes on to say:\n\n       For almost all scientific and utilitarian purposes a human \n     crew in space is neither necessary nor significantly useful.\n\n  Dr. Bloembergen says that human crews are inconsistent with most \nmicrogravity research. But I want my colleagues to answer this one \nquestion. What is it about space and no gravity that makes it so \nfascinating for medical research, or the development of new crystals \nfor our computer industry? I do not know the answer. But I rely on \nthose who do. They say there is none. Dr. Van Allen, and Dr. Park, who \nis a leader of the 40,000 physicists in the American Physical Society \nsay none. Do you know what else they say? Much of the research for \nmicrogravity, if it has any beneficial value, can be done on Earth \nwhich brings me to my final point, and then I will yield the floor and \nI will not say another word about this.\n  You ask yourself. What do you think is more important? The planet \nEarth or going to the planet Mars? That is all this is about. Carl \nSagan and all of them say that, if you want to go to Mars, then build a \nspace station. If you do not, do not. You ask yourself about the needs \nof the children of America, about their food and their education and \ntheir clothing and their housing. They are crying on the streets. Ask \nyourself about the health care of our elderly. The needs are growing, \nbut the funding is being cut. That is all happening on the planet \nEarth. The problems are not cosmic. The problems are here on Earth. You \nwant to go to Mars? Be my guest. But for God sakes, do not do it when \nwe have these unbelievable problems that are growing daily, that $94 \nbillion would go an awful long way to cure.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Madam President, my good friend from Arkansas asked to know who, with \nany knowledge of research or interest in scientific exploration, would \nsupport this. I ask unanimous consent to include statements from the \nPlanetary Society, Bristol Myers-Squibb Pharmaceutical Research \nInstitute, the American Medical Association, Mount Sinai Medical \nAssociation, Schering-Plough Research Institute, American Medical \nWomen's Association, Baylor College of Medicine, Hauptman-Woodward \nMedical Research Institute, and the Multiple Sclerosis Association of \nAmerica in the Record to answer the concerns of my colleague from \nArkansas.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n What the Nation's Leading Researchers and Scientists Are Saying About \n                    the International Space Station\n\n       Several years ago, Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray and I (the \n     officers of The Planetary Society) opposed the then-space \n     station plan as serving no national purpose. The present plan \n     is serving national and international interests. For Congress \n     to cancel the space station now would end the rationale for \n     America's manned space program, and with it would die the \n     spirit of a great nation bold enough to seek great \n     achievements.--Carl Sagan and Louis Friedman, The Planetary \n     Society.\n       The program of protein crystal growth experiments sponsored \n     by NASA has been one of the real success stories in \n     microgravity sciences and applications. Protein crystal \n     growth research has made much progress, but must now move to \n     the next phase, which requires prolonged access to a \n     microgravity environment with potential for human \n     intervention on a continuing basis. This new phase will \n     require an orbiting platform such as that provided by the \n     International Space Station.--Howard M. Einspahr, Bristol-\n     Myers-Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute.\n       The AMA supports the continuation of the NASA and other \n     programs for conducting medical research and other research \n     with potential health care benefits on manned space flights, \n     including the continued development and subsequent operation \n     of the international space station.--Policy Adopted by the \n     American Medical Association.\n       Through the NASA-NIH linkage, the Space Station has become \n     a vitally important and unique laboratory for biomedical \n     research. In addition to its central role in aerospace \n     engineering and space exploration, the Space Station is an \n     investment in the future of biomedical research.--John W. \n     Rowe, M.D., Mount Sinai Medical Center.\n       A commitment to conduct continuous research for longer \n     periods of time in space is also essential. Ultimately, our \n     hope is to be able to crystallize proteins in microgravity, \n     conduct all x-ray data collection experiments in Space and \n     transmit the data to earth for processing. This can only be \n     done in a Space Station.--T. L. Nagabhushan, Ph.D., Schering-\n     Plough Research Institute.\n       AMWA supports the continuation of funding for NASA's \n     International Space Station because it provides one of the \n     most promising new vistas for medical research on diseases \n     that strike women and have unknown causes or cures.--Dianna \n     L. Dell, M.D., American Medical Women's Association.\n       Space laboratories allow scientific experiments that simply \n     cannot be duplicated on Earth. The space station offers the \n     potential of long term studies that are especially exciting \n     to the biomedical researchers seeking to understand how cells \n     grow, divide, and mutate to cause diseases such as cancer and \n     immune deficiencies.--William T. Butler, M.D., Baylor College \n     of Medicine.\n       My institute has worked closely with the Center for \n     Macromolecular Crystallography at the University of Alabama \n     at Birmingham to perform two space shuttle crystal growth \n     experiments on the protein recombinant human insulin. It is \n     clear that with the additional capabilities that the Space \n     Station will offer, this type of research will progress at a \n     much more rapid rate. It is also evident to me that the Space \n     Station will offer similar advantages for the many other \n     areas of science that have been proposed for this unique \n     facility.--Herbert A. Hauptman, Ph.D., Nobel Laureate, Pres., \n     Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute. \n\n[[Page S 14241]]\n\n       NASA's ``cool suit'' literally has changed the lives of \n     some of those suffering from MS. The MSAA is hopeful, as new \n     findings continue to emerge from space-based research and the \n     possibilities that the International Space Station holds. \n     This research could be essential to MS patients.--John G. \n     Hodson, Sr., Multiple Sclerosis Association of America.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I also note that our very distinguished physician Member is \npresent. I yield to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the space station, and \nI hope to add to this debate with insights from what is a unique \nperspective in this body, that of physician and researcher. Until I was \nelected to represent the State of Tennessee in the Senate, I spent my \nadult life dealing with the daily reality of illness and the \nlimitations of our ability, as humans, to diagnose and treat those \nillnesses and to save lives. The limitations I faced as a physician and \nsurgeon were numerous: Limitations on the ability of the body to heal \nitself; limitations on the treatments and medicines to augment the \nbody's immune system and healing process; limitations on the scope and \neffectiveness of biomedical technology in detecting, diagnosing, and \ntreating an illness; and, finally, limitations in funding. It is this \nfinal limitation which now drives this current debate on the value of \nthe space station.\n  My colleague from Arkansas has claimed many things in his \nintroduction of his amendment, not the least of which is a consensus in \nthe scientific community that the possible rewards of space-based \nresearch are minuscule and do not justify the costs incurred. The \nSenator says that, ``every physicist and physician in the country says \nit is nonsense'' to expect advances in medicine from space-based or \nmicrogravity research. I disagree. As one physician who believes we can \nreap great rewards from spaced-based research, I suggest that such a \nstatement is untrue. As a member of the medical community, who is \nfamiliar with the opinions on research within that community, I can \ntell you that there are plenty of researchers and physicians who do not \nbelieve in the merits of microgravity research, and the Senator from \nArkansas has quoted several of them. As a member of the medical \ncommunity and of the Senate, I can tell you that it is, by no means, \nevery one. I dare say that for as many reputable scientists in America \nthat do not believe in the value of space-based medical research, we \ncould easily find two who hold the opposite opinion, and many of them \nhave contacted me.\n  I stated moments ago that this debate is about money. The Senator \nfrom Arkansas says the debate is about priorities. I believe that on \nthis point, we are in agreement, and we are both correct. However, the \nconclusions we would draw are markedly different.\n  Funding for the space station is has been characterized as being \nbased on skewed priorities: that this money is better spent on housing, \nlaw enforcement, and any other number of pressing domestic needs. The \nimplication is that we are facing a zero-sum game where the space \nstation is funded at the expense of the poor, of the elderly, or of the \nsick. That, too, is untrue. We in Congress are funding billions and \nbillions of dollars worth of programs for the poor, sick, and elderly \njust this year--maybe even more than our constituents want us to \nspend--and we see only rare successes from these grandiose social \nprograms.\n  I believe that, in fact, funding for the continuation of the space \nstation is exactly where our priorities should be: trying to achieve a \nbetter quality of life for Americans and, potentially, for all humans.\n  I would also take a moment to address the question of what has been \nachieved on space platforms so far, and what the goal of establishing \nthe space station would be. I am speaking almost solely in terms of \nmedical research. The Soviets, and the Russians in turn, have taught us \nquite a bit so far in terms of achieving the engineering feat the space \nstation will be. They have also collected massive amounts of \ninformation on the effects on the human body of the effects of extended \nweightlessness. Finally, they have saved us millions of dollars and \nyears of research if, in fact, we would want to launch a mission to \nMars from a semipermanent platform in space.\n  But what is more important to this debate is the fact that the \nRussians have, admittedly, taught us very little about medical research \nin space. Why? Not because they were not seeing the results they wanted \nto from their research in space, but because the medical research the \nRussians were conducting in space lacked the quality and priority our \nown space-based medical research would enjoy. The Russians simply do \nnot have the medical infrastructure to support the type of research I \nam talking about, and they have not made such research a priority on \nthe Mir space station. It is no wonder that some of the most \nenthusiastic supporters of the cooperative space station program are \nRussians--not because they see a cash cow in our ventures--rather, \nbecause they believe that, finally, the infrastructure and commitment \nto conduct medical research in space will finally be available.\n  Mr. President, the benefits and advancements in medical science and \ntechnology we can realize from long-term space-based research can be \ndivided into three simple categories: First, that which we know is \nimmediately or soon achievable; second, those which we can speculate \nabout or make an educated guess as to the new possibilities of space-\nbased research; and third, those achievements and advancements which we \ncannot even begin to assess.\n  I will first address the immediate and near term benefits the space \nstation can provide in the field of biomedical and life science \nresearch.\n  Support for the space station and space-based research continues to \ngrow throughout the medical and research community: the American \nMedical Association, Schering-Plough Research Institute, the Multiple \nSclerosis Association of America, the American Medical Women's \nAssociation, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Mount Sinai Medical Center, to \nname a few.\n  Space-based research provides unique insights to advance our \nunderstanding of the heart and lungs, cardio- \npulmonary research; the growth and maintenance of muscle and bone, \nmusclo-skeletal research; the body's ability to sense position and \nmaintain balance, neurovestibular research; and the regulation of the \nmetabolism, regulatory physiology.\n  Space-based researchers can conduct basic and applied research to \nimprove the efficiency and reliability of life support systems, such as \nartificial heart valves and pacemakers, or artificial kidneys.\n  Space-based research can provide knowledge of protein crystal growth \nphysics and kinetics which may lead to improvements in Earth-based \ncrystal growth technology and more effective pharmaceutical \ndevelopment.\n  Another benefit can be realized when using conventional bioreactors \nto culture human cells for cancer research and drug testing because \ncultured cells do not grow in ways representative of how cells develop \nin the human body. In the NASA bioreactor, cells taken from a cancer \ntumor grow and resemble the original tumor, making a much more accurate \nculture available for researchers.\n  Additionally, techniques developed for use aboard the space station \ncould advance the state-of-the-art growth of tissue samples in the \nlaboratory, thus leading to inestimable benefits for medical research.\n  Mr. President, this is only an abbreviated list of the immediate and \nnear term benefits medicine will experience from space-based research.\n  Those benefits to medical research about which we can now only \nspeculate are possibly the most exciting and promising of the space \nstation's contributions. The benefits of advanced crystal growth \nstudies; the ability to observe cell mutation and behavior over the \nlong term, without the effects of gravity; and the possibility of \nadvanced artificial human tissue growth are extraordinary. The \nimplications of the possibilities are nearly limitless: anything from \ncures for cancers and other deadly or debilitating disease, to the \ndevelopment of medicines that have crystallin structures which could \nnot be achieved in gravity, to the growth of tissues to replace losses \nwhich would normally kill someone.\n  If need be, Mr. President, we can place an actual rough dollar value \non \n\n[[Page S 14242]]\nsuch advancements by simply adding up the cost to our economy each year \nincurred by illnesses and loss of life. Personally, I think that is \nrather macabre and beside the point. I believe that the value we can \nplace on the known benefits of space-based medical research clearly \noutweigh the costs we now will assume to make the space station a \nreality. If you were to apply a cost-benefit analysis to the space \nstation--as we have rightly applied to many federally-funded programs--\nI believe it would yield a cost to benefit ratio which could end this \ndebate for good.\n  Finally, Mr. President, there are advancements in space-based medical \nresearch which defy both quantification and even qualification in this \ndebate. These are the advancements in medical science which we cannot \neven foresee--those which will become hints or reality only when we are \nallowed to explore them fully.\n  Some will say these yet-to-be-seen advancements are nothing more than \nfairy tales, or promises wildly beyond what we can possibly deliver, or \neven myths produced in an attempt to justify costs which those of us \nwho back the space station cannot currently justify.\n  However, I will remind my colleagues that throughout history it has \nbeen the unforeseen, unplanned benefits of technological advancement \nthat have most often proven to be our greatest rewards. I believe that \neven the possibilities of such watersheds in advancement of medical \nscience and unforeseen benefits are compelling enough to pursue the \nprogram further. Just as the medieval scholars could not speculate on \nthe profound changes and advancements of the upcoming Renaissance, we \ncannot even guess what we might soon discover.\n  Mr. President, I believe we truly are approaching a renaissance in \nmedicine and technology with the advent of space-based research, and it \nis exciting as a physician, as well as simply on a human level, to know \nthat much of these advancements could come within my lifetime or those \nof my children.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that not only can we make a direct \nlink between space-based research and improvements in the human \ncondition and quality of life, but also, I feel, we can be confident \nthat some of the greatest benefits and advancements have yet to be \nseen.\n  I believe that advancing the space station program is not pie in the \nsky, so to speak, but money very well spent. It represents the \nopportunity for great advancements in our quality of life and an \nunparalleled opportunity for international cooperation. I believe that \nwe have made many difficult but correct decisions concerning the \nfunding of the space program and space-based research specifically, and \nI urge my colleagues to continue that series of good decisions by \ndefeating the Bumpers amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator \nBumpers, in support of the amendment we have placed before the Senate \nand is the pending amendment.\n  Senator Bumpers and I have collaborated in the past to eliminate \nFederal projects that the Federal taxpayers simply cannot afford in \nthese tight budgetary constraints. We were successful in halting \nFederal funding for the super collider, a project whose astronomical \nexpense made it a simply unfeasible program in this era of tight \nbudgets.\n  Mr. President, at a time when Congress is struggling to balance the \nFederal budget, we think it is irresponsible to exempt from any cuts \nNASA's $90 billion-plus program to complete the building of a space \nstation.\n  There are genuine questions about whether this space station can be \nbuilt on the schedule and for the cost that NASA currently claims. \nSchedule and costs are inextricably connected. If the schedule is not \nmet, then the costs will increase.\n  There is a major and fundamental question here. Can the timetable to \nbuild the station, with all of the spacewalks that will be needed to \nassemble the structure, be achieved on schedule?\n  Mr. President, NASA is expecting 73 launches to take place on time \nand in sequence over 55 months. Flexibility will not be possible \nbecause each flight will bring a specific piece of hardware that must \nbe attached in a specific order. The assembly sequence cannot endure \nmanufacturing delays, launch delays or launch failures.\n  I remind my colleagues, that delays mean more costs.\n  Mr. President, the number of spacewalks needed to assemble the space \nstation has risen significantly in the past year. Reliance on these \nwalks increases the risk that the timetable to build the structure will \nnot be achieved. Thus, building the space station will be a very risky \nendeavor given the demanding schedule to complete the station and have \nit permanently occupied by 1998.\n  Mr. President, Russia and Canada are to have major roles in the \ntimely development of the space station. Yet, the involvement of these \ntwo nations adds critical elements of risk.\n  NASA assumes that, with one exception Russia will provide its \nhardware and services as a partner, on a no-exchange-of-funds basis. At \nthis time, it may be premature to assume that Russia will not charge \nfor anything given the economic problems confronting the country.\n  Canada has cut back its contribution to the space station program and \nwill not decide until 1997 whether to build the final portion of the \nrobotic servicing system that will be used in assembling and \nmaintaining the station. Canada is building the arm, but has not \ndecided on whether to build the special purpose dextrous manipulator \nthat fits at the end of the arm--the fingers. If Canada does not build \nthe fingers, then NASA will have to find the funds to build this \nexpensive piece of equipment.\n  Mr. President, the price tag today for this project is $93.9 billion. \nI have no doubt that this figure will be increasing dramatically once \nmore hardware is built, space shuttle launches are delayed, spacewalks \nare increased, and the Russians and Canadians fail to live up to their \ncommitments.\n  Total spending on the space station from 1985 to 1993 added up to \nabout $11.2 billion, and all we have to show for this are diagrams and \ndesigns.\n  Mr. President, it is time for Congress to cancel funding of the space \nstation. Let us not embark on an elaborate and expensive journey into \nspace until we meet the challenges confronting American taxpayers on \nEarth.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Bumpers \namendment to terminate funding for the space station. It seems to me \nthat we have answered the question of whether or not to proceed with \nthis historic endeavor. Year after year the Congress has endorsed the \noutreach to space. And we have done so for the right reasons--the space \nstation represents the next logical step of man's exploration of the \nuniverse and it represents the next logical step for understanding our \nown world.\n  I will not try and reiterate the many sound reasons for continuing \nthis important program. They have been presented in great and \ncompelling detail. But I would offer another reason which was recently \nbrought to my attention by Ambassador Pickering, our envoy to Russia. \nClearly the Russians are in dire need of hard currency. Should the \nUnited States default on our commitment of cooperation with Russia on \nthis project, Russia will necessarily look elsewhere--to Iran or Iraq--\nnations who have demonstrated a clear desire to possess and proliferate \ntechnology and weapons of mass destruction. Cooperation with the United \nStates on space station is vital to Russian needs for hard currency. \nAnd the United States will get fare more in exchange--both in \ntechnology and in stability.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to reject the Bumpers amendment, preserve \nour outreach to the stars, and keep a mindful eye on commitments made \nfor the purpose of keeping peace and stability in these difficult \ntimes.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered by \nthe senior Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. President, once again we find ourselves debating the merits of \nthe space station. The distinguished Senator from Arkansas again tells \nus that America should abandon its commitment as the leader of this \nhistoric endeavor.\n  Supporters of this amendment say we simply cannot afford to continue \nfunding the space station. Mr. President, I ask you, Can we afford not \nto? \n\n[[Page S 14243]]\n\n  History tells us that mankind is destined to explore beyond the \nbounds of this tiny planet. The question is not whether we should take \nthe next logical step. The question is: ``Will we lead or will we \nfollow?'' I believe the United States is destined to lead.\n  Leadership, Mr. President, requires commitment. America's relatively \nsmall investment in the space station demonstrates our commitment to \nthe future of technology in space. It also demonstrates our commitment \nto our international partners who have joined with us to make this \ndream a reality.\n  Abandoning the space station at this late date not only squanders our \ninitial investment, but it tells our partners that they can no longer \ndepend on us to meet our commitment to international space exploration. \nOur credibility among the space faring nations depends on our actions \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, a leader must also have vision and vision is \nmeaningless without the courage to fulfill its promise. When we began \nfunding this project, we set out on a journey that held out great \npromise and it continues to do so. Again, we hear from those who do not \nshare our vision and are content to quit.\n  Opponents suggest that the space station costs more than it is worth \nand that we should therefore stop funding it now and redistribute that \nmoney to more pressing social programs. Not only do they fail to \nrecognize the enormous potential of space research and exploration, but \nthey are content to sacrifice the promise of a better tomorrow for the \nfailed programs of today.\n  Mr. President, one of the most important Federal priorities of any \ngovernment is to create opportunities for a better life in the future. \nWe can not effectively do that anymore by just pumping money into life \non Earth today. We must look ahead. We must search for ways to sustain \nour society, our culture, our life into tomorrow. The space station \nholds that promise.\n  Mr. President, the space station has a legitimate mission, an \nimpressive design and a plan to achieve its goals. Granted, it has had \nits difficulties, but all great endeavors will meet with obstacles. \nAlthough the space station faces more challenges, NASA is prepared now, \nmore than ever, to meet those challenges. This unprecedented example of \ninternational cooperation is now on schedule, on budget and is worthy \nof our support.\n  So, I ask my colleagues that share the vision of space exploration to \njoin me in reaffirming our country's commitment to our future by \nopposing this shortsighted attempt to strip funding from the space \nstation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \ninternational space station and in opposition to the amendment offered \nby my colleague, Senator Bumpers. The space station is not only a \nvaluable scientific program, but it is a symbol of our Nation's \ncommitment to investing in the future.\n  More than a quarter of a century ago, the most awe-inspiring words \nwere uttered by Neil Armstrong, ``That's one small step for man, one \ngiant leap for mankind.'' Those words, delivered from the Moon's \nsurface when the Apollo 11 lunar module landed in 1969, resounded \naround the globe. Each and every American whose ears were graced with \nthat message, was filled with pride and honor.\n  That day in our past served as an inspiration. It showcased the \ntechnological leadership of the United States, the great will of the \nAmerican people, and the courage of our space pioneers which combined \nto produce a defining moment in history. That mission set the stage for \nseveral other Apollo missions which sent astronauts to the Moon. It \nserved as a precursor to Skylab, the first U.S. space station, launched \nin the early 1970's. And, it led the way for the space shuttle program.\n  With each mission, we learn more and more about life sciences, \nmaterials sciences, Earth sciences, engineering research and \ntechnology, and commercial development. Also with each new mission we \nexplore the unknown and make discoveries that ultimately help improve \nlife here on Earth.\n  The international space station will have a laboratory to conduct \nexperiments and do research on a wide variety of subjects. Astronauts \nwill be able to conduct long-duration microgravity investigations, \nwhich will allow scientists to look deeper into the mechanics of cell \nfunctions, combustion, liquid behavior, crystallization, and electro-\nmagnetics. In addition, research that would take place on the space \nstation could lead to cures for life-threatening diseases, lower \npharmaceutical costs, and better prepare astronauts for the rigors of \nspace travel.\n  Opponents of the space station argue that these justifications for \nthe space station cannot hold up to scrutiny. They suggest that \neconomic and scientific spinoffs are not applicable for life here on \nEarth. In fact, the opposite is true. Scientific research and \nexperiments conducted on the international space station do have real \nlife applications here on Earth. Space-based research has led to a \nvariety of innovations and technological advances that have, and \ncontinue to benefit people every day. Included among them are: Long-\ndistance telephone networks; international TV broadcasts; car chassis \nand brake designs; heart monitors for ambulances; structural designs \nfor bridges; laser surgery in hospitals; programmable pacemakers; \nnavigational systems for airplanes; and long-range weather \nforecasting--just to name a few.\n  Research conducted on the space station will have other important \napplications in the lives of average Americans. In the biotechnology \nfield, scientists on the international space station will conduct \nresearch on tissue culture studies to gain knowledge of normal and \ncancerous tissue development and to discover treatments and cures to \ndiseases. They will also study protein crystal growth to design \npharmaceuticals which block proteins which could lead to the \ndevelopment of an AIDS vaccine or cure. Additionally, research on \ndroplet/pool burning will help improve understanding of fire \npropagation for improved fire safety.\n  The field of fluid physics will also benefit. Scientists will conduct \nresearch on interface dynamics to improve industrial films and \ncoatings, oil spill recovery techniques, tracking of ground water \ncontaminants, and processing of semiconductor crystals. At the same \ntime, their research will cover cloud formation microphysics, which is \nuseful to meteorologists for improved weather predictions.\n  Scientists will study electronic materials to investigate the vapor \nphase of crystal growth. This will help produce much higher efficiency \nand density optoelectronics for the communications industry. Also, \nepitaxy liquid phase molecular and beam vapor phase will be studied to \nevaluate high speed switching devices and high density memory. This \nwill help to produce smaller, more affordable super computers.\n  Scientists will also study environmental health to develop improved \nair and water quality sensors, analyzers, and filtering devices. In \naddition, they will examine automated microbiology systems which \nenhance identification of bacteria population. They will conduct \nengineering research and technology development to support enhanced \ndesigns for firefighting suits, toxic waste cleanup suits, and deep sea \ndivers equipment.\n  It is clear that scientific research and experiments like those \nlisted above have real life applications here on Earth. At the same \ntime, investments in space create valuable economic returns as well. \nEach dollar invested in space programs yields up to $9 in new products, \ntechnologies, and processes here at home.\n  The international space station program also generates more than \n14,000 direct jobs--5,400 of them in my home State of California. \nIndirectly, 40,000 jobs nationwide have been created because of space \nstation-related activities. At a time when the country--and California \nin particular--has been impacted by defense downsizing and base \nclosures, the space station is an important source of economic \nactivity. It is defense conversion at its best and creates new jobs for \nformer defense and aerospace workers.\n  Aside from the enormous benefits to science, medical research, and \ntechnology, the space station helps to maintain U.S. leadership in \nspace and enhances global competitiveness. It also serves as a source \nof inspiration and encouragement for our children, fostering the next \ngeneration of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs. \n\n[[Page S 14244]]\n\n  As a powerful symbol of U.S. leadership in a changing world, the \nspace station represents an international commitment. Our original \ninternational partners--Japan, Canada, and Europe--have already \ncommitted $9 billion to the space station program, and are counting on \nAmerica's continued leadership in space.\n  Moreover, with the Russians added to the international partnership, \nthe space station has proven to be a test bed for scientific research \nand technological development, while uniting former adversaries in \npeaceful cooperation. Just 6 years ago, this would have been \nunthinkable.\n  By asking Russia to join the international space station, the United \nStates can channel the Russian aerospace industry into nonmilitary \npursuits. This gives us more leverage to reduce the risk of nuclear \nproliferation and enhances the United States goals of private sector \ndevelopment and demilitarization in Russia. In addition, an \ninternational space station will use existing Russian space technology, \ncapability, expertise, and hardware to build a better space station for \nless money.\n  In closing, I would like for you to imagine, if you would, had the \nearly pioneers not forged west to explore the frontier. If, for \ninstance, in 1803 the Louisiana Purchase had not been completed for $15 \nmillion--which at that time was a large sum of money. The frontier \npurchased in that deal now includes 15 States and generates $200 \nbillion in Federal taxes annually. The returns on that investment have \nmore than paid for the original purchase.\n  Let us, for a moment, consider Alaska, which, in 1867, was purchased \nfor $7.2 million. At the time it was purchased, Secretary of State \nSeward was derided and mocked for negotiating the terms with Russia. \nNow, we know that Alaska's oil reserves exceed $125 billion, and no one \nhas stepped forward to suggest we reverse that transaction.\n  The United States must continue its exploration in space with the \nnext logical step--a permanently staffed space station. The \ninternational space station will lead the world toward great advances \nin space exploration. At present, all of the returns on our investment \nin space have yet to reach fruition. We have yet to realize all the \ntreasures that are held within the vast resources of space. We have \nlearned, however, of its benefits to science and medical research. We \nknow that it bolsters global competitiveness and U.S. leadership in \nspace. We are also aware of its economic spinoffs, job creating \ncapacity and source of inspiration to future generations. I am \nconfident that this research will continue to exceed our imaginative \ngrasp and reap real benefits that are applicable here on Earth.\n  For these reasons, I strongly support the international space station \nand urge my colleagues to oppose the Bumpers smendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the space program is an investment in our \nNation's future. A commitment to continued space exploration means a \ncommitment to providing for the prosperity and wealth of future \ngenerations. No one can predict the exact outcome of our investment in \nthe international space station, but I believe that the continued \nexploration of space will present many positive opportunities.\n  First, the space program will provide significant contributions to \nthe well-being of mankind, both in America and around the world. We \nhave already seen the results of space-related research in life \nsciences, and the potential for expansion and further development is \nvirtually limitless.\n  Second, we must consider our Nation's leadership role in high-\ntechnology activities and international competitiveness. The areospace \nindustry is a significant area of international competitiveness, and we \nshould support our space program if we desire to maintain and enhance \nour position as a world leader in space science and exploration.\n  Third, the case today for such activities is even more compelling as \nwe work on space projects in a collaborative and multinational manner, \nespecially with the Europeans, Japanese, and Russians. International \nparticipation in the program contributes to increased cooperation and \nstability with participating partners, and the space station can be a \nconstructive and tangible example of international cooperation at a new \nand more exciting level. We have the opportunity to accelerate the pace \nof our technological and space exploration as well as the strength of \nour good relations with our friendly competitors.\n  Mr. President, I believe that these are compelling reasons for the \ncontinued support of space exploration. The international space station \nis an integral part of our space program. We must invest in our future, \nand we must invest in ourselves.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today, I lend my voice to the advocates of \nproject space station. In order to frame this debate for my colleagues, \nI want to pose a few rhetorical questions. What are the critical issues \nsurrounding space station on the Senate floor? Is it scientific worth? \nIs it an issue of foreign policy, or national priority? The answer to \neach is yes. But the underlying discontent that many of my colleagues \nharbor is not the scope or importance of space station--rather, it is \nthe cost.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, I fully and unequivocally \nsupport balancing the Federal budget by 2002. That task is not only a \nfiscal imperative, it is a moral one on which the future of this \ncountry depends. Ironically, that is where space station fits squarely \nin this debate. Balancing the budget is an imperative. Beginning the \ngroundwork for America's future scientific operations may, in fact, \nhelp us do just that. Take, for example, research in cardiovascular \ndisease. As my colleagues know, heart disease is the leading cause of \ndeath in both men and women in the United States. One in four Americans \nsuffer from cardiovascular disease, costing this country an estimated \n$138 billion in medical expenses and lost productivity annually; $138 \nbillion annually is not a small figure--it is, in fact, devastating. \nThe conditions provided in space, and on space station in particular, \nwill allow our doctors and scientists to see a heart functioning in \nmicrogravity. conditions for an extended duration, something not \nreplicable on Earth or the space shuttle. NASA's work on how space \nflight affects blood pressure is aiding scientists to understand the \ncomplex and sophisticated operations of the heart and circulatory \nsystem. As gravity lessens, the body's blood pressure controls are \naltered and change. High blood pressure is a major problem for the \ngeneral population of the United States. The opportunities for long \nduration space flight on the space station will provide a laboratory \nfor extensive and complex research on blood pressure control and how it \nis affected by the presence or absence of gravity.\n\n  What does this all mean? If 1 percent of that $138 billion can be \nreduced, or even one-tenth of 1 percent, we will have significantly \nreduced some of the massive costs incurred in our battle against this \nterrible, and prevalent, disease.\n  By January 1995, 25,000 pounds worth of space station was built. By \nthe end of this year, that poundage strides to 100,000. Upon \ncompletion, the space station will stretch 361 across and 290 feet \nlong, with a total weight of 925,000 pounds. Orbiting 230 nautical \nmiles above the Earth, it will be accessible to the launch vehicles of \nall its international partners. And with Boeing as the new prime \ncontractor, space station is on schedule, and meeting all of its \ncritical milestones. Perhaps more importantly, its annual cost has been \nfixed at $2.1 billion--according to NASA that represents less than 15 \npercent of the organization's total budget.\n  That being said, $2.1 billion is still a significant amount of money \nto be spent, particularly with the Republican goal of bringing the \ncountry out of its current fiscal mess. Yet I fully support space \nstation, and its mission, because I believe the benefits associated \nwith this program will be important, numerous and hopefully more \nrewarding than we can predict. From crystalline proteins to the \nresearch in osteoporosis, space station has the potential, and I \nbelieve certainty, to deliver important scientific discoveries \nimpossible to replicate or produce here on Earth. Does that justify the \ncost? Absolutely. If the cure for one disease--just one disease--is \nfound, and that if may not be as big as some of my colleagues assert, \nwe will have paid for space station and all its associated costs, \nfully.\n\n[[Page S 14245]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. I conclude my remarks by just saying that this country must \ninvest in its future. A research laboratory in space can provide \nunimaginable benefits to the American people. The space station is the \nonly facility where research can be conducted for long durations in \nmicrogravity. The unique environment has only begun to be explored \nscientifically. American taxpayers are certain to benefit just as they \nhave from other basic research, probably in ways we can never expect.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the remaining time to our very \ndistinguished colleague from Ohio, the former astronaut.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Senator.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is as accomplished an orator as we have I \nthink in the whole Congress. He would come closer to equaling Daniel \nWebster, I think, than anyone around here in his ability to give an \noration.\n  Back in 1852, when we were thinking of buying some territory out West \nfrom Mexico, Daniel Webster rose in the Senate--he was opposed to \nthat--and said as follows:\n\n       What do we want with this vast worthless area, this region \n     of savages and wild beasts, of deserts of shifting sands and \n     whirlwinds of dust and cactus and prairie dogs? To what use \n     could we ever hope to put these great deserts or the \n     mountains that are covered to their very base with eternal \n     snow? What can we ever hope to do with the western coast, a \n     coast of 3,000 miles rock-bound, cheerless, uninviting, and \n     not a harbor on it? What use have we for this country? Mr. \n     President, I will never vote one cent from the Public \n     Treasury to place the Pacific coast one inch nearer to Boston \n     than it is now.\n\n  Madam President, I think probably the view that Daniel Webster took \nof that acquisition of territory west of the Mississippi is a little \nbit like the Senator from Arkansas proposes now with regard to the \nstation.\n  I wish to see something come out of the station. We already have \nthings coming out of the preparation to even have a station. As the \nfloor manager mentioned just a moment ago, we do not even have the \nstation up yet. So to say that that is not producing is exactly right. \nIt is true. It is in the process of being put up. Over one-fourth of it \nhas already been built, 50,000 pounds by our country, 60,000 pounds by \nother people. Less than seven-tenths of 1 percent of our budget is the \ntotal cost of the space station project right now.\n  From what we can see from the space shuttle with the cultures of \ncrystals and of the experiments that have already been done on growing \nculture, culturing colon cancer cells, breast cancer cells, ovarian \ncells, what can be done with regard to AIDS, the experiments with \nregard to osteoporosis, right now a solution to any one of those would \nbe more than worth all of the money that we are putting into this. This \nis an investment for the future.\n  To say that every scientist and physicist is against it is just not \ntrue. My distinguished colleague read into the Record a few moments ago \na partial list of those who are for it--the American Medical \nAssociation, the National Academy of Sciences, the National Research \nCouncil, and so on.\n  This is one country that should have learned throughout its whole \nhistory that money spent on space research usually has a way of paying \noff in advance--more than anything we ever see at the outset.

The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, not seeing the proponent of the amendment on \nthe floor, I suggest that the time be equally divided, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the call of the quorum be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask for 1 minute on behalf of the opponents.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield 1 minute to the distinguished ranking member.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I absolutely oppose the amendment being \noffered by the Senator from Arkansas. I thank him for his support of \nthe space program and also for research in the American life science \ncommunity, but I want to make three points.\n  The Senator says this is a condo in the sky for going to Mars. We \nabsolutely reject that. We go to Mars, and we are going by robots; we \nare not going by astronauts. This is to be a science lab, not a condo.\n  Second, the space station at one time was overweight and \nunderpowered, not unlike the Federal bureaucracy. We streamlined the \nspace station design to make sure that weight, power, and mission \nmatch.\n  And last, but not at all least, there was a question whether we could \nreally assemble the space station in space. When we gave the Hubble \nspace telescope a new contact lens and our astronauts showed the \ndeftness with which they could do mechanical assembly in space, they \nshowed that we could do it. So we now have designs to the mission. We \ncan put it together in space. And it is a science lab, not a condo for \nastronauts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 1 minute 30 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me just reiterate, No. 1, much has been made of the \nfact that the American Medical Association favors the space station. \nLet me point out that the American Physical Society--40,000 physicists \nin America--are adamantly opposed to the space station. Why? Because \nthey say the benefits are going to be negligible. You cannot do \nanything in space with microgravity. Dr. Bloembergen at Harvard says, \nwhen you put men on the space station to do microgravity research, you \njust mess it up. The steps, a bump, destroys microgravity research.\n  And what is there about a lack of gravity that is going to cure \ncancer and AIDS and all the rest of it? The answer is nothing. Here are \npeople who really are concerned about the deficit: The Cato Institute, \nthe Concord Coalition, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, \nthe National Taxpayers Union, Progress in Freedom Foundation, \nProgressive Policy Institute. Not only do the American physicists \noppose it, every one of those organizations strongly oppose it.\n  This bill, just this bill alone, ravages housing for the elderly, \nravages sewer projects, and torpedoes the AmeriCorps Program to make \nroom for this thing. We are going to cut $40 billion out of education \nin the next 7 years to pay for this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Arkansas has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Missouri has 25 seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think the argument made very compellingly \nby our good friend from Arkansas just shows that physicists do not know \nanything more about biomedical research \n\n[[Page S 14246]]\nin space than we do. I will take the word of the people who are at NIH \nand who are involved in biomedical research to say that it is \nimportant.\n  This country has an opportunity to invest in the future. A research \nlaboratory in space can provide the benefits we need. I urge my \ncolleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on agreeing to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas, No. 2776. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered.

Mr. President, in discussions with the distinguished \nranking member, I think we have an order for the amendments that are \ncoming up. I want to thank our colleagues for getting the amendments in \norder and getting time agreements.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Stevens, followed by Senator \nChafee, be recognized for up to 10 minutes to present an amendment \nwhich I believe is acceptable on both sides. After action on that \namendment is completed, we ask that Senator Mikulski and Senator \nKennedy be recognized to present an amendment on national service with \na 2-hour time limit, with a vote on or in relation to that amendment to \noccur at that time; following disposition of that amendment, that \nSenator Sarbanes be recognized to present an amendment on the homeless, \nthat there be 1 hour divided in the usual form which would apply to \nboth of those amendments; and upon the expiration or yielding back of \nthe time, that a vote on or in relation to the Sarbanes amendment \noccur.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have an amendment which is acceptable by \nboth sides dealing with arsenic in the safe drinking water. We have \ndiscussed this with the staffs.\n  What I want to do is present that right after the Stevens amendment, \nand if it is acceptable, if I had 4 minutes equally divided----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Reserving the right to object, on the arsenic, would \nthe Senator go ahead with this? I need to be sure that the authorizer \non our side, and Senator Lautenberg--not only do I wish to cooperate \nwith the Senator from Rhode Island, but these got fairly prickly as we \nwere moving into the full committee, so I just want to make sure we \nhave one good thing done, and check in the meantime about the arsenic.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Missouri?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlaska is recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2779\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I \nask the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the pending committee \namendment is set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] for himself and Mr. \n     Murkowski, proposes an amendment numbered 2779.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Sec. 308. None of the funds appropriated under this Act may \n     be used to implement the requirements of section 186(b)(2), \n     section 187(b) or section 211(m) of the Clean Air Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7512(b)(2), 7512a(b), or 7545(m)) with respect to any \n     moderate nonattainment area in which the average daily winter \n     temperature is below 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The preceding \n     sentence shall not be interpreted to preclude assistance from \n     the Environmental Protection Agency to the State of Alaska to \n     make progress toward meeting the carbon monoxide standard in \n     such areas and to resolve remaining issues regarding the use \n     of oxygenated fuels in such areas.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment that Senator Murkowski and \nI have discussed with the managers of their staff and the chairman of \nthe authorizing committee, I understand will be accepted.\n  It provides for a 1-year exemption from the oxygenated fuel \nrequirements of the Clean Air Act for Fairbanks, AK. There are unique \ncircumstances in Fairbanks that justify this limited exemption. I do \nthank the other Senators who have worked with us on this amendment.\n  Alaska exceeds the carbon monoxide requirements on the Clean Air Act \nonly on days when there are temperature inversions caused by extreme \ncold, which really means when it is below 50 below zero.\n  When the oxygenated fuels requirement of the Clean Air Act was \napplied to Fairbanks to correct the carbon monoxide levels, serious \nhealth problems were reported. The MTBE additives developed for the \narea were simply never tested for use in the extreme cold of the \nFairbanks area.\n  In addition to waiving the requirements to use the oxygenated fuels, \nthis amendment would also prevent Fairbanks from unfairly being added \nto the list of cities with serious nonattainment problems.\n  Given the transitory nature of the oxygenated fuel requirements by \nFairbanks with respect to carbon monoxide, other Senators have agreed \nadditional measures coming from the declassification should not be \nrequired for Fairbanks.\n  Through negotiations with our staff and the staffs of the authorizing \ncommittee and this committee, Senator Murkowski and I have agreed this \nis the last time we will seek a waiver of the oxygenated fuel \nrequirement for Fairbanks using the appropriations process.\n  However, we do hope that the Senate will agree with us to fix the \nproblem legislatively through an amendment to the Clean Air Act.\n  Again, I do thank my colleagues for their help in this matter.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, although I generally oppose legislative \nriders on appropriations bills, I want to say that I support this \namendment by my colleagues from Alaska.\n  The city of Fairbanks has made extraordinary progress against the \ncarbon monoxide nonattainment situation.\n  In 1977, Fairbanks experienced nearly 100 days--100 days--in 1 year \nwhen carbon monoxide levels exceeded the health standard. Last year, \nthe city of Fairbanks only had 5 days when those standards were \nexceeded.\n  There is no question but what the city of Fairbanks has done an \nextraordinarily good job. It is a tribute to the \n\n[[Page S 14247]]\ncity and I might say it is also attribute, Mr. President, to the \nefficacy of the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act is working.\n  Fairbanks is currently classified as a moderate nonattainment area. \nIf it does not fully meet the standard by the end of this year, \nFairbanks will be reclassified as a serious nonattainment area. \nReclassification would trigger a series of additional requirements \nunder the Clean Air Act--including transportation control measures--\nthat may not be necessary to reach this standard.\n  Fairbanks believes that it can meet the standard without the \nimposition of these expensive additional measures. Because of the \ndramatic progress that has already been made, I think it is reasonable \nto extend the deadline in this case. The Senators from Alaska have \nstated that they will not seek another extension on an appropriation \nbill in the future.\n  As to oxygenated fuels, some States have experienced complaints in \ncities where MTBE has been used as an additive. But MTBE is not the \nonly additive available. Ethanol, grain alcohol, can also be used as an \noxygenate. Everything we know about air pollution tells us that burning \nalcohol presents less pollution concern than burning gasoline, the fuel \nthe alcohol replaces.\n  So, there are alternatives for Fairbanks if it cannot reach \nattainment using existing measures. In fact, Anchorage, AK, used \nethanol as a fuel additive last year and recorded its first year ever \nwith no exceedances of the carbon monoxide standard. This experience \nhas been repeated all across the country. When we passed the 1990 Clean \nAir Act Amendments more than 40 cities were in nonattainment for carbon \nmonoxide. Today that number is less than 10 and much of the credit goes \nto the oxygenated fuels program in the Clean Air Act.\n  Mr. President, we all look forward to the day when every American \ncity can boast of healthy air. Fairbanks has made great strides already \nand will reach that goal soon. In light of its accomplishments, I think \nwe can provide the city with some flexibility.\n  Mr. President, I have the assurance of the two Senators from Alaska \nthat this is the last time they will be in for this exception. I am \nsupportive of it and commend them and commend the city of Fairbanks.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Stevens-Murkowski amendment relieves Fairbanks of \noxygenated fuels requirement and transportation control measures under \nthe Clean Air Act for upcoming winter because Fairbanks' carbon \nmonoxide [CO] exceedances are a result of temperature inversions--not \nsimply CO emissions, and Fairbanks' residents experienced negative \nhealth effects when they initially tried methyl tertiary butyl ether \n[MTBE] as an oxygenated fuel.\n  The oxygenated fuels program was instituted in Anchorage and \nFairbanks on November 1, 1992, according to the law, using MTBE as the \noxygenate additive. Fairbanks' and Anchorage residents began to \nexperience unusual health problems--nausea, vomiting, dizziness, \ndisorientation, headaches, and other symptoms.\n  Our Governor canceled the program in Fairbanks on December 11, 1992, \ndue to these health problems. The EPA had not done any studies on MTBE \nin the Arctic conditions that exist in Alaska. So, many Alaskans \njustifiably fear the use of oxygenated fuels in their gasoline.\n  Let me also note that Alaska does not have a serious non-attainment \nproblem. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter \nfrom the city of Fairbanks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Fairbanks North Star Borough,\n\n                                 Fairbanks, AK, February 22, 1995.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: Thank you for taking the time to \n     meet with me while I was recently in Washington, DC. I \n     appreciate the time you took to talk with me about Fairbanks' \n     concerns regarding federal Clean Air Act requirements. We \n     continue to have problems with certain requirements of the \n     Act, due to a combination of extremely severe temperature \n     inversions and high cold-start emissions caused by our cold \n     temperatures. According to National Weather Service staff, \n     Fairbanks has the strongest temperature inversions in North \n     America.\n       As you can see from the enclosed chart, the number of days \n     each year that Fairbanks exceeds the ambient carbon monoxide \n     standard has dropped dramatically from previous levels to \n     fewer than five per year. The decrease is largely a result of \n     federal emissions controls on new cars, with some additional \n     benefits due to the basic emissions inspection and \n     maintenance (I/M) program the Borough implemented in 1985. \n     Although substantial progress has been made in reducing \n     emissions, several exceedances occurred recently during an \n     extended period of extreme temperature inversions and calm \n     winds. These conditions resulted in extremely stagnant air \n     dispersion for several days.\n       As you know, our residents remain adamantly opposed to the \n     use of oxygenated fuel in our community. Unfortunately, this \n     program is mandated directly by the Clean Air Act, and not \n     even EPA has the legal authority to exempt Fairbanks from \n     this requirement. As a result of the nonattainment status, \n     the Fairbanks North Star Borough may soon be subject to \n     additional Clean Air Act mandates which would require the \n     implementation of local transportation controls. None of \n     these programs appear feasible or acceptable to our \n     community, yet could be imposed upon us by a federal law that \n     doesn't recognize the uniqueness of the Fairbanks North Star \n     Borough.\n       When we spoke in Washington, you talked about current \n     efforts in the Senate to address the costs versus benefits of \n     federal mandates. The above Clean Air Act provisions are a \n     good example of this issue. It makes no sense to impose \n     federally mandated control strategies which may not provide \n     significant benefits on a community where those strategies \n     would cost millions of dollars, particularly when they aren't \n     likely to eliminate a problem that is largely caused by \n     Mother Nature. We are not asking to be completely exempted \n     from Clean Air Act requirements. We'll do our part to ensure \n     that the control measures we are responsible for (e.g., the \n     current I/M program) are effectively implemented. We need \n     your help in eliminating federal mandates that will not help \n     our community attain the goals of the Act. We would also like \n     some recognition in the Act that we shouldn't be penalized \n     for Alaska's unique weather characteristics.\n       We will be providing your staff with several options that \n     could possibly be pursued to provide Fairbanks with relief \n     from the above Clean Air Act provisions. Thanks again for \n     taking the time to talk with me on this subject. We truly \n     appreciate the efforts you've made on behalf of Interior \n     Alaska in the past regarding this issue, as well as any \n     additional actions that you can take to assist us further in \n     the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jim Sampson,\n                                                    Borough Mayor.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have some of the cleanest air in the \ncountry. Fairbanks has made significant, dramatic reductions in CO \nviolations. You will notice that most of these reductions occurred \nbefore the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments; so, the Clean Air Act was \neffective in Fairbanks without the oxygenated fuels requirement. These \nreductions are clearly attributable to Fairbanks' inspection and \nmaintenance program. Fairbanks has reduced their violations 43 \npercent--from 37 in 1985 to only 2 in 1992, and most recently we seem \nto be down to 5 or fewer violations a year.\n  Those exceedances that do occur are during thermal inversions. \nTypical automobile fleet turnover and the U.S. car fleet operating more \nefficiently at cold temperatures could also bring Fairbanks into \ncompliance eventually.\n  I want to thank Senator Chafee and Senator Bond for accepting our \namendment. Fairbanks air quality has improved significantly over the \nyears. We want to continue to work with the EPA to improve our air \nquality by means that make sense in our Arctic climate and not be \nsubject to a one-size-fits-all mandate that does not make sense in \nAlaska. We welcome the current political climate that recognizes the \nneed for flexibility and common sense in our environmental regulatory \npolicy.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I just ask the Senate to remember the \nextreme temperature conditions that exist in Fairbanks. I started my \nlife in Alaska, in Fairbanks, and I can attest to temperatures below 65 \ndegrees below zero myself.\n  These temperature inversions are the problem. They are not the normal \nproblem that causes carbon monoxide limitations to be exceeded. The \noxygenated fuels I think would have a minimal impact on that problem \nanyway because we are not certain they will even solve the problem when \nwe are down below 60 below zero.\n  So I thank the Senate. I thank Senator Chafee for being willing to \ndeal with this. Again, our commitment is, we will not raise this as an \nexception through the appropriations process. We are going to pursue \nthe authorizing committee for a permanent solution to this problem as \nwe deal with the Clean Air Act. \n\n[[Page S 14248]]\n\n  I thank the Senator from Missouri.\n  Am I correct that this amendment will be accepted?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, if I might add that when we passed the \nClean Air Act amendments in 1990, more than 40 cities were in \nnonattainment for carbon monoxide. Today that number is less than 10. \nMuch of the credit goes to the oxygenated fuels program as well as \nother steps taken by the various cities.\n  So I think we can look forward to the day when every American city \ncan boast clean air. Fairbanks, as I mentioned, has made great progress \nand we believe will reach the goal of complete attainment soon. In \nlight of those accomplishments, I think we should provide Fairbanks \nwith some flexibility, and I am happy to support this amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BOND. The amendment is acceptable on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Alaska yield his \nremaining time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we agree to the amendment. I have no \nother statement to make on it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I agree with what the Senator from Rhode \nIsland has said. I know what the situation here is. I am one who does \nnot believe that MTPE will make a difference when there are temperature \ninversions that cause nonattainment. We will have to deal with that in \nthe Clean Air Act, however, and we agree not to pursue it with the \nappropriations process again.\n  I thank the Senator. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 2779 offered by the Senator from Alaska.\n  The amendment (No. 2779) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I believe that the Senator from Rhode Island \nhas another amendment that will be acceptable on both sides. I modify \nthe unanimous-consent agreement and ask unanimous consent that he be \ngiven 5 minutes to present the amendment with respect to arsenic in \ndrinking water.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I further ask unanimous consent that on the Mikulski \namendment on national service and on the Sarbanes amendment on \nhomelessness, that no second-degree amendments be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Amendment No. 2780 to the Committee Amendment Beginning on Page 143, \n                   Line 17 through Page 151, Line 10\n\n       (Purpose: To amend the provisions with respect to arsenic)\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator seek to set aside the pending \ncommittee amendments?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I do so ask.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendment beginning on page 143, line 17, be the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will now report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Chafee) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2780 to the committee amendment beginning \n     on page 143, line 17, through page 151, line 10.\n\n  On page 149, line 18, insert ``(for its carcinogenic effects)'' after \n``arsenic.''\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this amendment would modify one of the \nenvironmental riders on this appropriations bill. The appropriations \nbill precludes the Environmental Protection Agency from taking final \naction to set a standard for arsenic under the Safe Drinking Water Act. \nThis delay is presumably justified because some uncertainties in the \nscience on the cancer-causing effects of arsenic.\n  My amendment would continue the delay imposed by the rider for a \nstandard to deal with the cancer threat from arsenic, but it would \nallow EPA to go forward and revise the standard to protect against the \nother adverse health effects of arsenic.\n  Arsenic is a naturally occurring substance frequently found in \ndrinking water, especially in water supplies from ground water sources.\n  Arsenic causes several adverse health effects, the most important of \nwhich are vascular diseases and skin cancer. Arsenic has been known to \nbe a cause of cancer by ingestion since 1887 because it was sold in \npatent medicines. Ironically, many of these medicines were intended to \ntreat skin diseases. Using arsenic as a medicine proved that arsenic \nitself causes skin cancer.\n  The other major health problem caused by arsenic is a weakening of \nthe vascular system--the vessels that circulate blood in our bodies.\n  Arsenic is currently regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act and \nhas been regulated by the Federal Government beginning long before \nthere was an EPA. The current drinking water standard, established by \nthe Public Health Service after World War II, is 50 parts per billion. \nThat standard was set to address the vascular diseases, but was not \ndesigned to address the cancer risk.\n  The 1986 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act required the \narsenic standard to be rewritten and to address the cancer risk. EPA \nwas directed to establish a new arsenic standard by 1989. For cancer-\ncausing substances such as arsenic, the goal in the Safe Drinking Water \nAct is to eliminate all exposure--to reach zero, if we can. But most \noften that is not a practical reality. Instead, the standard is set \nbased on the treatment technologies that large drinking water systems \ncan afford. With technology available today, it is possible to reduce \nthe concentration of arsenic in drinking water from the current 50 \nparts per billion to levels below 10 parts per billion.\n  However, some have argued that arsenic may not be a typical cancer-\ncausing substance and ought not to be regulated in the typical way. \nAccording to this argument, there may be a safe threshold for arsenic. \nIn other words, it may be that the first bit of arsenic one consumes \nwill not increase a person's cancer risk. It may be that some higher \nconcentration must be reached before the cancer effect takes hold. \nDrinking arsenic below this level would not increase risk because the \nbody would slough it off before it reached the target organs. If there \nis such a threshold--and depending where it is--a standard at less than \n10 parts per billion--even though we could achieve it--might not make \nsense, if our only concern is the cancer risk.\n  Unfortunately, there has not been sufficient study to answer this \nquestion about a threshold. Recent studies from Taiwan suggest that \nthere is not a threshold and that the cancer risk from drinking water \nat the current 50 parts per billion standard is quite high. If those \nstudies are correct 2 in each 100 people drinking arsenic-laden water \nat the current federal standard would be expected to develop skin \ncancer. On the other hand, many other scientists have attacked \nweaknesses in the Taiwan study and argued that it cannot be relied upon \nto determine whether there is a threshold or not.\n  Resolving this scientific dispute about the potential cancer-causing \nproperties of arsenic can be done. A gathering of scientists that \noccurred last spring produced a research plan that would result in a \ndefinitive answer. The study would take a period of a few years to \ncomplete and would cost about $15 million.\n  Mr. President, I have brought this amendment to the floor of the \nSenate to make a simple point. We have a responsibility to the American \npeople to make sure these studies get done and are completed as soon as \npossible. We have delayed too long.\n  There is a great deal of disagreement in this body and across the \ncountry today about the proper role of the Federal Government in \nensuring that our drinking water is safe. But one thing everybody \nagrees on is that the Federal Government has a responsibility to \nconduct the research necessary to determine the potential adverse \neffects of \n\n[[Page S 14249]]\nthe contaminants that occur in our drinking water. It would not make \nsense for every state or every city to conduct its own drinking water \nresearch program. That is a job for the Federal Government.\n  But we have not been doing it. We invest next to nothing in drinking \nwater research in these appropriations bills each year. A recent \nbriefing by EPA's Office of Research and Development indicated that \nless than $5 million per year is being spent to investigate the adverse \nhealth effects of drinking water contaminants.\n  Arsenic is a perfect example of this failing. It has been known to \ncause skin cancer in humans since before 1900. It has been regulated--\nbut not to prevent cancer from drinking water --by the Federal \nGovernment for decades. In 1986, Congress passed a law requiring that \nthe arsenic standard be revised and that the revision address the \ncancer risk. The new standard was due in 1989.\n  But nothing was done. EPA took no action to revise the standard. \nFinally, in 1993 EPA was sued by a public interest group to force the \nAgency to issue the cancer standard. In response to the suit, EPA \nappeared in court and asked for more time, because the research had not \nbeen done.\n  Now, this appropriations bill comes before us and provides EPA with \nthe extension they have been seeking. This extension would not be \nnecessary, if the appropriations bills adopted in previous years had \nprovided the small amount of research money for the needed research. \nTens of thousands of Americans are consuming arsenic in their drinking \nwater at levels that may be a threat to their health. This is not new \ninformation. But we are not ready to take action to protect public \nhealth, because we have delayed and delayed and delayed in making the \nsmall investment in research that is necessary to arrive at a sound \npublic policy regarding arsenic in drinking water.\n  Recent studies on the noncancer health effects of arsenic indicate \nthat the current 50-part-per-billion standard may not even prevent the \nother arsenic-related diseases. One approach might be to immediately \nrevise the arsenic standard for drinking water based on these other \neffects, press ahead full speed on the cancer research, and revise the \nstandard--if needed--to reflect the cancer risk when that research is \ncompleted. That is an approach that we will consider when the Senate \ntakes up the bill to reauthorize the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  My amendment today sets the stage for this debate. Instead of \nprohibiting a revision of the standard for arsenic altogether, under my \namendment EPA would just be prohibited from issuing a standard for the \ncancer effects. They might revise the standard based on the data for \nother health effects. My amendment does not require EPA to issue a \nstandard. And it does not pre-judge the issue of whether the standard \nshould be tightened to prevent vascular diseases. We would want all the \nstudies on those effects thoroughly reviewed by the Science Advisory \nBoard and others before a standard-setting effort was begun. But it \nwould not be blocked. That is the point.\n  Mr. President, I have discussed this amendment with the manager of \nthe bill and believe that it is agreeable to him. I want to commend \nSenator Bond for including $1 million in this bill for research on the \ncancer-causing effects of arsenic. That is a start. And we appreciate \nit. I am sure that we can count on him to see this research program \nthrough to the end, now that it has been initiated.\n  So, Mr. President, my amendment lets the prohibition that is in the \nbasic bill dealing with cancer-causing substances, cancer threats \nremain, but lets EPA go forward with revising the standards to protect \nagainst, as I say, other adverse health effects.\n  Mr. President, this has been cleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  I ask for its acceptance.\n  Mr. President, I would like to say that I have discussed this \namendment with the managers of the bill and the ranking member. I \nbelieve it is agreeable to them.\n  I commend Senator Bond for including $1 million in this bill for \nresearch on the cancer-causing effects of arsenic. That is a start. We \nappreciate it. I hope we can count on him--and I know we can--to see \nthis research program through to the end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The amendment (No. 2780) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the ranking member and the manager of the bill \nfor their consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous unanimous-consent \nagreement, the Senate is to proceed to the National Service Program \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2781\n\n    (Purpose: To restore funding for national and community service \n                               programs)\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

There will now be 2 hours of debate equally \ndivided in the usual manner. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you, Mr. President. At this time, I yield myself \nno more than 15 minutes, reserving the balance of my time to allocate \nto other Senators and also for summation argument.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the VA-HUD and \nindependent agencies appropriations bill.\n  My amendment restores funding for the Corporation for National and \nCommunity Service. It is in the amount of $425 million. The offset \nnecessary to do this is taken from inside HUD to cover the budget \nauthority in outlays needed to restore funding for national service.\n  The amount of funding this amendment provides allows another year of \noperation at a level that is 48 percent below the President's 1996 \nrequest, and it is also 10 percent below the fiscal year 1995 rescinded \nlevel.\n  In addition, my amendment would prohibit direct grants to Federal \nagencies, generating an additional 11 percent of savings. And, finally, \nmy amendment would fence all funds from obligation until the \nCorporation submits a plan that restructures the program operation to \nreflect its reduced budget or until national service is reauthorized, \nwhichever comes first.\n  Mr. President, why do I do this? I do this because I so strongly and \npassionately believe in national service. This is not just yet another \nsocial program. It is a unique American social invention designed to \nhelp create the ethic of service in today's young people. It creates an \nopportunity structure under which young Americans receive a reduction \nin their student debt or a voucher to pay for their higher education in \nexchange for full- or part-time community service.\n  This is not another handout. This says to young people, we know that \nyour first mortgage is your student debt, but we want to give you an \nopportunity to reduce that student debt by doing service in your \ncommunity. And if you do that, you will earn a voucher to reduce that \nstudent debt to the tune of about $4,000 a year.\n  The projects themselves do not come from some Federal bureaucrat \ndeciding what is best for local communities. It is driven by the \nchoices of local organizations, primarily nonprofits, and organizing \naround four basic areas of activity: education, public health, the \nenvironment, and public safety. It gives these young men and women a \nchance to get a college education in exchange for community service. \nThis is not a Gucci-styled, show-up-once-a-week concept. These \ncommunity workers spend an average of 35 hours each week contributing \nto their communities. They get a modest monthly allowance, and they get \nother support.\n  Why is this important? We want to do three things with national \nservice. We want to help students reduce their student debt. We want to \nalso rekindle the habits of the heart that made America great with the \nspirit of voluntarism. And third but not at all least, we want to deal \nwith the new volunteer deficit that is facing the United States of \nAmerica when many of our nonprofits are withering on the vine for the \nlack of community participation.\n  What are some of the examples of what these volunteers do? In my own \nState, in Montgomery County, they operate a community assisting police \nprogram where volunteers engage in community education and outreach \nthat addresses the need for crime control, prevention, and the \nreduction of fear in six underserved communities.\n  Some of the projects that they do are coordinating a school awareness \ncrime program. They provide bilingual assistance and referrals to crime \nvictims. They work actually in a community policing station side by \nside with the police officers. They are not new cops, but they are cop \nextenders because while the police officers are doing the policing, \nthese volunteers are helping doing prevention, community education, and \nalso providing much-needed bilingual assistance.\n  In Vermont, there is something called the Vermont Antihunger, \nNutrition and Empowerment Corps. This group operates five sites in \nVermont, developing a statewide approach to hunger to increase \nparticipation of low-income and rural residents in Federal food \nassistance programs and teaching them about nutrition and how to buy \nand plant food.\n  In Washington State, we have a conservation corps providing a 1-year \nprogram that combines fieldwork and on-the-job instruction for doing \nthings like watershed restoration, reforestation, stream and salmon \nhabitat rehabilitation, and forest fire and oil spill response. It \ntakes hard-to-reach kids and puts them with other young people who have \nrecently graduated from college, both doing hands-on work. I know that \nwe have not only turned the environment around but we have turned \naround some at-risk kids.\n  YouthBuild Boston is a program that puts 18- to 24-year-old \nvolunteers to work renovating buildings to provide low-income housing.\n  The program engages disenfranchised youth in rebuilding their \ncommunities and provides them with the education and skills to become \nself-reliant and responsible citizens.\n  The program has had such success that it has expanded its services \nfrom housing renovation to include environmental, public safety, and \neducation projects.\n  There are over 1,000 programs operating nationwide which involve \n20,000 volunteers.\n  These programs are doing exactly what Congress intended to do when we \nauthorized this bill in 1993. In fact, many of the programs are \noperating with a larger degree of success than even we had hoped. \nNational service was designed to address those two programs I talked \nabout--student indebtedness as well as how to instill a sense of \nobligation and habits of the heart in young people.\n  There has been a sharp drop over the last 20 years in the number of \nAmericans who volunteer in their communities. Harvard Prof. Bob Putnam \nhas identified this trend and says that we need to promote more civic \nactivity. Fewer people attend the PTA. But also what we know is that \ngroups like the Red Cross, Meals on Wheels, Girl Scouts, and Boy Scouts \nface fewer and fewer volunteers. What we want to do is instill this \nsense of citizenship, this sense of obligation. And we also want to \nsay, as part of an overall Government framework, now we have a clear \nmessage that for every right there is a responsibility, for every \nopportunity there should be an obligation. And this \n\n[[Page S 14251]]\nis what we are trying to create also through this legislation.\n  National service is the latest in a long series of social inventions \ndesigned by this country to create higher education. Earlier today we \ndebated the space station. We are known worldwide for our scientific \ninvention. But also we have been a genius in social inventions--those \ntools that enable people to pursue the American dream.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, we are the country that invented night \nschool so that immigrants, working in factories during the day, would \nhave a chance to learn English, learn citizenship, learn the skills to \nmove ahead in our society. That was a social invention. We created the \nGI bill for returning vets because we said that if you gave to this \nNation, we will make sure you will be able to participate in the \nAmerican dream.\n  National and community service is part of that framework. How can we \nmake sure the access to higher education is not only for the wealthy? \nIn my own home State of Maryland, to go to an independent college like \nLoyola or Notre Dame of Maryland, the kind of school I went to, it now \ncosts anywhere from $12,000 to $18,000 a year. For most middle-income \nfamilies, the whole idea of $72,000 for 4 years of education is beyond \ntheir dream. The same thing for our public schools. It still then would \nbe about $8,000 or $9,000 a year--or $45,000.\n  In this country, we believed that intellectual ability and character \nwas randomly distributed through the population, so that it was only an \nelite few that could have access to higher education and thus remain \nelite. We wanted to make sure it was available to others. So that is \nwhy national service is important.\n  There are many critics to national service, and Senator Grassley, of \nIowa, has rightfully raised many of those concerns.\n  I joined with him, asking GAO to evaluate the AmeriCorps Program. I \nfelt if we could not stand to be evaluated, we could not stand to be \nauthorized and we could not stand to be funded. In our quest, we asked \nthem to identify the resources required to field an AmeriCorps \nparticipant, evaluate whether an AmeriCorps program was meeting its \nmission, and make recommendations on how the national service corps \ncould be more efficient and effective.\n  Well, GAO answered two of the three questions we asked. GAO estimates \nthat the amount of resources available from the Corporation to field a \nparticipant are in line with the Corporation's estimate. Most \nimpressive in GAO's finding is that national service programs are \nmeeting the objectives that Congress set when we passed the bill in \n1993.\n  Some will come to the floor and argue that the cost to the taxpayer \nof about $26,000 is excessive. Well, I want to point out that in the \nreport it says, ``It is important not to equate our funding information \nwith cost data.'' Most AmeriCorps programs are still in their first \nyear of operation.\n  Also, the $26,700 figure is misleading because it represents all \nresources from Federal, State, local, and private. It is not a total \ncost to the taxpayer. You know, in fact, we require matching funds. And \nCongress expects that the federally appropriated dollars would be used \nto leverage matching contributions. So we see that what they say it \ncosts is really excessive.\n  Also, some have suggested in the tight budget times we cannot afford \nto continue this. Well, I do not think we can afford not to continue \nit. The GAO report goes on to recognize that these grants have really \nserved communities. They have served rural communities and they have \nserved urban communities. GAO said in the seven AmeriCorps programs in \nthe four States it visited that ``During our site visits we observed \nlocal programs helping communities.'' This one sentence makes it all \nworthwhile.\n  GAO says, ``In our site visits, we observed that these communities \nare actually being helped.'' I could go on to talk about what they do, \nbut what GAO says is, ``We observed participants renovating inner-city \nhousing, assisting teachers in elementary schools * * * analyzing \nneighborhood crime statistics to better target prevention measures * * \n* '' working with the police, developing a community food bank for \npeople with special dietary needs--and I could go on.\n  Others would say that is going to be done anyway. Well, I am not so \nsure it is going to be done anyway. You have the downsizing of State \nand local governments. They are shrinking funds available for \nnonprofits. And also there are few people to volunteer.\n  This bill rewards the kinds of values, like sweat equity and work, \nthat are at the heart of the American family. It does not identify with \nvictims. It does not whine. It is not morose about the issues facing \nour society. I think this goes right into the values of the Nation. \nThese are not Democratic Party values; these are not Republican Party \nvalues. These are American values: Hard work, neighbor helping \nneighbor, making sure that the access to the American dream is there \nfor all Americans.\n  So, Madam President, I hope we will support the appropriation of \nnational service. I also hope that we support the reauthorization when \nit comes up. I really think this is very important legislation. I think \nit really warrants the Senate's attention and their vote.\n  I yield back such time as I might have left, reserving other time \nthat has been allocated to me.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6 minutes and 46 seconds remaining.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I welcome the opportunity to join with \nmy friend and colleague, the Senator from Maryland, in urging the \nSenate to accept this particular amendment that will restore the \nnational service program and the service learning programs and renewing \nthis country's commitment to service. I think all of us in this body \nare very much aware of the strong commitment that the Senator from \nMaryland has had in terms of the voluntary service programs. As one who \nhas been involved in this effort for some period of time, Senator \nMikulski has really been the leader here in the Senate in the \ndevelopment of these important programs, and has given us the \nopportunity in our Human Resources Committee to hear the testimony of \nmany of the young people in Maryland who have been involved in \nvoluntary programs, and conservation programs, and many others.\n  We are very much aware of not only her strong commitment as a policy \nmaker but also her strong personal interest in the national service \nprogram, community service program, and other volunteer efforts. I \nwelcome the chance to join with her in what I consider to be an \nextremely important vote here this afternoon.\n  Madam President, I think, as Senator Mikulski has pointed out, the \nissue of voluntarism is really as old as the country. And I think many \nof us feel that the outlet for this voluntary spirit has not always \nbeen very evident. Only in very recent years did we see the development \nof a new major volunteer opportunity. That was in the early 1960's--we \ncan go back to the period of the 1930's and cite some of the programs \nin the time of the Depression, but really the 1960's and the \ndevelopment of the Peace Corps Program marked the dramatic beginning of \na national commitment to service programs.\n  I had an opportunity, recently, to visit with some of the volunteers \nat the 25th anniversary of the Peace Corps. At a luncheon that was held \nover in the other side of the Capitol building, I sat down with the \nfirst volunteers for the Peace Corps and I asked them about why they \nparticipated in the Peace Corps. Virtually, all of them gave--phrased \nsomewhat differently, a uniform response. And that was: We were asked \nand it was the first time that we were ever asked to do anything for \nanybody else. The Peace Corps asked them to do something for their \ncountry and also for the communities that they would serve, and they \nresponded.\n  I think all of us who have watched the program grow and develop, and \nhave heard the various discussions and debates about its stability and \nabout its future in recent years, have learned a very important lesson \nfrom the Peace Corps. We have seen a large number of Peace Corps \nvolunteers working on Capitol Hill and in different agencies of \nGovernment. They are individuals who \n\n[[Page S 14252]]\ninvolve themselves voluntarily in service. They give something back to \nthe community. And they have maintained this spirit of voluntarism and \nan interest in the broad public policy issues of our country.\n  That has been true of Peace Corps volunteers, and it has been true of \nthe Vista volunteers as well. I think there are more than 1,250 Peace \nCorps volunteers who are somehow related to activities on the Hill. \nThey are working for Members of the House, the Senate, extended staffs, \nan in other areas of service to the Congress. It is an extraordinary \nrecord. I think all of us have seen similar examples in our own States, \nthrough our visits and travels.\n  I think one of the most important purposes of this whole program is \nto try to reach out and bring the idea of service to young people. \nService learning programs, involve children as young as kindergartners, \nand continue the effort through the 12 years of school, to reach out to \nthose individuals in the 12th grade. The AmeriCorps Program provides \nanother kind of opportunity. It allows individuals to offer full time \nvoluntary service to their community and earn educational benefits \nthrough their service. Hopefully they then maintain that sense of \nvoluntarism during the time they are in school and in college, and \ncontinue it through the rest of their lives. The precedent set by Peace \nCorps and VISTA volunteers indicates that they will.\n  The programs that involve our seniors--Foster Grandparents, Senior \nCompanions, RSVP, provide great service to communities. These \nvolunteers are elderly retirees, who in many instances, are living on \njust a few thousand dollars a year. They are providing service to their \ncommunities and receiving a very minimal amount of resources for the \ngreat value that they represent in their communities.\n  Two superb programs in my own State, in Bedford and Fall River, come \nto mind immediately. These communities have very high unemployment and \nface many different challenges. The service that these programs provide \nto those communities is extraordinary. Those of us who support this \nprogram, want to see that concept of voluntarism started in the early \nyears and continued on for young people and adults through the \nAmeriCorps Program, continued into college, the workplace and on into \nretirement.\n  As part of the whole AmeriCorps Program, we have seen a great deal of \ncommitment from the private sector. The challenge, when this program \nwas established, was to try and ensure private participation and \nmatching funds. The Senator from Maryland has talked about it, as well. \nWe can, during the debate, go into greater detail on that part of the \nprogram. But it is already well documented that we have successfully \ninvolved the private sector in providing incentives and opportunities \nfor service.\n  The fact remains, Madam President, that the concept of voluntarism \nexists not only for those individuals who have financial security. It \nwill be said, in the course of this debate--it always is--it will be \nsaid that if we are going to talk about voluntary, why do we not talk \nabout really voluntary. That is fine for those families, young and old \nalike, who have financial independence. But the idea of contribution of \nservice back into community does not define itself by financial \nresources. The desire to serve exists among many people, young and old, \nthose that have resources and those that do not.\n  We should not deny the opportunity for service to those individuals \nwho come from humble beginnings and a family that does not have great \nresources. They know the concept of service and we should not deny them \nthat. That is the point of the AmeriCorps Program: provide a small \nstipend and give them an opportunity to continue their education after \nthey meet their service obligation. That is the AmeriCorps Program and \nit has been a great community resource.\n  We have seen the examples of real results where these programs have \ntaken place. I ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the \nRecord examples of the services provided in a number of different \ncities in my own State in projects that would never have been done \nunless AmeriCorps had been involved. The value of those projects far \nexceed the value of money paid to the individual AmeriCorps members. \nThese are projects that generally would not be done without this \nprogram.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Massachusetts AmeriCorps Programs--1995-96 Program Year\n\n\n                         program and community\n\n       YMCA Earth Service Corps--Becket, Fall River, Boston, \n     Brockton.\n       Berkshire Conservation Team/Berkshire \\1\\--Pittsfield.\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at the end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Boston University Health & Housing Fellows--Boston.\n       Academics for Changing times/Cambridge Community Services \n     \\1\\--Cambridge.\n       City Pride/Old Colony Y Services Corp.\\1\\--Brockton.\n       City Year Boston \\1\\--Boston.\n       Linking Lifetimes AmeriCorps/Corporation for Public \n     Management \\1\\--Springfield.\n       Greater Holyoke Youth Service Corps \\1\\--Holyoke.\n       City C.O.R.E./Lawrence Youth Commission \\1\\--Lawrence.\n       Local Initiatives Support Corporation--Boston.\n       Lowell Neighborhood Service Corps/Greater Lowell YWCA\\1\\--\n     Lowell.\n       MAGIC ME/Boston--Boston.\n       National Alliance of Veteran Family Service Organizations--\n     Roxbury.\n       National Council of Educational Opportunity Association--\n     Northfield.\n       National Multiple Sclerosis Society--Waltham.\n       Neighborhood Green Corps--Boston, Worcester, Springfield.\n       Athletes in Service to America/Northeastern University--\n     Boston.\n       Notre Dame Mission Volunteers--South Boston.\n       Action for Children Today--Boston, Worcester, Fitchburg.\n       Youth STAR/ROCA Revere Project \\1\\--Revere.\n       Summerbridge Cambridge--Cambridge.\n       Elder Leaders in Community Care/UMass Boston \\1\\--Greater \n     Boston.\n       US Catholic Conference--Somerville.\n       United States Department of Agriculture/Public Lands and \n     Environment Team--Dorchester.\n       National Service Legal Corps/Western Mass.

Operating sites in \n     other states.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, service is of great value to the \ncommunity, and also of value to the individual who participates in the \nprogram.\n  Madam President, the Mikulski amendment will allow the programs in \nschools across this country to continue to provide the opportunity of \nservice to young children.\n  In Springfield, MA, we have kindergarten children who are involved in \nfolding napkins and preparing centerpieces and involved in the feeding \nprograms for the homeless people in that area. They are just small \nchildren, and they are finding out about what homelessness means. They \nare finding out about the joy that takes place when they are able to \ninvolve themselves, as kindergarten children, in the preparation of \nnapkins and centerpieces for those homeless individuals.\n  We find sixth graders who go out and visit nursing homes and perform \nin pantomime the race between the rabbit and the turtle and they see \nthe joy that they are giving to those seniors. They often receive \nrequests for performances. They go out during study hall to do service \nto the community. They learn that good citizenship is an important \nvalue in our society. This is important.\n  We have 8th through 12th graders, under supervision, providing day \ncare programs for the sons and daughters of working families. They are \nworking and even providing some reading and tutoring for these young \nchildren.\n  These 8th and 12th graders write these extraordinary books. They \nwrite them themselves--and read them to the other children. They are \nmore popular than the books that are bought or were already available \nat these centers. The impact of that on those students is significant \nand profound.\n  We have more than 30,000 of them involved in these programs now in my \nown State of Massachusetts and that number is expanding. They do not \nneed \n\n[[Page S 14253]]\nextensive resources and training to be able to run these programs. They \nhave to have a program developed by students that has an education \nfunction, service to the community, and make application to the State \nboards.\n  That is another very important underlying concept. These programs are \nbasically structured and run by the States. The grant decisions are not \nFederal they are controlled by the States.\n  We have, in my own State of Massachusetts, a good program. The men \nand women who are part of it have all been individuals who have been \nvery, very much involved in voluntary service over the period of their \nlives and have been involved in a wide range of different kinds of \nservice activities. They review to make sure that these programs work \nand work effectively. Some programs, clearly, work better than others, \nand there is obviously a responsibility to ensure that those programs \nthat do not work are halted or discontinued and others that do work \nshould go forward.\n  I know there have been examples that have been raised during the \ncourse of the various discussions on this of programs engaging in \nimproper advocacy activities. When the very few allegations, have been \nsubstantiated, the programs have been abandoned. I think that is \nimportant. I think those of us who are supporting the Mikulski \namendment certainly support that concept. Overall, the service provided \nby this program has been extraordinary.\n  I mentioned, Madam President, one particular school in Springfield, \nMA, that had one of the highest incidences of trouble in terms of \nviolence, one of the highest dropout rates and also one of the highest \nincidences of teenage pregnancy.\n  There was an introduction into that whole school system of a \ncommunity service program. There was a good deal of effort by very \nenterprising students, members of the faculty and several of the \nparents. They really made an impact on this student body.\n  Now it is the second best high school in Springfield, MA. If you go \nup there and talk to the parents, if you go up there and talk to the \nstudents, if you go up there and talk to the teachers, if you talk to \nthe local merchants, if you talk to the other people who have received \nthe service and seen the difference--there is no question in any of \ntheir minds about the fact that the service opportunity that was \navailable to these young people made the big difference. It reduced \nviolence and increased the academic benefits to the students themselves \nand changed, in a very significant and important way, the attitudes of \nthese students about their school, about themselves and about their \ncommunity.\n  We all know about the challenges that we are facing in many of our \nurban areas and in many of our school systems about how we are going to \nenhance education, academic achievement; how we are going to do \nsomething about violence; how we are going to do something about \nteenage pregnancy; how we are going to do something to encourage our \nyoung people to move around and learn.\n  There are a lot of different ways of trying to do it, and we have \ntried to do it in a variety of ways. Do not discount service as also an \nimportant contribution to those effort. When service and service \nopportunities are done right, they teach excellent lessons. I think the \nrecord demonstrates that.\n  Madam President, I see others who want to speak to this issue.\n  I will just say I think this program is an extremely modest program. \nThe basic concept is to give an opportunity to people to give something \nback to their community. Many of us have the opportunity to visit \ndifferent service sites in our own States or communities. The number of \nvolunteers that are out there to try and provide help and assist is \nabsolutely extraordinary.\n  I visited recently a station that feeds those who are HIV positive, \nand I asked them about the volunteers that they get to assist in \nfeeding. They said the number of volunteers is off the charts. People \nreally care. They do not want to have their names listed. They are \npeople you would consider to be successful in terms of financial \nstanding in the community. People really care.\n  We, as a society, do not offer sufficient kinds of opportunities for \nthat kind of voluntarism. We provide important opportunities in many \ndifferent areas, and I certainly acknowledge the work that is done by \nmany of the very nonprofit voluntary agencies. But this is special and \nunique, a school-based program.\n  I ask for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Maryland yield?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield 1 more minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It really provides a very, very important opportunity. I \nthink our greatest hope is that that opportunity will be expanded on \nover the years in the future to make voluntarism something that is \nbasically a part of the American ethic from the earliest part of our \nlives until the twilight years of our lives.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Madam President, I regret having to rise to oppose the efforts of my \ngood friends from Maryland and Massachusetts to restore funding for the \nCorporation for National Service. I know that the Senator from Maryland \nhas been a champion of this and every other measure that contributes to \ncommunity service, that motivates people of all ages to take an active \npart in their community, to be contributing members of the community, \nto do something with their lives that is more than just getting a \npaycheck, and I know how important this program is to her.\n  But as I weigh the priorities, Madam President, I cannot see how we \nwould allocate the scarce resources to pay for a program which the \nGovernment Accounting Office has concluded costs, per participant, over \n$26,000 per year. That is a level of expenditure that I just do not \nbelieve can be sustained in our current budget.\n  As I indicated when we began consideration of this measure, we are \ntrying to move from the present condition of deficit spending, where we \nare going $200 billion in the tank every year, to balancing our books \nand stopping or ending the deficit, stopping the addition of debt, \nalmost $5 trillion worth, that is now on the backs and on the credit \ncards of our children and grandchildren.\n  Good intentions alone, unfortunately, are not enough. We must \nestablish some priorities, and it is very difficult. But to me, I \ncannot see AmeriCorps ranking high enough on that priority level. I do \nnot dispute that the program has provided some benefits to communities. \nI know that individuals have benefited from it. Yet, we have had to \nmake tough choices.\n  I had leaders of the Nation's mayors and county officials come into \nmy office to ask about what I was proposing in this VA-HUD bill for the \ncommunities. I discussed with them the choices that I had to make at \nthe subcommittee level, and that the full committee had to make between \nthe community development block grant and AmeriCorps. The local \nofficials who judge what really makes a difference for their \ncommunities said, ``Well, we like both of them, but there is no \nquestion that the community development block grant is more important \nin our community.'' That is a decision made at the local level by \npeople elected by and responsible to the people in that community. And \nI cannot argue with that.\n  I wanted to accommodate my colleague from Maryland. I do know that \nthere are some benefits to the AmeriCorps Program. But when the choice \ncame to funding community development block grants or AmeriCorps, as a \nsupporter of block grants, one who has worked with county and city \nofficials throughout my years of service, I felt we must go with those \nelected by the people at the local level, who said this is their \npriority.\n  I note also that the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts said \nthat this is a very worthwhile program and that the private sector \nmatches it. Yet, I understand that only about 8 percent of the funds \ncome from the private sector. This basically is a Federal Government \nprogram. We used to have a program called CETA, Comprehensive \nEmployment and Training Act, way back many years ago when I was \nGovernor. That program funded all kinds of jobs. After evaluation of \nGovernment-funded jobs, on a bipartisan basis, the leaders of this \ncountry, both at the State and \n\n[[Page S 14254]]\nnational level, decided that Comprehensive Employment and Training Act \nfunds were not the way to go.\n  We have seen in the Federal Government's use of the AmeriCorps jobs \nhow expensive they can be. It will surprise some of my colleagues that \n$14 million out of AmeriCorps funds went to fund Federal agencies. I \nbet you thought that we were cutting employment in the Federal \nGovernment, because that is what we have heard. Guess what? We cut \nemployment in the Federal Government on the one hand, and we come in \nthrough the other door, through AmeriCorps, and use AmeriCorps funds to \nhire people paid for by the Federal Government.\n  In some of those programs, the cost per participant was more \nexpensive. For instance, one HHS program costs more than $45,000 per \nparticipant. The Navy has a wonderful Seaborne Conservation Corps. It \ncosts $66,715 per participant. That, to me, is a pretty expensive \nvolunteer program. AmeriCorps, across the board, costs $20 per hour. \nHHS projects cost $33 an hour. The Navy project costs $49 an hour. \nThat, Madam President, is for a volunteer.\n  When the program was authorized 2 years ago, it was authorized as an \nexpansion upon the concept of voluntarism. Certainly, I believe and \nsupport voluntarism in this country. It has made our country great. \nMost of us would not be elected to this body, or any other body, if we \ndid not have voluntary support in our campaigns. Most good works in the \ncommunity would not go forward without voluntarism. But it would be \ncheaper for the Federal Government to simply pay salaries for \nadditional staff members for not-for-profit agencies than to continue \nthis program.\n  We do have good programs that assist in voluntarism. The VISTA \nprogram in the Labor-HHS Subcommittee is one that I have seen work. You \nhave to have some paid people to organize volunteers. Yes, that is one \nof the things you do have to have--somebody to help organize people to \nmake sure the volunteer efforts are effective. I agree with that \nprogram. But this is different. This is paying people to be volunteers. \nTo me, they are no longer volunteers.\n  The point was made very eloquently by the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts that voluntarism is only for the wealthy, unless you are \npaid. I do not agree with that. The figures are that over 80 million \nAmericans are engaged in volunteer work. I know people from all parts \nof the economic scale, all up and down the spectrum of wealth, who \nvolunteer. They volunteer in churches and schools and community \norganizations, community betterment projects, in programs that they \nthink are important. And these people volunteer regardless of how much \nthey have in the way of economic resources, or even paychecks.\n  Voluntarism is the spirit of America. But it is not paid voluntarism. \nLet me emphasize that under the proposal in this bill, no members of \nthe National Service Corps that are currently serving will be cut off. \nThe Corporation just announced the fiscal year 1995 awards in the last \nfew weeks. These programs will run until September 1996. It gives us an \nopportunity to see one more year of the experiment and to allow the \nnot-for-profit agencies one more year to prepare for a possible change \nin their Federal subsidies.\n  From my perspective, we have not seen the administration provide any \nkind of support or real push to get this program in a position where it \ncan be saved. We have asked them for their input. We have told them of \nthe problems. We have asked how they are going to reform it. And in our \nhearing, the ranking member asked Mr. Segal, the chief executive \nofficer of the Corporation, to provide the subcommittee with workable \noptions to save the Corporation because she suggested that perhaps the \nrequest for 1996 was unrealistic.\n  I do not know if Mr. Segal has responded but in the amendment that \nhas been offered by the Senator from Maryland, I commend her because \nshe has demanded they come up with a plan, they come up with a program, \nto show how they can be effective in a new, reconfigured, smaller, \nleaner process.\n  I can assure you that if the administration wants to save this \nprogram, it is going to have to be reconfigured. It will have to be \nslimmer. It will have to get rid of the abuses.\n  The champion of this effort to reform the program and make it more \nefficient and less abusive of the process has been the Senator from \nIowa, who is prepared to speak. He has invited the Corporation, \nadministration officials, to work with him and with me on restructuring \nthe program to ensure its survival.\n  The latest I have heard, they simply responded that it was OK that \nFederal volunteers were paid $66,000 a year----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. With that, Madam President, I yield to the Senator from \nIowa 30 minutes, and ask the Senator to reserve such time as he does \nnot use.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, first of all, the job that the Senator \nfrom Maryland and the Senator from Missouri have on this entire budget \nthat is within the jurisdiction of their subcommittee is a very \ndifficult process. They are fitting all the needs that come within \nthose programs within the 602(b) allocation they have been given.\n  I commend the chairman for the fine work that he has done on this \nbill and how pleased I am to work with him in reforming the AmeriCorps \nProgram. He has a tough budget problem.\n  We have a program here, AmeriCorps, that has not worked out the way \nthe administration has said it would work out. I think that is why we \nare calling for either reinventing this program within the definition \nof the President's statements when it was first enunciated, when the \nprogram was inaugurated, or else lose the program.\n  That is what my letter to the President in late August said. This is \nthe problem pointed out by the General Accounting Office. We feel that \nuntil the problems are corrected, either reinvent it, in other words, \nor lose it.\n  We have not had the cooperation of the White House on that point. \nThat is why I think one of the reasons that the chairman felt necessary \nto zero out this program at this particular time and use the money \nsomeplace where there is a greater need for it.\n  In the process of stating my position in support of the chairman and \nagainst the amendment by the Senator from Maryland, I do not take \nexception to the rationale that the Senator from Maryland or the \nSenator from Massachusetts gave for the necessity of promoting a great \nAmerican tradition of voluntarism. I do not take exception to their \npoints that we need to promote a communitarian spirit within our \nAmerican society. I do not find any fault with anyone who says that we \nought to have as a characteristic Americans giving back to the \ncommunity, because we receive a lot from the community.\n  I do not find any fault with helping people to get education. I do \nnot find any fault with what I have seen on television for the most \npart, although lately there have been some stories that are real \nboondoggles within these programs. Over the vast amount of the TV \ncoverage of this program, I do not find one program of voluntarism that \nI find fault with.\n  Compare what it costs with what the managers and the President said \nthat it would cost. We have a program that, according to the General \nAccounting Office, is costing $26,650 per position. Now, the workers \nget about $13,000 plus.\n  We are in a position where the President said 1 Federal dollar would \nleverage 1 private-sector dollar. The General Accounting Office says \nthat only 8 percent of the $26,650 comes from the private sector.\n  So we have a program that is 40 percent or more in overhead and \nadministrative costs, bureaucratic costs, when that money could better \nbe used going to the worker. If you want to compare this whole program \nwith another use of the money that I do not think we would find any \nfault with, at $26,650 we can finance 18 Pell grants for one person \nbeing educated under the provisions of AmeriCorps.\n  This program is not coming out of the pipeline according to the \nrhetoric that it went into the pipeline. We need to refocus this \nprogram so that the money goes to those who are volunteering and that \nthe programs are within the $13,000 of Federal costs that the President \nand the Director said they would. \n\n[[Page S 14255]]\n\n  This is a period of time when there is a great need to establish very \nstringent budget priorities. The middle-class American taxpayers are \nasking us to balance the budget. They want us to make sure that good \nuse is made of their taxpayers' money. Hard-working taxpayers should \nnot have to fund $18.26 for every hour of community service by \nGovernment-paid volunteers.\n  This Congress is committed to setting priorities that would say the \nmoney ought to be within the cost that the program was enunciated. \nThese were programs that were going to cost much, much less than \n$18.26. These are good goals, but it is a high priced method to \naccomplish the goals of voluntarism when we have $26,650-a-year costs \nper position. If we keep the Federal costs within the $13,000, that \nmeans we are not going to have the high bureaucratic overhead that we \nhave in this program that is pointed out by the General Accounting \nOffice. That is the main reason for my letter to the President, that he \nneeds to reinvent this program or face losing it.\n  I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. This is an amendment \nthat, if passed, would undermine efforts to reform AmeriCorps and only \nensure that the taxpayers' money continues to be wasted in this \nprogram.\n  I hope I come to the floor with some credibility on the issue of \ntrying to consistently support the wise use of taxpayers' money. I \nhope, as has been said by some critics of our effort to reinvent this \nprogram, that it is not a political attack by Republicans on the \nPresident's most-favored program.\n  I remind my colleagues that I have fought for many years against \nwaste of the taxpayers' money, particularly in the Reagan and Bush \nadministration. I fought against waste in the Pentagon. I still \ncontinue my efforts to watchdog the taxpayers' money at the Department \nof Defense.\n  It was well over a year ago before there was such a political price \non this program that I started looking into the AmeriCorps Program, \nthis program that is administered by the Corporation for National \nService.\n  Similar to the Department of Defense under Reagan, AmeriCorps is one \nof the fastest growing programs in the budget. The administration wants \nto spend billions over the next several years of taxpayer dollars on \nthis program. Just as with the Pentagon, I found that there was a \ntremendous waste in the AmeriCorps Program. In many cases, AmeriCorps \ngives the Pentagon a run for its money in the boondoggle department. \nFor example, while the Air Force paid $7,600, as this chart shows, for \na coffee pot, the AmeriCorps Program managed to work with the Navy to \nproduce a $66,715 volunteer.\n  As we remember from a few years ago, the Department of Defense bought \na $600 toilet seat. But the AmeriCorps workers give us a $49,652 \nvolunteer. The Department of Defense a few years ago paid $500 for a \nhammer. But AmeriCorps pays $42,758 for a volunteer in new England.\n  There is no disputing the fact that the coffeepots, the toilet seats, \nand the hammers at the Department of Defense actually work. They \nactually work. There is no doubt in my mind that the volunteers under \nAmeriCorps at the Seaborne Corp., or the Magic Me, or the Youth \nConservation Corps will work. But what we in Government have to do is \nfind a more wise way to use the taxpayer dollars, whether it is with \nthe $7,600 coffeepot at the Department of Defense or whether it is the \n$66,000 volunteer in AmeriCorps.\n  My long experience is that when the Department of Defense and their \nsupporters are confronted with a $500 hammer story, they at least claim \nthat there will be an end to business as usual. They state that there \nare going to be reforms. Frankly, sometimes these reforms are real and \nsometimes they are not very real at the Pentagon.\n  Here with AmeriCorps, we have an amendment that says all is well--\nthat there is nothing wrong with paying nearly $50 an hour for service \nto the community, nothing wrong with 50 percent cost overruns, and \nnothing wrong with the taxpayers footing 92 percent of the bill. When \nit comes to AmeriCorps, $1 of Federal money was going to leverage $1 of \nprivate sector contribution to the program. This amendment is the same \nas Congress saying $500 hammers are completely acceptable, and voting \nto increase the Pentagon's hardware budget.\n  I do not find such waste of taxpayers' money acceptable at the \nPentagon, and I do not find it acceptable at the AmeriCorps Program.\n  So, as I said, I wrote to President Clinton last month offering to \nwork with him to reinvent the AmeriCorps Program. I asked him to sit \ndown with Congress and work cooperatively with us in finding ways to \nhave the AmeriCorps Program meet original goals as defined by the \nPresident of the United States--not by anybody in this Congress--by the \ngoals that he hoped to achieve and the costs of those programs, and the \namount that would come from the private sector and the amount that \nwould come from the taxpayers.\n  Unfortunately, while the President has found the time to give \ninspiring speeches in support of AmeriCorps, he has found no time to \nroll up his sleeves and find common ground with the Congress. It is \nunfortunate at a time when I asked for common ground with the President \nthat he is giving speeches all over the country wanting to find common \nground with the Republican Congress, but never does the common ground \nof the President ever seem to be the same common ground that we ask for \nfrom here.\n  It is unfortunate that many young people could be denied assistance \nto go to college because the administration has refused to sit down and \ntalk with the Congress about reforming AmeriCorps and more efficiently \nusing scarce tax dollars.\n  The administration, at the last hour, at least has responded to our \nletter today. My letter was sent on August 29. The administration has \nfinally sent a letter in response. Frankly, the letter says nothing. \nThe administration has wrapped up its same tired lines and excuses with \na new ribbon. Sadly, it offers nothing new in the way of cooperating \nwith Congress or finding the common ground that is the President's \nwatchword of the last 2 months.\n  In sum, the administration's response says continue to waste the \ntaxpayers' money on these $66,000 volunteers, continue to hire over \n2,000 volunteers to work for the Federal Government, and continue to \nspend half of the money on overhead and administration instead of \nhelping young people pay for college.\n  It reminds me of the story of the emperor's clothes. Everyone in the \nadministration is just too afraid to tell the President that AmeriCorps \nhas no clothes, that it is a boondoggle, at least from the standpoint \nof these high-paying jobs, at least from the standpoint that it is not \nfitting within the $13,000 of Federal costs that the President defined \nas what the programs would cost, at least from the standpoint of $1 of \nFederal money not leveraging $1 from the private sector.\n  The amendment that is before us, as well intended as it might be to \ncontinue the promotion of the communitarian spirit in America, is \nreally just a continuation of the status quo of business as usual.\n  My colleagues should clearly understand though that this amendment is \nnot the life or death of AmeriCorps. This is about whether there will \nbe a reform of AmeriCorps to stop the waste of the taxpayers' money.\n  There will be long discussions with the administration regarding the \nVA-HUD appropriations bill. I am confident that there will be funding \nfor AmeriCorps when the day is done. This amendment is about whether we \nwill undercut efforts to reform this program.\n  So I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. I \nwant them to vote for protecting the taxpayers' money. I want them to \nbe able to help more young people attend college. At the same time, I \nthink we ought to take into consideration that while we are talking \nabout preserving 20,000 AmeriCorps positions, for every one AmeriCorps \nposition, you want to remember that there are 190 young Americans, \ntotaling up I think to 3.9 million Americans, young Americans, I want \nto emphasize--that is by our Department of Commerce figures--who \nvolunteer every year without getting paid for it.\n  We need to remind these volunteers who do not get paid that their \nwork is worthy work, even though they do not get paid. The best way I \nknow to do \n\n[[Page S 14256]]\nthat is to make sure that the President's objective is met of having \nthese positions paid relatively small amounts of money to earn a \nstipend to go to college, to leverage $1 of private sector money for \nevery $1 of Federal money spent, and staying within those guidelines \nthat the President set--not that we set--is the best way to show the \n3.9 million young people who volunteer that their work is appreciated \nas well.\n  Perhaps we can accomplish the President's goals of young people being \neducated, promoting the communitarian spirit, helping people in need, \nwithout jeopardizing either the public sector attempt to do that or a \ngigantic private sector attempt that has been characteristic of \nAmerican society for decades before there was ever a President Clinton.\n  I yield back my unused portion of the 30 minutes and yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I am about to yield 4 minutes to the \nSenator from Illinois, a staunch supporter of national service. He has \nbeen waiting patiently.\n  Before the Senator from Iowa leaves the floor, I would like to say \nthree things. First, I know that the Senator is not out to torpedo the \nprogram but to reform the program. He was one of the first to raise \nconcerns about the program, and as he recalls, I joined with him in the \nGAO report.\n  I also have in my possession the letters that he did send to the \nPresident asking for a reformed framework. I would like to recognize \nand acknowledge the validity of the Senator's concerns about that, and \nI think the Senator should have gotten a better response. I think I was \nowed a better response.\n  Third, I wish to say to the Senator, however, if this amendment goes \ndown, national service is zeroed out. So it will not be about reforming \nnational service; it will be about ending national service. So we will \ntalk more.\n  But I would like to thank the Senator for his work on this issue. I \nthink he raises important points. We disagree on the amendment.\n  I also thank the Senator for the tone in which he presented this \nargument. I think good people can engage in this kind of conversation \nwith civility and keep the focus on the issues. So I would just like to \nthank him.\n  Having said that, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague from Maryland, Mr. President and \nMembers of the Senate.\n  First, I wish to say Senator Grassley has contributed in the area of \nwaste in the area of defense, no question about it. And when he talks \nabout waste, I think we have to take it seriously.\n  I should point out that the figure he uses of $27,000 is the total \namount, including tools and equipment. For example, Judy Wagner of my \nstaff just gave me a report where in one community they built a \nfarmers' market. That includes all the aid equipment. In terms of \nFederal expenditures, it amounts to $17,600 per volunteer. That is a \nvery different thing.\n  Second, I point out to both Senator Grassley and my colleague from \nMissouri, Senator Bond, that some of the abuses they have cited are of \npeople who have worked for the Federal Government. The Mikulski \namendment knocks out service for Federal agencies, and I think properly \nso. So that moves us in the right direction.\n  Back when I was a Member of the House, I held hearings on this whole \nidea of service, and one of the people who testified was Harris \nWofford, our former colleague, who then was President of Bryn Mawr \nCollege in Pennsylvania. I would, frankly, today vote for a 1-year \nrequirement for everyone to serve this Nation in some capacity, and if \nyou wanted to serve in the military, you got a little extra incentive \nof some kind or another, but you had to work for a mental hospital or \npark district or something. Frankly, it was good for me when I served \nin the Army for 2 years to come and be in a mix with a great many \npeople, and I think it is good for others.\n  In terms of return on investment, I quote Stan Litow, an IBM \nexecutive, who reviewed the cost-benefit study and came to the \nconclusion that this program is sound. ``This program works,'' he said.\n  Senator Bond made a reference to CETA. The CETA Program, frankly, was \nfor unemployed people. This is a very different thing, and it brings in \npeople to work together in areas where they have not often worked. This \nis different from the VISTA Program. There is obviously much \ncooperation.\n  I remember being in an impoverished area of Cincinnati. I walked into \na little, one-person store, and there was a man explaining to this \nperson who was running the store how to keep books. I walked out, and I \nthanked him for volunteering to do this. He told me at that point he \nwas the treasurer of Procter & Gamble, and he said, ``I should thank \nyou.'' He said, ``I didn't really understand our country until I \nvolunteered.''\n  I think we have to learn about one another more than we are. We are \ngoing to have to learn what it is like in another neighborhood. I think \nthis is part of that. I read in--this may surprise the Presiding \nOfficer--one of Rush Limbaugh's books--and I confess to having \npurchased two of his books and giving him a little bit of royalty--he \nsaid, ``We are not being asked to sacrifice as Americans today.'' I \nthink he is correct, and this is a way of bringing out the noble in \npeople.\n  Government leaders can appeal to either the noble or the greed in all \nof us, and too often I think we pander to the greed. It is easy. But we \nshould be appealing to the noble. And that is what this program does. I \nthink it is a good program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SIMON. If I may have 30 additional seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I will be happy to yield the Senator an additional \nminute.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague.\n  I remember--and I am sure Senator Mikulski will remember--that during \nthe 1992 campaign when Bill Clinton was going around making speeches, \nthe one line in his speech that got enthusiastic applause was when he \nsaid, ``We are going to establish a volunteer service corps.'' I do not \nimagine the Presiding Officer was at any of those rallies and did not \nhear that line, but it was a response from the American people. They \nlike the idea of appealing to people to volunteer for things.\n  Now, if there are improvements that should be made in the program--\nand there probably are--let us make the improvements. I think the \nMikulski amendment makes some of those improvements. But let us not \nkill the program. That is what we do without an amendment. So I hope my \ncolleagues will vote for the Mikulski amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support the mission of AmeriCorps. I have \nmet the people, young and old, participating in Vermont's program, and \nI have seen the benefits in their faces and in the benefits in their \nfaces and in the communities they serve.\n  Engaging Americans of all ages to help communities solve their own \nproblems is a worthy goal. AmeriCorps builds a sense of community \nresponsibility and is certainly a better investment than the $1 billion \nthis Congress plans to spend for each B-2 bomber.\n  The greatest threat facing our cities and towns today is the loss of \na sense of community responsibility. The best weapon against rising \ncrime, hunger, and illegitimacy is for every American to take an active \ninterest in their community.\n  AmeriCorps provides inspiration by inviting Americans to give \nsomething back--to reestablish the local ties that have been so \nimportant to this country. I cannot think of a better program to invest \nFederal dollars in.\n  Senator Mikulski has been a tireless advocate of the AmeriCorps \nProgram, which now has 20,000 participants from all different \nbackgrounds. The accomplishments of those participants are evident \neverywhere.\n  The 130 AmeriCorps members in Vermont are fighting hunger and \nmalnutrition, improving trails and wildlife habitat in the Green \nMountain National Forest, and helping rural communities develop fire \nprotection plans. Others are helping troubled youths get back on their \nfeet and aiding the blind.\n  AmeriCorps is an experiment that is working. The least we can do is \nto allow that experiment to continue. \n\n[[Page S 14257]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Mikulski's amendment \nproviding funding for the Corporation for National Service in 1996.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Senator Leahy has been a longstanding supporter of \nnational service. I appreciate his remarks.\n  Mr. President, much has been raised about the concerns over the \nfiscal responsibility of national service, and the GAO report, I \nbelieve, shows that we are getting a dollar's worth of services for a \ndollar's worth of taxes. In the interest, also, of not running up the \nprinting cost of the Federal Government, I would like to include only \nthe executive summary of the GAO report in the Congressional Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the executive summary of the GAO report \non the Corporation for National and Community Service be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. General Accounting Office, Health, Education and \n           Human Services Division,\n                                Washington, DC, September 7, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       The Corporation for National and Community Service (the \n     Corporation) administers the AmeriCorps*USA program, the \n     largest national service volunteer program since the 1930s. \n     AmeriCorps*USA participants perform community services that \n     match priorities established by the Corporation, such as \n     addressing educational, environmental, and public safety \n     needs. The Corporation provides grants to individual \n     programs, which obtain additional resources from other \n     federal agencies, state and local governments, and the \n     private sector.\n       While there has been interest in assessing AmeriCorps*USA's \n     cost-effectiveness, such an assessment is difficult because \n     the program has operated for less than a year. We recently \n     reported on total resources available to support \n     AmeriCorps*USA programs in the 1994-95 program year and, to a \n     lesser extent, on benefits of certain programs. We found that \n     total resources available for AmeriCorps*USA participant \n     equaled about $26,700 for program year 1994-95.\\1\\ We also \n     found that, at seven programs we visited, participants were \n     providing benefits to their communities, but we did not \n     attempt to quantify these benefits.\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Recently, in an effort to provide perspective on the \n     potential cost-effectiveness of AmeriCorps*USA programs, a \n     benefit-cost study was conducted of three AmeriCorps*USA \n     programs based on short-term and projected data.\\2\\ The \n     benefit-cost study was commissioned by financial sponsors of \n     the three AmeriCorps*USA programs it examined. The sponsors \n     wanted more information about benefits derived from the \n     programs relative to program costs. These programs were \n     AmeriCorps for Math and Literacy, which targets at-risk \n     children from kindergarten through second grade in Ohio and \n     Texas schools; East Bay Conservation Corps, which addresses \n     environmental needs in California; and Project First, which \n     provides access to computers for students in Georgia, New \n     York, and North Carolina. The study analyzed each program \n     separately, and it did not claim that the three were \n     representative of all AmeriCorps*USA programs. The study \n     estimated that these programs returned between $1.68 and \n     $2.58 for each dollar invested.\n       Based on concerns you and others have raised about the \n     study, you asked us to evaluate it. We agreed to provide an \n     overview of benefit-cost analysis; evaluate how the study's \n     specific methodology compares with that of other benefit-cost \n     analyses, and assess the study's conclusions.\n       To develop this information, we reviewed the study, held \n     extensive discussions with the authors and used some of the \n     study's data to try to replicate its results. However, in \n     most cases we accepted the study's calculations as given and \n     did not verify them. We did our work in August 1995 in \n     accordance with generally accepted government auditing \n     standards.\n\n\n                   benefit-cost analysis: an overview\n\n       Economists typically use benefit-cost analysis to evaluate \n     the worth of particular investment projects. Calculating the \n     ratio of expected benefits to expected costs is one method \n     analysts can use to provide policymakers with evidence as to \n     whether a project is worth undertaking. The analysis results \n     in a benefit-to-cost ratio that is either greater than 1 \n     (meaning the project returns more than $1 per $1 invested) or \n     less than 1 (meaning that less than $1 is returned per $1 \n     invested). The analysis may also compare a variety of \n     investments to see which one returns the greatest benefit per \n     dollar of cost.\n       Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance on benefit-\n     cost analysis of federal programs \\3\\ focuses on the entire \n     economy, thus including net social benefits and costs. Social \n     benefits of federal programs are the value of the program's \n     output to private citizens, and this value is typically \n     difficult to measure. Both direct and indirect benefits are \n     usually included in the analysis. A job-training program, for \n     example, may have the direct benefit of preparing individuals \n     for employment, thus raising their future earnings. It may \n     also have an indirect benefit of reducing welfare payments or \n     crime rates, assuming that, had the individuals not received \n     training, some might have received welfare or committed \n     crimes. Even when the social benefits of a project are clear, \n     attaching a dollar value to them is often problematic.\n       Social costs of a federal program are opportunity costs--\n     the value of the forgone benefits had the program's resources \n     been allocated to their best alternative use. Producing an \n     additional unit of the program's output requires the \n     reallocation of resources away from other productive \n     activity. The opportunity cost of an additional unit of the \n     program's output equals the sacrificed amount of some other \n     productive activity's output occasioned by the resource \n     reallocation. For example, if money used for a federal job-\n     training program were obtained by reallocating funds \n     earmarked for a federal bridge-building program, the \n     opportunity cost of the job-training program would be the \n     value of the services that the new bridges would have \n     provided.\n       Comparing social benefits with social costs allows \n     policymakers to determine whether the value of the output or \n     services gained from a program is greater than the benefits \n     sacrificed elsewhere when resources are reallocated. When the \n     social benefits of a program exceed the social costs, there \n     is a net gain to society from taking resources from elsewhere \n     in the economy and devoting them to the program.\n       The comparison of benefits to costs can be expressed as a \n     benefit-cost ratio (that is, social benefits divided by \n     social costs) or as net benefits (that is, social benefits \n     less social costs). The expression of net benefits is more \n     straightforward. When the comparison is expressed as a ratio, \n     decision must be made about costs that can affect the ratio. \n     For example, if building a bridge will result in time saved \n     by commuters or delivery trucks, this can be seen as a \n     benefit--time gained--or as a negative cost--reduced time \n     lost. Whether it is included as a benefit or as a negative \n     cost affects the magnitude of the ratio but not the \n     underlying economic basis for any decision-making process.\n       Benefit-cost analysis results are typically very sensitive \n     to the underlying assumptions. For example, a small change in \n     the interest rate used to discount a stream of future \n     benefits or costs can have a large impact on the outcome of \n     such an analysis.\\4\\ In addition, including or excluding \n     certain items from either costs or benefits can greatly \n     change the results.\n\n\n               our analysis of the kormendi gardner study\n\n       The goal of the benefit-cost study was to calculate the \n     ratio of social benefits, net of nonfederal costs, to federal \n     costs. On the basis of our review of the study and \n     conversations with the authors, we believe the overall \n     approach of the study appears to be consistent with this \n     goal. Rather than dividing gross social benefits by gross \n     social costs, it subtracted all nonfederal costs from the \n     benefits and then calculated the ratio of the resulting net \n     benefits to federal costs. The choice of what costs to \n     subtract from the numerator, instead of adding to the \n     denominator, affects the magnitude of the ratio, but it \n     cannot affect whether the ratio is above or below 1. Given \n     the goal of the study, the costs that are netted with \n     benefits in the numerator do not seem unreasonable.\n       In addition to decisions about the placement of costs in \n     the numerator or denominator, specific assumptions and other \n     methodological decisions used to calculate components of the \n     ratio affected the results of the study. Further, as the \n     study appropriately recognized, without full program data, \n     comparisons had to be made with historical data for similar \n     programs, and the outcome was influenced by the choice of \n     comparisons.\n\n                        The study's methodology\n\n       The study summed three types of benefits deriving from the \n     AmeriCorps*USA programs: participant benefits, societal \n     benefits, and net donor benefits. Participant benefits \n     included wages, fringe benefits, a ``citizenship'' \n     contribution,\\5\\ an education award,\\6\\ and the value of \n     future education made possible by the award. Societal \n     benefits, as defined in the study, included all benefits that \n     accrued to nonparticipants, such as increased educational \n     attainment or reduced crime and welfare incidence for \n     children who were tutored by AmeriCorps*USA participants. Net \n     donor benefits equaled 0, because donor benefits were assumed \n     to equal donor costs. The study then compared this sum with \n     federal costs. To illustrate, we present these components, \n     along with their values for one of the programs, Project \n     First, in table 1.\n\n             Table 1.--Benefits and Costs for Project First\n\nItem                                                              Value\nBenefits\n  Participant benefits..........................................$25,976\n    Wages and fringe benefits.....................................9,804\n      Federally paid..............................................8,211\n      Donor-paid..................................................1,593\n    Citizenship...................................................8,195\n    Education award...............................................4,725\n    Future education..............................................3,252\n  Net societal benefits..........................................26,330\n\n[[Page S 14258]]\n\n  Net donor benefits................................................  0\n    Donor benefits...............................................10,350\n    (Less) donor costs..........................................-10,350\n                                                             __________\n\n      Total benefits............................................$52,306\n  Costs\nFederally paid participant costs................................$12,396\n  Federally paid wages and fringe benefits........................8,211\n  Education award (federally paid)................................4,725\nFederally paid overhead costs.....................................7,789\n                                                             __________\n\n    Total costs.................................................$20,725\n\n       To determine the benefit-cost ratio for Project First, the \n     study netted nonfederal costs and benefits in the numerator \n     rather than including gross benefits in the numerator and \n     gross costs in the denominator. For example, the benefits for \n     donors of matching funds were assumed to equal the costs, and \n     they were netted in the numerator.\n       A more complex example is the participant's ``future \n     education'' component. According to our conversations with \n     the authors, this component was the difference between (1) \n     future earnings the participant will have with the additional \n     education made possible by the education award and (2) future \n     earnings he or she would have had in the absence of the \n     award.\\7\\ The authors also told us they calculated the \n     difference between these earnings streams net of the \n     participant's labor costs during the year in AmeriCorps*USA--\n     that is, the future education benefit component was \n     calculated subtracting out the participant's labor costs for \n     the program year. The difference between the earnings streams \n     did not include the benefits produced during the year; these \n     were included as societal benefits. Because the costs that \n     were subtracted were federal costs, they had to be added back \n     into the numerator to calculate the desired ratio--social \n     benefits, net of nonfederal costs, relative to federal costs. \n     While the logic the authors described to us is \n     understandable, we did not verify the details of all of the \n     computations.\n       The choice of which costs to net out of benefits, in the \n     numerator, and which to include as costs, in the denominator, \n     is an important one. For example, according to the study, the \n     net value of future education for a Project First participant \n     was $3,252. This was approximately the difference, for the \n     average participant, between a discounted lifetime income of \n     $745,040 with the additional education and $741,790 in the \n     absence of the additional education. One way to measure gross \n     benefits and gross costs would be to include $745,040 as part \n     of the benefit and $741,790 as the lifetime opportunity cost \n     of producing that benefit. This methodology would probably \n     not be an improvement over that of the study; these dollar \n     figures would dominate the ratio relative to other benefits \n     and costs, placing undue importance on this aspect of the \n     entire study.\n       The valuation of benefits deriving from private donations \n     would be optimistic if these donations were partly offset by \n     federal tax deductions. For private sector donors, if part of \n     the benefit were derived from tax deductions, the lost tax \n     revenue should be counted as a cost if taxpayers ultimately \n     have to make up for it. The authors told us that for the \n     three programs analyzed in the study, this factor was not \n     relevant because private donations came from tax-exempt \n     foundations, but this point should be kept in mind for future \n     analyses.\\8\\ In addition, as with the value of future \n     education discussed above, an alternative calculation could \n     include only donor benefits in the numerator and include \n     donor costs in the denominator, rather than netting them to 0 \n     in the numerator. While this would reduce the measured \n     benefit-cost ratio, it could not make it fall below 1, and \n     the measure of net social benefits would be unaffected.\n\n    Other methodological decisions could affect benefit-cost ratios\n\n       The study made several other assumptions and methodological \n     choices that affect the benefit-cost ratios. The study failed \n     to recognize the costs associated with raising tax revenues \n     to pay for new government spending programs. We also believe \n     it may have made an optimistic assumption in one case about \n     results of AmeriCorps*USA participants' work. In addition, as \n     the study noted, benefit-cost ratios given in the study did \n     not incorporate certain unquantifiable benefits, which would \n     raise the reported ratios if they could be included.\n\n              Loss associated with generating tax revenues\n\n       Economists recognize that there are costs associated with \n     raising tax revenues to pay for a new spending program. These \n     costs can arise, for example, as some people change their \n     behavior to avoid paying more taxes. OMB cites an estimated \n     loss of 25 percent due to the process of generating the \n     revenues, and it recommends calculating supplementary \n     benefit-cost ratios including this adjustment to costs. \n     Increasing the programs' cost by 25 percent would diminish \n     the benefit-cost ratio.\n\n                        Perry project comparison\n\n       As an estimate of future gains for preschool students whom \n     AmeriCorps*USA participants tutored, the study used results \n     from the Perry Preschool Project, an intensive intervention \n     in a particular school in the 1960s on which much long-term \n     research has been conducted. The intensity of effort in the \n     Perry Project appeared to be much greater than in the \n     AmeriCorps*USA programs. Comparison with some prior research \n     is necessary, but it may have been optimistic to use the \n     results from the Perry Project. This concern with the study \n     has been raised previously in another assessment.\\9\\\n\n                 Benefits that could not be quantified\n\n       As the study notes, some benefits of AmeriCorps*USA \n     projects could not be quantified and thus were not accounted \n     for in the benefit-cost ratios. During site visits we \n     conducted as part of our earlier study, we observed benefits \n     that may also apply to the three programs the study analyzed, \n     including strengthening communities and fostering civic \n     responsibility. Inclusion of an estimate for the value of \n     these benefits would raise the reported benefit-cost ratios. \n     One of the limitations of benefit-cost analysis is that \n     intangible benefits such as these cannot easily be \n     incorporated into the analysis.\n\n\n                   assessment of study's conclusions\n\n       The study concluded that programs such as the three \n     AmeriCorps*USA programs it reviewed ``generally can be an \n     important societal investment'' because the benefit-cost \n     ratios exceeded 1 ``by a substantial margin.'' As we pointed \n     out earlier, the magnitude of the ratios depends in part on \n     the assumptions and methodological choices that are made. \n     Even if the three AmeriCorps*USA programs' benefit-cost \n     ratios exceeded 1, in an era of constrained federal budgets, \n     the ratios should be compared with those of other programs \n     performing similar services, such as Volunteers in Service to \n     America (VISTA), to see whether AmeriCorps*USA is a more \n     efficient program. As the authors concluded, the three \n     programs they analyzed would appear to be worthwhile federal \n     investments. But until comparisons with other programs are \n     done, decisionmakers will not know whether there are \n     preferable uses of federal funds.\n\n\n                        study authors' comments\n\n       In commenting on a draft of this correspondence, the \n     study's authors told us that they believed we had \n     characterized the study fairly. They thought our breakdown of \n     the benefit and cost components was helpful in illuminating \n     their methodology. They agreed that their results were \n     sensitive to methodological issues such as the choice of \n     comparison groups. They emphasized, however, that a balanced \n     view--which they believed was taken in this correspondence--\n     recognizes that this sensitivity goes in both directions. \n     They said that they stood by their overall conclusions that \n     their results were reasonable and conservative. The authors \n     believe that this type of study should be undertaken for \n     other AmeriCorps*USA programs and for similar federal \n     programs.\n       We are sending copies of this correspondence to the Chief \n     Executive Officer of the Corporation for National and \n     Community Service, the authors of the study, appropriate \n     congressional committees, and other interested parties.

I am pleased to rise in strong support of the Mikulski \namendment to restore funding for the Corporation for National and \nCommunity Service and for AmeriCorps.\n  Mr. President, given all of the attention focused on this issue, it \nis hard to believe that AmeriCorps is just 2 years old.\n  However, AmeriCorps has already created a lasting legacy in thousands \nof American communities. Through the work of over 20,000 full-time \nenergetic and talented volunteers, needy children are receiving \ntutoring, mentoring and other assistance, our national parks are \ncleaner, streets are safer and thousand of homes have been \nrehabilitated for families in need.\n  The Corporation for National and Community Service has also harnessed \nthe efforts of 500,000 senior volunteers and nearly 350,000 school-age \nstudents who are today working in their communities helping to meet \ncritical needs in education, public safety, human service and the \nenvironment.\n  The Corporation's efforts are already making an incredible difference \nin America's communities. In my State of Connecticut, AmeriCorps \nsponsors 20 different programs. The largest, leadership, education and \nathletics in partnership in New Haven, has 164 members working with \nneedy children providing tutoring and mentoring. During the summer \nmonths, many of the volunteers live in the community housing projects \nand work with the children throughout the summer months.\n  A recent study of the work of just 8 percent of AmeriCorps volunteers \nfound the volunteers were having an extraordinary impact. Nearly 8,000 \npre-school and elementary students were tutored in basic education; \n17,000 needy people were fed, and thousands of school hallways were \nmade safer.\n  AmeriCorps has also made a significant difference in the lives of \nvolunteers--who not only gain knowledge and satisfaction from their \nwork but who also are able to pursue additional education and training \nand pay off student loans. After devoting their energies to rebuilding \ntheir communities, volunteers received a modest post-service \neducational benefit of $4,725.\n  This makes a substantial difference for today's students as student \nindebtedness rises to alarming levels. More than half of all AmeriCorps \nmembers come from families with household incomes between $15,000 and \n$50,000--the average family income was $33,500 overall--the very \nfamilies who find the educational award so important in helping to \nmanage the spiraling costs of college.\n  Mr. President, I know personally what a difference voluntary service \ncan make in a young person's life. Over 30 years ago, hundreds of young \nAmericans answered President Kennedy's call to service in the Peace \nCorps. I was one of them, and was sent to the Dominican Republic for 2 \nof the most rewarding years of my life. I would like to think that the \nmaternity hospital I helped construct has made a lasting difference in \nthat community. But I certainly know that the experience made an \nincredible difference in my life.\n  Mr. President, the benefits of national and community service may be \nlost here in Congress, but they are not lost on the American public. \nThe vast majority of Americans support the AmeriCorps Program. A recent \nGallop Poll showed that 91 percent of Americans supported national \nservice. A Los Angeles Times poll indicated that 70 percent of \nAmericans like this program--including 60 percent of Republicans and \nconservatives.\n  Mr. President, we cannot afford to lose this program to the pitfalls \nof partisan infighting. I would hope my colleagues would join me in \nvoting for the Mikulski amendment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I want to offer my support for Senator Mikulski's \namendment. I was a skeptic of this program when it was first proposed. \nIt sounded too expensive, and the concept of stripended service seemed \nincongruous with voluntarism.\n  That was before I had a chance to see the positive impact of this \nprogram on the ground in my own State of Rhode Island. Young people \nfrom all walks of life have gone into a number of communities to help \nclean up neighborhoods, improve the literacy of inner city school \nchildren, and to improve public safety and the environment.\n  Let me give you an example of what we are finding in Rhode Island. \nTwo years ago, Marilyn Concepcion was a high school dropout. Getting \nthat far was an accmplisment; no one in her family had ever gone beyond \nthe sixth grade. This 19-year-old woman joined Rhode Island City Year, \nan AmeriCorps program, to earn her GED certificate.\n  With training from the City Year staff, Concepcion began to tutor and \nmentor a group of first graders. She taught them to read, taught \nEnglish as a second language, gave them insight into the value of \nlearing, the importance of an education. Some of these children had \nnever been given the type of encouragement that Marilyn Concepcion \nprovided.\n  The short-term impact Marilyn Concepcion had on these children's \nlives has been measurable. They pay attention more in school, their \nself-esteem has been increased. But the real impact, the most concrete \neffect on their lives may not be felt for another 10 to 12 years, when \nthese children become members of the work force or go onto college.\n  Spurred by the positive influence she'd had on her students, Marilyn \nConcepcion decided she wanted to go to college. She applied to, and was \naccepted by, Brown University. She became the first recipient of \nBrown's offer to match the $4,700 AmeriCorps educational award--a \nchallenge grant program just announced by a number of universities and \ncolleges in our State.\n  If this is the kind of results we are obtaining with only 1 year of \nexperience, I think it is only fair that we let this program continue \nfor some period of time to better evaluate its performance.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by my colleague from Maryland which restores $425 million to \nAmeriCorps.\n  Let me begin by saying that if the Senate is interested in engaging \nin a productive debate on the accomplishments of AmeriCorps--and on \nreal suggestions for improving the program --I would welcome that \ndebate. Very few programs managed by government at any level couldn't \nbe made better, and wouldn't benefit from an ongoing public review. The \namendment offered by the Senator from Maryland both saves AmeriCorps \nand, in my judgement, improves it.\n  And AmeriCorps is worth saving, Mr. President. It is worth saving \nbecause, as the General Accounting Office stated in its August l995 \nreport, ``at the grantees' sites we visited, we found that the projects \nhad been designed to strengthen communities, develop civic \nresponsibility, and expand educational opportunities for program \nparticipants.''\n  How do we identify the catalysts for vesting our people in our \nNation? How can we encourage our children to feel an obligation and a \nresponsibility to contribute to the strength and security of America \nthroughout their lives?\n  Military service is one way. And civilian national service is \nanother.\n  What does America get from a single individual's intense and all \nencompassing period of service?\n  Is it possible that those who work for a year to combat illiteracy \nwill be forever committed to a good education for each child in the \ncity or town in which they live?\n  Is it possible that those who work for a year to fight poverty will \nremember forever the importance of opportunity?\n  Is it possible that those who work for a year to hold together a \ncrumbling neighborhood will never forget the responsibility of every \nman and woman to build and to sustain?\n  It is my hope that national service will be a catalyst for a lifetime \nof community service. It is my hope that experiencing the tangible \nresults of strengthening and teaching will convince our people that \ncitizenship has value, that individuals who roll up their sleeves and \nenter the fray can personally make something richer and stronger.\n  With every national service slot we fund, Mr. President, we give \nanother American an intense, all encompassing, opportunity to serve. \nAnd by investing in them, we gamble that they will then invest in us.\n  I am willing to take that gamble, Mr. President. I am willing to \nreach for something to help fight this giant malaise that seems to \npermeate so many of \n\n[[Page S 14260]]\nour citizens. I am willing to grab a tiny particle of idealism and see \nhow far we can take it.\n  I am willing to work to make AmeriCorps better, Mr. President. And I \nam willing to oppose any attempt to eliminate its funding.\n  Churchill once said, ``We make a living by what we get, we make a \nlife by what we give.'' In national service, Mr. President, we allow \nour citizens to give. I urge my colleagues to support this important \namendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend my friend, Senator Sarbanes, for his leadership on this issue, \nand lend my support to his amendment which would restore funding for \nhomeless assistance.\n  Mr. President, homelessness is a problem that the American people \nwant solved. The number of homeless Americans has grown steadily over \nthe last three decades and it will continue to grow until we \nresponsibly address the issue of homelessness. Studies put the number \nof homeless at more than 600,000 people on any given night. It is even \nmore shocking to find that children are now the fastest growing portion \nof this homeless population. As a caring Nation, we must no longer \nignore this growing and often overlooked part of our population. I \nfirmly believe that every citizen deserves not only a place to sleep at \nnight, but a real opportunity to improve their lives. Our national \nefforts must focus on helping these families.\n  Senator Sarbanes' amendment restores $360 million for homeless \nassistance funding to the fiscal year 1996 VA-HUD appropriations bill, \nbringing the funding level back up to fiscal year 1995 levels. These \nfunds will enable local governments, communities, and nonprofits to \nform comprehensive, flexible and coordinated strategies for ending \nhomelessness. These funds will help local agencies leverage additional \nmoney needed to aid homeless people with disabilities, create more \nhousing and provide the services and facilities needed to move people \ninto situations where they can live independently.\n  Restoring homeless assistance funding to 1995 levels is also an \nimportant part of the authorizing committee's effort to reform HUD in \ngeneral and specifically to reform our delivery of homeless assistance. \nLast year's Senate Banking Committee bill created a single formula \ngrant program which would replace the seven different categorical grant \nprograms at HUD. This formula grant will allow better coordination of \nhomeless services at the local level and facilitate better planning as \nfunding levels become more predictable. The VA-HUD bill allows for this \nformula but does not provide adequate funding. The funds restored in \nthis amendment will raise homeless assistance funding to a level that \nwill allow a formula approach to make sense.\n  Unfortunately, no matter how we restructure HUD, during the \ntransition some people are going to fall through the cracks. The \nhomeless programs are the safety net that catches them.\n  Mr. President, earlier this year I had a chance to meet with Lucie \nMcKinney and she reminded me of her late husband's tireless efforts and \ndetermination to end the cycle of homelessness. We must do all we can \nto continue Stewart McKinney's work.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \namendment to ensure the survival of AmeriCorps, today's commitment to \nnational service throughout the country and in my State of West \nVirginia. I was proud to be an original cosponsor of the legislation \nthat created AmeriCorps.\n  I know something about the importance of public service because of \nthe VISTA program back in 1964. After President Kennedy issued his \nfamous call for serving our country, I went to West Virginia through \nthe VISTA program and to a place called Emmon that changed the course \nof my life.\n  AmeriCorps is a wise and meaningful investment in our country's \nfuture. Whenever I am home talking to West Virginians of every age, I \nsee heads nod when the idea of national service comes up. West \nVirginians and our fellow Americans believe in the values of service \nand responsibility, and AmeriCorps is a very exciting, important way \nfor these values to have meaning. It is incredible to see this \nappropriations bill include a retreat from one of the most exciting \ninitiatives taken in the recent years. We should be working together to \nrenew and reinvigorate service, especially by our young people, and not \nretreat from it.\n  There is a great deal of talk about solving problems at the local \nlevel and working in communities. I agree and I believe that AmeriCorps \nis one Federal program that successfully delivers on this promise. For \nevery Federal dollar invested in AmeriCorps, we reap as much as $2.60 \nin return.\n  While it is important to note that AmeriCorps is a cost-effective \nprogram, I know it is more compelling to talk about what AmeriCorps has \ndone for communities.\n  In West Virginia, the AmeriCorps program places workers at seven \ndomestic violence shelters to help battered women and children with a \nrange of issues. I have visited a shelter in West Virginia and was \ndeeply touched by the need to help women and their children caught in \nviolent homes. This is important community work, and AmeriCorps is \nhelping make a difference.\n  My State also sponsors Project HEALTH--Health Education Associates \nLearning to Teach Health--which places 20 AmeriCorps members in 15 \nsites that focus on promoting health care in rural areas. This is a \nunique partnership program with the Kellogg Foundation, my State, and \nAmeriCorps. AmeriCorps workers will be promoting child immunizations, \nworking to reduce the prevalence of low birth weight, and promoting \nhealthy behaviors.\n  AmeriCorps members are also involved in a West Virginia project \ncalled Energy Express. This is an innovative summer program for \ndisadvantaged children that combines remedial education and child \nnutrition. Energy Express also works to promote parental involvement \nwith a child's education which is a goal we all share.\n  I could go on and on about the extraordinary work by AmeriCorps and \nthe other service programs sponsored in my State. We have more than \n20,000 West Virginians participating in public service initiatives \nthanks to the leadership and encouragement of the Corporation for \nNational and Community Service. There are 189 West Virginians in \nAmeriCorps, and others are involved in VISTA, RSVP, the Retired and \nSenior Volunteer Program, and ``Learn and Service'' in the schools. The \nCorporation for National and Community Service weaves all of these \nimportant incentives together.\n  As we talk about the need to strengthen our communities and to solve \nproblems at the grassroots, we should continue our support for \nAmeriCorps, which reflects this basic goals.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two West Virginia \narticles be printed in the Record. These pieces tell the story of \nAmeriCorps in West Virginia more eloquently than I can.\n  There being on objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Americorps Comes Under GOP Scrutiny\n\n                          (By Cheryl Caswell)\n\n       Americorps, President's Clinton's pet project for \n     encouraging community service and education, is one the \n     firing line as Republicans carry out their program to slash \n     government spending.\n       But his first recruits may be too busy to pay much \n     attention.\n       In West Virginia, nearly 60 Americorps workers are studying \n     archaeological sites and inoculation records, building \n     shelters, tutoring children, developing leadership clubs and \n     drug prevention programs, housecleaning for the handicapped, \n     studying stream erosion and assisting farmers and domestic \n     violence victims.\n       ``The great value I got in it is that they are not just \n     doing work, but developing an emotional tie to the \n     community,'' said Joan Ambratte, director of the state \n     Commission for National and Community Service.\n       ``They are getting a sense that they are responsible for \n     the future,'' she said. ``And these are the people who are \n     going to take over as leaders in the next 30 years, the ones \n     who will step forward and serve in the legislature and on \n     boards.''\n       Ambroge's commission came under direct assault by some \n     state Republicans who hoped to end its funding and end \n     Americorps here, but the appropriations passed.\n       At the national level, many in the Republican party are \n     calling for a $416 million cut to the Americorps program. \n     President Clinton has asked instead for a $300 million \n     increase and hopes to extend the program to another 27,000 \n     recruits.\n       ``There are many critics of this,'' she admitted of the \n     program labeled by Newt Gingrich as ``coerced volunteerism.''\n\n[[Page S 14261]]\n\n       ``But few people can devote this much time to community \n     service. * * * the local level, all non-profits are going to \n     need more support. Americorps in the perfect vehicle for \n     that.''\n       Americorps recruits workers for 1,700 hours--about a year--\n     earning $4.50 or more plus day care and medical benefits. At \n     the end of their term, they get a credit of $4,725 to pay for \n     education or existing college loans.\n       In Charleston, Sue Sayre, 50, is trading a year of serving \n     battered women for that payback. She intends to return to \n     college next fall.\n       ``The money was an incentive,'' she said. ``But these women \n     needed help. It's a new experience every day for me.''\n       There were more than 200 applicants for Sayre's position \n     alone.\n       Hopeful recruits similarly stormed all of the Americorps \n     hiring sites statewide--some federal agencies and some non-\n     profit organizations.\n       The federal directive for Americorps did catch many of them \n     short. It promised lots of money if they would use the \n     government funded volunteers. The deadlines to submit \n     requests for money and their plans to use it sent the \n     hopefuls scrambling to make it work for them.\n       ``Part of the plan was that they were not to do work that \n     we were already doing with other personnel,'' said Pat \n     Bowman, who works for the national resources conservation \n     service. ``It was like, `Hey, it would be nice if we could \n     have somebody to do this.' ''\n       Bowen said his federal office greatly needed someone to \n     travel the state evaluating potential archaeological sites \n     that might be damaged by development, erosion or other means. \n     When he secured funds and volunteers, he recruited a young \n     man with a master's degree in archaeology from the University \n     of Glasgow in Scotland.\n       In fact, three of his five volunteers have master's \n     degrees, but Bowen doesn't see that as out of line with the \n     Americorps concept.\n       ``If they could come out of school and get a job in their \n     industry, they'd make a lot more pay than we're providing,'' \n     Bowen said. ``But they all have a desire to provide service \n     while they gain experience. It's like a domestic Peace \n     Corps.''\n       Joetta Wright of Fairmont graduated from West Virginia \n     University with a bachelor's degree in sociology. She began \n     her graduate work and then quit for financial reasons.\n       Now she works as an AmeriCorps volunteer at a domestic \n     violence shelter in her hometown, answering the hotline and \n     helping victims.\n       Tommy Adkins, 21, is working with poor Lincoln County \n     residents to establish a barter system with their local \n     businesses. He also spends part of his time in Jackson \n     County, trying to boost the business community there.\n       In Kanawha County, five AmeriCorps volunteers have helped \n     to review more than 5,000 records of pre-schoolers at the \n     Kanawha-Charleston Health Department in an attempt to catch \n     them up on their inoculations.\n       Andy Johnston, coordinator of their work for the Regional \n     Family Resource Network, said his agency got 18 volunteers \n     altogether and hopes to see funding increased so they can add \n     more.\n       ``What AmeriCorps can do is be the pickup piece that \n     encourages people to go get more education,'' he said.\n       Among Johnston's recruits, one had once been homeless. \n     Three currently live in public housing, and two receive \n     public assistance for their own children. Two are college \n     graduates, and one is seeking a master's degree.\n       ``In West Virginia, we're exceeding all our objectives,'' \n     said Ambrose, state director.\n       ``The volunteers have broken the belief that one person \n     can't make a difference,'' she said. ``They are doing real \n     work and dealing with the real challenges of change.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                     AmeriCorps Means Win, Win, Win\n\n                          (By Rachel Tompkins)\n\n       Eric Stone, 22, thought he would never be able to save \n     enough money to go to college. Many people told him he was \n     bright, clearly college material, but no one in his family \n     had gone, so he had no example of how to do it. Then he read \n     about AmeriCorps.\n       Today, Eric works as an AmeriCorps member at Chandler \n     School Family Resource Center and the Roger Switzer Community \n     Center in Kanawha County. He's earning the minimum wage and \n     at the end of his year of service, he will have an additional \n     $4,725 in trust to spend on college. One more year of service \n     and he will have enough to pay his tuition and fees at a West \n     Virginia public college.\n       In the past six months since AmeriCorps began in West \n     Virginia, 30 AmeriCorps members, like Eric, have been working \n     in two community-based organizations: the Regional Family \n     Resource Network in Kanawha County and the Coalition Against \n     Domestic Violence based in Sutton, Braxton County. An \n     additional 30 AmeriCorps members work in West Virginia for \n     various U.S. Department of Agriculture agencies, the \n     Children's Health Fund in Cabell and Wayne counties and the \n     National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n       West Virginia AmeriCorps members range in age from 19 to \n     55. Some have GEDs, or are just out of college, while others \n     have been out of school many years. All are committed to \n     obtaining more education. Some of those working for the \n     Coalition Against Domestic Violence are victims of abuse \n     themselves.\n       Some examples of AmeriCorps work in West Virginia include:\n       Reviewing 5,000 immunization records and scheduling 1,000 \n     children for overdue immunizations.\n       Scheduling two community health clinics in underserved \n     areas.\n       Expanding the Parents as Teachers program.\n       Creating two new after-school programs serving 84 children.\n       Helping 100 families use a common application for a variety \n     of social, health and education services.\n       Expanding programs about domestic violence awareness in \n     high schools in Southern West Virginia leading to four \n     specific referrals.\n       Providing multiple assistance to victims of domestic \n     violence on hot lines and in shelters in eight communities.\n       Unless the national budget cutters prevail, this program \n     will expand in West Virginia during 1995 and serve twice as \n     many AmeriCorps members. As a taxpayer, an educator and the \n     parent of two college-age children, I'm convinced this \n     program ought to be continued and indeed, ought to expand.\n       AmeriCorps is a win, win, win program. First, local \n     community groups apply for AmeriCorps members to support \n     local projects that need extra help. No one in the state or \n     federal government tells communities what they need. Second, \n     AmeriCorps members who go to work for local groups get things \n     done. The jobs are real work that simply wouldn't get done \n     without the time and talents of AmeriCorps members. \n     AmeriCorps members also get important work experience that \n     will help in future job searches. Finally, each AmeriCorps \n     member puts away $4,725 toward post-secondary education or \n     toward paying off college loans.\n       During the just concluded legislative session, Gov. \n     Caperton proposed, and the Legislature enacted a bill \n     continuing the West Virginia Commission for National and \n     Community Service to oversee the implementation of AmeriCorps \n     and to promote service and volunteering in West Virginia. \n     Debate on that bill reported in this newspaper suggested that \n     AmeriCorps members were merely overpaid baby sitters. That is \n     simply not it.\n       I know it is fashionable today to be against government \n     programs and especially fashionable for Republicans to oppose \n     this program so closely identified with President Clinton. \n     But AmeriCorps builds on America's tradition of volunteerism \n     and community service, and adds a new program to the more \n     than 30 years of positive experiences of the Peace Corps, \n     VISTA, the National Senior Corps and Learn and Serve. All of \n     these programs have had strong bipartisan support over the \n     years.\n       My hope is that West Virginia's elected representatives \n     state and federal, Republican and Democrat will visit these \n     programs, talk with AmeriCorps members, and consider the \n     value of the program to West Virginia citizens and \n     communities. Eric Stone and his colleagues will be happy to \n     share their stories.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of my \ncolleagues from Maryland's amendment that would restore funding to \nAmeriCorps.\n  I stand behind this program not from reading the glossy brochures \nthat highlight its achievements. I believe in the work that AmeriCorps \ndoes from seeing young adults in my State coming together for a common \ngoal. I have met these students and witnessed their accomplishments, \nand must tell you that communities throughout my State are praising \ntheir work.\n  From AmeriCorps members providing gang intervention in Olympia \nschools to rehabilitating damaged watersheds in Lacey to providing \nemergency assistance to disabled elderly in Pasco to delivering meals \nto HIV-positive patients in Tacoma, Americorps is working across my \nState.\n  Let's put the partisan politics behind us. This is not anyone's \nprogram. It is America's program serving our Nation by making our \nstreets safer, our environment cleaner, our children healthier, and our \nschools better.\n  Certainly, cries of deficit reduction have wrapped themselves around \nthis debate. However, the return on America's Federal dollar has been \nproven to be quite substantial in recent studies. A research report \nconducted last year by the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory \nlooked at two Washington State Americorps projects in Hoquiam and Lake \nChelan.\n  For every Federal dollar spent on these two AmeriCorps projects, a \n$2.40 return can be expected. Even beyond the many direct skills and \nexperiences derived from AmeriCorps participants that cannot be \nmeasured in dollars and cents, monetary benefits were still found to \nsubstantially exceed costs.\n  Mr. President, I wonder how my colleagues can look these young people \nin the eye and tell them that Congress has pulled the plug on an \nopportunity that shapes their future while improving our communities. I \nstrongly urge \n\n[[Page S 14262]]\nmy fellow Members to think critically about what we fund that truly \nmakes a difference in the lives of our next generation. Americorps is \nthe answer that provides a cost-effective solution to meeting many of \nour Nation's concerns.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment offered by my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, to \nrestore funding to the Corporation for National and Community Service. \nWhen the conference report on the National and Community Service Trust \nAct of 1993 came before the Senate for final approval, I was proud to \ncast my vote in favor of this important legislation and I am equally \nproud to stand before the Senate today to reaffirm my support for the \nCorporation and its mission.\n  Signed into law on September 21, 1993, the National Service Act has \nhelped to renew the ethic of civic responsibility and the spirit of \ncommunity service while also providing critical assistance to needy \ncommunities throughout the Nation. The measure has also encouraged and, \nmore importantly, provided the opportunity for thousands of Americans \nto give of themselves for the greater good while earning money to \nfurther their education. In my view, the legislation effectively merges \neducation and service, two critical components of a healthy society.\n  Now, several of my colleagues in stating their opposition to \ncontinued funding for the National Service Corporation have expressed \nthe view that it is not the role of the Federal Government to subsidize \ncommunity service; that to pay volunteers through a Federal program \nruns contrary to the spirit of local community-based service. I would \nurge those who hold this view to look to history. Our society and the \nunique form of government we enjoy was built on the strength of \nnational service and, in my view, fostering the investment in and \nproviding the leadership for increased opportunity to serve is a \nresponsibility we all share.\n  Mr. President, Americorps, the centerpiece of the national service \nprogram, is not one large Federal program, but a network of locally \ndeveloped and locally managed service corps which gives thousands of \nyoung people the opportunity to serve their country while improving the \nlives of themselves and their neighbors. Moreover, the initial \ninvestment we have made has encouraged increased private sector \ninvolvement in community service programs, including Americorps.\n  I encourage opponents of national service to look carefully at the \nsuccess of many of the Americorps programs operating in communities \nacross the United States. Information gathered from site visits by the \nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) indicate that an overwhelming majority \nof the programs across the country serve their purpose. In my State of \nMaryland, the Montgomery County Police Department is operating a \nCommunity Assisting Policing program designed to engage volunteers in \neducation and outreach efforts to control and prevent crime and to \nreduce fear in at-risk communities. The GAO found that participants \nwere involved in such projects as organizing a school Crime Awareness \nDay, teaching senior citizens how to protect themselves from crime, and \nanalyzing neighborhood crime statistics to identify problem areas.\n  The GAO also visited MAGIC ME America, a nonprofit organization \nfounded in Baltimore in 1980. The central mission of the MAGIC ME \norganization, which operated three AmeriCorps programs nationwide, is \nto motivate and educate teens by involving them in local community \nservice projects. The GAO reported that participants in the MAGIC ME \nProgram in Baltimore found that the program helped them to build their \nself-esteem and confidence and that all three participants interviewed \nplanned to use their education awards to start or return to college. \nAdditionally, staff members at three of the area facilities served by \nAmeriCorps volunteers stated that their presence was a key ingredient \nto the program. With the help of the AmeriCorps Program, MAGIC ME \nestimates that they have been able to increase the number of people \nserved by over 800 percent in their three AmeriCorps Program sites.\n  Mr. President, it is my view that national service, and those who \nparticipate in national service represent the best of our Nation. In \nthe tradition of the Peace Corps and VISTA, AmeriCorps strengthens the \nbeliefs and values that are at the very root of American citizenship--\nthe tradition of serving others, the value of taking personal \nresponsibility for ourselves and our communities, and the belief that \nto who much is given, much is expected. Through programs like \nAmeriCorps we provide our Nation with both an opportunity and an \nobligation. National service requests a contribution to the community \nwhile providing individuals with the opportunity to develop skills \nwhich will serve them well throughout their lives.\n  As I have indicated through examples in my own State, the national \nservice program is effective; it does work. At a time when we as a \nsociety are searching for ways in which to strengthen our families and \nour communities it would be foolhardy to abandon this national service \ninitiative. I urge my colleagues to join me in applauding those who \nhave answered the call to service through AmeriCorps and other national \nservice opportunities. These individuals are taking part in the oldest \nand best of America's traditions--the spirit of service--and they \ndeserve our support.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Does the Senator from Massachusetts wish to speak?\n  I note the absence of a quorum, and ask that it be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask the Presiding Officer, how much time does my side \nhave left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes, 51 seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would like to yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts. And I look forward to his discussions, as well as the \nchart.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator from Maryland very much.\n  Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity to respond to some of the \nissues and questions that have been raised about the AmeriCorps and the \ncosts for this program. And I listened, even though I was not on the \nfloor, to both the response by the Senator from Maryland as well as the \nSenator from Illinois, Senator Simon, about some of the points that \nhave been raised about AmeriCorps working with governmental agencies \nand how that issue is addressed in the Senator's amendment.\n  That has been an issue that had been brought up and examined during \nthe course of the review of the AmeriCorps. And I believe that the \namendment that has now been before the Senate responds to that \nparticular issue and question.\n  Second, I listened to those who have talked about AmeriCorps and the \ncost of the program, and also how much is expended in costs that are \nrelated to the AmeriCorps volunteer. I think it is important that we \nunderstand the terms that are being used and the costs that are being \nallocated to the different projects.\n  I have a chart here, Mr. President. I understand that this presents a \nbreakdown of the total cost per member by category. I think there is \nsome confusion about what the costs are in terms of the member. And I \nthought I would review this chart because I think it illustrates by \nthis chart exactly what is being expended for the AmeriCorps and the \ncosts which are related to the service of an AmeriCorps member. We are \ntalking about two different items, and it has been very easy for those \nwho have been opposed to this program to try to somehow lump all of \nthose together and give a distorted view as to actually what is \nexpended on behalf of the AmeriCorps volunteer.\n  For each AmeriCorps volunteer the Corporation spends $6,200 on the \nstipend over the course of the year. This represents 33 percent. We \nhave the education award, which is $4,700. We have the health care, \nwhich is $1,200. Those all go into the costs. And then we have the \nAmeriCorps overhead at 7 percent.\n  I wonder how many of the governmental agencies are able to have an \nadministrative cost at that figure--at \n\n[[Page S 14263]]\nsome 7 percent--which is very impressive, and indicates that for every \ndollar that is actually expended, only a small amount of that dollar is \nused for program administration.\n  The State commissions that ensure that the programs are actually \ngoing to be a service in the State--really a State function for the \nAmeriCorps programs--is a small percentage, 2 percent.\n  Now, the other programs which are related in terms of the general \ncosts are what are considered local program operations. This is the \n$4,300 over here. These are the tools by which the AmeriCorps volunteer \nis able to make the voluntary contribution. This is for projects like \nhousing rehabilitation. These are the saws, the hammers, the nails, the \nequipment the AmeriCorps member is using.\n  There have been those on the floor of the Senate who have taken this \nfigure, whether in this average figure where it is $4,300, 24 percent--\nor whether it would be even larger, depending on the particular program \nand have put it all in overhead to somehow say that the costs of the \nAmeriCorps Program is far in excess of what was estimated and far out \nof control.\n  That kind of confused calculation has been done with regard to the \nNavy's Seaborne Conservation Corps program. We have heard about the \ncosts per participant being $66,000. I have the excellent response by \nCongressman Green that analyzes those figures to show that at the \nbottom line, the actual costs were $16,641.\n  Now, people can come on this floor and use this other figure which \nrepresents funding for the organization, so to speak, in which the \nAmeriCorps members are actually working. They can repeat it and repeat \nit and repeat it, but it does not make it any more accurate.\n  I think that it is important that we understand that.\n  Mr. President, earlier when I spoke about the participation of the \nprivate sector, there was a comment made about the contributions that \nwere being made to match the AmeriCorps. I think it is important to \nhave a complete response on that, as well.\n  We know that the 7 percent, which is actually the figure named in the \nlegislation authorizing AmeriCorps, requiring leveraging of private \nsupport was far exceeded. In its first year, AmeriCorps raised $91 \nmillion in matching funds, nearly three times the amount required by \nlaw; $41 million came from the private sector, more than $32 million \nlegally required from all sources. Over 600 businesses, from local \nconcerns to national corporations like IBM and General Electric, have \ndirectly contributed money, uniforms, tools, equipment, and training.\n  And therefore, again, if you use selective figures to try to downplay \nthe private sector's contribution, you can make a debater's point, but \nit is not an accurate reflection of reality. The figures I have given \nshow the real participation and contributions that have been made. And \nI think, Mr. President, an even a greater indication of the value of \nAmeriCorps is not just what I say about this private-sector \nparticipation, but what the leaders of the various voluntary agencies \nand the other project leaders have said about AmeriCorps. There have \nbeen the most commendable and enthusiastic statements, across the \nboard. In a number of instances these statements come from some by \nthose who were skeptical about the whole program and ended up being \nenthusiastic about what these volunteers really mean.\n  Mr. President, both those who have supported AmeriCorps and those \nopposed to it have evaluated the service and the corps. You find out \nthat even by the minimum evaluation, about two and a half times the \nbenefit comes back from the expenditures. This is demonstrated by a \ncost analysis of the program.\n  So, Mr. President, I think the points that have been made earlier by \nthe Senator from Maryland in terms of the costs of the program, in \nterms of the private participation, and responding to the criticisms \nthat are made about involving the AmeriCorps with governmental \nagencies, all are extremely important issues that should be responded \nto. And I think we have tried to do that this afternoon.\n  I just say, finally, we want to keep our eyes on one important point, \nthe $4,700, the educational award, is also eliminated in this \nappropriations bill. And this is at a time when we are cutting on \nstudent loan programs. We reported out of our committee earlier today \nwhat is effectively a tax on every college in this country, based upon \nthe amount of the student loan programs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Can I have 2 or 3 more minutes?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield the Senator from Massachusetts 2 more minutes \nto conclude his remarks.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at a time when we are cutting back on the \nstudent loan program, or at least making it much more expensive, this \nprogram is out there. These individuals, by and large, are involved \nbecause they want to give something back to the community. Their \ngreatest reward is not only their personal satisfaction and service to \nthe community, but an opportunity for education, which is certainly a \nmatter of national interest.\n  Finally, I will include in the Record, Mr. President, the number of \ncolleges that are matching these education awards. Hampshire College in \nmy own State--and I will include in the Record a number of the schools \nand colleges that are matching these education awards two and three \ntimes in recognition of the service these young and old people are \nproviding for the community. I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-nine minutes, 43 seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to yield the Senator from Arizona 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the Senator from \nMissouri yielding time.\n  I appreciate what both he and the Senator from Iowa have done in \npointing out some of the problems with this new program that is called \nAmeriCorps. My position is that at this time of severe budgetary crisis \nin this country, at a time when we are trying to balance the Federal \nbudget, it is not the time to be starting new Federal programs with \nsubstantial expenses which, frankly, are not cost beneficial in terms \nof the degree of support that it provides to the American people.\n  As a brand new program, AmeriCorps costs American taxpayers $367 \nmillion in 1994, and the GAO estimates that AmeriCorps costs nearly \n$27,000 for each volunteer. It is not an effective jobs or education \nprogram, and I submit, Mr. President, that it is not going to increase \nvoluntarism in this country or in my home State of Arizona.\n  For example, the Arizona AmeriCorps Program, called the Border \nVolunteer Corps, was one of the largest programs. It received $2.6 \nmillion in the 1994 and 1995 service year. But it will not be federally \nfunded this year through the Corporation for National Service. The \nreason is because the Arizona-Mexico Commission, the Arizona sponsor, \npulled out because of alleged mismanagement of this program.\n  It seems to me that groups such as the Salvation Army, groups in \nArizona like Arizona Clean and Beautiful, Crime Victim Foundation, St. \nMary's and Andre House food bank, and others that provide volunteer \nservice in the State commit millions of hours to voluntarism every \nyear.\n  We know today, Americans 18 and up volunteer 19.5 billion hours of \ntheir time, which is a 50-percent increase in the number of hours since \n1981. Turning voluntarism into a wide-scale public jobs project, it \nseems to me, will undermine public philanthropy. We are doing well in \nvolunteering in this country, not paying people to be volunteers.\n  Moreover, as other speakers have pointed out, AmeriCorps is not based \non need. Certainly, today in our effort to prioritize where Federal \ndollars are going, Federal higher education dollars, if that is what \nthese are targeted to be, should be targeted toward those who are most \nin need of assistance. AmeriCorps does not promote voluntarism because \nit is not a volunteer program. Students are paid $7,400 for work and \ngiven $4,750 toward education costs for 2 years. In addition, \nrecipients are guaranteed health and child care benefits. \n\n[[Page S 14264]]\n\n  For the average $20,000 to $30,000 cost per year per student in \nAmeriCorps, eight needy students could receive Pell grants at $2,400 \neach. Eight needy students--and that is the definition of the \nqualification for Pell grants--could be served with this same amount of \nmoney, in other words, that we pay for one AmeriCorps volunteer.\n  A $20,000 stipend is worth more than the individual income of nearly \n40 million working Americans. That is what we are paying these \nAmeriCorps so-called volunteers.\n  Examples of AmeriCorps spending: The National Civilian Community \nCorps, funded through AmeriCorps, provides 1,000 AmeriCorps volunteers \nwith meals, tuition stipend, health care, child care, and housing at \nfour closed military bases in Maryland, South Carolina, Colorado, and \nCalifornia.\n  So this volunteer program will cost $26 million for these 1,000 \nparticipants. Of course, the taxpayers fit the bill for AmeriCorps and \nnot just for the good work that they do, but also for everything else \nassociated with their work, including their training and a lot of \ninteresting kinds of seminars.\n  According to John Walters of the New Citizenship Project, AmeriCorps \nvolunteers spend one-fifth of their time in training, education and \nother nondirect service activities. So the taxpayers pay for nonneedy \nstudents to participate in self-esteem and other government classes and \nseminars.\n  It is also, I think, a problem here because, Mr. President, at the \ntime we are trying to reduce the Federal bureaucracy, AmeriCorps \nvolunteers are becoming part of a Federal bureaucracy. Over 2,800, in \nother words, about 20 percent, of the 20,000 AmeriCorps volunteers are \nassigned to Federal agencies, including Agriculture, Interior, National \nEndowment for the Arts, and others.\n  The federally funded Legal Services Corporation, for example, has \nbeen awarded funding for 44 AmeriCorps volunteers, costing taxpayers \n$959,000.\n  I think the bottom line is that for fiscal reasons, we have to limit \nAmeriCorps spending, and that is why I support what the Senator from \nMissouri is trying to do today. It simply costs the American taxpayer \ntoo much for the benefits that it provides, and I suggest that it \nshould be eliminated.\n  We ought to examine the intent and the costs of the program. For \nexample, we should get answers to why the AmeriCorps program costs \n$42,000 per person per student in Alaska. More than 16 students in that \nState could participate in the Pell grant program for the same amount \nof money that is used to sponsor one AmeriCorps volunteer.\n  Or why $1.7 million of the AmeriCorps budget has been spent on an \nAmeriCorps advertisement campaign. This year alone, the Government will \npay more than $3 billion in interest on our national debt. That is \nabout $1,100 for every man, woman and child in the country, enough to \npay a year's tuition for a young woman or young man, for example, to \nattend Arizona State University.\n  Reducing funding for AmeriCorps is one small but very important way \nthat we can begin to prioritize how Washington spends the taxpayers' \nmoney. That is why, Mr. President, as I said, I support what the \nSenator from Missouri and the Senator from Iowa have been saying today. \nIt is time to cut the AmeriCorps program down to size.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Missouri yielding me this time. I \nreserve the remainder of the time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment offered by my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, \nwhich restores $425 million to the Corporation for National Service.\n  Two years ago, I was very proud to be a lead Republican sponsor of \nthe National Community Service Trust Act. My support for this endeavor \ncomes from a long-held belief that national and community service is \nessential in addressing many of our unmet social and educational needs. \nCommunity service is the cornerstone of democracy, where those who have \nmuch have a responsibility to help those who have little. Providing \npublic service as a means of training individuals, while at the same \ntime supplying benefits to a community, is a win-win initiative.\n  It is interesting to note that the critics of national service have \nnever criticized the goals of the program. They focus their criticism \non the cost of national service activities with figures which are \nhighly debatable, but not the worthiness of the efforts.\n  I beg to differ with those who say we do not have the dollars for \nnational service activities. We do have the resources to devote to this \nworthy effort. For example, since 1980, we have downsized our military \nenrollees by 184,790, representing 54 percent drop. The savings \ngenerated from curtailing new recruits by 184,000 is close to $2.7 \nbillion per year, much more than we spend on this program. And yet we \nhave reduced the opportunity to 184,790 individuals each year, who \notherwise would get help from the Federal Government to assist them in \nlearning skills and being able to participate in a more meaningful way \nin our society. All we are doing with this amendment is taking a small \nproportion of those who now no longer have that opportunity, \napproximately 20,000, and give them the chance to take part in this \nprogram.\n\n  Although we are downsizing our military, many young people still have \nthe desire to become involved in public service. We are not providing \nthem an opportunity to contribute if we do away with national service.\n  National service enables not only young people but schools, community \norganizations, towns and cities to develop programs that will meet \ntheir own unmet needs while giving invaluable education to generations \nof our future leaders.\n  I point out that those 184,000 no longer in the military would have \nhad an opportunity to get the same kind of scholarship they could get \nwith national service through the military. Now due to downsizing of \nour Armed Forces, that opportunity is no longer available to them. So \nthe elimination of national service will effectively remove another \navenue for a large number of young people to obtain educational \nopportunities.\n  Let us remember that national and community service is not a program \nthat young people engage in because they are free for the summer or \nbecause they have nothing better to do. Participation in service \nrequires true commitment. This is a program that demands that youth \nspend at least 1 year in full service, or 2 years in part-time service \nin an area of national need.\n  Although we all support spending cuts, this does not mean we should \nforsake our responsibility to develop necessary Government programs, \nespecially those that help our young people.\n  We must commit ourselves to redirecting our priorities to make clear \nthat unless we address the concerns of this Nation, our children will \nnot have a future. National service is a cost-effective program that is \nmeeting many urgent local and national needs not being met through \ntraditional means.\n  An example of the program's cost-effectiveness is an AmeriCorps \nproject in New York. For each hour that AmeriCorps members update \ncomputer equipment, they save the New York City Board of Education $100 \nin labor costs.\n  Through a combination of hard work and commitment, National service \nhas surpassed the expectations we all had when this legislation was \nenacted almost 2 years ago. National service was not designed to result \nin miracles on a grand scale, but there are many examples of minor \nmiracles occurring daily throughout the United States. Some of these \nexamples include, Youth Conservation Corps participants who have \nassisted Midwestern families afflicted by this spring's floods, the \nTeach for America participant who not only taught children in Watts how \nto read, but also how to love, and the Battleboro, VT, Independent \nLiving project participants who assist the elderly and individuals with \ndisabilities so they can remain in their homes instead of being forced \nto live in an institutional setting.\n  National service is a program that has served our Nation well, and \ntherefore I rise today to lend my voice in supporting the Mikulski \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  \n[[Page S 14265]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I was struck by the comment of my friend from Vermont \nthat we do have the resources to fund AmeriCorps. I think this \namendment, which I have now had an opportunity to study a bit more, \nreflects just how difficult these funding choices are. I said earlier \nthat when I made my recommendations, I had to weigh AmeriCorps versus \ncommunity development block grants. I was interested to see what the \nsponsors of this amendment show as their offsets because we have to \nkeep this amendment budget neutral.\n  Well, this amendment uses two accounts for offsets, both of them from \nHousing and Urban Development. The first cuts the annual contributions \nfor assisted housing accounts by an additional $383 million by taking \nan unspecified reduction. This could affect section 202 housing for the \nelderly, or the section 8(11) program for the disabled, or even housing \nfor AIDS victims.\n  Other activities in this account include vouchers for displaced \nfamilies. Incidentally, when we are looking at family vouchers, for \neach AmeriCorps volunteer, four low-income families could be given \nhousing for a year. Is this truly our priority? Is it truly our \npriority to pay one young person what otherwise could go to providing \nassisted housing for four families needing housing? I do not think so. \nThat is part of the problem I have with AmeriCorps in this budget.\n  In addition, in the rescissions bill which was adopted by this body \nand signed by the President earlier this summer, there was already a \n$1.12 billion reduction in this housing account. And the Department of \nHUD is telling us of their difficulty in identifying those reductions. \nTo impose a further $383 million cut could impact real programs and \nreal housing assistance for low-income families, the elderly and the \ndisabled. One of the great complaints I have heard about this bill, as \nit has been submitted by the committee, is that it cuts HUD too much. \nThis amendment would cut HUD further. Frankly, I was not willing to do \nthat. I do not think it is a good idea.\n  The other offset proposed in this amendment is achieved by increasing \nthe individual limit on mortgages for the FHA-guaranteed program. Now, \nthis is a very controversial provision. Under this amendment, mortgages \nas large as $175,000 would be eligible for Government guarantees. That \nis raising from the current limit of about $152,000. These are not and \nshould not be the sector of the housing market that the Government \nguarantees should cover. Moreover, private mortgage insurance is \nreadily available in those mortgages. This proposal would expand the \nrole and scope of Government. It is something that has been debated in \nthe authorizing committees. I believe it is not wise because it would \nplace the Government in greater competition with the private mortgage \ninsurance market and likely increase FHA's market share in the area at \na time when the private market is doing more and more.\n  President Clinton has talked about reinventing Government and \nbringing it under control. The Republicans who were elected in 1994 \ntalked about limiting the scope and the role of Government. This \namendment goes in the opposite direction from both of those objectives. \nTo make the argument that we should increase the maximum allowable loan \namount because it generates more money is to say that the best reason \nfor a Government program is that it makes money. That is not the right \napproach.\n  I think the only valid justification for a program is a public \npurpose that can only be achieved by Government. There is no public \npurpose served by expanding Government's role into the already served \nprivate market. I believe this proposal is corporate welfare for \nlenders who currently receive servicing fees far higher than market \nlevels for handling loans with no risk. Actually, it is a risk assumed \nby the taxpayers, not by the lenders.\n  I think there is real reform needed in the AmeriCorps, National \nService Corps. I am very pleased that the sponsors of the amendment--\nand I congratulate the Senator from Maryland for putting in a proviso \nthat none of the funds available shall be used to administer, \nreimburse, or support any national service programs run by Federal \nagencies. We were astounded earlier this year to learn, Mr. President, \nwhen we wanted to find out where the money was going at the national \nlevel, that AmeriCorps had been funding the Departments of Agriculture, \nEnergy, Interior, Justice, Labor, Transportation, EPA, and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  Well, according to the letters that we have received from OMB \nDirector Rivlin and from Mr. Segal, they are not willing to talk about \nany reforms. I strongly support and commend the Senator from Maryland \nfor agreeing to take out all of these Government agencies. AmeriCorps \nwas funding these governmental agencies, and they were passing over \nFuture Farmers of America, National 4-H Council, Girl Scouts of \nAmerica, American Red Cross, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, the Boys and \nGirls Clubs, National Audubon Society, United Negro College Fund, \nUnited Way of America, United Cerebral Palsy Association, Goodwill \nIndustries International.\n  These are the traditional volunteer agencies that most people think \nof in America when you talk about volunteers. Yet, they were passing \nover those. They were passing over those, in some instances, to go to \nFederal Government agencies. I am glad and I congratulate the sponsor \nof this amendment for knocking out those Federal agencies. But I also \nwant to point out that there was strange scoring done. When you look at \nthe independent assessment made by an outside agency who ranked these \napplicants, they had to reach way down in the rankings--from an \nimpartial ranking group--to find some of the organizations that were \nfunded. They overlooked Big Brothers/Big Sisters, National Urban League \nand Student Conservation to provide funding for an ACORN project.\n  Well, as Senator Grassley has learned--and I believe he may have a \nstatement later on--the ACORN project was involved directly in \npolitical activity. They were soliciting votes, actually involved \ndirectly in a campaign against a city councilman in Denver.\n  I think it is time that we had a commitment from this administration \nfor a thorough reform of AmeriCorps before we even consider putting \nfunds that are badly needed in other agencies into that program. I \nreceived a letter from Peter Hoekstra on the House side, chairman of \nthe Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee. He was an original \nsupporter of the Corporation for National Service. He said, at the \ntime, ``I believed that this would be an efficient and effective use of \ntaxpayer dollars. However, after conducting an independent evaluation \nof how money flows from the Corporation to AmeriCorps programs and how \nthese funds are spent, I have grave concerns about the continuation of \nthis program.''\n\n  He states that he has begun a dialog but he finds that it is safe to \nsay that AmeriCorps has been and likely continues to be an avenue for \npartisanship. ``The recent move by the Corporation to defund ACORN and \nCole Coalition only serves to highlight the seriousness of this \nproblem. In the case of ACORN, AmeriCorps' IG has pointed out numerous \ncases of lobbying, fund raising, and even voter registration carried \nout by AmeriCorps members.''\n  Congressman Hoekstra goes on to say, ``Finally, our subcommittee is \nin the process of reviewing CNS' grant-making procedures. Our \npreliminary findings reveal a less than comprehensible procedure, \nwhereby grant scoring often has little to do with who receives the \nfinal grants.''\n  I really believe that before we consider trying to take money away \nfrom HUD, from assisted housing for those who are in grave need, for \nthe people who are elderly, who are disabled, or the people with AIDS, \nthat the administration at least owes us a good-faith effort to make \nsure that the dollars that are spent in AmeriCorps are not being spent \nfor political purposes, they are not being wasted on high-cost \nprojects.\n  I reiterate my point that in these very tight budget times, I do not \nthink that paying money to volunteers in this program is a higher \npriority than taking care of the needs of those who depend upon HUD for \nfederally assisted \n\n[[Page S 14266]]\nhousing. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Delaware 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. President, I will be necessarily brief.\n  There is very little the Federal Government can do about moral \nvalues. That is something that is shaped by families and communities \nand churches. One of the things we can do is the Government can help \nteach young people that they owe something to their country and to each \nother and that membership in the community conveys both rights and \nresponsibilities.\n  The Senator from Georgia is on the floor. He had a national service \npiece of legislation which I and several others supported over the \nyears. The notion that we are going to instill in our children that \nthey have an obligation to their community and to their country--my own \nexperience, we focus, I believe, too much on just what the benefit to \nthe recipients of this service is.\n  I suggest one of the greatest benefits of AmeriCorps is what it \nteaches those who participate in AmeriCorps. My son was in the Jesuit \nVolunteer Corps. No relationship, no remuneration, but he spent a year \nin a community service project in a homeless shelter out in Portland, \nOR. I know he benefited more from that experience, quite frankly, than \nalmost anybody he helped benefit.\n  That is one of the payoffs of this program. One of the payoffs is a \ngeneration of young people who, in fact, are instilled with a sense of \nobligation and responsibility to the community.\n  I heard my friend from Arizona stand up and talk about this as if it \nwere need-based. There is nothing need-based about the military; the \nPeace Corps is not need-based. The point is to pass on these values to \nchildren or young people of all economic strata.\n  We need broad-based support from the next generation in terms of what \ntheir responsibility to the communities is. I think that is the most \noverlooked aspect of this program.\n  I also add, Mr. President, that I hear some of my friends--not the \nchairman of the subcommittee, but some of my friends on the floor--\ntalking about the need for other programs. I notice they also cut those \nprograms. I find it somewhat interesting the talk about this could pay \nfor x amount of Pell grants or y amount of this. I notice from their \nrecords they do not vote for the Pell grants, they do not vote for the \nother things.\n  I find it somewhat interesting that they use as a straw man--I am not \nspeaking about the Senator from Missouri but others who have spoken and \ntalked about this off the floor--they use as a straw man the idea if we \njust were not spending the money on AmeriCorps, we would be spending it \non other worthwhile programs that I note they also vote against and \nvoted to cut.\n  Mr. President, I must admit that I find this debate--and the \nopposition to AmeriCorps--somewhat fascinating.\n  We have been hearing for about a year now--including the last few \nweeks during debate on the welfare reform bill--that we need to return \npower to States and local communities. That the Federal bureaucracy \nneeds to get out of the way of local solutions to problems, that we \nneed to make better use of nonprofit community organizations and church \ngroups in addressing the problems this country faces. And that \nindividuals helping each other, not the paternalism of big government, \nis the ultimate answer to our problems.\n  Fine and good, Mr. President. And, to an extent, I agree. But, that \nis exactly what AmeriCorps does.\n  AmeriCorps says to States and communities, you decide how to meet the \nneeds of your people how to solve the problems you face. AmeriCorps \nsays, private, nonprofit organizations should be the main focus of the \nprogram. And, AmeriCorps teaches young people about responsibility, \nopportunity, and citizenship.\n  The fact is, President Clinton's national service program is probably \nthe most Republican program ever enacted by a Democratic President.\n  It is not the Federal bureaucracy trying to solve problems, it is \nState, local, and private organizations working together to solve \nproblems.\n  It is not solutions conceived inside the Washington Beltway. It is \nsolutions conceived where the problems are, at the local level.\n  It is not government taking over the role of charities. It is, as \nalmost all local charities will tell you, a way to make volunteer \nefforts more useful and effective.\n  All the Federal Government does is to provide some money and some \ndedicated young people to help.\n  Let me tell you about some of those people from my State of \nDelaware--both those who help and those who are helped.\n  Tammy is a single parent who used to be on welfare. Today, Tammy is \nan AmeriCorps member who helps teenage mothers do what she did--move \nfrom welfare to work. Tammy says, ``AmeriCorps gave me my voice back.''\n  Dora is another woman supporting her two children. After leaving the \nmilitary, she took a job waiting tables. But, this past year, she spent \nworking for AmeriCorps, helping elderly public house residents get \npreventive health care.\n  Dora will be using her tuition voucher to go back to school, \nsomething she admits she never would have done without AmeriCorps. As \nshe put it, ``AmeriCorps gave me direction.''\n  Jeff was a Maryland AmeriCorps member, but he did his service by \ntutoring at-risk elementary school children in the Colonial School \nDistrict in Delaware. For many of the boys, Jeff was their only male \nrole model.\n  And, the boys could hardly wait for Jeff to show up each day. After \njust 1 week, one of the teachers said, ``There's already been a \ndifference.'' Many teachers are now begging the principal to have an \nAmeriCorps member in their classroom.\n  And, finally, let me tell you about Camille, who is a homeless \nteenage mother who dropped out of high school. She met an AmeriCorps \nmember named Chan. And, Chan gave her hope.\n  Chan got Camille to sign up for an adult education program. He \nsupported her and tutored her. And, Camille will soon graduate from the \nadult education program and receive her GED.\n  Mr. President, there is very little the Federal Government can do \nabout moral values. That is something that is shaped by families and \nchurches and communities.\n  But, what each of the examples I just gave proves is that the Federal \nGovernment can do at least a little bit about this country's values. \nThe Federal Government can help teach young people that they owe \nsomething to their country and to each other, that membership conveys \nboth rights and responsibilities.\n  And, what these examples also show is something I have long believed \nabout community service--and I saw it with my own son after he served a \nyear with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps. Those who benefit from community \nservice are not just those who are helped, but also those who do the \nhelping.\n  AmeriCorps helps instill the values of responsibility and \ncitizenship. It makes a difference in lives of thousands of Americans \nand makes our problems just a little bit smaller.\n  There are children who will walk through their neighborhoods today \nsafer because of the AmeriCorps members who are helping the police in \ncommunity policing.\n  There are neighborhoods tonight that are safer because AmeriCorps \nmembers closed down the crack houses.\n  There are children in school today because an AmeriCorps tutor gave \nthem hope and they did not drop out of school.\n  There are families who have homes today because of houses built by \nAmeriCorps members.\n  There are senior citizens in nursing homes whose days are just a \nlittle bit brighter because of the work of an AmeriCorps member.\n  Mr. President, AmeriCorps is not the solution to all of our problems. \nAnd, it is not the entire answer. But, I dare say, it is making a \ndifference. And, it would be truly regrettable if AmeriCorps was \neliminated after just 1 year.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Georgia. I wish \nto tell the Senate this is one of the founding fathers of national \nservice.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge support of the amendment of the \nSenator \n\n[[Page S 14267]]\nfrom Maryland, and I commend her for taking this leadership and also \ncommend the Senator from Missouri for pointing out things that need to \nbe corrected in this program.\n  That is what we ought to be doing. We ought to be correcting the \nfaults, not killing the entire program.\n  Mr. President, we have heard comparisons of how many Pell grant \nprograms we could fund, how many job training programs we could fund. \nThese criticisms are valid as far as they go but what they forget is a \nvery important point.\n  That is, we are requiring service, and service is being rendered. A \ngood analogy is our Nation's Armed Forces. We do not maintain Armed \nForces in order to provide valuable skill and help develop good \ncharacter in young men and women. Rather, Armed Forces personnel \ndevelop skills and character in the military as they carry out their \nprimary mission for providing for our Nation's security.\n  The same is true of national service. Would critics have us disregard \nthe benefits to society of national service participants helping flood \nvictims in Montezuma, GA, last year, a town completely overcome by the \nflood? Should we ignore the benefits of the first-time immunization \nprogram of 33,000 children in Fort Worth, TX, in 1 month?\n  Mr. President, independent studies verified by the GAO found recently \nthat AmeriCorps returns between $1.68 and $2.58 for every $1 invested. \nI think it is important that we continue this program. National service \nsays to the participants, along with society's opportunities come \nduties. If you will provide your honest sweat and elbow grease to \nimprove society, we will help you attend college or acquire a skill.\n  This is a win-win-win situation. The question I have for my \ncolleagues is what other program is aimed at accomplishing these social \nends without a handout, without stifling bureaucracy, and with such \nenormous benefits to our communities?\n  As my colleagues know, the idea of national service is one in which I \nhave been involved for several years. In 1989, I introduced with \nSenator Robb, Glenn, Breaux, and Sasser  introduced legislation to \ndemonstrate the concept of national service in a small number of \nprograms nationwide. President Bush signed that legislation into law in \n1990, and the effort yielded a number of highly-successful \ndemonstration programs, including two in my State. In 1993, Congress \npassed President Clinton's National and Community Service Act to create \nthousands of young people serving their communities. While the scope of \nAmeriCorps is much larger than our original demonstration project, the \nphilosophy behind it, supported by Democrats and Republicans, is the \nsame--make plain the essential connection between rights and \nresponsibility by putting Americans to work meeting the unmet needs in \ntheir communities.\n  At present this Congress is involved in a great debate over how to \nreverse the fraying of our Nation's moral fabric. The question which \nconfronts us is how to stop the rising tide of crime, illegitimacy, \nfalling test scores, and rising despair that plague our communities. I \ndo not pretend that funding national service is the answer to all of \nthese problems. What I can say with great conviction, however, is that \nnational service is one of the few Government enterprises with the \npotential to inspire large numbers of young people against this tide.\n  In Georgia, success stories are not hard to find. In my State, \nAmeriCorps members alone have contributed more than 300,000 hours of \nservice, and served more than 19,000 individuals. In addition to their \nrequired service, AmeriCorps members have volunteered 7,500 hours to \ncommunity-wide philanthropic efforts and traditional volunteer \nprograms. They have also recruited more than 2,500 community volunteers \nto help in their community service efforts. Members are working with \nthe Macon police department to patrol communities and establish \nneighborhood watch programs. In Douglas, members are helping to erect \nroad signs to ensure that emergency crews can respond quickly to calls \non the newly-installed 911 telephone system. In Atlanta, members mentor \nand tutor low-achieving students in schools and recruit volunteers for \nfurther community service efforts. In Atlanta, the principal of Ralph \nMcGill school in a low-income area of Atlanta informed me on a visit \nthat since AmeriCorps young people started working as teacher's aides \ndiscipline problems have declined at his school by 70 percent. This \nlist of accomplishments is mirrored in virtually every State in this \nNation.\n  Critics have tried to attack national service in a number of \ndifferent ways. With the recent release of the GAO report on the costs \nof national service we have heard cries of how expensive the program \nis. I would caution the program's critics to examine the benefits of \nthe program as well as its costs before issuing such casual independent \nstudies. The GAO study often quoted by critics found that AmeriCorps' \nper-member costs to the Federal Government are in fact lower than the \nestimates the Corporation set for itself. In addition, the benefits \ngenerated by the program, as reported by an independent accounting \nagency and verified by GAO, have yielded excellent ratings for cost-\neffectiveness. Most importantly, however, the program receives high \nmarks from the beneficiaries of the service, like the teacher of Ralph \nMcGill school, who is better able to teach his students through \nAmeriCorps' efforts. In this way AmeriCorps is living up to its slogan, \n``Getting Things Done.'' I hope that the program's critics, many of \nwhom were singing the praises of cost-benefit analysis on this floor in \na different debate on regulatory reform just a few weeks ago, will \npractice that preaching for this program as well.\n  Our Nation's Armed Forces provide another good historical analogy to \nnational service--the GI bill. This program, which began in the mid-\n1940's as an effort to provide an education to those who fought for our \nNation's survival in World War II, has been judged one of the most \nsuccessful investments of public funds in our history. The program \ncontinues today as the Montgomery GI bill. The GI bill gives the \nparticipants an education benefit in exchange for their great service \nto this country. Like the GI bill, national service provides a triple \npayoff in terms of the service performed, the service experience, and \nthe post-service benefit. Do my colleagues who criticize national \nservice believe that the GI bill was a mistake? Here, Mr. President, is \na program that has just as much potential to help our society.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would point out that since its initial \nauthorization in 1993, AmeriCorps has had only one full year of \noperation. As with any newly created enterprise, there are growing \npains of varying degrees, and I am the first to express my willingness \nto search for ways to make the program more effective. The time for \nsuch debate and change, however, is during the program's scheduled \nreauthorization next year. That way we can have a systematic, rational \nconsideration of whether this program has provided sufficient ``bang'' \nfor the Government's buck, and whether structural changes are needed. \nTo kill this program in this appropriations bill would be a costly \nmistake.\n  Mr. President, as our distinguished colleague Senator Byrd often \npoints out, one of our primary duties as Senators is to exercise the \n``power of the purse'' and be good stewards of the taxpayer's dollar. I \nhave been watching AmeriCorps' work in my State, and I am pleased to \ninform my colleagues that AmeriCorps is achieving its goals. This is an \ninnovative, nonbureaucratic, decentralized approach to one of our \nNation's most important tasks--creating citizens who understand that \nresponsibilities accompany rights and who provide real services to \nindividuals and communities. I urge my colleagues to look at the \nbenefits as well as the costs of this program, and to support the \nMikulski amendment.\n  Mr. President, we are developing leadership and we are also serving \ncommunities and individual needs. I urge this program be retained.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, acting on behalf of Senator Bond, I yield \nSenator Santorum 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  I rise, and I hesitate to come to the floor to talk about this issue \nalthough I have talked about it in the past. I wanted to make a \nstatement because the former Senator from Pennsylvania, \n\n[[Page S 14268]]\nSenator Wofford, is in line to be the next head of the AmeriCorps \nProgram.\n  I stand as someone who has been a critic of the program. I wanted to \nmake it clear that I am critical of the program--not of Senator \nWofford. In fact, I have said to the Senator that I will support him \nfor that position and wish him well.\n  He has a big job ahead of him because I believe this program is a \nmisguided program, is a program that is on a values level--the Senator \nfrom Delaware talked about values. I think it teaches the wrong values. \nI think it teaches the value of not voluntarism.\n  My definition from looking in the dictionary, voluntarism is unpaid \nlabor. This is paid labor. That is not voluntarism. You can call it a \nlot of things, but not voluntarism, any more than me deciding to run \nfor the U.S. Senate and therefore being elected, being a volunteer \nbecause that is what I decided I wanted to do.\n  You are compensated for your work and therefore you are not a \nvolunteer. Call it what it is. It is a Federal paid taxpayers' position \nthat you have, working many places in a government job, or through some \ngovernment-sanctioned organization, or approved organization.\n  I do not see anything particularly noble about a job paid for by \ntaxpayers' dollars, that is any more noble than someone who goes out \nand sells insurance or someone who works on Wall Street or someone who \ngrows cotton.\n  Those are all noble jobs. They are providing valuable services to \nthis country. To suggest that somehow we instill the value in people, \nworking for the Federal Government for taxpayers' dollars is somehow \nnoble, and that going out and trying to start a business or raise a \ncrop is not noble, that those values are not important.\n  I think that is really what is fundamental. I think we are missing \nthe point. Yes, there is a lot of good work being done by people, but \nthey are being paid to do it by the Federal Government, and it is the \nFederal Government's design as to what role they should be filling.\n  I think that is a very dangerous value to somehow elevate Government \nservice above all other aspects of our lives in our society. I think \nthat is why you see so many people on our side of the aisle come up who \nfeel this is a real hot button issue, because I think it is a \ndistortion of the American value.\n  I would also add, having just been very actively involved in the \nwelfare debate over the past few weeks, that there are a lot of people \nwho are very strong supporters of AmeriCorps who are not supporters of \nrequiring people on welfare to work. I find that incredible. Here we \nhave people who desperately need work. You talk to employers. What do \nemployers tell you they are looking for an employee? Are they looking \nfor someone who has a lot of skills, someone who is exceptional in a \nparticular area? No. What most employers look for in employees is \nsomeone with a good attitude and good work ethic. What people on \nwelfare in most cases do not have as a result of having grown up on \nwelfare--I am talking about the chronic welfare recipient--is instilled \na good work ethic.\n  What we could provide instead of paying volunteers in AmeriCorps is \nwe could be putting the people who are on welfare who need jobs the \nsame things AmeriCorps people are doing. Remember, people on welfare \nare receiving the money. They are already getting the benefits. It does \nnot cost any addition and gives the people who really need the work, \nnot someone whose daddy is a CEO of some company who signed up for \nAmeriCorps because he wants to do the good thing and be a volunteer and \nget $27,000 a year, but someone who actually needs the work experience, \nneeds to learn the skills.\n  Let us talk about what we can do to take this program and apply it in \na sense in the welfare context. That makes a lot of sense. That is \nreally a direction that I think the American public could support.\n  Mr. President, I want to read a quote from Father Robert A. Sirico, \nwho is president of Action Institute for the Study of Religion and \nLiberty in Grand Rapids, who wrote an article on AmeriCorps and how it \nfalsely teaches people what service is all about. His concluding \nparagraph is:\n\n       Idealism led me to the priesthood. Another sort of idealism \n     leads people to the business world. Here's some advice for \n     young idealists. If you want to serve others, don't be bought \n     off by a Government program. Try something voluntary that is \n     personally challenging, socially beneficial, and doesn't cost \n     the taxpayers one dime.\n\n  I think that sums up the mood of most of us on this side of the \naisle. We want people to be challenged. We want young people to be \ninvolved in voluntarism. We want people to care about their community. \nBut we want them to do it because they care about their community, not \nbecause they are getting paid $30,000 a year by Federal taxpayers.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield Senator Ashcroft 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  How much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A total of 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to speak on AmeriCorps.\n  Before I begin, I would like to thank my colleague and my good \nfriend, Senator Bond, for his management of this bill as well as his \nunending commitment to the taxpayers of Missouri. His opposition to the \nCorporation for National Service is another example of the fiscal \nintegrity that has marked his career in the Senate, and I am honored to \njoin him here.\n  Americans constitute a community of service. Last year 90 million \nAmericans of all ages gave their time to civic and religious \norganizations. They cared for the poor, sick, the broken, and the \nlonely. They gave their time without regard to benefit or pay. They did \nit as a matter of personal devotion and out of their regard for each \nother as part of the way we live our lives as Americans. Their personal \nsacrifice is, in my opinion, mocked by a Government program with a \ncatchy name like AmeriCorps.\n  Mr. President, we have for most of this Congress been debating \nWashington's legitimate role in our daily lives. Some cases are tough, \ntough debates--debates on welfare, crime, and education. Others are \nnot. This is not a tough case. AmeriCorps is a $27,000 per participant \nboondoggle for kids trying to find themselves. AmeriCorps is welfare \nfor the well-to-do.\n  Mr. President, for what AmeriCorps costs annually we could send two \npoor students to the University of Missouri for 4 years, all expenses \npaid, for everyone person we send through AmeriCorps. We could give 18 \nPell grants to needy students for the annual cost of one AmeriCorps \nparticipant.\n  AmeriCorps is wasteful and bureaucratic. At least $15,000 per \nAmeriCorps participant goes into overhead and administration here in \nWashington. Only in Washington could $15,000 a year be paid for paper \nturning, and as a result that would be considered volunteer service.\n  Of the AmeriCorps participants, 1,200 serve--volunteer--at the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture; 525 volunteer at the Interior Department; \nand 60 serve at the National Endowment for the Arts. This is not in the \nspirit of volunteering. This is not in the spirit of service that we \nnormally find for American communities.\n  I rise to oppose this because I believe that a volunteer program \nshould be a volunteer program. It should not be a way to subsidies the \nFederal bureaucracy and send individuals into the bureaucracy at rates \nof pay that deprive other needy programs, that displace the ability to \nmeet other needs in our culture.\n  So I am pleased to support my senior Senator's motion which would \ndefund or otherwise take AmeriCorps out, because I do not believe we \nshould be spending money at this level in an enterprise which \nmasquerades as a volunteer program but is a very expensive program.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be added as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n[[Page S 14269]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Mikulski \namendment, and I ask to be added as a cosponsor.\n  As a former college professor and community organizer, I was proud to \nbe a part of creating and now implementing the National Service \nProgram. I was also proud to bring the vast experience of people and \nprograms in my State to Washington as Congress was considering this \noriginal legislation.\n  People across my State of Minnesota and the rest of the country have \nworked in National Service programs which has helped our Nation and \nlocal communities solve social problems while at the same time \nstrengthen democracy and citizenship.\n  From all I see, this is a program that works.\n  Over half of the AmeriCorp members in Minnesota signed up for another \nyear of service.\n  This is not about paid service at all. Service in Minnesota is about \ncitizenship, to be part of a community, stepping forward to serve. \nThese people are not getting rich by any means. The participants are \nmaking $4.50 an hour. This is essentially minimum wage.\n  If you think today's youth are cynical; if you think they are \ndisengaged and apathetic, you are wrong. I have met them. This program \nis all about participation and citizenship.\n  Listen to what some of these young people in Minnesota have said \nabout the program:\n\n       David Jacobsma: ``It has meant meeting new people with a \n     wide variety of backgrounds. It has meant money for my \n     education. It has meant new life experiences.''\n       Holly Sirjord: ``I feel I have contributed to my community. \n     I not only worked with the personal aspects of the community, \n     but I feel in return I have learned a lot by working with the \n     natural aspects as well.''\n       Katherine Musch: ``AmeriCorps is a wonderful service \n     organization that helps people help themselves build futures. \n     This past year I have learned so much working with people and \n     nature. It was great to feel a part of something so \n     worthwhile. I am proud to be a member and would love to see \n     AmeriCorps continued.''\n       Aaron Neubert: ``It has given me the opportunity to use my \n     college degree. I am anxious to show future employers that I \n     have experience.''\n       Kelly Engen: ``Being a member of the AmeriCorps program has \n     meant a great deal to me. It has given me a sense of pride \n     knowing that I am giving something back to the local \n     communities that have given so much to me.''\n       Tim Reese: ``An opportunity to experience resource \n     management on a watershed scale, frustration, a valuable \n     experience, good training, an understanding of the workings \n     of a Federal agency and a way to help pay for graduate \n     school.''\n       Russell Boheim: ``AmeriCorps has given me the opportunity \n     to use the knowledge and experience I've gained on a natural \n     resources project benefitting the people in the region, where \n     I was raised.''\n       Tony Kroska: ``AmeriCorps is, and has been, an excellent \n     opportunity to use and test my skills to further the \n     improvement of a region that I consider to be a valuable \n     resource.''\n       Shelly Eckblad: ``AmeriCorps--group of Americans forming a \n     body of persons, acting together in a common direction. That \n     direction is to solve problems facing our country--the United \n     States.''\n       Tracy Guthmiller: ``AmeriCorps to me means opportunity. \n     AmeriCorps has given me the opportunity to assist others \n     while at the same time gain valuable experience for myself.''\n       Linda Dahl: ``To me AmeriCorps has meant helping those who \n     are willing to work toward improving their stewardship of the \n     land. I believe this will lead to a better informed rural \n     community and a healthier living environment.''\n       DiAnn Koening: ``Being an AmeriCorps member has given me \n     the opportunity to serve local communities through individual \n     and team efforts, acquire new skills, and become more \n     knowledgeable of the local agencies and what services they \n     provide.''\n       Melissa Stommes: ``Being an AmeriCorps member has given me \n     a lot of opportunities to test my talents, explore more \n     options, and meet new people.''\n       Graeme Belcher: ``AmeriCorps has given me the chance to \n     make my community and myself better. The results of my \n     actions will affect the environment so that everyone can live \n     healthier and happier lives.''\n       Joy Swenson: ``I have learned many things in my AmeriCorps \n     stint, so far. I have been trained in some things that will \n     be a definite help to me in my future career--along with some \n     things that will help out my life in general. Things such as \n     team spirit and working with a range of attitudes and \n     personalities. I cannot really say all I want to in 25 words \n     or less, but I will end with this thought. I believe that \n     being an AmeriCorps member will be an experience that I will \n     always remember.''\n       Dean Lutz: ``The AmeriCorps program has been beneficial to \n     me in helping me develop and achieve my goals. The NRCS and \n     other surrounding people are fantastic to work along side.''\n       Jeff York: ``Being a AmeriCorps member has allowed me to \n     return and serve the area I grew up in. As a member, I have \n     enjoyed the responsibility and commitment it takes to serve \n     others. I have also been introduced to a new, diverse group \n     of Americans that, without this experience, I would not have \n     been able to otherwise meet.''\n       Brian Krzmarzick: ``Being an AmeriCorps member is having a \n     chance to learn new things and meet fun and exciting people \n     while doing something that will help my community and \n     country.''\n       Michael Aho: ``AmeriCorps has provided a way for me to face \n     the challenges of the future by taking the first of many \n     steps after college.''\n\n  I think what some in Washington who are trying to dismantle this \nprogram because they are afraid that it makes people think. It makes \npeople who are working with homeless people to ask why is there \nhomelessness. People who are working in the inner city are asking why \nis there poverty? And those who are working to clean up our environment \nare asking why is there pollution?\n  Every program in Minnesota is in a partnership with either a State \nand/or private partners. All these new partnerships were spurred by \nthis program. It has leveraged a lot of private funds.\n  Community service programs in Minnesota and across the Nation have \noffended hundreds of thousands of young people the opportunity to learn \nwhile serving their communities. Community service programs have \nprovided important and necessary services to communities all over the \ncountry. Programs have empowered students to improve conditions in \ntheir own communities by encouraging them to become a part of their \ncommunity.\n  Service-learning programs have taught young people about the skills \nof citizenships, responsibility, and democracy while teaching them \nmath, science, civics, English, history at the same time. Students \nthrough these wonderful programs have had their eyes opened to new \nopportunities and to diversity and multiculturalism in society. They \nhave taught people how to utilize community resources to improve their \nlives.\n  In Minnesota, we have combined State funding under the Youth Works \nProgram and the Federal dollars in the AmeriCorps Program to create an \nexcellent program.\n  People of all ages, but especially our young people, have been \nencouraged to help their communities and get involved in their \ncommunities. We created a program that empowers people to participate, \nto make changes in their communities, and a program that teaches the \nskills of citizenship, responsibility and democracy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the AmeriCorps Program and service \nlearning and support the Mikulski amendment.\n  Mr. President, I find the description of this program as kids trying \nto find out who they are insulting. I do not even recognize the program \nmy colleagues are describing. In Minnesota, AmeriCorps is really an \nexceptional program. It is quite a wonderful thing to see the work done \nin a child care center, the work done in the environment, the work done \nfor senior citizens, the work done for communities, combined with a \nwhole lot of young people who are able then to begin to build the \nresources to attend higher education. Mr. President, I would call this \na marriage. It is well worth it. It is the very best in this country.\n  As to deficit reduction, why do we not cut the subsidies for the oil \ncompanies, the coal companies, the tobacco companies and the \npharmaceutical companies? Why do not we go after the military \ncontractors, and what do we do when there is a $245 billion tax \ngiveaway mainly to wealthy people? But instead, when it comes to \ncommunity services, young people and higher education, and that kind of \nmarriage, that is where we want to cut.\n  That is not a Minnesota standard of fairness, and I am proud to stand \non the floor and speak for AmeriCorps.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I would like to compliment my \ncolleagues and friends from Missouri, Senator Bond and Senator \nAshcroft, for their statements, as well as Senators \n\n[[Page S 14270]]\nSantorum and Grassley. I hope our colleagues had a chance to listen to \nthem because they were right on target.\n  National service is basically paying volunteers. I find that to be a \nlittle bit of an oxymoron--paid volunteers. We have thousands, we have \nmillions of volunteers who are doing great work, and they do it without \nthe Federal Government saying, ``Here, we are going to give you a \ncheck.''\n  Many of us stated our opposition to this program at its inception \nbecause we said it would cost enormous sums. I looked at my notes, and \nI was computing, given the figures that we received from the Clinton \nadministration, and estimated this program would cost $22,000. I \nremember debating Mr. Segal, and he said it would not cost that much; \nthe cost would be something like $17,000 or $18,000. According to GAO, \nthe cost is almost $27,000. I was talking about total cost, the cost to \nthe Federal Government, the cost to State and local governments, and \nprivate.\n  It turns out to be, if you add the total cost, $17,000 from the \nAmeriCorps; other Federal support, $3,000; State and local \ncontributions, governments, $4,000; and private, $1,800. So the private \nsupports only 7 percent.\n  They stated that this was going to be largely privately funded. It \nhas not been. It is largely Government funded at a cost of $27,000.\n  Mr. President, some people said, ``Well, this is good so it will help \npeople be educated.'' The average cost of a Pell grant is $1,300. It is \nabout one-eighteenth the size of this program. And that is a grant. The \naverage cost of a student loan is $416. That compares to this program's \naverage cost of $27,000. There is no comparison.\n  Mr. President, in my opinion, this program is a failure as an \neducation tool. It is a failure as a tool promoting service or \nvolunteers. We do not need the Federal Government to micromanage a \nprogram. We see that all the Federal Departments--the Veterans \nDepartment, EPA, Department of Transportation, Labor, Justice, \nInterior--are receiving assistance and funds to train volunteers. We do \nnot need that.\n  And then when you find out that Big Brothers and Big Sisters and Red \nCross and Girl Scouts have been denied funds, this does not make sense. \nWe cannot afford this program. Let us put the scarce resources that we \nhave in the programs that will help thousands.\n  Actually, we have millions; we have 9 million students that benefited \nunder the guaranteed student loan program or the Pell grant program. We \ncan help millions in those programs, and we have been doing so. We are \nwasting millions of dollars under this program. It is a time to defund \nit, and I hope that this amendment by our friend from Maryland will be \ndefeated. I thank my colleague from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma and the \nothers who have spoken on this side so eloquently. I think we have had \nan excellent debate.\n  Because we have had so many people debating on this measure, we have \nused up all of the time. I would now ask unanimous consent that there \nbe 3 minutes for the proponent of the amendment and 3 minutes for me as \nan opponent of the amendment to wrap it up, and then that I be \nrecognized for a tabling motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, we have heard I think some compelling arguments \nagainst the AmeriCorps Program. I think in this vote it is important \nfor our colleagues to focus on the fact that everybody agrees this \nprogram is vitally in need of reform. This program has to be changed. \nThere have been too many problems with it. Even if you accept the fact \nthat paying for volunteers is a good idea, I think that taking the \nmoney from assisted housing or those who badly need assisted housing is \nunwarranted. I think that raising the FHA mortgage limits is an idea \nthat should be left to the authorizing committees.\n  Serving on the authorizing committee, I can tell you that there are \nmany good arguments against doing that. I recognize the difficulty that \nthe proponents have had in finding funding for it. This was my problem \nwhen I chose to fund CDBG rather than this program.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me to table this amendment. We will \ncontinue to discuss AmeriCorps in the conference and beyond. We are \nwaiting for a response from the administration.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We have been through a lot of ups and downs already \ntoday, and I would like to thank all the Senators for offering their \namendments.\n  Mr. President, I know I have 3 minutes for summing up. Let me just \nsay this. There is much to be said in favor of national service and \nmuch criticism in terms I think of the need for a tighter ship. I think \nwe would agree with the need for a tighter ship.\n  Let me just say in conclusion, my life has been devoted to creating \nan opportunity structure. I am absolutely committed to giving help to \nthose who practice self-help. My great grandmother came to this country \nfrom Poland for a prearranged marriage with $16 and a feather bed \nmattress. She came with no guarantees. She came seeking opportunities. \nAnd she came because she believed in the United States of America there \nwould be access to something called the American dream. The triad of \nthe American dream was homeownership, access to education, and personal \nfreedom.\n  The reason that I was one of the leaders in establishing national \nservice was that we would have an opportunity structure for access to \nthe American dream.\n  There were those who said these are not volunteers because they earn \na voucher. They do not get paid. They get a living stipend and a \nvoucher.\n  We use the term ``volunteer'' to mean that they are not drafted or \ncoerced into it. Perhaps that is not the right language, but it is the \nright intent.\n  The important part of this is that we know for most Americans their \naccess to higher education is closing. Student debt is increasing. What \nthis bill essentially does is follow the framework of a principle I \nbelieve in, that if you are middle class the role of Government is to \ntry to help you stay there or do better and, if you are not middle \nclass, to be able to get there through hard work, effort, and merit.\n  That is what national service is all about. That is what its intent \nis, and that is why we have been advocating this bill.\n  I know that we are in a very skimpy budget time; that the chairman of \nthis bill and I struggled over this. I know that originally as we \nlooked at this bill the question was, How can we fund it?\n  The chairman felt we needed money to go into the community \ndevelopment block grant funds, and I could not fault him for that--\nempowering cities to make local decisions for economic development. \nAbsolutely.\n  What we face here is not should we or should we not support national \nservice. We have a very skimpy budget allocation. I know that there are \nthose who say, ``Well, we can do Pell grants; we can do four more \nhousing subsidies.'' The fact is, I believe under the skimpy \nallocations we are now coping with there will not be the money to do \nthese things. I hope we continue the support of national service.\n  I thank the chairman for the courtesies given to us on this and \nreally the civility of the debate. I hope that my colleagues will vote \nto continue national service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have seen the wisdom and I shall not offer \na tabling motion. I shall ask my colleagues to vote against this \nmeasure.\n  I could not agree more strongly with the goals and the views \nexpressed by my ranking member about the American dream. But I do not \nbelieve it involves AmeriCorps or paid Federal Government volunteer \nservice. I am very much concerned, and I think all my colleagues should \nbe. I hope they would vote against this amendment, even if they support \nthe concept of AmeriCorps, because it takes money from housing \nassistance, from the elderly, the disabled, those with AIDS, and it \nraises the FHA mortgage limit.\n  I do not believe it is the time or the amendment on which we should \nmove forward with AmeriCorps. I ask for the \n\n[[Page S 14271]]\nsupport of my colleagues in opposing this amendment.\n  Now, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask further proceedings under the quorum call be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment No. 2781 offered by the \nSenator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski].\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, yesterday, together with some of my \ncolleagues, I sent a letter to President Clinton urging him to consult \nwith the Congress on the nature of the commitments his administration \nhas made to our NATO allies and the Bosnians with respect to United \nStates involvement in a potential peace enforcement operation in \nBosnia. The letter included a number of specific questions about such \nan operation and the wisdom of the administration's present approach.\n  Much to my surprise, administration spokesmen protested this letter \nclaiming that there have been numerous consultations on this matter.\n  Despite White House claims, the fact is that the Clinton \nadministration has not consulted the Congress on sending United States \nground forces to Bosnia since 1993--when consultations were held on \npossible enforcement of the Vance-Owen plan.\n  What was Congress' reaction then? As part of the fiscal year 1994 \nDefense Appropriations bill we passed an amendment, 99 to 1. The \nMitchell-Dole amendment--which reads as follows, and I quote:\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that none of the funds \n     appropriated or otherwise made available by this act should \n     be available for the purposes of deploying United States \n     Armed Forces to participate in the implementation of a peace \n     settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina, unless previously \n     authorized by the Congress.\n\n  A subsequent provision addressed consultation on U.S. participation \nin any peacekeeping or peace-enforcement operations and opposed it \nunless, and I quote:\n\n       The President initiates consultations with the bipartisan \n     leadership of Congress...\n\n  This was followed by directions for such consultation, including \ndiscussion of the goals of the operation, U.S. interests, the costs, \nfunding strategy, extent of U.S. involvement, and the expected duration \nand scope of the operation.\n  Well, it is more than 2 years later--more than 2 years later--and a \ngreat deal has changed. The situation on the ground is not what it was \nand the peace settlement being negotiated is also not what it was. \nWhile we are aware that the administration continues to repeat its \ncommitment to send U.S. troops to participate in a settlement force, we \nin the Congress do not know what that means in concrete terms. And we \nbelieve we have a right to know.\n  About 2\\1/2\\ weeks ago, the administration sent a high level team, \nled by Deputy Secretary of Defense White, to brief Senators on the NATO \nair campaign. At that time, questions were raised about administration \nplans to participate in a peace enforcement operation. Unfortunately, \nthese officials did not answer any of these questions, claiming that \nthe planning process was not finished.\n  Mr. President, the point of consultations is to have input before \nthere is a finished plan, before the Congress is handed a fait \naccompli. We do not want to be told after the fact that is a briefing, \nnot a consultation. And we have had plenty of those where we are \ninformed. We are not consulted; we are told. Lists of administration \nbriefings and returned phone calls don't add up to consultation.\n\n  Today administration officials and members of the contact group \nconcluded a second round of negotiations with the Bosnian, Croatian, \nand Serbian Foreign Ministers on principles for a peace settlement. \nThere is little doubt in my mind that whether the Bosnian Government \ncontinues participating in these talks and finally agrees to sign a \nsettlement will depend significantly on whether or not the United \nStates sends troops to enforce it.\n  Let us face it, the so-called agreed principles are vague, except in \nthat they partition Bosnia into two entities. As such, the Bosnians are \nbound to rely on United States guarantees where there are differences \nwith the Serbs, which are inevitable on matters of Bosnia's sovereignty \nand territorial integrity. Because the administration and allied \napproach has left the Bosnians without the means to secure their own \npeace, they will depend on those troops sent to enforce a settlement to \ndefend their sovereignty.\n  Mr. President, we are still waiting to hear the administration's plan \non lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia, a question that remains relevant \nnow, as well as central to any exit strategy for American forces. I \ncannot conceive of supporting a plan that sends United States troops \ninto Bosnia, while leaving the Bosnians unable to defend against future \naggression.\n  We must know what the administration is telling the Bosnians, the \nSerbs, and our NATO allies, what promises and what threats, are being \nmade. We also need to know what commitments are being made to the \nRussians with respect to their participation. In particular what is the \nadministration response to Russian demands to share command with NATO \nin an enforcement operation? Will U.S. forces be under unified NATO \ncommand at all times?\n  The bottom line is that U.S. credibility depends on the United States \nkeeping its word, meaning what it says. NATO credibility is also on the \nline. Why has there been no response to Bosnian Serb violations of the \nNATO no-fly zone reported today and last week?\n  No doubt about it, there is a lot at stake here--United States and \nNATO credibility, as well as the future of Bosnia.\n\n[[Page S 14272]]\n\n  It cannot escape the administration that the Congress has repudiated \nits approach toward Bosnia for the past 2 years. An overwhelming \nbipartisan majority has opposed the arms embargo, and Congress has \nvoiced concerns with respect to peace plans that would destroy the \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. So, to \noperate under the assumption that Congress will approve administration \nplans to send thousands of Americans in harm's way to enforce a \nsettlement is a major error. The fact is that the Clinton \nadministration may be making promises it cannot or should not keep.\n  Therefore, I am writing today to the chairmen of the Appropriations, \nArmed Services and Foreign Relations Committees to request that they \nhold extensive hearings on this critical issue. I will request that the \nquestions asked in the letter to President Clinton form the basis of \ntheir examination of this matter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter we sent to the \nPresident today be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                              Office of the Republican Leader,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: It is our understanding that your \n     administration, together with our NATO allies, is completing \n     plans to enforce a potential settlement in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina--a settlement not yet finalized. Much to our \n     dismay, what we have learned about possible U.S. troop \n     obligations has been largely from press reports. To date, \n     your administration has failed to consult with the Congress \n     on the nature and extent of commitments made to our NATO \n     allies and the Bosnian government regarding U.S. \n     participation in a force to implement a settlement. We are \n     especially concerned since those forces must consist \n     primarily of ground troops. There should be no doubts that \n     without the concurrence of the Congress these commitments \n     will not be fulfilled.\n       In our view, your administration must answer the following \n     questions as soon as possible in order that the Senate may \n     begin to fulfill its responsibility to carefully evaluate \n     this matter:\n       (1) What specific commitments regarding U.S. troop \n     participation have been made by your administration to our \n     NATO allies?\n       (2) What specific commitments regarding U.S. troop \n     participation have been made by your administration to the \n     Bosnian government?\n       (3) What is the range of total NATO ground force levels, \n     related to enforcement of a Bosnian peace settlement, being \n     considered in the administration and at NATO headquarters? \n     What would the U.S. contribution of forces be? What is the \n     estimate of the number of reservists that would need to be \n     called up? What is the estimated impact of such a deployment \n     on readiness?\n       (4) Would this be a NATO-only operation or would Russian \n     troops and/or other troops, from Islamic countries for \n     example, also be a part of that total force enforcing a \n     settlement?\n       (5) Would NATO be in complete command of all forces \n     involved in an enforcement operation? Or would Russian forces \n     an non-NATO forces be under different command arrangements? \n     If so, how would these varied command arrangements be \n     ultimately integrated in order to achieve unity of command? \n     Is there to be another dual- key command?\n       (6) When would NATO forces be deployed--immediately after \n     an agreement is signed or after Bosnian government and \n     Bosnian Serb forces withdraw to lines of demarcation? What if \n     the fighting does not stop after an agreement is signed?\n       (7) Is there a time table for UNPROFOR withdrawal? Would \n     some of these U.N. units, from NATO contributing countries, \n     remain as part of the new force?\n       (8) When would the ``dual key'' be eliminated? Would there \n     be any other U.N. input into the command arrangements?\n       (9) What would the rules of engagement for NATO forces be?\n       (10) Where would NATO troops be deployed? In Bosnian Serb \n     controlled territory?\n       (11) Would Bosnian government forces be supplied with \n     additional arms during this enforcement period so that Bosnia \n     can better defend itself against aggression after NATO forces \n     leave? If so, what types of weapons would be provided and by \n     whom? Has a commitment to provide military assistance--to \n     include arms and/or training--to the Bosnian government in a \n     post-settlement period been made by Assistant Secretary \n     Holbrooke, or any other administration officials to Bosnian \n     government officials?\n       (12) How long would NATO troops be deployed? What is the \n     exit strategy?\n       (13) What are the estimated costs of such a NATO \n     deployment? What would the U.S. share be and how does the \n     administration plan to pay for it?\n       Mr. President, these are not the only questions that will \n     need to be answered, but they are essential to any \n     Congressional debate and consideration of commitments made by \n     you and your administration with respect to U.S. troops \n     participating in an enforcement operation.\n       Thre are also matters of principle that will have to be \n     carefully considered. First and foremost is a very \n     fundamental question--whether United States forces should be \n     deployed to partition a sovereign and independent country \n     into two entities. Our men and women in the military have \n     protected our freedom and our interests and defended our \n     principles. Do we want to place our soldiers in harms' way to \n     defend the compromise of our principles? We must also ask \n     whether or not any settlement reached has been agreed to \n     freely by the Bosnian government and without coercion. We are \n     concerned about news reports that senior administration \n     officials gained Bosnian government agreement on the first \n     set of ``Agreed Principles'' by threatening a halt in NATO \n     bombing. Finally, we must ask whether it would not be more \n     just and more wise to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina, and allow the Bosnians to fight until there is a \n     stable military balance--the precondition for any settlement \n     which would not require the deployment of thousands of \n     American and NATO troops to police it.\n       Mr. President, we have serious concerns about the \n     commitments you and your administration reportedly have made \n     with respect to U.S. participation--to include thousands of \n     ground forces--in enforcing a possible Bosnian peace \n     settlement. We hope that you will begin to consult earnestly \n     and forthrightly with the Congress in the very near future.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert Dole,\n     John W. Warner,\n     Thad Cochran,\n     Bob Smith,\n     Jesse Helms,\n     Arlen Specter,\n     James M. Inhofe,\n     Dirk Kempthorne,\n     Jon Kyl,\n     Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n  Mr. DOLE. I reserve the balance of my leader's time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/26/senate-section/article/S14271-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14272-S14279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1966\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The previous order is the Senator from \nMaryland is to be recognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate to my colleagues what we \nhope to achieve here this evening.\n  The Senator from Maryland will be recognized. I understand there is a \n1-hour time agreement. We are willing to accept a 1-hour time agreement \non the amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It has already been agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. We will do that amendment and then the amendment of the \nSenator from Vermont, Senator Jeffords. I understand there is a 30-\nminute time agreement agreed to or willing to be agreed to. We will \nhave those two votes.\n  By that time, we hope to be in a position to announce what will \nhappen to the remainder of the evening. I am hopeful that Members who \nstill have amendments will be willing to debate those amendments \ntonight and we will start voting on the amendments tomorrow.\n  We are talking about the additional amendments. There are two \nRockefeller amendments, a Baucus amendment, Moseley-Braun.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. As you know, we have been moving along very well on \nthis bill, and what we will endeavor to do, and I thought we had, is to \nsee if Senators Rockefeller and Baucus will offer their amendments \ntonight because they are on the Finance Committee. That would, I think, \ntake us through a substantial part of the evening.\n  Mr. DOLE. I suggest after these two votes we will announce what \nagreement we have been able to reach. We may not be able to reach any \nagreement. I do not want to keep raising this, but whether or not we \nare in session next week depends on whether or not we finish this bill, \nLabor-HHS, and State, Justice, and Commerce.\n  Yesterday we did not do anything. We had debate on one amendment. The \namendment was voted on at 2:15 today.\n  My view is it is our hope we can finish this bill tonight and finish \nLabor-HHS by Thursday and dispose of the other bills by Saturday. If we \ncannot \n\n[[Page S 14273]]\ndo it, we cannot do it, and we will be here next week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized to \noffer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2782\n\n (Purpose: To restore homeless assistance funding to fiscal year 1995 \n  levels using excess public housing agency project reserves, and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes] for himself, Mr. \n     Simon, and Mr. Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 2782.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II of the bill, insert \n     the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . HOMELESS ASSISTANCE FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Assistance for the Renewal of Expiring Section 8 \n     Subsidy Contracts.--\n       (1) Reduced appropriation.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, the amount made available under title \n     II of this Act under the heading ``Housing Programs'' under \n     the subheading ``assistance for the renewal of expiring \n     section 8 subsidy contracts'', is reduced from $4,350,862,000 \n     to $3,990,862,000.\n       (2) Use of assistance.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of this Act, in using amounts made available under title II \n     of this Act under the heading ``Housing Programs'' under the \n     subheading ``assistance for the renewal of expiring section 8 \n     subsidy contracts'' to renew an annual contributions contract \n     with a public housing agency administering the tenant-based \n     existing housing certificate program under section 8(d) of \n     the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(d)) or \n     the housing voucher program under section 8(o) of the United \n     States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)), the \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall take into \n     account the amount in the project reserve under the contract \n     being renewed in determining the amount of budget authority \n     to obligate under the renewed contract.\n       (b) Homeless Assistance.--\n       (1) Increased appropriation.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, the amount made available under title \n     II of this Act under the heading ``Homeless Assistance'' \n     under the subheading ``Homeless Assistance Grants''  is \n     increased from $760,000,000 to $1,120,000,000.\n       (2) Restriction.--Notwithstanding section 504 or any other \n     provision of this Act, of the funds made available under \n     title II of this Act under the heading ``Homeless \n     Assistance'' under the subheading ``homeless assistance \n     grants'', $360,000,000 shall not become available for \n     obligation until September 30, 1996, and shall remain \n     available until expended.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, am I correct that we have 30 minutes on \nthis side and 30 minutes for the manager of the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes and ask the \nChair to inform me when that time has been utilized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I very much hope that Members will \nperceive this amendment in a way that will enable us to adopt it. In \nfact, I hope the manager of the bill will accept it, after we discuss \nit a bit.\n  What this amendment does is restore $360 million for homeless \nassistance funding. It brings the funding for the homeless back to the \n1995 level of $1,120,000,000. The bill reported from the Appropriations \nCommittee has a figure of $760,000,000. That is a cut of $360 million--\na cut of 32 percent from the 1995 funding level--the largest percentage \nfunding cut of any of HUD's formula-driven programs.\n  Homeless assistance programs are a critical part of the safety net.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. Members who are \nhaving conversation in the aisles will please retire to the cloakroom.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The homeless assistance programs are a critical part of \nthe safety net. The safety net is being badly shredded. I certainly \nhope it would not happen to the programs that really deal with the \npeople who are out on the street--people who are out on the street \nwithout a place to stay.\n  The offset for this additional money would take funds out of section \n8 program reserves. Housing authorities that have expiring section 8 \ncontracts have money available to them. In the past, the authorities \nhave been able to roll the reserves over. This amendment would utilize \nthose funds for section 8 renewals. In the past, the public housing \nauthorities have used the reserves to augment the section 8 program. I \nregret using section 8 as an offset because I think the section 8 \nprogram is also very important. But, in deciding between these two \nchoices, it seems to me we have to pay more attention to the pressing \nproblem of the homeless.\n  The Secretary of HUD has sent a letter indicating that the expiring \nsection 8 contracts could be renewed by the money provided in the \nbill--even after this offset--even after the utilization of the $360 \nmillion--in order to bring the funding for the homeless up to this \nyear's level.\n  Let me very quickly cover the importance of passing this amendment. \nOn September 11, there appeared an excellent article in the Washington \nPost by Lucie McKinney, the widow of Stewart McKinney, Republican \nMember of the House of Representatives from the State of Connecticut. \nRepresentative McKinney was a very able and distinguished Member of the \nCongress who took a very keen interest in the problems of the homeless. \nIn fact, the McKinney Act programs are named after him. That act \nincludes the range of homeless programs addressed by this amendment.\n  Ms. McKinney points out, ``I'm stunned that Congress, which has \nproclaimed its commitment to finding and funding plans that actually \nwork, would allow these cuts to stand.'' She is talking about the cuts \nto the homeless programs.\n  She goes on to cite two studies which conclusively demonstrate that \nthe supportive housing dimension of the homeless program is working \nexceedingly well. As she notes, ``* * * cuts, far from saving money, \nwill waste it.'' She goes on to say, ``Put simply, not housing our most \nvulnerable Americans costs millions more than housing them. It's just \ncommon sense.''\n  And she concludes this article: ``* * * we do know how to end \nhomelessness. And while the cure is not cost-free, it costs a whole lot \nless than not facing--and solving--the problem. Saving lives and saving \nmoney--how can that be bad?''\n  Increasing the homeless funding back up to the 1995 levels will \nprovide an opportunity to reform how the homeless assistance programs \nare administered. The most notable feature of the reform effort is the \npush to convert the existing collection of seven categorical grant \nprograms at HUD into a single program delivered by formula to State and \nlocal governments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator he has used 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield myself 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. A formula grant will allow better organization at the \nlocal level and facilitate better planning as funding levels become \nmore predictable. The VA-HUD bill allows a formula approach, but it \ndoes not provide adequate funding. This amendment would raise the total \nhomeless funding to a level that would allow a formula approach to make \nsense. In fact, the Appropriations Committee recognized it in their \nreport. The committee stated: ``The committee is worried that the block \ngrant approach with funds less than $1 billion may disadvantage some \nareas with significant homeless problems and homeless providers.''\n  This amendment addresses that problem. It brings the homeless funding \nfigure back up to this year's level and makes it possible to use the \nformula approach. Almost everyone is supportive of a formula approach. \nIn fact, the Senate Banking Committee reported a bill that included \nsuch a program last year on a bipartisan, 15 to 3 vote.\n  I am not going to go through a litany of the numbers of people who \nare on the street. I do want to point out, however, how much of this is \na veterans problem. Well over a third of the homeless have served in \nthe Armed Forces. It is estimated that about 275,000 veterans are \nhomeless on any given night. The single largest segment of homeless \nveterans--55 to 60 percent--are from the Vietnam era. \n\n[[Page S 14274]]\n\n  The demand for these funds is significant. Last year applications for \nfunds for assistance to the homeless were 2\\1/2\\ times the amount which \nthe Congress had appropriated.\n  Let me discuss the offset further. The offset for this amendment \ncomes from section 8 contract renewal accounts. Currently, HUD is \nholding reserves in section 8 contracts on behalf of housing agencies \nthat administer the section 8 program. The amendment would allow HUD to \ntake into account the project reserves when considering the amount to \nprovide housing agencies when contracts are to be renewed. Money would \nnot be available to, in effect, uplift the section 8 program. The HUD \nSecretary has assured us, however, that enough money would remain to do \nthe contract renewals.\n  I therefore suggest to my colleagues, in terms of priority, it makes \neminent good sense to shift this money out of section 8 and put it into \nthe homeless programs. The last thing we want to see is people \nwandering our streets, many of them suffering from mental and physical \ndisabilities. It is a problem that cuts to the very heart of what we \nstand for as a society.\n  This amendment offers the opportunity to bring it back to this year's \nlevel and to enable us to move forward in partnership with State and \nlocal governments and with the private sector--churches, community \ngroups and other similar action organizations--in order to address this \nvery pressing problem.\n  I very strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague from Maryland for offering this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment. These \nsubcommittees and committees have tough choices to make, but the \nreference has already been made to the op-ed piece by the widow of our \nformer House colleague, Stewart McKinney. Senator Sarbanes referred to \ntwo studies. Let me just read from that one study.\n  The first study found that formerly homeless people with severe \nmental illnesses achieved stability at a rate of 83.4 percent in \nsupportive housing. Tenants also cut their hospital in patient use by \n50 percent. The 4-year evaluation concluded that this unique housing \n``not only will alleviate human suffering, but also will reduce costs \nfor institutionalization and hospitalization.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire op-ed piece be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 11, 1995]\n\n                          Dumb Move on Housing\n\n                         (By Lucie C. McKinney)\n\n       Right before the summer break, the House approved drastic \n     cuts to housing programs for the neediest Americans: homeless \n     people who have chronic mental and medical illnesses. Four of \n     these--the McKinney Programs, named after my late husband, \n     Stewart B. McKinney, who was a Republican representative from \n     Connecticut--face reductions of 40 percent or $444 million \n     (as compared to the unasked-for $7 billion the House decided \n     to give the Pentagon). Usually when I testify before Congress \n     I talk about the people who have reclaimed their lives \n     through the offer of housing and a helping hand. In keeping \n     with the times, however, I'd like to reframe the debate--and \n     talk about statistics and cold, hard cash.\n       I'm stunned that Congress, which has proclaimed its \n     commitment to finding and funding plans that actually work, \n     would allow these cuts to stand. The McKinney Programs \n     provide funding from something called supportive housing--\n     permanent housing linked to a safety net of support services \n     that allow even chronically disabled people who are homeless \n     to live autonomously in hope and dignity. And according to \n     the evidence, including two separate government evaluations, \n     supportive housing is our best bet for ending homelessness \n     and doing so cost-effectively.\n       The first study found that formerly homeless people with \n     severe mental illnesses achieved stability at a rate of 83.4 \n     percent in supportive housing. Tenants also cut their \n     hospital inpatient use by 50 percent, The four-year \n     evaluation concluded that this unique housing ``not only will \n     alleviate human suffering, but also will reduce costs for \n     institutionalization and hospitalization. The five projects \n     [studied] offer proof that the face of homelessness in \n     America can be changed dramatically.''\n       The second evaluation found a success rate of 84.5 percent \n     and concluded that supportive housing--``provided cost-\n     effective assistance to help families and individuals escape \n     from homelessness.''\n       So. These programs actually end homelessness, which is one \n     of those seemingly intractable social problems we thought \n     would be a permanent part of the American urban landscape.\n       As to the cost, Congress doesn't seem to grasp the fact \n     that cuts, far from saving money, will waste it. Put simply, \n     not housing our most vulnerable Americans costs millions more \n     than housing them. It's just common sense: People with mental \n     illnesses end up using expensive hospital beds, state \n     psychiatric institutions and even jails as de facto housing; \n     people with AIDS end up in acute-care beds (at more than \n     $1,000 a day); people with alcohol or drug dependencies stay \n     too long in high-cost treatment programs. Meanwhile, they are \n     still homeless, still dependent on crisis services and no \n     closer to living independent productive lives. This is worse \n     than penny-wise, pound-foolish--it's billions foolish.\n       The cost of providing housing linked to services, on the \n     other hand, can be as little as $10,000 a year, an \n     expenditure that actually ends that person's homelessness and \n     allows him or her to use clinics instead of emergency rooms, \n     counseling instead of psychiatric hospitalizations and drug \n     counseling instead of treatment centers. Supportive housing \n     also promotes self-sufficiency through employment and \n     education linkages. Aren't these the very goals Congress is \n     so anxious to advance?\n       My late husband was committed to ending the blight of \n     widespread homelessness. Four months before he died, he even \n     spent a night on the streets in 20-below weather to bring \n     media attention to the plight of homeless people. Yes, he was \n     deathly ill at the time, but so are more than 70 percent of \n     homeless Americans.\n       We may not have a cure for AIDS, cancer or a way to provide \n     health care to all Americans, but we do know how to end \n     homelessness. And while the cure is not cost-free, it costs a \n     whole lot less than not facing--and solving--the problem. \n     Saving lives and saving money--how can that be bad?\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial \nfrom the Chicago Sun Times entitled ``Rush To Trim Budget Cuts Off \nHomeless'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Chicago Sun Times, Sept. 13, 1995]\n\n                 Rush To Trim Budget Cuts Off Homeless\n\n       Once again, Congress is using a machete instead of a paring \n     knife to cut the federal budget to help pay for an \n     unaffordable tax cut.\n       The latest casualty is the McKinney Homeless Services \n     Program. The House already voted to cut the program by 44 \n     percent, to $676 million. Today, the Senate Appropriations \n     Committee will consider a plan to reduce it by a third, to \n     $760 million. The short-term savings ignore the long-term \n     expense of their actions.\n       Housing providers use McKinney money to pay for supportive \n     services to people who otherwise would be living on the \n     streets. On the streets, homeless people spend their energy \n     looking for food and a safe place to sleep. They can't waste \n     time seeking treatment for substance abuse, mental illness or \n     AIDS. They aren't enrolled in job training programs. They \n     can't even get a bath and a change of clothes--the first step \n     toward a job.\n       Formerly homeless people now living in Lakefront SRO \n     (single room occupancy) apartment buildings can do all those \n     things. Lakefront provides the services for $2,500 per person \n     per year at six buildings in Chicago. Shelters--the primary \n     housing option for most homeless people--cost as much as four \n     times that and provide little more than a place to sleep. If \n     the homeless person ends up in a hospital or prison, the \n     taxpayers' burden skyrockets--without any hope of breaking \n     the cycle of homelessness.\n       No doubt, senators will emerge from today's committee \n     meeting patting themselves on the back for having restored \n     some of the draconian cuts made by the House. But they still \n     must answer tough questions about how much saving $440 \n     million now will cost us later.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, on Sunday--I happened to spend a weekend in \nWashington--I was reading a little bit from a small book that I had not \nread for years. It was Will Durant's ``The Lessons of History.'' What \nhe says in this book--my colleague from Maryland who is a history buff \nwill appreciate this also--is that there is, among other things, one \nconsistent action in nations; that is, the struggle between those who \nare fortunate and those who are less fortunate. And those who are \nfortunate usually put the squeeze on those who are less fortunate, and \nultimately it hurts those who are more fortunate.\n  I think we are going through that struggle in a variety of ways right \nhere \n\n[[Page S 14275]]\nin this very Senate. I can remember--I see some of my colleagues on the \nfloor who will remember this, also. Maybe the Presiding Officer is \nyoung enough not to remember this. But I can remember when we did not \nhave anywhere near the number of homeless people on the streets of our \nNation that we have today. In Chicago, on Madison Avenue, there was a \nplace where we had what we used to call winos. I am afraid it was not a \nrespectful term. But it was used commonly where the winos were. But we \ndid not have homeless people as generally as we have today.\n  Then I look at this allocation within the subcommittee. I find that \nthe largest percentage cut in any of HUD's formula-driven programs is \n32 percent which is taken off of the programs for the homeless.\n  We are not going to have any homeless here lobbying us on this one. \nThere are not any big campaign contributions from any homeless. But it \nsure says something about our priorities and where we are.\n  Let me just add, my friends, that I know it is tough for the chairman \nof this subcommittee and the members of the subcommittee to make these \nchoices. It can get worse. I heard my colleague from Illinois, Senator \nCarol Moseley-Braun, the other day refer to an article in a history \nmagazine that I happened to read also which talked about homelessness \nin New York City back at the turn of the century when young people were \ndropped off at churches. And that is where we got the name \n``foundlings.'' People found them in churches, and they would take \ntrain loads of these young people from New York City and take them out \nto the West, to Wyoming, to California, to Oregon. People would show up \nat the train station and look around and find a child that they might \nwant to adopt and take care of.\n  Can things get worse? You bet they can get worse.\n  This is a program that works. Yes. We have tough decisions to make. \nBut before we take money and say we have to have a tax cut, we have \ntough decisions to make. But here is one. If you are to say who are the \npeople who desperately need help in terms of public housing and in \nterms of health, it is these homeless people. I am sure none of them \nare registered to vote, or very few of them are. But some of them have \nmental illness. Some of them have alcohol and drug problems, a variety \nof problems. We ought to help them.\n  That is what the amendment offered by my colleague from Maryland is \ndoing. I am proud to stand up and urge adoption of this amendment. This \nis one that ought to be an easy vote for Members of the Senate.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). At this point the Senator from \nMaryland has 16 minutes, and the Senator from Missouri has 30.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the good motives. I appreciate the \nconcern of the Senator from Maryland, the leader of the authorizing \ncommittee on his side. I appreciate the thoughtful comments by the \nSenator from Illinois as well.\n  But unfortunately, this is an effort to take money from one pocket \nand put it in another pocket. It does so in a way that I do not think \nis particularly productive. I think it may even be counterproductive. \nWhile I commend them for their motives, I do not think it accomplishes \nanything.\n  This is in the arcane rule of scoring budgetary authority and \noutlays. I apologize in advance to my colleagues. But let me tell you \nwhat has happened.\n  The amendment proposes a budgetary offset from the HUD \nappropriations. It takes it out of the renewal of section 8 rental \nsubsidy contracts. It takes out $360 million. The amendment is \npredicated on the reduction of project reserves. These are reserves \nheld by local housing authorities for section 8 certificates and \nvouchers in use for low-income families to cover potential increases in \nrent or reductions in resident income during the remaining contract \nterm. In other words, this is taking money away from one group of very \npoor who need housing to another group of very poor who need housing.\n  During the consideration of the recently enacted rescissions bill, we \nclosely examined the funding needs of the existing section 8 contracts \nto remove any excess funds. Only 4 months ago, this body, along with \nthe House and the President, after we carefully assessed the needs, \ndetermined that some $427 million could be rescinded from the section 8 \nreserves without, in our view, potentially jeopardizing the sound \nfinancing of these outstanding rental contracts. That rescission has \nalready been enacted into law. We now find ourselves a few months later \nagain attempting to raid these contract reserves to fund increased \nhomeless activities.\n  There are two things I could say about the amendment. If we fail to \nadequately maintain reserves for the cost of section 8 contracts, we \nwill surely need additional homeless funding to assist the families \nthat get evicted when their rental contracts run out of money. So we \ncould be pushing another group out into the street.\n  Mr. President, the pending amendment proposes to cut another $360 \nmillion from section 8 contract reserves. I should point out that more \nthan half the current estimate of the total amount held in these \nreserves is by local housing authorities.\n  New York City, for example, stands to lose as much as $90 million if \nthis reduction is taken proportionately. Such a large reduction could \njeopardize the financial viability of the contracts issued and \nadministered by that large housing authority.\n  I note that those who suggest this reduction in contract reserves \nclaim that the section 8 amendment funding could be provided at a later \npoint to make up any shortfalls. Unfortunately, this assumes there will \nbe adequate funding within our budget allocation to accommodate such an \nappropriation request, in addition to meeting the growing renewal needs \nof these section 8 contracts, all in the face of further reductions in \noverall discretionary spending.\n  Mr. President, that is the fallacy behind this offset. I described \nearlier the difficulties in finding offsets. There are no easy places \nto find offsets.\n  In reality, this measure is no offset at all because the net effect \nof the amendment is to increase program funding levels. It simply \nproposes to borrow funds previously set aside for section 8 program \ncosts to augment yet another activity, neither of which can be \nmaintained in the future at the increased spending levels if we ever \nhope to balance the Federal budget.\n  I should add that the sponsors of this amendment have acknowledged \nthe real programmatic effect of this budgetary shell game by delaying \nthe availability of the $360 million added for homeless programs until \nthe last day of the year.\n  I refer my colleagues who are interested to page 3 of the amendment. \nThe last paragraph says ``Restriction.''\n\n       Notwithstanding section 504, or any other provision of this \n     act, the funds made available under title II of this act \n     under the subheading ``homeless assistance'' grants, $360 \n     million shall not become available for obligation until \n     September 30, 1996, and shall remain available until \n     expended.\n  In other words, to avoid the Budget Act point of order, they said \nthey are appropriating it for the coming year, but you cannot spend it \nuntil the end of the next fiscal year, to avoid the Budget Act point of \norder for breaching the fiscal year 1996 allocation.\n  Mr. President, I merely point out that if the sponsors of the \namendment are concerned about increasing fiscal year 1997 homeless \nprogram spending, then it would be wise simply to wait until next \nyear's appropriations bill and offer an amendment to take funds from \nthe 1997 appropriations. Maybe we can work with the sponsors and the \nproponents of the amendment to find funding in that year. But it looks \nlike a difficult year. This is an effort to fund in 1997 some programs \nfrom the budget authority in 1996.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. The best of motives \nbut, unfortunately, will do nothing towards meeting the current need \nfor homeless assistance activities. It does not even click in until \nSeptember of next year. It undermines our budgetary and deficit control \nefforts, and it jeopardizes the viability of housing assistance \ncontracts currently in use by thousands of families across the Nation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  \n[[Page S 14276]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  First of all, the amendment does not jeopardize the contracts. We \nhave a letter here from the Secretary of HUD. I ask unanimous consent \nto include it in the Record.\n  Mr. BOND. Could I see a copy of that?\n  Will the Senator provide me a copy, please.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         The Secretary, U.S. Department Of Housing and Urban \n           Development,\n                               Washington, DC, September 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Paul: I am writing this letter to express my support \n     for an amendment to the Senate Appropriations bill which \n     would restore the level of funding for the homeless \n     assistance programs to their FY 1995 level, or $1.12 billion. \n     This amendment would offset the homeless funding level \n     increase of $360 million with a concomitant reduction in the \n     section 8 renewal account.\n       Funding for the renewal of expiring contracts can be \n     reduced without any impact on existing recipients because \n     many public housing agencies have sufficient reserves in \n     their section 8 tenant-based contracts. These agencies can \n     use these reserves to renew expiring contracts before \n     receiving additional federal resources.\n       As you know, the FY 1995 Rescission law required the \n     Department to use available PHA reserves in the same manner \n     as this amendment would provide.\n       We therefore fully support the amendment that would offset \n     the increased Homeless funding level with available PHA \n     reserves for section 8 tenant-based contract renewals.\n       Thank for you your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Henry Cisneros.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Secretary says:\n\n       I am writing this letter to express my support for an \n     amendment to the Senate Appropriations bill which would \n     restore the level of funding for the homeless assistance \n     programs to the FY 1995 level of $1.12 billion. This \n     amendment would offset the homeless funding level increase of \n     $360 million with a concomitant reduction in the section 8 \n     renewal account.\n       Funding for the renewal of expiring contracts can be \n     reduced without any impact on existing recipients--\n\n  I underscore that ``existing recipients''--\n\n       Because many public housing agencies have sufficient \n     reserves in their section 8 tenant-based contracts. These \n     agencies can use these reserves to renew expiring contracts \n     before receiving additional Federal resources.\n       As you know, the FY 1995 Rescission law required the \n     Department to use available PHA reserves in the same manner \n     as this amendment would provide.\n\n  The amendment uses these reserves. That means the reserves are not \navailable if they want to upgrade the section 8 program. Public housing \nagencies would be less able to issue more contracts or cover rent \nincreases. The amendment does leave enough money to fulfill existing \ncontracts.\n  The real question then becomes: Is it a sufficiently higher priority \nto address the problem of the homeless, even though we have to move \nmoney out of another program? I think the problems of the homeless are \na critical priority.\n  What the extra money for the homeless program would enable us to do \nis use a formula approach. Virtually everyone is in favor of a formula \napproach. The additional funds made available in this amendment would \nbecome part of a larger pool which would enable the Department to apply \nthe formula to allocate the funds. We need enough funds to make the \nformula realistic.\n  The fact that the additional money in this amendment can not be \ncommitted in a contract with a State or local government until the end \nof the fiscal year does not affect then the ability of the States and \nthe localities to prepare for the money on the basis of a formula \nallocation and to develop their programs accordingly. The committee \nreport says that ``funding for a formula below $1 billion will mean \nthat many communities with significant homeless programs will not get \nadequate resources to design and maintain assistance programs to meet \ntheir needs.'' This amendment would provide enough money and make \npossible a major reform in the administration of HUD's homeless \nprograms.\n  Ever since 1989, the Congress has repeatedly increased the amount of \nmoney available for homeless assistance. This amendment merely tries to \nkeep the funding level from 1995 to 1996. And, in this amendment, we \nhave an offset that comes out of another housing account. I am not \nhappy about the offset. I think the housing accounts are being markedly \nshortchanged. But, when it comes to a judgment as to whether we ought \nto let the bill's drastic cut in the money for the homeless stand or \ndraw some money off of the section 8 reserves, it seems to me that we \nought to use the section 8 reserves in order to assure that the \nhomeless program can continue at a reasonable level.\n  I again want to underscore that a significant number of Members are \ntalking about are the needs of veterans in the context of the bill \nbefore us. The amendment raises a question of priorities. I say to my \ndistinguished friend from Missouri, in the choice between leaving these \nfunds in reserve accounts to be rolled over into section 8 versus \nproviding shelter for homeless veterans, I have chosen to move the \nmoney to the homeless programs. The money left in the section 8 account \nafter this amendment will cover existing contracts. What will be lost \nis the housing authorities' reserves that are there to cover increases \nthe contract subsidy or to cover rent increases. I say to my colleague: \nBetween those two alternatives it seems to me that raising the level of \nappropriations for the homeless ought to take precedent.\n  As Lucie McKinney said in this very strong and moving article, ``We \ndo know how to end homelessness.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield myself one minute. The article by Ms. McKinney \ncontinues: ``And while the cure is not cost free, it costs a whole lot \nless than not facing and solving the problem. Saving lives and saving \nmoney, how can that be bad?''\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this point the Senator from Maryland has 10 \nminutes and 40 seconds and the Senator from Missouri 23 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nSarbanes amendment which would restore funding for the homeless \nassistance program. But I also rise in strong support of the leadership \nand advocacy provided by the senior Senator from Maryland. I am not the \nkind of person who likes being No. 2, but I am more than satisfied to \nbe No. 2 to this distinguished Member of the Senate, our senior \nSenator.\n  As we know, he is the ranking member on the Housing Committee. He has \nchaired the Subcommittee on Housing for a number of years, and his \nadvocacy in promoting homeownership, opportunities for the poor in \nterms of shelter, and economic and community development as well as \nbanking reform I think are to be acknowledged.\n  Senator Sarbanes really wanted to offer many amendments to this bill \nbecause there are issues in this bill related to housing and their \nskimpy allocation that warrant both debate and additional amendments. \nHe has chosen to focus his amendment on the poorest of the poor, that \nconstituency in our society that has the least advocacy.\n  The bill before us provides $760 million for homeless assistance \nprograms, a cut of $360 million under last year's appropriation and the \nPresident's request.\n  The Sarbanes amendment will restore this funding to the President's \nrequest of $1.12 billion.\n  Preliminary analysis of this cut is that HUD would serve a total of \n93,000 fewer homeless Americans, including 11,000 people who would have \nreceived housing if funding had been continued at current levels; \n23,000 Americans who would lose their homes by denying them homeless \nprevention assistance that provides short-term rental and utility \nsubsidies in times of family or financial crisis; 11,000 day care slots \nwhich would force the working poor to choose between working full-time \nand caring for their kids; 16,000 disabled Americans would lose mental \nhealth counseling provided under current levels; 14,000 homeless \npersons would be denied substance abuse counseling; and 20,000 homeless \nfamilies would lose opportunities for job placement through HUD and \nnonprofit agencies. \n\n[[Page S 14277]]\n\n  These numbers are staggering.\n  In fact, this cut represents the first reduction in the homeless \nprogram since 1989.\n  What bothers me most about this cut in homeless funding is the impact \nof this cut coupled with others that are coming down the pike.\n  Over the past 25 years the construction of the interstate highway \nsystem, immigration and migration trends, the shift from manufacturing \nto service and knowledge-based industries, and the flight of the middle \nclass have weakened our cities.\n  Poverty is growing and becoming more concentrated.\n  Twenty-five years ago 3.8 million people lived in the poorest \nneighborhoods in our largest 94 cities.\n  Today, 10.8 million people live in those same areas.\n  In those same 94 cities, unemployment increased by 66 percent between \n1970 and 1990.\n  The percentage of people employed in manufacturing jobs has dropped \nfrom 22.1 to 14 in the last 20 years.\n  The point is that as we look across the agenda that the new majority \nin this Congress is promoting, you can't help but notice the \ndevastating cumulative impacts of these cuts.\n  The deep cuts being proposed by the majority in areas like job \ntraining programs, mass transit, and community reinvestment programs \nare drawing jobs, private investment, and income out of metropolitan \nareas.\n  Cuts in Medicaid and the earned income tax credit will impact the \nworking poor.\n  And as the Federal Government continues to shift service costs to \nlocalities, metropolitan areas will be forced to choose between raising \ntaxes and cutting services and capital budgets.\n  The result is that our larger cities are increasingly becoming less \ndesirable places in which to live and work. They are becoming \nwarehouses for the poor.\n  At a time when our cities need a helping hand, this Congress is \ninstead adding to the burden. There is no better example than committee \nproposal that the pending amendment seeks to address.\n  Mr. President, we have a convergence of forces going on in America's \ncities and also in communities we call the ``inner beltway \ncommunities.'' These were the first suburban communities after World \nWar II where the infrastructure is now aging. And in our hometown of \nBaltimore, and in communities like Silver Spring and Oxon Hill, and \nsome others, and in our own home State of Maryland, we see a rising \nnumber of homeless. And we see a new kind of homeless.\n  Sure, the homeless in the past have been romanticized. Lucy played a \nhomeless lady befriended by a young woman. We saw ``Down and Out in \nLA,'' some cute, clever kind of story about a homeless guy who ends up \nin a Gucci household and transforms them in some kind of great \nmetamorphosis.\n  But I will tell you, down and out in LA, down and out in Baltimore is \nincreasing. And when we look at the homeless, we see what is the face \nof the homeless.\n  First of all, there are many people who get up and work every day but \nbecause they often work at the minimum wage, they cannot afford \nhousing. We see where men, particularly single men, are in and out of \nthe shelters but going to work. We also see an increased amount, in the \nhomeless, of single mothers who have been abandoned, often with no \nrecourse, who then are finding themselves and their children out on the \nstreet. And now what we are also seeing is the homeless vet population. \nAnd I know the Senator from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, has been an \noutspoken advocate of that. So what we are seeing is an increase in \nhomelessness because we are seeing an increase in poverty.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that very point?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The figures here in this report before me show that \nsingle men comprise 48 percent of the homeless population. Families \nwith children now comprise 39 percent of the homeless population. The \nnature of the homeless population is changing.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator knows where I live in Baltimore, not too \nfar from him, in a neighborhood called Fells Point. It used to be an \nold Polish neighborhood. It has a little bit of an entertainment \ndistrict. But now we are seeing every day the increase of homelessness \nand panhandling. Yet when you talk to the panhandlers, these are \nmothers with children trying to get a few pennies together to hold the \nbody and soul together. I live eight blocks from public housing. I live \naround the corner from a shelter for battered women. Those battered \nwomen are one step from being homeless. Fortunately, we have public \nhousing. But this increase in homelessness is due to a decline in \nwages. It is also due to the decline of opportunity. So I think, \ncoupled with what is going on in our economy combined with other cuts \nthat are going to hurt the poor, that we really do need this amendment. \nI am very much concerned about the growing number and the changing \nprofile.\n  There is nothing romantic about the homeless. The homeless do not \nthink they are romantic. The homeless think that they are homeless. And \nif you talk to people in our public schools or if you go to Mercy \nHospital in downtown Baltimore, they are treating more and--what they \nare facing in the hospitals is more and more homeless families, \nparticularly the children who have no home and no medical plan.\n  I thank the Senator for his advocacy. I look forward to his voting \nfor the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I very much appreciate the support of my colleague and \nher leadership on this bill. The appropriations subcommittee has been \ngiven an allocation which is completely inadequate to meet the funding \nneeds of the programs under her jurisdiction. I know how hard she \nstruggled with that.\n  Mr. President, let me make this point: State and local governments, \nnonprofit groups, church groups, and community groups have all joined \nin a network to try to address the problems of the homeless. They are \nworking at the local level to create comprehensive systems on behalf of \nthe homeless, systems that outreach and screening, emergency shelters, \ntransitional facilities, and permanent housing with services where that \nis necessary. Supportive housing is the approach to meeting the needs \nof the homeless about which Mrs. McKinney wrote in her article.\n  Our approach to addressing the needs of the homeless is beginning to \nwork. This is not the time for the Federal Government to back away from \nits commitment. I implore my colleague from Missouri to accept this \namendment. This amendment makes good sense. We are weighing the \ndecision between dealing with the homeless, as this amendment seeks to \ndo, and leaving those moneys in a section 8 reserve account. I do not \nthink that it is even a close call. We have to try to deal with the \nhomeless problem. We ought not to recede from the fight when we are \nfinally realizing some success.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, how much time is left on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 23 minutes; the \nSenator from Maryland has 4 minutes 16 seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am about ready to yield back my time. I \nhave some very brief comments. I yield myself 3 minutes, and if the \nproponent of the amendment wishes to conclude, then I will respond \nbriefly, and we can move on to the next amendment. While this is a very \nimportant amendment, we do not seem to have a great number of \ncolleagues wishing to debate it. So, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I have already made the point that we are dealing with \nsome very, very sensitive issues, and, unfortunately, I do not see this \namendment as being any solution whatsoever because it takes money from \nan account designed to prevent homelessness in order to add money to \nthose who are currently homeless.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BOND. We are dealing with the same population. Frankly, we are \ntrying to make sure that the money available for section 8 grants does \nnot run out next year.\n  Let me explain. There are a couple things that can happen. Not only \nif the rents go up, but if the income of the persons receiving the \nsection 8 certificate or voucher goes down, more \n\n[[Page S 14278]]\nmoney is needed. And we are digging into the same pot and potentially \ncausing the greater problem.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BOND. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would it not make more sense to take the chance that \nthe section 8 contracts will be adequate funded? The reserves are there \nfor when the rents go up or the income of the section-8-assisted people \ngo down more than anticipated. Both of these outcomes are \npossibilities, but by no means certainties. Would it not make more \nsense to take the contingent money and use it to address the current \nneeds of the homeless? Their needs are a certainty.\n  We are reducing our commitment to the fight against homelessness by \n32 percent in this legislation. You have got State and local \ngovernments working with private groups to construct this network to \ntry to deal with the homeless problem. They are relying on these \nresources and I think we should sustain our commitment. We know that \nthe homeless problem is there. The section 8 problem you are talking \nabout is only a possibility. I do not deny that using the reserves does \nraise the possibility of future section 8 needs.\n  Mr. BOND. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The section 8 offset is not money that appears out of \nnowhere.\n  Mr. BOND. If the Senator wishes to make an argument, he has 4 minutes \nleft. To respond to the question, I would say that argument holds no \nwater when he does not make any of the funds available--what is it--\nuntil September 30, 1996. This is a shell game.\n  Mr. SARBANES. No. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The money in the amendment would become available for \npurposes of running the formula and for the purposes of HUD developing \nits regulations. With this amendment, the Senator has an opportunity \nnow to make the formula approach --which he supports, as I understand \nit--work. The Senator has said himself in the committee report that he \nneeds at least $1 billion in order to fund a formula adequately. This \namendment would provide the Senator with that opportunity. The final \ncommitment of funds would not come until the end of the fiscal year, \nbut the whole process could be put in place. You could have a formula-\nbased homeless program, which everyone says is the direction in which \nto move. My amendment would give HUD the opportunity to do it.\n  Mr. BOND. Well, Mr. President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. BOND. All right. Would the proponent of the amendment wish to \npursue that? Does he wish to, on his time, state anything further? \nBecause I am prepared to yield back all of the time as soon as I make \nsome closing comments.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator wishes to respond, I will hear him out \nand then make my closing statement.\n  Mr. BOND. I will say, first, we are asking HUD to promulgate rules \nthrough negotiated rulemaking and include recommendations by State and \nlocalities, as well as homeless assistance providers.\n  This task is going to go forward in any event. A budget gimmick of \nmaking funds available on the last day of the fiscal year does not \nimprove the situation. We are going to be facing a very tight budgetary \nsituation in 1997. To attempt to move funds now and make them available \nSeptember 30 next year, unfortunately, is not a realistic way of \ndealing with the problem of homelessness. I share the concern of the \nSenator from Maryland to make sure we get a new program. Frankly, this \ndoes not do anything for it.\n  I point out that when we rescinded slightly more than this in the \nrescissions bill, that rescission was more than three-quarters of the \nway through the fiscal year when we knew what was going to happen in \nthe fiscal year. This is starting out the fiscal year by taking away \nfrom that reserve fund. I do not think that makes any sense, \nparticularly when it is not going to be needed until the end of the \nfiscal year.\n  I ask this amendment be set aside for a vote to occur--I will, when \nthe time arrives, ask that it be set aside. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I have no objection to the vote being \nset aside. I gather the Senator from Vermont wishes to offer his \namendment, and then we will vote on both of them at the same time \nseriatim.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, let me bring to the attention of the \nother Senator from Maryland, the senior Senator from Maryland, that the \nleadership is going to try to do some other amendments after the \nJeffords, of Vermont, amendment. There are Senators who need a window \nand both leaders are trying to accommodate that. I think they are \nlooking for votes somewhere around 7:30, 8 o'clock, though it has not \nbeen agreed to. That is what is floating out there. So we are trying to \nget as many amendments in.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is the parliamentary situation that a vote is to occur \non this amendment at the conclusion of the use of our time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order that the vote occur after \nthis amendment, but if at the conclusion of this debate a motion to put \nit aside takes place, the normal procedure in regular procedure would \nbe to vote at the conclusion of debate and expiration of time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That would be the regular order. I do not mind \naccommodating, but I do not want to see the vote extended way into the \nevening, I say to my colleagues.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I do not believe it will be extended into the evening, \nif the Senator agrees to lay this aside so we can go to the Jeffords \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 3 minutes, 23 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me say to my colleague from Missouri, and I am on \nthe housing committee, you say in your own report, on trying to go to a \nformula base:\n\n       . . . the Committee is worried that a block grant approach \n     with funds less than $1,000,000,000 may disadvantage some \n     areas with significant homeless problems and some homeless \n     providers.\n\n  That is on page 61.\n  What this transfer will do is it will enable HUD, in effect, to move \nto a formula grant program as it develops these negotiated regulations \nin the coming fiscal year. It is going to take time to develop those \nregulations, but they cannot structure a competition or an allocation \nof those moneys unless they are above $1 billion by your own statement \nin the report.\n  So this offers the opportunity to really move forward on the homeless \nissue, and the price we are paying for it is we are taking some moneys \nout of the section 8 program, which would not cover then the \npossibilities to which you have eluded, either that rents would rise or \nincomes of people getting section 8 would drop. Those are both \npossibilities, and I concede that.\n  But the homeless are a reality here and now, and the need to \nstructure the homeless programs in partnership with State and local \ngovernment and in partnership with the private sector must move \nforward. And the way to move it forward is to adopt this amendment, \nbringing the amount for the homeless back up to this year's level and \nthereby enabling HUD to structure a program which utilizes the formula-\ngrant approach, which the committee on which the Senator and I serve \nreported out last year on a bipartisan vote, on a 15-to-3 vote.\n  A formula grant will provide State and local governments with a \npredictable stream of funding to support their efforts to create \ncomprehensive systems: outreach and screening, emergency shelters, \ntransitional facilities and permanent housing with supportive services.\n  Comprehensive, coordinated systems such as those are critical for \naddressing the needs of the homeless population. I urge the adoption of \nthis amendment. It will actually be putting resources to work in their \nmost important and critical need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I go back to the fact we have asked HUD to engage in \nnegotiated rulemaking because HUD is unlikely to be able to put \ntogether a block grant during fiscal year 1996. Negotiated rulemaking \nwill provide the homeless advocates with the ability to fashion a block \ngrant to utilize these \n\n[[Page S 14279]]\nmoneys, and, frankly, this amendment, although it looks good to have it \nin an appropriations bill in 1995 that I hope gets signed this year for \n1996, will not make a single dollar available, cannot be allocated or \nobligated during fiscal year 1996.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will--\n  Mr. BOND. This measure does not do anything except what I think is a \nshell game to make it look better when, in fact, there is not a dollar \nthat can be allocated during the coming fiscal year because of the \nrestriction put on saying it should be restricted until September 30, \n1996.\n  While we both share the objective of taking care of the homeless, \nthis amendment is less than it appears. It does not accomplish \nanything. I, therefore, move to table it. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator withhold the tabling motion, because \nit is just not correct to say it cannot be allocated. It can be \nallocated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be put aside \nuntil such time as the leaders, by agreement, can establish the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I object. Is there time remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining. The question is--\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield me 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. There is time on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no debate on a motion to table.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Has the tabling motion been made?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time to be yielded, because we \nhave a motion to table and it is not debatable.\n  Mr. BOND. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/26/senate-section/article/S14272-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14279-S14281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER CALLS FOR U.N. REFORM\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, yesterday Secretary of State Warren \nChristopher delivered an important address to the U.N. General \nAssembly. Secretary Christopher's speech, which was made at the \ninitiation of the 50th session of the General Assembly, was remarkable \nnot only for the milestone it commemorated, but for the forward-\nthinking approach it took to the issue of U.N. reform.\n  Recent congressional debates have demonstrated that continued U.S. \nsupport for the United Nations hinges on the issue of reform. At a time \nwhen some members of Congress are questioning the fundamental utility \nof U.S. participation in the United Nations, it is imperative that the \nU.N. perform its duties effectively and in a cost-efficient manner. As \nSecretary Christopher said last night,\n\n       It is time to recognize that the UN must direct its limited \n     resources to the world's highest priorities, focusing on the \n     tasks that it performs best. The UN's bureaucracy should be \n     smaller, with a clear organizational structure and sharp \n     lines of responsibility. Each program must be held to a \n     simple standard--that is, it must make a tangible \n     contribution to the freedom, security, and well-being of real \n     people in the real world.\n\n  Mr. President, as one who was present at the creation of the United \nNations, I have tried very hard to see the U.N. live up to its \npotential and have seen the good works of which it is capable. I \nunderscore and applaud the Secretary of State's call for reform. His \ninitiative has my full support, and I hope it will receive the support \nof the Congress as well. The very future of the United Nations, and the \nsuccess of many of our own national security objectives, depend upon \nit.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Secretary's address to my colleagues and \nask unanimous consent that the full text of his remarks be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         U.S. Department of State,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Spokesman,\n\n                                 New York, NY, September 25, 1995.\n\nRemarks by Secretary of State Warren Christopher to the 50th Session of \n                  the United Nations General Assembly\n\n       Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies, \n     Distinguished Guests: It is a privilege to speak to you today \n     on behalf of the United States. A half-century ago, the \n     General Assembly first met in New York--across the river in a \n     converted skating rink at Flushing Meadows. In those modest \n     surroundings, our predecessors began to put into place an \n     ambitious framework they hoped would keep the peace as \n     successfully as they had prosecuted the war.\n       In the years since, the United Nations has helped to bring \n     peace, prosperity and hope to countless people around the \n     world. Technological change has brought nations closer \n     together than the UN's founders could possibly have foreseen. \n     The United Nations itself has been challenged in unforeseen \n     ways. It has had to manage complex humanitarian emergencies, \n     from civil wars to the mass movement of refugees to health \n     epidemics. This evolution has placed great strains on the \n     organization, and revealed the necessity for far-reaching \n     change in how it is run.\n       The Clinton Administration has vigorously made the case to \n     our Congress and our people for continued American leadership \n     at the UN. The United States made a commitment to the UN \n     Charter 50 years ago. We are determined to keep our \n     commitment, including our financial obligations.\n       We will always remember that for millions of people around \n     the world, the UN is far from a faceless institution: It is, \n     as Harry Truman once said, ``a case of food or a box of \n     school books; it is a doctor who vaccinates their children; \n     it is an expert who shows them how to raise more rice, or \n     more wheat.'' To millions more, it is the difference between \n     peace and war.\n       Economic and social development, as well as protection of \n     human rights, remain central to the UN's mission. But the UN \n     must change to meet these needs more effectively. When money \n     is wasted in New York, Geneva, or Vienna, and when time is \n     lost to bureaucratic inertia, the people who pay the price \n     are those most vulnerable to famine, disease and violence.\n       It is time to recognize that the UN must direct its limited \n     resources to the world's highest priorities, focusing on the \n     tasks that it performs best. The UN's bureaucracy should be \n     smaller, with a clear organizational structure and sharp \n     lines of responsibility. Each program must be held to a \n     simple standard--that is, it must make a tangible \n     contribution to the freedom, security, and well-being of real \n     people in the real world.\n       In the last two years, under the leadership of Secretary-\n     General Boutros-Ghali, the groundwork for substantial change \n     has been laid. The UN has an office with the functions of an \n     inspector general, and a mandate to crack down on waste and \n     fraud. Under-Secretary-General Joe Connor has embarked on an \n     aggressive campaign to improve the UN's management culture, \n     and we fully support his work. The UN Secretariat has moved \n     in the right direction by submitting a budget that begins to \n     restrain spending.\n       Now the momentum for reform must accelerate. Let me propose \n     a concrete agenda:\n       First, we must end UN programs that have achieved their \n     purpose, and consolidate programs that overlap, especially in \n     the economic and social agencies. The UN has more than a \n     dozen organizations responsible for development, emergency \n     response, and statistical reporting. We should consider \n     establishing a single agency for each of these functions. We \n     should downsize the UN's regional economic commissions. We \n     should ensure that the functions of the UN Conference on \n     Trade and Development do not duplicate the new WTO. And we \n     should adopt a moratorium on big UN conferences once the \n     present series is completed, concentrating instead on meeting \n     the commitments of those we have held.\n       Second, we need to streamline the UN Secretariat to make it \n     more efficient, accountable and transparent. Each part of the \n     UN system should be subject to the scrutiny of an inspector \n     general. The UN must not tolerate ethical or financial abuses \n     and its managers should be appointed and promoted on the \n     basis of merit.\n       Third, we should rigorously scrutinize proposals for new \n     and extended peacekeeping missions, and we should improve the \n     UN's ability to respond rapidly when new missions are \n     approved. We must agree on an equitable scale of peacekeeping \n     assessments that reflects today's economic realities. And we \n     should have a unified budget for peacekeeping operations.\n       Finally, we must maintain the effectiveness of the Security \n     Council. Germany and Japan should become permanent members. \n     We should ensure that all the world's regions are fairly \n     represented, without making the Council unwieldy.\n       We welcome the formation of the high-level group on reform, \n     initiated under the leadership of outgoing General Assembly \n     President Essy. Our goal must be that a practical blueprint \n     for UN reform will be adopted before the General Assembly's \n     50th Session finishes work next fall. The way forward is \n     clear: We have already seen countless \n\n[[Page S 14280]]\n     studies and reports. The time has come to act on the best proposals.\n       As you know, in my country there have been serious efforts \n     to curtail our support for the United Nations. The Clinton \n     Administration believes it would be reckless to turn away \n     from an organization that helps mobilize the support of other \n     nations for goals that are consistent with American and \n     global interests. But to sustain support for the UN among the \n     American people and the people of other nations, it is not \n     enough that we defend the institution. The best argument \n     against retreat is further reform. Tangible progress will \n     help us win the battle for UN support that we are waging in \n     the United States.\n       The United Nations must emerge from the reform process \n     better able to meet its fundamental goals, including the \n     preservation of peace and security. From Korea, to the \n     Persian Gulf, to Haiti, the UN has provided a mandate to its \n     members as they carried out this responsibility. The UN's own \n     blue helmets have helped nations create the basic conditions \n     of peace in some of the most difficult situations imaginable, \n     even though they have not always fully achieved their \n     intended purpose.\n       Recently, a young Haitian father was asked what \n     peacekeeping forces had achieved in his country. ``We walk \n     freely,'' he answered. ``We sleep quietly. There are no men \n     who come for us in the night.'' In Haiti, as for example in \n     Cambodia, Mozambique and El Salvador, the UN has shown that \n     peacekeeping, for all of its limitations, has been an \n     enormously useful instrument.\n       Our region where UN forces and the international community \n     have played a critical role is the Middle East. Another \n     historic milestone will be marked this Thursday in Washington \n     when Israel and the Palestinians sign their agreement to \n     implement phase two of the Declaration of Principles. That \n     agreement will bring to life a goal first set in the Camp \n     David accords--that is, to protect Israel's security and to \n     give Palestinians throughout the West Bank control over their \n     daily lives. The international community and the UN must \n     continue to support this process politically and \n     economically.\n       Without a doubt, the UN has never undertaken a mission more \n     difficult than the one in the former Yugoslavia. The \n     limitations of that mission are well known. But we must also \n     recognize that it has provided relief for hundreds of \n     thousands of people and saved thousands of lives. Today, with \n     diplomacy backed by force, the United States and the \n     international community are moving forward on a track that is \n     producing genuinely hopeful results. The United Nations and \n     NATO are working together effectively to bring peace to the \n     region. On September 8 in Geneva, the parties to the conflict \n     accepted the fundamental goal the Security Council has often \n     expressed--namely, the continuation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as \n     a single state within its current internationally recognized \n     borders. When I meet with the foreign ministers of Bosnia, \n     Croatia, and Serbia later today, I will urge them to maintain \n     momentum toward peace and to establish constitutional \n     structures for Bosnia.\n       The framers of the UN Charter created this institution to \n     meet threats to peace and security posed by aggression and \n     armed conflict. These threats are still very much with us. \n     But the world also faces a set of new security challenges, \n     including proliferation, terrorism, international crime and \n     narcotics, as well as the far-reaching consequences of damage \n     to the environment. These have assumed a new and dangerous \n     scope in a more interdependent world. As President Clinton \n     said in San Francisco in June, the ``new forces of \n     integration carry within them the seeds of disintegration and \n     destruction.''\n       While new technologies have brought us closer together, \n     they have also made it easier for terrorists, drug dealers, \n     and other international criminals to acquire weapons of mass \n     destruction, to set up cocaine cartels, and to hide their \n     ill-gotten gains. The collapse of communism has shattered \n     dictatorships. But it has also left the political and legal \n     institutions of newly liberated nations even more vulnerable \n     to those who seek to subvert them.\n       Although these threats are sometimes sponsored by states, \n     they increasingly follow no flag. Each of us must vigorously \n     fight these enemies on our own. But we will never be truly \n     secure until we effectively fight them together. That is the \n     new security challenge for the global community. It must be \n     the new security mission of the UN.\n       There is no area where the UN can make a more significant \n     contribution than in nonproliferation. Fifty years ago, the \n     United States was the only country capable of making a \n     nuclear bomb. Today, many countries have the technology that \n     would enable them to turn a fist-sized chunk of plutonium \n     into a bomb as small as a suitcase. That is one reason why \n     more than 170 countries agreed to extend for all time the \n     Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty last May, at the conference \n     chaired here by Ambassador Dhanapala. We must build on that \n     achievement.\n       First, we should have a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ready \n     for signature by the time we meet here next year. As \n     President Clinton announced last moth, the United States is \n     committed to a true zero-yield test ban. We urge other \n     nations to join us in that commitment.\n       Second, we should immediately start negotiations on a \n     Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty. Those who have been most \n     vocal in calling for nuclear disarmament should recognize \n     that it is essential to ban future production of fissile \n     material for nuclear weapons.\n       Third, we should push forward with the historic reductions \n     of the nuclear arsenals of the United States and the \n     countries of the former Soviet Union. I call on the U.S. \n     Senate, as well as the Russian Duma, to approve the START II \n     Treaty so that we can lock in deep cuts in our strategic \n     nuclear arsenals. In addition, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin \n     are working together to ensure the safety, transparency and \n     irreversibility of nuclear arms reductions.\n       As part of this process, President Yeltsin will host a \n     Nuclear Safety and Security Summit in Moscow next spring. The \n     Summit should have an ambitious agenda, including a \n     declaration of principles on nuclear reactor safety. We look \n     to the summit to address the worldwide problem of nuclear \n     waste management, including ocean dumping. The Summit should \n     also promote a plan of action to Safeguard nuclear materials. \n     That plan should include new measures to prevent criminals \n     and terrorists from acquiring nuclear material for use in \n     weapons.\n       Finally, we should push for the earliest possible entry-\n     into-force of the Chemical Weapons Convention. President \n     Clinton has urged the U.S. Senate to act promptly on its \n     ratification, and to stop holding it and the START II treaty \n     hostage to unrelated issues. The world has witnessed the \n     effect of poison gas too many times in this century--on \n     European battlefields during World War I, in Ethiopia and \n     Manchuria during the 1930s, and against Iranian soldiers and \n     innocent Kurdish civilians in the 1980s. The Chemical Weapons \n     Convention will make every nation safer, and we need it now.\n       The UN is also playing an invaluable role in focusing \n     attention on pressing regional poliferation problems. In Iraq \n     UNSCOM and its chairman Rolf Ekeus continue to uncover \n     horrific details about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       Under Saddam Hussein, Iraq developed a deadly biological \n     weapons capacity hidden from view. It was conducting research \n     to turn some of the most toxic substances known to man into \n     weapons of war. We know Saddam succeeded in putting anthrax \n     and botulism in bombs and missile warheads. In December 1990, \n     he deployed these with every intent to using them against the \n     international coalition and innocent civilians. He was \n     dissuaded only by the steadfast determination of the United \n     States and the international community.\n       In light of what Ambassador Ekeus has uncovered, we can \n     only conclude that for the last four and a half years Saddam \n     Hussein has lied about the full scope of Iraq's weapons \n     programs. There should be no easing of the sanctions regime \n     until the Iraqi government complies with all the demands of \n     the Security Council and demonstrates that it has changed its \n     ways.\n       The UN should also promote responsibility and restraint in \n     the transfer of conventional weapons. Last year at the \n     General Assembly, President Clinton proposed, and the \n     Assembly approved, the eventual elimination of antipersonnel \n     landmines. On my recent trip to Cambodia, I saw the terrible \n     damage these hidden killers can do. This year, we will again \n     call on other countries to join us in ending the export of \n     landmines.\n       Two years ago, President Clinton called on the \n     international community to devise a true international system \n     that governs transfers of conventional weapons and sensitive \n     dual-use technologies. I am pleased that the Russian \n     Federation has joined with the United States and 26 other \n     countries to agree on common principles to control the build-\n     up of dangerous conventional arms. We hope to activate this \n     global regime, called the New Forum, by the end of this year.\n       The proliferation of weapons has added a disturbing \n     dimension to another threat we all face: international \n     terrorism. Indeed, this year's sarin gas attack in Tokyo is a \n     grim warning of what can happen when terrorists acquire \n     weapons of mass destruction.\n       More nations are joining the fight against those \n     individuals and groups who attack civilians for political \n     ends. The United Nations has supported this effort in \n     important ways. The UN Security Council recognized the \n     importance of countering state-sponsored terrorism by \n     imposing sanctions against Libya for the bombing of Pan Am \n     103 and UTA 772.\n       Terrorists should be treated as criminals and there must be \n     no place where they can hide from the consequences of their \n     acts. States that sponsor terrorists should feel the full \n     weight of sanctions that can be imposed by the international \n     community. Let us not deceive ourselves: Every dollar that \n     goes into the government coffers of a state sponsor of \n     terrorism such as Iran helps pay for a terrorist's bullets or \n     bombs. Iran's role as the foremost state sponsor of terrorism \n     makes its secret quest for weapons of mass destruction even \n     more alarming. We must stand together to prevent Iran from \n     acquiring such threatening capabilities.\n       The United States has taken a leading role in meeting the \n     international terrorist threat. We have intensified our \n     sanctions against Iran. Last January, President Clinton also \n     issued an Executive Order prohibiting financial transactions \n     with terrorist groups and individuals who threaten the Middle \n     East peace process. We are urging our Congress to tighten our \n     immigration and criminal laws to keep terrorists on the run \n     or put them behind bars.\n       The United States strongly supports the counter-terrorism \n     measures the G-7 and Russia announced at the Halifax Summit, \n     and \n\n[[Page S 14281]]\n     we expect the P-8 Ministerial Meeting on Terrorism in Ottawa to produce \n     a concrete action plan to implement these measures.\n       Other kinds of international crime also threaten the safety \n     of our citizens and the fabric of our societies. And \n     globalization brings new and frightening dimensions to crime. \n     The threat of crime is a particular menace to young \n     democracies. It weakens confidence in institutions, preys on \n     the most vulnerable, and undermines free market reform.\n       Of course, every country must take its own measures to \n     combat these threats. The Clinton Administration is now \n     completing a review of our approach to transnational crime \n     that will lead to a stronger, more coordinated attack on this \n     problem.\n       To help other states deal with criminal threats, the United \n     States and Hungary have created the International Law \n     Enforcement Academy in Budapest to train police officers and \n     law enforcement officials from Central Europe and the states \n     of the former Soviet Union. We are providing similar help \n     bilaterally and through the UN Drug Control Program to \n     countries whose laws are challenged by drug cartels.\n       A particularly insidious form of crime and corruption is \n     money laundering. All nations should implement \n     recommendations by the OECD to attack money laundering. The \n     nations of this hemisphere should also advance the anti-money \n     laundering initiative introduced at last December's Summit of \n     the Americas. Together, we must squeeze the dirty money out \n     of our global financial system.\n       Through the UN's conventions on drugs and crime, the \n     international community has set strong standards that we must \n     now enforce. We call on UN member states who have not already \n     joined the 1988 UN Drug Convention to do so. Those countries \n     who have approved the convention should move quickly to \n     implement its key provisions.\n       We are increasingly aware that damage to the environment \n     and unsustainable population growth threaten the security of \n     our nations and the well-being of our peoples. Their harmful \n     effects are evident in famines, infant mortality rates, \n     refugee crises, and ozone depletion. In places like Rwanda \n     and Somalia, they contribute to civil wars and emergencies \n     that can only be resolved by costly international \n     intervention. We must carry out the commitments we made at \n     last year's Cairo Conference, and the Rio Conference three \n     years ago.\n       Never have our problems been more complex. It has never \n     been more evident that these problems affect all nations, \n     developed and developing, alike. Only by working together can \n     we effectively deal with the new threats we all face.\n       That is why, on this 50th anniversary year, we must shape \n     the UN's agenda as if we were creating the institution anew. \n     Just as the UN's founders devised a new framework to deter \n     aggression and armed conflict, the United Nations, in \n     particular the Security Council, must now assign the same \n     priority to combating the threat posed by proliferation, \n     terrorism, international crime, narcotics, and environmental \n     pollution. We should dedicate our efforts in the UN and \n     elsewhere to turning our global consensus against these \n     threats into concrete action. We must renew and reform the \n     United Nations not for its sake, but for our own.\n       Thank you very much.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my previous \ntabling motion be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Maryland be recognized for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I simply want to address the argument by \nmy colleague that passing this amendment will not serve a purpose. The \namendment will, in effect, enable HUD to implement a formula approach \nwith respect to the homeless problems in the coming year. HUD could \nstructure the formula approach so that State and local governments, the \nhomeless assistance providers, the church groups, and the community \ngroups could come in and anticipate their expected level of funding off \na $1.1 billion figure. The Appropriations Committee itself has said \nthey have to have more than $1 billion in order to make the formula \napproach work.\n  They are going to negotiate regulations. That will take a good part \nof the fiscal year. The end result of all of this is a greater \ncommitment to dealing with the homeless.\n  I concede that we are taking money from the section 8 program. I \nthink in the order of priorities, addressing the homeless ought to come \nahead of that.\n  Then people say, well, the following fiscal year the amount needed \nfor section 8 is going to double from $4 billion to $8 billion. If it \nis that order of magnitude you will need an entirely new solution. You \nwill not solve it by this $360 million here that is being held in the \nreserve.\n  This money, though, could make an enormous difference with respect to \naddressing the homeless problem.\n  Therefore, I very strongly renew my support of the amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Let me just conclude this discussion by saying that under the system \nthat has been suggested by my colleague from Maryland, which is an \neffort to solve the homeless problem, we are still in a budgetary \nquandary. We have not solved the budgetary problem.\n  The Budget Committee will score the outlays during the year in which \nthey occur no matter when they have been allocated. If, when the budget \nauthority has been granted, if we move the funds to fiscal year 1997, \nas the amendment by my friend from Maryland would do, we will have that \nmany fewer dollars to spend, that many fewer dollars in outlays to \nspend during fiscal year 1997.\n  That is why I say that we have asked HUD to enter into negotiated \nrulemaking to try to get these funds out to deal with not only the \nfunds we have appropriated in this bill but the funds, $297 million, \nmade available in the rescission bill for the coming year, and utilize \nthose funds to deal with the homeless problem.\n  That is why again I regretfully say that moving money from one pocket \nto another does not overcome the appropriations and budgetary problems, \nand does not move us any further towards the goal of serving the \nhomeless and those who need section 8 public housing assistance.\n  Mr. President, is all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment \nbe set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2783\n\n (Purpose: To require EPA to give priority to small businesses in its \n ``green programs'' and to require EPA to perform a study to determine \n       the feasibility of making these programs self-sufficient)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], for himself and \n     Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Chafee, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Simon, \n     Mr. Biden, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bumpers, \n     and Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 2783.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 151, line 11, insert:\n\n     SEC.  . ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND ENERGY SUPPLY PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Priority for Small Businesses.--During fiscal year 1996 \n     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     shall give priority in providing assistance in its Energy \n     Efficiency and Energy Supply programs to organizations that \n     are recognized as small business concerns under section 3(a) \n     of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(a)).\n       (b) Study.--The Administrator shall perform a study to \n     determine the feasibility of establishing fees to recover all \n     reasonable costs incurred by EPA for assistance rendered \n     businesses in its Energy Efficiency and Energy Supply \n     program. The study shall include, among other things, an \n     evaluation of making the Energy Efficiency and Energy Supply \n     Program self-sustaining, the value of the assistance rendered \n     to businesses, providing exemptions for small businesses, and \n     making the fees payable directly to a fund that would be \n     available for use by EPA as needed for this program. The \n     Administrator shall report to Congress by March 15, 1996 on \n\n[[Page S 14282]]\n     the results of this study and EPA's plan for implementation.\n       (c) Funding.--For fiscal year 1996, up to $100 million of \n     the funds appropriated to the Environmental Protection Agency \n     may be used by the Administrator to support global \n     participation in the Montreal Protocol facilitation fund and \n     for the climate change action plan programs including the \n     green programs.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will not take very long, and I want to \nthank the managers of the bill for agreeing to an amendment to our \noriginal proposal, which makes good sense and which I think improves \nthe amendment. I appreciate their cooperation.\n  I am offering this amendment on behalf of myself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \nChafee, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Simon, Mr. Biden, Mr. Lieberman, \nMr. Kohl, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bumpers, and Mr. Leahy.\n  What this amendment does is to restore the EPA Administrator's \nability to fulfill our obligations under the Montreal Protocol. In \naddition, it will authorize the EPA Administrator to fund the \nsuccessful green programs, including Green Lights and Energy Stars \nBuilding Programs.\n  The net effect, actually, of this amendment as far as present \nspending will actually decrease because it will raise by fee some \nrevenues to assist in the second program that I mentioned.\n  I need not go into detail on the importance of the Montreal Protocol. \nLast year, the Congress appropriated $119 million for these important \nprograms--$101 million for the green programs and roughly $17 million \nfor the Montreal Protocol multilateral fund. This amendment will allow \nthe Administrator to spend up to $100 million on these programs, \nactually a 13 percent decrease from last year's levels.\n  Again, it is authorization to spend. It is not a specific authority \nfor those programs. That will be up to the administrator.\n  I will not go into detail on this. I do not want to take the time of \nour Members here for this.\n  I will summarize now the green programs. There is no money for the \ngreen programs. I remember President Bush searching for alternatives to \noverregulation, command and control policies of the 1970's and 1985's. \nHe longed to find a way to control production in a nonregulatory free \nmarket manner.\n  His legacy through the environment is his success in developing just \nsuch a program which we are referring to this evening. The Green Lights \nProgram and Energy Stars Program are a testament to the type of \ninnovative programs we must implement if we wish to reduce the \nregulatory burden faced by industry today. The programs are volunteer, \nreduce energy use, save business money, and stimulate markets for clean \nalternative energy technologies and services. What more could you ask \nfor?\n  Green Lights is simple. EPA provides technical assistance to help a \ncompany survey its facilities and upgrade its lighting. Since its \ninception, Green Lights has saved companies hundreds of millions of \ndollars and dramatically reduced air pollution emissions, all without \none regulation.\n  I have to my left here a chart which shows--how often do you get to \nthe cover of Time Magazine? This is an important public-private \npartnership. Just ask companies in my own State like IBM, our largest \nutility--Green Mountain Power, Jay Peak Ski Area, and many others, \nincluding small businesses.\n  Now I had several Members that wanted to speak but due to the \ngracious acceptance of this amendment by the managers, I will yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nJeffords-Bingaman amendment to the VA-HUD appropriations bill, which \nwould restore authority to the EPA Administrator to expend funds on \ntheir atmospheric pollution prevention programs, and on the Montreal \nProtocol Multilateral Fund.\n  This amendment requires no new money of any offsets to H.R. 2099. It \nmerely allows the administrator to use appropriated funds from the $1.6 \nbillion program and administration fund to continue what we believe is \nessential work going on at EPA. It does not affect the overall budget \ncuts prescribed in the bill.\n  The Green Lights Program represents one of the best ideas of the past \n20 years in the field of environmental protection. As our framework of \nenvironmental laws has evolved since 1970, we have been shown the \npositives and negatives of command and control regulation. While strict \nstandards have been successful in many ways at reducing pollution, they \nhave also proven costly and unwieldy for complying companies in some \nsituations.\n  The Green Programs at EPA have done an exceptional job at saving \nenergy and reducing pollution in a voluntary, flexible manner which \nshould be emulated and expanded rather than zeroed out. In 1994 alone, \nGreen Lights and Energy Star prevented $69 million metric tons of \ncarbon equivalent, including 5.1 billion pounds of carbon monoxide, \n14.1 million pounds of sulfur dioxide, and 6 million pounds of nitrogen \noxides.\n  While these pollution reductions are a positive step, the more \nimpressive fact is that these improvements are making money for State \nand local governments, companies, nonprofits and other organizations in \nalmost every case. The Green Lights and Energy Star Programs saved $92 \nmillion in utility bills in 1994 alone.\n  Corporate welfare is a term one hears of often these days, both in \nand outside of this body. I am strongly supportive of reducing \nunnecessary subsidies to private industry wherever possible. However, \nlabeling the EPA programs as corporate welfare is just plain wrong. No \ndirect subsidies are given to corporations or any other participants. \nIn fact, no direct marketing is done on behalf of any specific \nmanufacturer or contractor. EPA merely alerts energy users to the \nfinancial savings and public relations benefits of the programs and \ngives them a long list of businesses that can do the work. All sales \nand contracting is the responsibility of the companies involved.\n  I have heard many statements in this Chamber railing against the \nevils of environmental regulation. If the majority also eliminates \ncooperative, voluntary, non-regulatory approaches to environmental \nprotection, what alternatives remain?\n  Also restored in this amendment is the authority of the Administrator \nto expend Federal dollars on the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund. \nStratospheric ozone depletion from man-made chlorofluorocarbons [CFC's] \nis a real and pressing problem. Due to prompt action on the part of the \nCongress to phase out production of CFC's in the Clean Air Act, ozone \ndepletion will likely peak in the year 2000, and restore itself \ngradually during the following 3 to 5 decades.\n  The United States is enduring significant transition cost to \naccomplish the phase-out and must be assured that our progress is not \nundercut by rampant CFC use in developing countries. Our participation \nin the Montreal Protocol is essential for those recovery projections to \nbe realized.\n  I understand that the subcommittee chairman would like to see the \nMontreal Protocol funded by the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. It \ndoes not make a difference to me if the Senators from Missouri and \nKentucky want to work out an arrangement. However, our treaty \nobligations to the Montreal Protocol are vital, and whether our \ncommitments to it are met should not be subject to a squabble over what \nsubcommittee should provide the funds.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, these programs are programs that I think are \nvitally in need of restructuring and reoriented and bringing in to the \nmodern day.\n  No question that Green Lights may have done some good for some big \ncompanies. This is really a distinguished group of companies. You can \nsee Martin Marietta, General Dynamics, Warner Lambert, Phillips \nPetroleum, Whirlpool, Xerox, U.S. West, TransAmerica, all these \ncompanies have saved millions of dollars through the Green Lights \nProgram. Great.\n  What I think is that it is time to say enough corporate welfare. \nStart getting these people who are benefiting to pay for it. I have \nagreed with the sponsors of this amendment to accept their permissive \nlanguage and to make some changes.\n  No. 1, we say that there ought to be a priority for small businesses. \nDuring fiscal year 1996, the Administrator of the EPA shall give \npriority to providing assistance in its energy efficiency \n\n[[Page S 14283]]\nand energy supply programs to organizations that are recognized as \nsmall business concerns under section 3(A) of the Small Business Act.\n  Get out of the business of providing very scarce taxpayer resources \nto help very large companies save money on energy. They ought to be \nsaving it. We have started the program. We have shown how they can save \nmoney. Let them pay for it.\n  No. 2, we will include a study. The Administrator must determine the \nfeasibility of establishing fees to recover all reasonable costs \nincurred by EPA for assistance rendered businesses in the energy \nefficiency and energy supply program. The study should include making \nthe program self-sustaining, the value of the assistance rendered to \nbusinesses, providing exemptions for small businesses, making the fees \npayable directly to a fund that would be available for use by EPA as \nneeded for this program.\n  Nobody here is challenging the need for energy efficiency. It is \nvitally important from the environment standpoint, from a cost \nstandpoint. It makes good sense. I do not believe that we ought to \ncontinue to have the Federal Government paying out this high-class \ncorporate welfare.\n  This is a significant step toward weaning those large companies away \nfrom that endeavor.\n  Now, let me address the Montreal Protocol, and let me state to my \ncolleagues that both of these are permissive. EPA is going to have to \neat into its own budget to the extent it wants to use up to $100 \nmillion to support the climate change program in the Green Lights \nprogram or the Montreal Protocol facilitation funds. I hope they will \nbe careful in utilizing those funds because we need those funds to be \nused on cleaning up the environment here in this country, not providing \nforeign aid to other countries under the Montreal Protocol and not \nusing up dollars in helping the largest corporations save money by \ninstituting energy-efficiency programs.\n  Let me tell you briefly about the Montreal Protocol funds. The fund \nreceived $116 million from the U.S. Government over the past few years. \nIt is an international fund, managed through the State Department, to \nsupport developing countries in their efforts to phase out ozone-\ndepleting chemicals. It is a worthwhile goal, but I do not see why the \nEPA, which is strapped for funds, is going to want to spend much of its \nmoney on that. I think, if we really want to provide foreign aid for \nother countries to improve their environment, we ought to be looking at \nthe State Department.\n  I understand the Senator from Vermont had expressed concern about \ncuts in the foreign operations appropriations bill, the account which \nprovides funding for the Montreal Protocol funds. That, I believe, is \nwhere it should be funded in the future. This subcommittee is not able \nto make up for shortfalls in other appropriations bills. We will allow \nthe EPA, as a transition, to utilize those funds to the extent \nnecessary. But I really believe the funds are better spent on \nenvironmental protection activities at home. We have provided the funds \nas available for these activities. We provided the Montreal Protocol \nfunds some $116 million. I think the EPA can determine how to utilize \nits scarce resources and phase out the funding of these programs.\n  The companies that have benefited from the Green Lights programs, we \ncongratulate them and urge the EPA to move on to self-funding.\n  With that, Mr. President----\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, if I might, I would just like to make a \ncouple of comments on this. It is my understanding the distinguished \nfloor manager is prepared to accept this?\n  Mr. BOND. We are prepared to accept the amendment, and we appreciate \nthe support of our colleagues for the program.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I commend the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee \nof the Appropriations Committee for accepting this. Let me just say a \ncouple of words, if I might, about the Montreal Protocol.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, every single Member of this Senate, and \nindeed members of the Republican Party, should be extremely proud of \nthe Montreal Protocol. Why? Because it was signed under the \nadministration of Ronald Reagan. This is what President Reagan said on \nApril 5, 1988, about the Montreal Protocol:\n\n       The Montreal Protocol is a model of cooperation. It is a \n     product of the recognition and international consensus that \n     ozone depletion is a global problem.\n\n  I am going to come back to that in a minute, because often it is \nsaid, only spend your money on domestic problems. But ozone depletion \ncannot be solved just by the United States alone. ``It is a global \nproblem,'' as President Reagan said, ``both in terms of its causes and \nits effects. The Protocol is a result of an extraordinary process of \nscientific study, negotiations among representatives of the business \nand environmental communities, and international diplomacy. It is a \nmonumental achievement,'' said Ronald Reagan, and he was absolutely \nright.\n  With respect to the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund, how does the \nmoney come about and who contributes? Let us just take what is \nhappening right now. The United States is supposed to contribute $38 \nmillion a year to this international fund. Where does it come from? \nBecause of funding shortfalls in previous years, the State Department \nrequested $27 million and the EPA requested $24 million. That is a \ntotal of $51 million for fiscal year 1996. The amounts in excess of the \n$38 million cap were requested to make up for past years. In other \nwords, the request is up some. The point I am making is it is split \nbetween the State Department and the EPA.\n  Who else contributes? There are 40 other nations that are \ncontributing. The United States puts in a total of $38 million. Japan \nputs in $22 million, Germany $16 million, United Kingdom $9 million, \nCanada $5 million, and so forth.\n  I am advised that the contributions to the multilateral fund have \nbeen at a higher rate--85 percent of the assessed amounts are \ncontributed. This is the highest of any known U.N. trust funds. So it \nis working.\n  I would just like to point out a quote from the July 14, 1994, \njournal of Science. That is the name of the journal. It published the \nfindings of an international group of scientists who concluded that \n``methyl chloroform, one of the chief threats to the Earth's protective \nozone layer, has begun to diminish. Other researchers confirm the \nfinding, first reported 2 years ago, that chlorofluorocarbons, CFC's, \nhave almost stopped increasing in the atmosphere.''\n  You might say why have they not stopped completely? You have had this \nMontreal Protocol since 1987. The facts are, it takes a significant \namount of time for the CFC's to go from the Earth up into the \nstratosphere where they do their damage. So, if we can stabilize--if \nour reports show they are stabilizing in the atmosphere, that means the \nefforts we have made to reduce the emissions are working and pretty \nsoon the destruction of the ozone layer will go into a rapid decline \nfrom the activities that are taking place now. So, we can congratulate \nourselves. Here is something that has worked.\n  I want to just say how happy I am that we have worked out this \nagreement this evening; that both the distinguished ranking member and \ndistinguished manager of the bill, the senior Senator from Missouri, \nhave accepted these proposals. I am particularly interested in the \nMontreal Protocol side of it, having been connected with it for some \nyears.\n  Again, it is my view that the Republicans can pat themselves on the \nback for this measure, because it occurred under a Republican \nadministration with a Republican President leading the way.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Vermont for his efforts in \nconnection with this this evening. I am glad we have reached a \ncompromise and that the amendment of the Senator from Vermont has been \naccepted.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a letter to me from the \nAlliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy dated September 19, 1995, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S 14284]]\n\n                                          Alliance for Responsible\n\n\n                                           Atmospheric Policy,\n\n                                Arlington, VA, September 19, 1995.\n     Hon. John Chafee,\n     U.S. Senate, 506 Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Chafee: On behalf of the Alliance for \n     Responsible Atmospheric Policy, I urge you to support the \n     appropriation of funds to fulfill the U.S. commitment to the \n     Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal \n     Protocol. The Multilateral Fund provides resources for \n     developing countries to comply with the Protocol's \n     requirements to phase out of the production of ozone-\n     depleting compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). \n     Appropriation of moneys to the Fund have been eliminated in \n     the EPA budget and substantially reduced in the State \n     Department's budget.\n       The Alliance is the internationally recognized U.S. \n     industry coalition which is composed of producers of CFCs and \n     their alternatives; and several hundred manufacturers and \n     organizations whose products and services rely on CFCs and \n     their alternatives. The Alliance was organized in 1980 and \n     continues to assist government in the development of \n     reasonable international and U.S. government policies \n     regarding ozone protection. A list of Alliance members is \n     attached.\n       Industry has worked diligently over recent years with \n     policymakers to seek sensible international requirements for \n     the phaseout of ozone-depleting compounds. We have done so \n     because the best scientific information has led us to \n     conclude that the concern for human induced alternation of \n     the ozone layer is a serious ``global'' environmental \n     concern. Unilateral requirements imposed on U.S. industry \n     alone would be neither fair nor environmentally beneficial in \n     solving the overall global problem of ozone depletion. \n     Therefore, the Montreal Protocol, ratified by 149 countries, \n     provides an unprecedented forum for all nations to work \n     together to solve this global environmental problem.\n       The United Nations Environment Programme Science Assessment \n     Report shows that one of the few remaining obstacles to \n     recovery of the ozone layer is the growth of CFCs in \n     developing countries. Developing countries must be urged to \n     continue their transition to alternatives and phase out of \n     CFCs as soon as feasible. The Mulitlateral Fund helps to \n     ensure the success of the Montreal Protocol by providing \n     needed assistance to these developing countries. Without \n     funding for the implementation of CFC alternatives in \n     developing countries, these countries will continue to use \n     ozone-depleting CFCs because they are the best option \n     available to them as their economies grow to meet their \n     society's needs. Developing countries need assistance through \n     the Fund in phasing out of CFCs and utilizing new \n     technologies.\n       Industry is proud of its accomplishments in ozone \n     protection, by its efforts to phase out of CFCs ahead of \n     schedule, and in its investment of several billion dollars to \n     identify and introduce ozone-protecting alternative \n     technologies. Therefore, it is critically important that \n     Congress provide as much oversight as necessary of federal \n     agencies, such as EPA, to ensure that U.S. interests and \n     alternative technologies are not disadvantaged or prejudiced \n     in the Multilateral Fund's CFC phaseout projects. In \n     addition, the Fund should not be used to implement any \n     acceleration of the phaseout of hydrochlorofluorocarbons \n     (HCFCs) beyond the 1992 Copenhagen Amendments to the Montreal \n     Protocol.\n       The Multilateral Fund is an integral part of the effort to \n     ensure that alternative technologies are adopted globally. \n     The U.S. contribution to the Fund is only a relatively small \n     but important symbol of the U.S. commitment to this effort. \n     The U.S. agreed to the Fund assistance as part of its treaty \n     obligation; and it should not renege on this obligation. \n     Government and industry in the United States have shown both \n     strong leadership in ozone protection and a commitment to the \n     success of the Montreal Protocol. In order to fulfill this \n     commitment and continue U.S. leadership, we urge you to \n     support the funding of the Multilateral Fund.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     David Stirpe,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n 1994/1995 Membership List Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy\n\n       3M Company.\n       A.

Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered \nby Senator Jeffords, which would make $100 million available for \nparticipation by the United States in the Montreal Protocol \nFacilitation Fund and the Climate Change Action Plan green programs. \nThis funding is critical if we are to protect the ozone layer from \nfurther erosion and continue our progress in helping American industry \nbecome more energy-efficient.\n  The Montreal Protocol Facilitation Fund helps implement the \ninternational phaseout of CFC's--chemicals that deplete the ozone \nlayer. In turn, it helps make the lives of every American safer and \nhealthier, protecting us from radiation that causes skin cancer.\n  To date, the Fund has provided over $300 million for almost 900 \nactivities in 80 developing countries around the world. These projects \nhave resulted in the elimination of over 55,000 tons of ozone-depleting \nchemicals--representing roughly 25 percent of the developing nation's \nozone-depleting chemical use.\n  Why does this effort merit the Senate's support? Let me suggest two \nreasons.\n  First, developing countries are rapidly industrializing, making \nchoices about the technologies they will employ to improve their \nstandard of living. The choices they make will affect the health of \neveryone who inhabits this planet, and Americans are no exception.\n  Developing countries can profit from the lessons of more developed \ncountries and avoid the environmentally damaging mistakes that have \nalready been made. Or, they can follow the path of least short-term \nresistance and make the current ozone depletion problem even worse. If \ndeveloping nations chose to industrialize using ozone-destroying CFC's, \nthen all countries could suffer, since the ozone hole will continue to \ngrow.\n  Second, American businesses benefit from the global market for ozone-\nfriendly equipment created by this international effort. To date, U.S. \ncompanies have sold millions of dollars' worth of equipment designed to \nprevent the release of ozone-destroying compounds as a result of the \nprogram. Clearly, further investment by the United States in this \nprogram is very much in our interest.\n  In addition to eliminating funding for the Montreal Protocol \nFacilitation Fund, the VA-HUD appropriations bill cuts $90 million from \nthe Climate Change Action Plan green programs. The Jeffords amendment \nwould restore most of this funding.\n  The cuts in this account primarily affect EPA's green programs. The \nGreen Lights Program, for example, provides information, training, \ntechnical reports, and other assistance, but not direct financial \nassistance, to companies to encourage them to invest in highly energy-\nefficient lighting, heating, and cooling technologies designed to save \nenergy.\n  In my view, these programs represent the type of public/private \ninitiative we should be encouraging--a government and industry \npartnership that protects the environment and reduces our consumption \nof energy, thereby making domestic industries more competitive.\n  Green Lights is so popular that businesses throughout the country \nhave signed up. Nearly 2,000 businesses and other institutions \nparticipate in the program today.\n  In my home State of South Dakota, Gateway 2000 and the State \ngovernment both are participating in the Green Lights Program. It has \nbeen a great success, saving energy, reducing costs, and cutting \npollution.\n  Mr. President, I commend Senator Jeffords for offering this amendment \nand urge my colleagues to vote to restore the funding for the Montreal \nProtocol Facilitation Fund and the Climate Change Action Plan green \nprograms.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleague from \nVermont, Senator Jeffords, in support of the Montreal Protocol Fund--an \nextraordinarily successful multilateral agreement to phase out the use \nof ozone-depleting chemicals.\n  Since the early 1970's, scientists from both academia and the \nbusiness community have warned us that the \nuse of chlorofluorocarbons--commonly known as CFC's--as refrigerants \nand solvents damages the Earth's stratospheric ozone shell.\n  This ozone shield absorbs some of the sun's harmful ultraviolet, or \nUV radiation. Increased amounts of this radiation will raise the risk \nof skin cancer and cataracts, impair the functioning of human immune \nsystems, and could adversely impact the global food supply.\n  As a direct consequence of CFC use, scientists identified literally a \nhole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, in 1985.\n  An intensive investigation concluded that this hole, which increased \neach consecutive year from 1990 to 1994, and which is expected to \nenlarge again this year to over 3.9 million square miles--roughly the \nsize of Europe, was caused by chlorine from dissolved CFC compounds.\n  The ensuing inquiry also detected falling concentrations of ozone \nover the North and South Temperate Zones--the former includes the \nUnited States incidentally.\n  In response to this growing threat, 47 of the world's developed and \ndeveloping countries joined together in September 1987, and formed the \nMontreal Protocol.\n  This agreement bound the leading ozone-using countries to first \nfreeze, and later phaseout, the use of these chemicals.\n  At present, over 120 countries have voluntarily signed onto the \nProtocol, making it the broadest and most successful international \ncollaboration in world history.\n  Protocol member nations have accelerated the CFC phaseout schedule \ntwice, and have agreed upon a complete \n\n[[Page S 14286]]\nelimination of halons in 1994, and of CFC's by the end of this year.\n  Protocol member nations also recognized that the disproportionate \nreliance upon ozone-depleting substances by the developing world \nthreatens to eliminate any progress.\n  Consequently, 30 developed nations formed the Montreal Protocol Fund \nin 1990, to provide technical assistance to developing nations, as they \nmake the transition to less harmful technologies.\n  To date, roughly $350 million has been committed for 900 projects in \nmore than 85 developing countries. When fully implemented, these \nprojects are anticipated to cut the developing countries' use of ozone-\ndepleting chemicals by almost one-third--55,000 tons.\n  A recent report produced under the auspices of the United Nations \nEnvironmental Program indicates we are making some headway--since 1989, \nthe rate of growth of major ozone-depleting substances in the \nstratosphere has declined significantly.\n  Yet, further reducing CFC's remains critical. Earlier this year, the \nWorld Meteorological Organization reported that ozone levels were 10 to \n15 percent below long-term averages, with a 35-percent depletion over \nSiberia. In fact, the past 3 months saw the most depletion ever.\n  Mr. President, the United States is responsible for a small portion \nof the Montreal Protocol Fund's resources. Yet, even though we have the \nmost to gain, we are currently $28 million in arrears.\n  Shrinking away from our commitment, going back on our word as the \ncommittee has suggested by eliminating the account, will severely \nhamper developing countries' transition to non-CFC technologies.\n  Additionally, our industrial allies will likely refuse to adopt added \nmeasures to further reduce ozone-depleting chemicals which are not \ncurrently controlled.\n  Many American businesses, which are now world leaders in the \nmanufacturing of non-CFC refrigerants and solvents, will also suffer.\n   Mr. President, regrettably, my home State of Delaware is one of the \nnational leaders in terms of the incidence of cancer. Delaware ranks \namong the top 10 nationally in breast, lung, and bladder cancer.\n  We have put a lot of work into identifying the causes, but we don't \nyet know what in our environment, or what aspects of our behavior, are \nleading to these cancer cases.\n  For that reason alone, Mr. President--and perhaps it is a selfish \nreason and I make no apologies--I want to prevent the increase of \ncancer-causing UV radiation.\n  Delaware is a coastal State, and during the summer months hundreds of \nthousands of people flock to our shoreline to enjoy our beaches. I \ndon't want these people or anyone in America, to unknowingly be exposed \nto harmful doses of UV radiation because this Nation walked away from \nits responsibility.\n  The Montreal Protocol is enormously successful, and we are making \nsolid, substantial progress in decreasing the use of CFC's in the \ndeveloping counties.\n  This success needs to be continued. I urge my colleagues--support \nthis worthy program and send a signal to the world community that \nAmerica remains a leader.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add as a \ncosponsor Senator Cohen, Senator Lugar and Senator Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have no further requests to be heard \nfrom any of the Members I am aware of.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are willing to accept the amendment on \nthis side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I believe there is no objection on the other side. I think \nwe are therefore ready to go to a vote.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2783) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2784\n\n(Purpose: To strike section 107 which limits compensation for mentally \ndisabled veterans and offset the loss of revenues by ensuring that any \n tax cut benefits only those families with incomes less than $100,000)\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment of the \nSenator from Maryland will be set aside.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I believe that we have discussed previously \nthe possibility of a time agreement on this amendment.\n  I understand the proponent of the amendment is willing to accept a \n30-minute time agreement, equally divided in the usual form, provided \nthere is no second-degree amendment. Is that the understanding?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator is entirely correct.\n  Mr. BOND. May I ask which amendment he just sent forward?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I wanted to lead off with the amendment relating to \nthe mentally disabled veterans.\n  Mr. BOND. And the second amendment?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Would have to do with veterans' health care.\n  Mr. BOND. Is the Senator agreeable to a 30-minute time agreement \nequally divided in the usual form for that amendment as well?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I am indeed.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on these two \namendments the time be equally divided, 30 minutes in the normal form \non both sides with no second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller], for \n     himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. \n     Dorgan, proposes an amendment numbered 2784.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 16, beginning with line 20, strike all through page \n     17, line 5, and insert the following:\n       Sec. 107. Section 105(b) of House Concurrent Resolution 67 \n     (104th Congress, 1st Session) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(b) Reconciliation of Revenue Reductions in the Senate.--\n       ``(1) Certification.--(A) In the Senate, upon the \n     certification pursuant to section 205(a) of this resolution, \n     the Senate Committee on Finance shall submit its \n     recommendations pursuant to paragraph (2) to the Senate \n     Committee on the Budget. After receiving the recommendations, \n     the Committee on the Budget shall add such recommendations to \n     the recommendations submitted pursuant to subsection (a) and \n     report a reconciliation bill carrying out all such \n     recommendations without any substantive revision.\n       ``(B) The Chair of the Committee on the Budget shall file \n     with the Senate revised allocations, aggregates, and \n     discretionary spending limits under section 201(a)(1)(B) \n     increasing budget authority by $170,000,000 and outlays by \n     $150,000,000.\n       ``(2) Committee on finance.--Funding for this section shall \n     be provided by limiting any tax cut provided in the \n     reconciliation bill to families with incomes less than \n     $100,000.''.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, my amendment is very simple. It would \nstrike a provision of the appropriations bill which seeks to limit \ncompensation benefits to certain veterans who are disabled by mental \nillness, and offset the savings that would result from the enactment by \nlimiting any tax cut under the budget resolution to families earning \nless than $100,000.\n  Mr. President, the choice posed by my amendment is, again, simple \nand, I think, straightforward. Do we favor tax cuts for the wealthy or \nbenefits for mentally disabled veterans? I trust the answer will be \nobvious.\n  The Appropriations Committee would reenact a 1990 provision which cut \noff VA compensation benefits to mentally incompetent veterans who have \nno spouse, children, nor dependent parents, when the veteran's savings \nreached $25,000. Payments were resumed when the savings fell to \n$10,000. \n\n[[Page S 14287]]\n\nThis provision expired at the end of 1992. Attempts to reenact this \nprovision were rejected by the House and Senate Veterans Affairs' \nCommittees in both 1993 and again this year, 1995, in our \nreconciliation efforts. It is bad policy, and, in any event, it does \nnot belong in an appropriations measure.\n  Mr. President, some may argue that suspending compensation to \nmentally disabled veterans when their savings reach $25,000 prevents \nuncaring heirs from acquiring funds amassed through the receipt of VA \ncompensation benefits. Indeed, that is usually the argument which is \nused against this. While it is undoubtedly true that this will happen \nin a few cases--that is, that individuals truly remote from the \nmentally incompetent veteran will receive moneys on the death of that \nveteran--it is equally true that it does not happen in the great \nmajority of cases in which a mentally incompetent veteran dies without \na spouse, child, or dependent parent. In fact, to the contrary, in many \ncases there are other family members--nondependent parents, brothers, \nsisters, uncles, aunts, or cousins--who have been involved with the \nveteran and the care of the veteran.\n  Also--this is important to note--there is absolutely no reason to \nsuppose that the situation of funds going to so-called remote heirs \noccurs any more frequently with mentally incompetent veterans than with \nother seriously disabled veterans who have acquired significant savings \nbased upon their receipt of compensation.\n  If there is indeed some interest in ensuring that savings derived \nfrom VA compensation not go to remote heirs, then the law should be \nchanged to provide that the cutoff in compensation apply across the \nboard to everyone. I do not believe that this is something the \nGovernment should do only for those who are mentally incompetent, \ndisabled veterans.\n  If we are to undertake this policy--and I would not favor that--it \nmust be done in a fair, across-the-board fashion. Otherwise, we single \nout mentally disabled veterans and in that classic sense discriminate \nagainst them when, of course, they are unable to do anything about this \nthemselves.\n  Mr. President, on its face this provision discriminates against one \nsmall group of veterans: those who are mentally disabled. There is no \nsound policy reason for allowing a competent disabled veteran to save \nmoney that could possibly go to remote heirs upon the veteran's death, \nwhile limiting savings of a mentally incompetent, disabled veteran. \nThere is a rather important matter of fairness involved here.\n  This provision would do terrible harm to families who sacrificed to \nprovide care for their mentally incompetent son or daughter. In many \ncases, parents who act in fiduciary roles build savings so that when \nthe parents are deceased, there will be enough money to care for the \ndisabled veteran. Under the proposal, families could not accomplish \nthis goal.\n  Another outcome of the 1990 provision was that many veterans and \ntheir guardians did very creative things to circumvent the law. For \nexample, mentally incompetent veterans arranged marriages in order to \navoid losing their compensation. Others made large purchases of \nunneeded property or cars to lower their savings or otherwise disburse \ntheir savings. Guardians in these cases often consented because it was \nbetter to expend those savings than to lose VA compensation altogether. \nWe can expect more of the same if this proposal becomes law. By cutting \noff payments, the provision punishes the veteran whose guardian \nconscientiously administers the veteran's funds, while it rewards the \nguardian who allows the veteran to spend frivolously everything that he \ngets.\n  Mr. President, I note that all of the major veterans service \norganizations oppose this provision, some of them very strongly. They \ngenerally believe, as I do, that there is no justifiable reason for \nsingling out these veterans for discrimination solely because they are \nmentally disabled.\n  Also, as I noted briefly earlier in my remarks, this provision is a \nclear example of authorizing legislation on an appropriations bill. \nThat is not considered lightly around here. The Veterans Affairs' \nCommittee considered this provision as part of meeting our \nreconciliation mandate under the leadership of Chairman Simpson, and we \nrejected it. That is the business of an authorizing committee. It \nshould not be resurrected in the guise of an appropriations issue.\n  Mr. President, for all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting this amendment to remove this onerous provision from \nthe appropriations bill.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  Mr. President, this is an effort again to deal with some very, very \ntight funding problems. We recommended, and the committee accepted, \nthat the incompetent veterans provision included in the House stay in \nthe Senate bill. It limits the provision, as we said earlier, in order \nto save $172 million in budget authority and $157 million in outlays.\n  As a result of this provision, the subcommittee was able to provide \nan increase for VA medical care. It does say that where a mentally \nincompetent veteran has neither dependent children, dependent spouse, \nnor dependent parents, when the value of the veteran's estate exceeds \n$25,000, until the estate is reduced to $10,000, there will be no \npayments. These are for veterans whose needs are being fully cared for \nby the Veterans Administration. This is a veteran who has no \ndependents. This is the ultimate estate builder plan. These are \nveterans who are in very difficult circumstances. The people who will \nbenefit from the payments made by the VA are heirs, not dependent \nheirs.\n  Frankly, the offset provision which purports to deal with tax cuts is \nthin air. It is absolute vapor. It proposes some budget gimmickry, but, \nfrankly, what this amendment does by raising spending by the amount of \n$172 million in budget authority and $157 million in outlays is to say \nto our children ``We've got you. We are going to put this estate \nbuilder program on your credit card.''\n  This is a violation of the budget that is proposed and been adopted \nby Congress. If this provision were to succeed, it would have the \nimpact of busting the agreement to achieve a zero deficit by the year \n2002.\n  Imagine how difficult it would be to tell your children or your \ngrandchildren, ``I just decided that we don't need to stop spending on \nyour credit card. We're going to provide an estate builder plan for \nincompetent veterans, people who served the country well but who are \nbeing fully cared for by the Veterans Administration so their \nnondependent heir, not their wife, not the dependent child, not the \ndependent parent, but some farther away heir will receive the bonus \nthat has been built up by these payments.''\n  In September 1980, the Comptroller General, as written by the former \nchairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, said, ``Congress \nintended distant relatives should not be enshrined to receive benefits \nof veterans or their immediate families. However, large estates \nconsisting of VA benefits are evidently still enriching distant \nrelatives who may have had very little to do with the veteran and were \nnot affected by his service to the United States.''\n  The VA inspector general conducted an audit of the VA's fiduciary \nprogram and recommended legislation to limit compensation payments. The \nIG found numerous instances of substantial estates being inherited by \ndistant relatives.\n  An incompetent veteran of World War I emigrated from Lithuania in \n1907 and died in 1978, leaving an estate of $87,900, of which $77,800 \ncame from VA benefits. The estate went to six nieces and nephews living \nin the Soviet Union.\n  There are many other examples like that. But the basic argument is we \nhave a very tight budget, and it was our decision in recommending to \nthe subcommittee, which the subcommittee recommended to the full \ncommittee, which the committee recommended to this floor, we could \nbetter spend the $172 million in ensuring that current veterans receive \nmedical care that they need. This was a very important part of the \nincrease that we were able to give in veterans medical affairs.\n  When the time comes, I will raise a Budget Act point of order to this \nmeasure. \n\n[[Page S 14288]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, how many minutes would the Senator from Wyoming like?\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

Mr. President, again, one of these difficult issues that \nare filled with emotion. I have chaired the Veterans Affairs' Committee \nfor several years. Senator Cranston chaired the committee, Senator \nMurkowski, Senator Rockefeller. It is a remarkable committee that does \ntremendous things for veterans, and I very much enjoy having Senator \nJay Rockefeller as the ranking member. We work closely together. His \nstaff and my staff work closely together.\n  This is an honest difference of opinion, but again it is one of those \nthat have a ring--a tug at the heart--and I have been through a lot of \nthese through the years, because if you resist this, then it will go \nout on the wavelength that somehow you do not care about veterans; you \nare cold and mean spirited and heartless.\n  This one you want to pay close attention to. This is a serious issue \nthat is not leaving any single veteran unattended.\n  We are talking here about an incompetent veteran. We are talking \nabout a person that cannot manage their assets. They have a conservator \nor a guardian.\n  What we are providing here, it seems to me to make eminent common \nsense. We are going to suspend the VA disability compensation payments \nin the case of an incompetent veteran with no dependents whatsoever.\n  If you really want to get a look at what we are talking about, we are \ntalking about a person perhaps in a nursing home or some other \ninstitution who is totally incapable of functioning, with not a single \nperson that comes to see them on Christmas or New Years or Easter, not \na single dependent ever shows up at the door.\n  We are talking about not including the value of a home in computing \nthe size of the estate, and we are talking about the fact that if a \nperson in that status accumulates over $25,000, we stop. And the \npurpose of stopping is so that a nondependent heir does not inherit \nsomething which is totally a windfall--because the veteran did not need \nit at all. The veteran's necessities as an incompetent are totally \ntaken care of--food, shelter, clothing. This is for expenses that he or \nshe did not need. That is why it accumulated in a bank account, and \nthat is why it should not go to a nondependent relative who had no \ndesire to care for or even see the person.\n  So if you want to get into the emotion of it--and we always usually \ndo--then remember this is a pretty tragic situation. So we are saying, \nI think in a very magnanimous way, if it gets above $25,000, we are \ngoing stop it so it will not get up to $100,000 and go to somebody who \ndoes not care about the veteran. The veteran will be totally taken care \nof; every single need will be taken care of. I know that and you know \nthat. And then here is the key.\n  If this drops below $10,000, you start the money coming again. Now, \nthat is what we have here, to save $170 million. If it drops below \n$10,000, it starts again. If it gets above $25,000, it stops.\n  And what is the money for? The veteran. And he is not using it, so \nwhy let it go to $60,000, $70,000, or $80,000. And it only affects \nveterans who are not competent in any way to handle their money. These \npayments are made to provide for the living expenses of disabled \nveterans. They are not being used for that purpose. The money is not \npaying for clothes or food or shelter. It is a accumulating, and it \nwill be ultimately passed on to nondependent heirs.\n  This provision does not affect the standard of living or the \ncondition of living of any veteran because the veterans involved are \nnot now spending the money. If the benefit money is being expended to \nsupport the veteran, then the money would not be building up in the \nbank, and the provision in the bill would not kick in. It is that \nclear.\n  The amendment is actually an assault on the budget resolution. The \ncost of this amendment would be offset by reducing the amount available \nto the Finance Committee to reduce the tax burden imposed on the \nAmerican people and the American economy. We will hear over and over \nand over in these next days that Senators must either vote for a tax \ncut for the rich or vote for disabled and helpless veterans, one or the \nother.\n  That is a sad choice and quite an extraordinary rigging of the \namendment. But we will see a lot of those in the days to come, many, \nmany of those. I personally do not favor a tax cut for the rich or the \npoor. So at least I am on record on that because we are going to deal \nwith the $5 trillion debt limit in the next few days. And we will deal \nwith Medicare and Medicaid and let that go up 6.4 percent, and that \nwill be called a savage cut from coast to coast.\n  We do not do veterans any favor if we use them as a point man. I was \nin the infantry. I do not know where others served, but it was not fun \nto be a point man to begin to do any kind of military activity. And \ncertainly you cannot use veterans as point men to begin dismantling the \nnational effort to try to bring the deficit under control and provide \nsome relief to Americans aged between 18 and 45 who will have nothing \nin 30 years. And nobody talks about them and that period of time.\n  We always talk about 1 year. We have a Secretary of Veterans Affairs, \na Cabinet Member, who will not go past 1 year in his dealings with \ntelling the American veterans what is going to happen to them.\n  And so these are the troublesome things. We do veterans no favor at \nall if we use them as point men for including spending for a program \nwithout at the same time reducing spending in another program. We do \nveterans no favor if we enact legislation that really has the effect of \nenriching only their nondependent relatives after their death, people \nwho have not cared a whit about them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 7 minutes \n43 seconds.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the esteemed \nSenator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I want to congratulate him on his advocacy for veterans. I thank him \nfor coming here this evening to offer his amendment, the kind of \ncultured cooperation we have here in the U.S. Senate. And I \nparticularly want to thank him for his advocacy for veterans health \ncare.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Rockefeller amendment to strike \nthe provision contained in the committee bill which would deny benefits \nto those veterans who have become mentally incapacitated.\n  The bill before us reinstates a provision of law that was expired in \n1992.\n  The provision contained in this bill suspends benefits to veterans \nwho are mentally incapacitated with no spouse or children when their \nestates reach $25,000. It would allow payments to be resumed when the \nvalue of the estate falls to $10,000.\n  Section 107 of the committee bill discriminates against a small group \nof veterans, those who have become incapacitated as a result of mental \nillness or disease.\n  There simply is no sound policy reason to single out these veterans \nand deny them their benefits.\n  The provision contained in the committee bill is an affront to \nveterans.\n  By including this provision, the committee is going after those \nveterans who have become completely incapable of defending themselves, \ntaking their benefits, and then using their money to cover even deeper \ncuts in the VA medical care budget.\n  Aside from the fact that this provision discriminates against a small \ngroup of veterans, it also: denies parents who are caring for the \ndisabled veteran the ability to accrue savings needed to care for their \nson when the parents dies; experience has shown that guardians and \ntrust officers responsible for the care of these disabled veterans are \nunwilling to continue their responsibilities if benefits are \ninterrupted; and the provision, when it was law \n\n[[Page S 14289]]\nunder the 1990 Budget Reconciliation Act, led to a variety of \nunintended consequences that were destructive and demeaning to veterans \nsuch as arranged marriages to avoid the law, and the purchase of \nunneeded property or cars in order to keep the estate value down.\n  Mr. President, we've seen enough to know that this is bad policy and \nbad law.\n  If we don't stand up for these veterans, who will?\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Rockefeller amendment.\n  I want to make one point perhaps that has not been discussed in the \ndebate, which is about the parents of the mentally incompetent veteran.\n  You see, parents are very much concerned about their--primarily their \nson, sometimes their daughter--who is disabled and the need to keep \nsome type of saving to care for their son or daughter when these \nparents die. Experience has shown that guardians and trust officers \nresponsible for the care of these disabled veterans are unwilling to \ncare for them if benefits are interrupted.\n  The other thing that happens is that in order to keep some kind of \nasset base, they kind of get into phony, manipulatory things. They will \nwant to try to buy a car or a new property and so on. This is not the \nveteran. This is not the people who fought at Iwo Jima or Pork Chop \nHill or the Mekong Delta. These are honorable men and women who do \nthat. And I think that what we need to do is make sure that we do not \nhave bad policy become not good law. And I really support the Senator's \namendment. These are people who have come to a point in their life \nwhere they are unable to think for themselves and in many instances \nunable to care for themselves. We are asking that a safety net be \nprovided. And when they join the U.S. military, it is not an asset \ntest.\n  So I hope that the Senator's amendment prevails, and I hope his \nadvocacy continues.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. This Senator thanks the distinguished colleague from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. President, I will use my remaining time to say the following. In \n1992, Senators Hatfield and Domenici and Kasten wrote to the President \nof the United States, President Bush, about precisely this subject. And \nthey said in a letter, which I ask unanimous consent be printed in the \nRecord, the following:\n\n       . . . based on ``irrational discrimination against the \n     mentally disabled . . . the virtually exclusive, if \n     unintended result is impermissible discrimination against \n     mentally incompetent disabled veterans.''\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 1992.\n       Dear Mr. President: On February 3, 1992 the U.S. District \n     Court for the Southern District of New York temporarily \n     restored the right of mentally incompetent veterans to \n     receive disability compensation. These benefits were being \n     denied to this select group of veterans because of a \n     provision in FY '90 OBRA.\n       We believe that the ruling of temporary injunction by Judge \n     Shirley Wohl Kram should not be appealed. We agree with her \n     statement that the current statute is based on ``irrational \n     discrimination against the mentally disabled. . . . the \n     virtually exclusive, if unintended result is impermissible \n     discrimination against mentally incompetent disabled \n     veterans.''\n       Mr. President, we ask that you recognize the harm caused by \n     this discriminatory provision and urge you to withdraw your \n     appeal of this temporary injunction.\n           Best regards,\n     Robert W. Kasten, Jr.\n     Mark O. Hatfield.\n     Pete V. Domenici.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, people talk about people with remote \nheirs and people who may care for mentally disabled veterans as if they \ndid not really care. They say, why would one care for a mentally \nincompetent veteran? Well, I am sorry, but there are people who do \ncare. And there is nothing in the law which says that you have to care \nto 20 percent or 70 percent or 90 percent for this to be fair.\n  There is no justification for singling out mentally disabled people \nfor discriminatory treatment. None. We have not said they are entitled \nto compensation only if they are poor. The law does not say that. We \nhave not said they are entitled to compensation only if they have \nsavings less than $25,000. And we have not said they are entitled to \ncompensation only if they have no money from anywhere else, like so \nmany Members of this body do who do not have to worry about things like \nthis. These are people who have people who care about them. To assume \nthey do not is not in line with thinking about family values.\n  We have said that they are entitled to compensation for their \ndisability based on their disability. And that is what my amendment \nasks for.\n  Are we prepared to say now that for some reason the mentally disabled \nare somehow less entitled solely because they are mentally disabled? Is \nthat what those who oppose this amendment would do? The Senator from \nWest Virginia will not join such an effort.\n  I hope very much that my amendment will be accepted. I think it is \nright, fair, reasonable, just, and nondiscriminatory.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has yielded \nback his time.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I urge adoption of my amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. How much time is remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes 6 seconds left remaining of \nthe time for the opponents of the amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield the distinguished Senator from Wyoming 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I hope this debate does not come down to \nwho cares more about disabled veterans or homeless people or the lesser \nin society. That is not what this amendment is about. That truly is a \nmind-boggling thing to think that there are some people in this Chamber \nwho care less about other people in society. We all have the same level \nof care toward the lesser in society.\n  Since I have chaired this committee, we have doubled the veterans \nbenefits. The veterans budget when I came to this Chamber 17 years ago \nwas about $20 billion, and we are going to do something which puts it \nclose to $40 billion. And the veterans population is declining. And if \nanyone can say that we do not take care of veterans, it is usually \nnonveterans or people who were never overseas or never involved with \nveterans who say that.\n  And I am not making a reflection on anyone. When I came to this \nChamber, I heard the most stirring debate I ever heard about what we \ndid not do for veterans by a person who had never been in the civil air \npatrol. I had to listen to one-half hour of unmitigated guff about what \nwe were doing for veterans. Now, that is a tiresome argument, and I do \nnot think it fits in any way of what we do for these fine people, now \n26 million, now declining 2 percent per year, who have given much, and \nwe have given them much. And we will continue to do so.\n  This is a very isolated incident. If we are talking about caregivers \nand the conflict of interest, is it a conflict of interest for a \ncaregiver to put aside $100,000 if they know they are going to get it? \nLet us apply this to everybody, competent veterans and incompetent \nveterans. That will seem to cover it pretty well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the amendment.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. The adoption of the pending amendment would cause the \nAppropriations Committee to breach its discretionary allocation as well \nas breach revenue amounts established in the fiscal year 1996 budget \nresolution.\n  Pursuant to section 302(f) and 306 of the Congressional Budget Act, I \nraise a point of order against the amendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I move to waive the application of \nthe Budget Act to the pending amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment and the motion \nto waive be set aside.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Objection is not heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n[[Page S 14290]]\n\n\n\n  Amendment No. 2785 to Committee Amendment on Page 8, Lines 9 and 10\n\n(Purpose: To increase funding for veterans' medical care and offset the \n  increase in funds by ensuring that any tax cut benefits only those \n               families with incomes less than $100,000)\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the second amendment I propose is \nalso very simple. It would provide funding for VA medical care at the \nlevel requested by the President--that is, $16.96 billion--and would \noffset the cost of this increase, approximately $511 million, by a \nreduction in the amount set aside in the budget resolution to cover the \nrevenue loss from any tax cut.\n  The choice represented by the amendment is simple: Should VA health \ncare be funded at a level which allows it to continue to meet health \ncare needs and demands of those veterans who seek care from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, or should medical care be cut so as to \nfund a tax cut?\n  The Senator from Wyoming indicated this comparison would be made on a \nnumber of occasions, and he is entirely correct. The values implicit in \nthis argument, and how one comes down on this argument, are profound. \nObviously, to me the answer is self-evident.\n  Mr. President, I want my colleagues to understand some of the ways \nthat the level of funding included in the appropriations bill will \naffect the people who use the VA health care system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair asks the Senator to withhold so that \nthe clerk can report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller], for \n     himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Wellstone, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2785.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 8, line 10, strike ``$16,450,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$16,961,487,000''.\n       On page 22, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n       Sec. 111. Section 105(b) of House Concurrent Resolution 67 \n     (104th Congress, 1st Session) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(b) Reconciliation of Revenue Reductions in the Senate.--\n       ``(1) Certification.--(A) In the Senate, upon the \n     certification pursuant to section 205(a) of this resolution, \n     the Senate Committee on Finance shall submit its \n     recommendations pursuant to paragraph (2) to the Senate \n     Committee on the Budget. After receiving the recommendations, \n     the Committee on the Budget shall add such recommendations to \n     the recommendations submitted pursuant to subsection (a) and \n     report a reconciliation bill carrying out all such \n     recommendations without any substantive revision.\n       ``(B) The Chair of the Committee on the Budget shall file \n     with the Senate revised allocations, aggregates, and \n     discretionary spending limits under section 201(a)(1)(B) \n     increasing budget authority by $511,487,000 and outlays by \n     $511,487,000.\n       ``(2) Committee on finance.--Funding for this section shall \n     be provided by limiting any tax cut provided in the \n     reconciliation bill to families with incomes less than \n     $100,000.''.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator asks permission to continue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Under the bill as reported, VA would be forced to \noperate at a level below current services. In human terms, 113,000 \neligible veterans would be denied inpatient and outpatient care in \n1996. In terms of VA's capacity to provide a full range of health care \nservices nationwide, the equivalent of four VA hospitals would have to \nbe shut down; 6,500 VA health care professionals would lose their jobs.\n  I spent most of the day in the Finance Committee, and people there \nsay that a reduction in the increase in the amount of money put aside \nfor health care is not a cut. They are, of course, entirely wrong. \nHealth care is not like a loaf of bread. A loaf of bread is subject to \nnormal inflation; it goes up a couple pennies a year, whatever. Health \ncare is subject to entirely different influences. It is subject to \ntechnology. It is subject to the fact that veterans are aging.\n  The Senator from Wyoming made the point that there are fewer \nveterans, but he did not make the point that, in fact, demand for \nveterans' health care, even with fewer veterans, is increasing. Are we \nto deny them that? My amendment would seek to try to deny them less.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to focus on these repercussions in \nhuman terms. I fear too often we hear numbers and we become numb. We \nlose sight of the human element in what we are doing. If we do not \nappropriate funds for VA medical care at the level sought by the \nPresident, which is a modest level, in my estimation, and which only \ncovers the cost of inflation--not medical inflation but inflation--real \npeople, veterans who answered our country's call, will not receive the \nhealth care that they need, the health care that they deserve, the \nhealth care that they have been promised.\n  One can ridicule all one wants the commitment to our Nation's \nveterans, but it was made, and it is justified. This is not pulling on \nheart strings. This has to do with whether veterans get treatment for \ndifferent kinds of conditions which might range all the way from \nprostate problems to Alzheimer's to other long-term care problems or \nimmediate problems. They are real problems and real people.\n  I do not say that any person in this body cares for people less than \nany other person, but what they do about what is available to those \npeople may differ substantially, and in what they do is the judgment \nabout what they feel, in terms of their priorities.\n  Every VA medical center furnishes vital care to veterans in the \ngeographic regions served. We know that. We stopped all new \nconstruction in the Veterans' Committee. We have stopped any major \nrenovation of our current veterans hospitals, many of which were built \n75 years ago. The Senator from Maryland mentioned a psychiatric \nhospital which is literally crumbling on its foundations, but are we \ndoing anything to build that up, to restore it, to improve it? No. So \nwe are not doing that. We are talking here about veterans health care \nas it exists, to be made available to veterans who need it.\n  We will deny service to my constituents who are veterans and to the \nconstituents of others who are veterans. Some have disabilities from \ntheir service; others were able to complete their service without \ninjuries but are now unable to afford the cost of health care. What do \nthey do if they are unable to afford the cost of health care? We have \n40 million, 50 million Americans who do not have health insurance. To \ndeny veterans health care is wrongheaded. We must avoid it, and my \namendment will help us to do so.\n  Mr. President, I find it very ironic that we are being asked to cut \nVA health care funding below current services, thereby turning veterans \naway from their health care, just as we conclude a great national \ncelebration of the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, \nan enormous emotional outpouring.\n  I remember staying up late one night a couple of weeks ago to watch \nPresident Clinton out in Hawaii. C-SPAN did something at 2 or 3 in the \nmorning for an hour, or hour and a half. We have had people talk about \nit on the floor of the Senate, Senators discussing their service with \neach other. Powerful, powerful testimony. We have all agreed that these \npeople saved the world.\n  One thing came through very loud and clear to me during those recent \ncelebrations, and that is how the victory belonged to the GI's--not to \nme, I was 5 years old, but to the GI's--who fought the battles from \nNormandy to Iwo Jima. Oh, how we love to talk about that, and ought to \nand are inspired by it, made better by it.\n  Mr. President, these are the same GI's who are now veterans in their \nseventies seeking care from the VA. Not everybody is rich. They say a \nthird of the Members of the Senate are millionaires. Well, we may be \nout of touch. A lot of those folks out there are not, and they are \nbroke and they need VA, and that is what the VA is there for, to serve \nthem. These same GI's could be turned away from the care they need if \nthe cutback envisioned by the Appropriations Committee is enacted. That \nhardly seems like a fitting or worthy tribute after all the speeches \nthat we have heard.\n  I also find it ironic that there are proposals to cut VA below \ncurrent services at the very time that cutbacks \n\n[[Page S 14291]]\nare being proposed in Medicare and Medicaid. Now, why do I say that? \nThere is every reason to suspect that as individuals are pushed out of \nthose programs because of the changes that are being contemplated, the \nveterans who have relied on either Medicare, which is being diminished \nby $270 billion, or Medicaid, which is being diminished by $182 \nbillion, will have to turn to VA for needed health care. I find that \nironic.\n\n  Mr. President, VA health care is at a crossroads, and many innovative \nand dynamic changes are happening within the system. We have a lot of \nimprovements that we can make, and they are being done--not all, but \nsome.\n  Some, as I have indicated, suggest that the number of veterans is \ndeclining, and that that, therefore, justifies cutbacks in VA health \ncare. People even laugh at that. Well, it is true that the overall \nveteran population is coming down. It is now just over 26 million. A \nfew years ago, it was close to 27 million. It is also true the demand \nfor VA health care continues to increase. The question is whether we \nwill meet it under the obligations that we have.\n  This is a phenomenon--this demand for more health care--that is easy \nto understand once one realizes that as the population continues to \nage, the demand for health care services actually is on the rise.\n  As our veterans age, we must make sure that the promises a grateful \nnation has made will not be undone as we rush to balance the budget.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who will yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  Mr. President, it is not hard to see how this Congress has gotten \ninto the habit in the past of spending more money than we take in, of \nrunning deficits of $200 billion or more, putting burdens on our \neconomy and terrible burdens on the backs of our children and \ngrandchildren. When we talk about cuts, as my friend from West Virginia \nhas--about draconian cuts in Medicare, when under the budget resolution \nMedicare will rise per recipient faster than the rate of inflation in \ncoming years, only in Washington, DC, is that a cut.\n  My colleague from West Virginia is complaining about the draconian \ncuts in veterans medical care. Our increase in medical care for the VA \nis the largest in this bill. It will be an increase of $285 million \nabove fiscal year 1995--that at a time when every other aspect of this \nbudget is being cut.\n  Now, we have a clear choice. We have a clear choice on these two \namendments. Neither one of them are offset. There is language in the \namendment which purports to change the congressional budget resolution \nthat has been adopted months ago. We cannot do that. This is simply a \nbudget buster. It feels good. If you do not care about the fiscal \nimpact of your irresponsibility, then you can move to waive the Budget \nAct so that we can go on spending like money is going out of style, \nbecause it will go out of style and this second amendment is just \nanother in the same direction.\n  We have tried to work with the Veterans Administration for the past \nseveral months on ways to trim VA's budget, so that the budget of VA \nwill be used to serve the veterans. Unfortunately, the secretary has \ncompletely stonewalled and refused to cooperate with it. The secretary \nof the VA has done everything in his power to torpedo efforts of the \nCongress to reform the VA medical system, to bring it into the 21st \ncentury, to get rid of fraud, waste, and abuse, and to make sure that \nwe use modern techniques to serve our veterans with the high quality of \ncare that this country is capable of providing, but I fear in too many \ninstances does not provide through the VA.\n  The secretary has sent computer e-mail messages to every one of VA's \n220,000 employees decrying the congressional budget resolution and its \ndevastating impact on veterans health care. He has sent messages out to \neach employee on their pay stubs saying: ``The administration's plan is \nmuch better for veterans and their families.''\n  He has made speeches across the country, talking about bed closures \nand patients being denied air care. He has impugned the motives of \nCongress and the congressional budget resolution.\n  I think it is very, very disappointing that the secretary has chosen \nto use his efforts on politics rather than on finding ways to serve the \nveterans better.\n  He has cited statistics that are overstated, as the GAO has found, or \nneed to be put into context. For example, the secretary said that this \nmeasure will result in hundreds of beds being closed. But what the \nsecretary has not acknowledged is that the VA has been, and plans to \ncontinue absent any budgetary constraints, to close hospital beds \nbecause of the demand for care on an outpatient basis--rather than \nhospitalization. Since 1989, VA has closed almost 20,000 hospital \nbeds--and the budget has increased each of the years since 1989.\n  In a September 12 letter to the House Veterans, Affairs Committee \nChairman Stump, GAO found serious flaws in VA's analysis of the \npossible impacts of the House budget resolution. VA overstated the \nfunds it would need to maintain its current level of services because, \naccording to GAO, it based its projected funding needs on assumptions \nthat there will be an increase in VA workload in fiscal year 1996, and \nthat it will be maintained for the outyears; it limited savings from \nincreases in the efficiency with which services will be delivered, and \nsteadily increasing costs, workload and staffing due to facility \nactivations.\n  Frankly, the Veterans Administration stands for the status quo. \nDespite medical practices changing dramatically across this country, \ndespite the declining veteran population, despite mismanagement, the \nsecretary does not want the VA to change.\n  Mr. President, I am tired of the rhetoric. It is not serving anyone--\nparticularly not our Nation's veterans.\n  There are few experts on VA who believe that the current quality of \nmanagement of VA hospitals is adequate. GAO, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the VA Inspector General, and the veteran service organizations \nhave advocated major changes to the way VA operates.\n  They have pointed out scores of opportunities for management \nimprovements, which would result in hundreds of millions of dollars of \nsavings--which would improve, rather than hinder quality of patient \ncare.\n  You can save by shifting from inpatient to outpatient care. The \nveterans, in their independent budget, recommend shifting inpatient \ncare to an outpatient basis for savings of up to $2 billion. VA \nestimates it could save $761 million.\n  The inspector general testified that ``VA does not always receive the \nbest price for pharmaceuticals, for which VA spent close to $1 billion \nin fiscal year 1994, and millions of dollars in annual cost savings are \nnot realized.''\n  VA is overpaying in its fee-basis program for outpatient care. Again, \nthe IG audits say the VA could save $25 million.\n  All of these reforms, like not spending too much on affiliations with \nmedical schools, not providing surgical services at every VA facility, \nwhen it is far safer for the veterans to be served in areas where \nsurgical services are performed on a regular basis--all of these are \nsavings that could go to the bottom line of better care for veterans.\n  Let us be clear. This bill provides an increase for VA medical care. \nIt is an increase. It is $16.45 billion to care for fewer than 3 \nmillion veterans--about $5,500 per veteran. The bill seeks only to \nreduce the rate of increase in VA medical spending by forcing the VA to \nadopt modern health care delivery methods, reduce bureaucracy and \nimprove management. There is adequate money in this budget--without \nbusting the budget, without destroying the congressional agreement to \nachieve a zero deficit in 2002--to provide the quality of care that our \nveterans are entitled to.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes twenty seconds are left on the \nopponents' side, and 6 minutes 12 seconds are left for the proponents.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski.\n\n[[Page S 14292]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Rockefeller \namendment, which would restore funding to veterans medical care.\n  This amendment is about promises made, it's about keeping our \ncommitments.\n  This amendment is for the GI Joe generation--the World War II \ngeneration--our fathers who fought on the battlefront overseas and our \nmothers who fought on the homefront here in our communities.\n  This amendment is for the men and women who fought in Korea in an \nundeclared war; the soldiers who served in Vietnam in an unpopular war; \nthe veterans from the high-tech Gulf war; and, the new veterans from \nhumanitarian missions in Somalia and Haiti.\n  I have always fought to get them the care they deserve--and they \ndeserve the best.\n  Although this bill increases the funding level for veterans medical \ncare by $235 million over last year, it is still $511 million below the \nPresident's request and $327 million below the House number.\n  When we compare this year's number to last year's it looks as if the \nvets are getting a deal. But that is not true. This increase does not \nkeep up with the skyrocketing increase in the cost of health care \ndelivery. The increase does not allow the VA to keep pace with the \nnumber of veterans needing treatment--particularly the long term care \nrequirements for the aging veteran population.\n  It is inevitable that the quality of the health care we promised to \nour veterans will decrease.\n\n\n                     impact of senate fy 1996 mark\n\n       Medical care--Assuming an increase of only $285 million \n     above the 1995 appropriation, the impact in 1996 would be the \n     following.\n       A reduction of $511 million from VA's request:\n       A reduction of 6,500 FTE\n       113,000 fewer vets treated\n       46,000 less inpatients treated\n       1,000,000 less outpatient visits\n       Closing the equivalent of 4 medical centers with an average \n     of 300 beds each.\n\n  Mr. President, I recognize the need to balance the budget. But it \nrubs against everything I believe in to do that on the backs of the GI \nJoe generation, especially while we pile money up in a slush fund so \nthat we can dole out a tax break to people who are making 6 figure \nincomes.\n  So, I think it would be only fair to live up to the long-standing \ncommitments we made with our veterans before we start making new \ncommitments with the wealthiest of Americans.\n  I certainly hope this Senate will recognize the commitment our great \nnation has made to its veterans and stand by that commitment by \nsupporting the Rockefeller-Mikulski amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased and proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of the two amendments to H.R. 2099, the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1996 that specifically concern our \nNation's veterans. My distinguished colleagues who are cosponsoring \nthis amendment are to be congratulated for their efforts to ensure \nveterans' access to quality VA health care is not seriously compromised \nand to protect some mentally incompetent veterans who are being \ntargeted for discriminatory, arbitrary, and shameful cuts in VA \ncompensation.\n  Mr. President, while these amendments address two different issues--\nveterans health care and compensation for the most vulnerable group of \nAmerican veterans--they are prompted by one basic concern. Our pressing \nneed to balance the budget. Unfortunately this pressing need is being \nused to justify unequal sacrifice. Veterans with service-connected \ndisabilities and indigent veterans, many of whom earned their VA \nbenefits at great cost on bloody battlefields are seeing those benefits \nwhittled away, while the most affluent of our citizens are exempted \nfrom sacrifice. Instead of being asked to share the pain, the wealthy \nseemingly are supposed to contribute to balancing the budget by \naccepting substantial tax cuts. What kind of shared sacrifice is this?\n  I believe that one of the great strengths of these amendments is that \nthey make a significant contribution to righting the balance. The $511 \nmillion that would be restored to the medical care account to enable \nthe VA to meet veterans health care needs and the $170 million that is \nneeded to ensure that all mentally ill veterans continue to receive \nunrestricted compensation are to be offset by limiting any tax cuts \nprovided in the reconciliation bill to families with incomes of less \nthan $100,000.\n  Our Nation's veterans are prepared to sacrifice for the good of this \ncountry as they have done so often in the past, but only if the \nsacrifices they are asked to make are: (1) equitable; (2) reasonable; \nand (3) essential. Clearly, these sacrifices that service-connected--\nparticularly mentally incompetent veterans--and indigent veterans are \nbeing asked to make meet none of these essential criteria.\n  Mr. President, before I conclude I would like to discuss each of the \namendments. Amendment No. 2785 would restore to the medical care \naccount $511 million cut from the President's budget for fiscal year \n1996. While there may be some doubt as to the validity of VA \nprojections of the precise impact of such a cut on veterans health \ncare, there is little doubt that it would result in some combination of \nsubstantial reductions in the number of veterans treated both as \noutpatients and inpatients as the number of VA health care personnel \nshrink. According to the VA, this cut could have an impact that is \nequivalent to closing some sizable VA medical facilities.\n  While not directly related to this amendment but related to the \nquality of VA health care generally, this bill also would eliminate all \nmajor medical construction projects requested by the President. In the \nprocess, some projects involving VA hospitals that do not meet \ncommunity standards and are deteriorating would not be funded. How can \nwe treat veterans in facilities that do not meet fire and other safety \nstandards? In obsolete facilities that lack separate rest rooms and \ndressing room areas for men and women veterans? This is a travesty and \nno way to treat those who have defended our country. Our veterans don't \ndeserve such shabby and undignified treatment and I will do all in my \npower to see that this shameful situation ends. I hope that all of my \ncolleagues will join me in this long overdue effort.\n  Mr. President, as I pointed out at a Veterans Affairs Committee \nhearing a few months ago these cuts could not come at a worse time. We \nare now talking about cutting $270 billion over the next 7 years from \nMedicare and making deep cuts in Medicaid. This could lead to a much \ngreater demand for VA services precisely at a time when VA health care \ncapabilities are eroding. Would the VA be able to cope with an influx \nof elderly and indigent veterans eligible for health care, but \ncurrently covered by Medicare or Medicaid? There sometimes is much talk \nabout a declining veterans' population, but much less about an aging \nveterans' population--one that disproportionately requires expensive \nand intensive care. What happens if this population grows even more as \na result of Medicare and Medicaid cuts? Before veterans fall victim to \nthe law of unintended consequences, I strongly urge my colleagues to \ngive careful consideration to the cumulative impact on veterans' health \ncare of such concurrent cuts in Federal health care funding.\n\n  Regarding amendment No. 2784, I was frankly appalled when I learned \nthat both the House and Senate versions of H.R. 2099 include a \nprovision that limits compensation benefits for mentally incompetent \nveterans without dependents but does not limit benefits for physically \nincapacitated veterans without dependents--or any other class of \nveterans for that matter. As I understand it, compensation for service-\nconnected disabilities paid to mentally incompetent veterans without \ndependents would be terminated when the veteran's estate reached \n$25,000 and not reinstated until the veteran's estate fell to $10,000.\n  Such unequal treatment is outrageous and indefensible. How can we \ndiscriminate against veterans who became disabled while serving their \ncountry only because they are mentally ill. In eloquent and informative \ntestimony before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs Jessie Brown, who I regard as an outstanding Cabinet \nofficer and a singularly tenacious and effective advocate for veterans, \npointed out that the only difference between veterans who have lost \nboth arms and legs and those \n\n[[Page S 14293]]\nwho have a mental condition as a result of combat fatigue, is that the \nlatter group can't defend themselves. Moreover, the Secretary stressed, \nwe are not only talking about veterans who seem to have no organic \nbasis for their mental illness, but also veterans who were shot in the \nhead on the battlefield and as a result of brain damage can't attend to \ntheir own affairs. And, I might add that to make matters worse, this \nprovision amounts to means-tested compensation that applies to only one \nclass of veterans--the mentally ill. I am aware that such a provision \nwas enacted in OBRA 1990 and withstood court challenge, but the fact \nthat it was held to be constitutional makes it no less abhorrent. \nFortunately, Congress had the good sense to let this onerous provision \nexpire in 1992.\n  Victimizing the most vulnerable of our veterans while providing tax \ncuts to our wealthiest citizens smacks of afflicting the afflicted \nwhile comforting the comfortable. I urge my colleagues from both sides \nof the aisle to support amendment No. 2784.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am very proud to be a Member of the Senate, \nthe oldest democratically elected deliberative body in the world. But \nI'm sure the last thing any of you would want is for this great \ndeliberative body to merely rubberstamp ill-advised actions by the \nHouse and in the case of the VA Medical Account to make matters even \nworse by appropriating $327 million less than was appropriated by the \nHouse.\n  The veterans health care and compensation protected by these two \namendments are by no means handouts, but entitlements earned by men and \nwomen who put their lives on the line to defend this great country. \nThey are part and parcel of America's irrevocable contract with its \nveterans, a contract that long predates the Contract With America we've \nheard so much about recently.\n  I have a deep commitment to Minnesota veterans to protect the \nveterans benefits they have earned and are entitled to and in \ncosponsoring these amendments I am keeping my faith with them. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting both amendments.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Wyoming 4 minutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, again, I speak as chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. There are two facts, alleged to be facts, \nthat are not so.\n  It has been said in the debate some veterans will be turned away. \nThat may be so, but the care for those nonservice connected is on a \nspace-available basis anyway, and some veterans will not be cared for \nby the VA no matter what the funding level.\n  Please hear that. I hope that those who are debating it will hear it. \nSome veterans will not be cared for by the VA at any funding level you \ncan put up, including the level proposed by my friend from West \nVirginia.\n  I commend Senator Bond. He is a fierce fighter for his causes. He had \nanother one that has been erroneously presented. They said there would \nbe no hospital refurbishment. That is wrong. Refurbishment can be \nfunded by minor construction, which is increased by $37 million in this \nbill.\n  Let me review the bidding in my years here in the U.S. Senate with \nthis remarkable series of charts. I have never done this, probably will \nnever do it again. Here we are. Look here. When I came to the Senate in \n1978 with my good colleague from Montana over there--I see him \nsmiling--when I came here, there was the total VA budget of almost $20 \nbillion. The total health care budget in 1978 was $5.1 billion and is \n$16.2 billion in 1995. Here is what it is today: Nearly double. The \ntotal VA budget is almost $40 billion now. It was $20 billion when I \nstarted here 17 years ago.\n  If you say it is all in paper or the vapors, here is the increase in \nVA staff by human beings. We are always talking about human beings \nhere, so we want to talk about the human beings that are working for \nthe VA. There are quite a number of them.\n  Physicians have gone up from 11,200 to 12,300; registered nurses from \n26,000 to 37,000; and nonphysician providers FTE, a whole new category \nof those who serve veterans and who are paid for by the taxpayers were \nzero in 1975 and 3,079 in 1995. And we hear about veterans growing in \nnumber--they are not. We all know that. Here it is: There were 28.5 \nmillion veterans in 1978, and we are headed down to the year 2010 where \nthere will be 20 million veterans. When we are finished with this \nbudget exercise in 7 years, there will be 23 million veterans instead \nof the 26 million today.\n  If we cannot work through the cloud of vapors about what we do for \nveterans in this country, then look at this. Here is what we have done \nin 1978. Here is what we are doing now. Hospital admissions, down now. \nWe are trying to do outpatient instead of inpatient. Look at the \noutpatient visits: 17.4 million in 1978, versus 25.9 million in 1995. \nIt is tough enough to get things done around here using correct \nfigures. It is impossible to get anything done when you use a \ncombination of emotion, fear, guilt or whatever.\n  I am proud to be a veteran, very proud to be a veteran and a lifetime \nmember of the VFW and a member of the American Legion and AMVETS, and \nwe do our share. They know it. We know it.\n  There is not a person in this Chamber that can say in any \nconscientious way that we have not done yeoman work for our veterans. \nWe will continue to do it for one reason. We will find out when we do \nthis amendment. Mention the word ``veteran'' and hope to get everybody \nto the floor and vote for it regardless of its sense.\n  An amendment to increase funding for VA health care sure sounds \nattractive. Who can be against sick veterans?\n  We do have an obligation to care for those who are harmed as a result \nof their military service.\n  But remember that almost 90 percent of VA patients are being treated \nfor non-service-connected conditions.\n  And, yes, we do have a policy to care for additional veterans to the \nextent that resources are available.\n  But, that does not mean that we have an obligation to make resources \navailable without limit.\n  America's veterans served to preserve our Republic and to ensure a \nbetter future for their own children and grandchildren.\n  But, the Congress will throw away all that our veterans fought to \npreserve if we fail to stick to our plan to balance the budget.\n  The Rockefeller amendment is an assault on the budget resolution and \nthe goal of a balanced budget.\n  It uses veterans as point men to break down the fire walls that \nconstrain the natural desire of the Congress to spend money.\n  It will put Senators in the position of voting to fund a tax cut for \nthe rich at the expense of sick veterans.\n  It does so by providing for $511 million increased spending for VA \nhealth care and offsetting the cost by limiting the benefits of a tax \ncut to families with incomes over $100,000.\n  Remember that VA health care actually INCREASES in this \nappropriation.\n  Remember that VA has never had to try to become more cost effective \nunder the pressure of REAL cost constraints.\n  The Rockefeller amendment would have the effect of funding continued \nbusiness as usual.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I strongly support and am pleased to \ncosponsor the amendment being offered by Senators Rockefeller and \nMikulski to add $511 million to the veterans health care component of \nthis appropriations bill. This increase will bring funding in the bill \nto the level proposed by the President in his fiscal year 1996 budget \nrequest.\n  There is no more patriotic or generous group of Americans than our \nNation's veterans. Not only do they care deeply about the national \nsecurity of this country, they care about its economic health and \nsocial welfare as well. But we ought not ask of those who suffered \nphysically or mentally from their military service to make additional \nsacrifices with regard to the future of their health care system.\n  Veterans have borne their fair share of budget cuts over the past \ndecade. Their benefits and services over that period have been cut \napproximately $10 billion. Under the budget resolution passed earlier \nthis year, they are slated to take additional cuts of $6.4 billion over \nthe next 7 years. And in this bill, it's not just any cuts--it's cuts \nin their health care. Veterans have paid \n\n[[Page S 14294]]\nenough; their accounts should be free and clear.\n  In establishing priorities in this era of shrinking resources, it is \nmy firm belief that veterans must remain at the top of the national \nagenda. That has not happened in this bill. The veterans have been \nshort-changed in this legislation, but we have a chance to correct hat \nmistake by passing the Rockefeller-Mikulski amendment. I don't know how \nin good conscience my colleagues can oppose it.\n  The $16.4 billion allocated for veterans health care in this bill is \n$327 million below the House-passed level, and more than half a million \ndollars below the President's request. That is unconscionable. \nVeterans, who put their lives on the line in service to their country, \ndeserve better. The very least they deserve is a quality health care \nsystem on which they can rely.\n  The proposed appropriations level in this bill clearly undermines the \nVA's ability to fulfill its health care mission to those who have \nsuffered injuries resulting from their military service. And it \nundermines Congress' longstanding commitment to care for the Nation's \nveterans. Mr. President, the pot of money available for VA health care \nin this bill is simply insufficient to maintain current services. That \nis just plain wrong, and I hope my colleagues will do the right thing \ntoday and vote for this amendment.\n  For those of you who believe that the proposed level of funding will \nnot have an impact--that the VA will be able to absorb these cuts \nthrough efficiencies--let me tell you what the VA thinks. They estimate \nthat the proposed funding level will result in 133,000 fewer veterans \nbeing treated in fiscal year 1996. They believe that they will be able \nto treat 46,000 fewer inpatient episodes of care and 1 million fewer \noutpatient visits. And they believe they will have to reduce employment \nlevels by 6,500--the equivalent of closing four VA Medical Centers with \nan average of 300 beds each. While these estimates may not be 100 \npercent on target, I would guess they are pretty accurate. And no one \ncan argue that the proposed reductions are not going to have a serious \ndetrimental impact on the ability of the VA to provide high quality \nmedical care to deserving veterans.\n  As a Member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have to \ntell you that I don't believe our veterans are being treated fairly in \nthis appropriations measure. They deserve better than they are getting \nin this bill. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support the \nRockefeller-Mikulski amendment to add $511 million for VA health care \nto this bill which will bring funding up to the level proposed by the \nPresident. It is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, how much time is remaining to the \nproponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Two minutes and three seconds.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask unanimous consent to yield myself such time as \nI need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I simply conclude this argument by saying the \nFinance Committee has been meeting all day. They are meeting as we \ntalk. The Senator from Wyoming and I are on that. They are going to \npass out--without my vote, but it will happen--the Committee will pass \nout $450 billion of cuts in Medicare and Medicaid.\n  I repeat that one can say that there are fewer veterans, but it is \nalso statistically true that the demands by veterans for health care, \nas the demand for other American citizens for health care, is \nincreasing. It is larger than it was in the previous year.\n  As a result of what we are doing in the Finance Committee and the \ncutbacks in Medicare and Medicaid, I envision a substantially increased \nnumber of veterans who will not be able to avail themselves, for \nexample, of that assistance to the extent that they could before, and \nwho will, therefore, need to turn to the Department of Veterans \nAffairs.\n  To further cut veterans' health care is wrong. Is that emotional? \nYes, partly. But mostly it is a promise. It is a commitment. It is a \ncommitment that was made by this Nation and it is a commitment made to \nno other group in this Nation.\n  Interestingly, veterans groups are not, as a rule, as caught up in \namendments like this as I think they ought to be. I cannot help that. I \nknow what the commitment is. I know what my responsibility is. I know \nwhat my 202,200 veterans in West Virginia require. I do not want to let \nthem down.\n  I hope that the amendment will be looked upon carefully by my \ncolleagues. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself the remaining time on this \nside.\n  The amendment by the Senator from West Virginia purports to deal with \ncuts in veterans' medical care.\n  How many times do we have to say it? Veterans' medical care will go \nup over $200 million from last year and this year's bill. There are \nreforms needed in the Veterans Administration. I hope that by having \nbrought some light to these, we may encourage the authorizing committee \nto look at ways in which we can work together to see the quality of \nthat care is increased.\n  But the amendment by the Senator from West Virginia is very simply a \nbudget buster. There is not an offset. It is a clear-cut attempt to \nbreak the agreement, to get us back on the path of spending $200 \nbillion a year in deficits. It is not designed to improve medical care \nfor the veterans. It is designed to break the budget agreement. It \ncannot at this time amend the budget agreement.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues not to support the \nwaiver of the Budget Act point of order.\n  Mr. President, is all time used up on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has about a minute \nand 45 remaining, the Senator from West Virginia has 17 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BOND. Will the Senator care to use his 17 seconds?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, three veterans organizations do \nsupport this amendment by their letters. I ask unanimous-consent \nletters be printed in the Record from the Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nParalyzed Veterans of America, and Disabled Veterans.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Veterans of Foreign Wars\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 1995.\n     Hon. John D. Rockefeller IV\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Rockefeller: It is my understanding that you \n     intended to offer two amendments to H.R. 2099, the ``FISCAL \n     YEAR 1996 VA, HUD, and INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS'' \n     bill. One amendment would restore VA medical funding to the \n     level proposed in the Administration's request and the other \n     would strike the provision terminating VA disability \n     compensation to certain mentally incompetent veterans whose \n     estates are greater than $25,000. The VFW strongly supports \n     both amendments.\n       For years, the VFW has maintained that VA health care has \n     been sorely under funded. The funding level contained in H.R. \n     2099 will not only contribute to delayed and denied care, but \n     breaks a solemn promise to veterans that a grateful nation \n     will care for those who have borne the battle.\n       The VFW also commends you for attempting to rectify a \n     potential precedent setting provision that would deny \n     disability compensation to what may be the most vulnerable of \n     all veterans--those deemed incompetent. This is contrary to \n     all sense of fairness.\n       Again, thank you for offering these two amendments on \n     behalf of our nation's veterans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Paul A. Spera,\n     Commander-in-Chief.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                Paralyzed Veterans of America,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 1995.\n     Hon. John D. Rockefeller,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Rockefeller: I am writing on behalf of the \n     Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) to ask for your support \n     for two amendments that Senator John D. (Jay) Rockefeller, \n     IV, Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' \n     Affairs, plans to introduce during the floor debate on H.R. \n     2099, the VA, HUD, & Independent Agencies Fiscal Year 1996 \n     appropriations bill. These two amendments would ameliorate \n     some of the harshest provisions currently found in H.R. 2099.\n       The first amendment proposed by Senator Rockefeller would \n     restore $511 million to VA Medical Care for Fiscal Year 1996. \n     These monies are urgently needed by the VA in order to enable \n     it to provide the bare minimum of care needed by veterans. \n     PVA has long advocated the need for lasting and fundamental \n     changes to the way the VA currently provides health care; in \n     the absence of \n\n[[Page S 14295]]\n     real eligibility reform simply providing the VA with fewer dollars \n     would only exacerbate and deepen the critical situation faced \n     by the VA, and all veterans that rely upon the VA to provide \n     them with the medical care they so desperately need, and \n     earned.\n       Senator Rockefeller's second amendment would reverse a \n     provision in H.R. 2099 that would realize cost savings by \n     limiting compensation to certain mentally incompetent \n     veterans. PVA is shocked that this appropriations bill would \n     seek to realize savings from a class of veterans who are \n     incapable of defending themselves. This is truly a case of \n     taking money from the weak and giving it to the strong. \n     Furthermore, we are alarmed by the precedent that this sets: \n     this provision was not recommended by the Senate Committee on \n     Veterans' Affairs, but was rather added by the Appropriations \n     Committee. PVA firmly believes that policy decisions should \n     be made by the respective authorizing committees. Therefore, \n     PVA strongly seeks your support of this amendment, an \n     amendment that would strip this noxious provision from H.R. \n     2099.\n       PVA looks forward to your favorable support of these two \n     amendments that Senator Rockefeller proposes to offer, and \n     your continued support of America's veterans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Gordon H. Mansfield,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                   Disabled American Veterans,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 1995.\n     Hon. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Rockefeller: On behalf of the more than one \n     million members of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), I \n     wish to express DAV's deep appreciation for your efforts to \n     amend H.R. 2099, the Fiscal Year 1996 VA, HUD and Independent \n     Agencies Appropriation bill. As we understand them, your \n     amendments will increase funding for VA health care and \n     remove a provision which would means test the service-\n     connected disability compensation payments made to certain \n     mentally incompetent veterans in order to fund VA health \n     care.\n       We in the DAV find it perplexing that Congress would divert \n     compensation payments from service-connected disabled \n     veterans to increase VA funding for health care, particularly \n     in view of the fact that the veterans' service organizations \n     (VSOs) had presented Congress with a plan to save taxpayer \n     dollars while at the same time increasing access to VA health \n     care.\n       As you may know, the DAV filed a class action law suit \n     against a similar provision targeting mentally incompetent \n     service-connected disabled veterans which was contained in \n     the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. In granting \n     DAV's request for a temporary injunction, U.S. District Judge \n     Shirley Wohl Kram found that withholding compensation \n     payments to certain incompetent veterans was based on \n     ``irrational discrimination against the mentally disabled * * \n     * the virtually exclusive, if unattended result, is \n     impermissible discrimination against mentally incompetent \n     disabled veterans.'' The DAV and the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) ultimately settled this lawsuit resulting in the \n     return of $100 million in compensation payments to these \n     equally deserving service-connected disabled veterans.\n       Senator Rockefeller, we commend you for your efforts to \n     ensure that Congress provides adequate funding for VA health \n     care and for recognizing the basic unfairness of means \n     testing the compensation paid to a most helpless category of \n     service-connected disabled veterans--those whose service-\n     connected disabilities render them mentally disabled.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Thomas A. McMasters III,\n                                               National Commander.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from West Virginia has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, again I urge my colleagues not to support \nthe Budget Act waiver. We have provided an increase. We are seeking to \nimprove health care for the veterans. This measure simply is an \nattempt, on a very appealing case, to break the budget agreement. I \ntrust that everybody in this country as well as in this body will \nunderstand what this means.\n  Mr. President, the adoption of the pending amendment would cause the \nAppropriations Committee to breach its discretionary allocation as well \nas breach revenue amounts established in the fiscal year 1996 budget \nresolution. Pursuant to section 302(f) and 306 of the Congressional \nBudget Act, I raise a point of order against the amendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I move to waive the application of \nthe Budget Act to the pending amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent the following \namendments be the only remaining amendments in order to H.R. 2099, that \nthey be offered in the first degree or second degree to an excepted \ncommittee amendment, and that those offered in the first degree be \nsubject to relevant second-degree amendments: Baucus, EPA provision; \nDaschle, relevant; Bradley, budget process; Feingold, redlining; \nFeingold, CDBG; Simon-Moseley-Braun, strike transfer of HUD fair \nhousing office to DOJ; Lautenberg, Superfund/CEQ increase; Chafee, \nKalamazoo, MI; Bumpers, reactor sale; Harkin, EPA lead sinkers; \nFaircloth, occupancy standards; Faircloth, fair housing and free \nspeech; Johnston, environmental technology; Feinstein, CDBG; Feinstein \nearthquake insurance; cleared managers amendments; and a Bingaman \namendment dealing with colonias.\n  I further ask, following disposition of the listed amendments, the \nmanagers be recognized to offer their cleared amendments to be followed \nby adoption of any remaining committee amendments, third reading of \nH.R. 2099, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Now, Mr. President, in light of this agreement, the leader \nhas authorized me to announce that there will be no further votes \ntonight. However, votes will be stacked to occur at approximately 9 \na.m., Wednesday. Senators who have amendments are urged and begged to \nremain tonight to debate their amendments.\n  I now ask unanimous consent it be in order to proceed to the \nconsideration of an amendment to be offered by the Senator from \nMontana, Senator Baucus, regarding EPA provisions, under time limit of \n40 minutes equally divided in the usual form and that no second-degree \namendments be in order to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent Senator Mikulski, \nSenator Lautenberg, Senator Boxer and Senator Reid be added as \ncosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2786\n\n (Purpose: To provide that any provision that limits implementation or \n      enforcement of any environmental law shall not apply if the \n Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency determines that \n    application of the prohibition or limitation would diminish the \n  protection of human health or the environment otherwise provided by \n                                  law)\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] for himself, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Boxer and Mr. Reid, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2786.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in title III, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 3--. Application of Limitations on Implementation or \n     Enforcement of Certain Laws.\n       Any prohibition or limitation in this Act on the \n     implementation or enforcement of any law administered by the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall \n     not apply if the Administrator determines that application of \n     the prohibition or limitation would diminish the protection \n     of human health or the environment otherwise provided by law.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment is simple. It provides that \nno environmental rider in the appropriations bill will take effect if \nthe rider would weaken protection of public health or the environment. \nThe amendment sends a strong message: We should not use appropriations \nbills for back door attacks on environmental protection or the quality \nof life in America.\n  To explain why we need this amendment let me put it in perspective. \nDuring this Congress there has been a lot of debate about environmental \nlaws. Some of the debate has been pretty heated. But when you strip \naway the rhetoric, two points become clear. First, the American people \nwant a clean environment. I do not think there is much dispute about \nthat. We \n\n[[Page S 14296]]\nwant a clean environment because we want to protect the public health. \nWe know that bad environment tends to degrade public health.\n  Because we want the high quality of life that comes with clean air \nand clean water and clean neighborhoods, we feel we need environmental \nprotection laws. And because we feel a responsibility to hand America \nthe beautiful down to our children, we also need environmental \nprotection laws. To have a clean environment we need strong, fair \nenvironmental laws.\n  Second, we want environmental laws that are smart. Not only laws that \nare strong but that are smart, that make sense; laws that are less \nburdensome for landowners and for business, more capable of addressing \nthe complex and subtle environmental problems we face today than are \nthe laws America passed 25 years ago.\n  It is not easy to get such laws. If we want to do a good job, strike \nthe right balance, we need to put in the time and the effort to get it \nright--roll up our sleeves, do the work, find the right balance between \nlaws that on the one hand protect the environment and on the other hand \nare not too burdensome, do not require too much paperwork.\n  It takes work, a lot of hard work. And that is precisely what the \nHouse has failed to do. The House version of this bill contains 17 \nenvironmental riders designed to weaken environmental laws all across \nthe country. These riders would jeopardize public health. They would \njeopardize the quality of life for American families. In most cases, \nthey respond to the demands of special interests rather than to the \nnational interests of strong, efficient environmental protection. And \nthey do the opposite of what the public wants. The riders would make \nour air and our water dirtier--not cleaner, dirtier. And the riders \nwould make our air and water smellier, worsen threats to public health, \nand degrade the quality of life.\n  A few of them are relatively innocuous. For example, the House \nprevents EPA from implementing the centralized vehicle inspection \nmaintenance program, a program which EPA has pretty much decided not to \nimplement anyway. But most of the riders are anything but innocuous. \nFor example, one would block--entirely block--implementation of the \nGreat Lakes water quality initiative, stop it dead in its tracks. That \nwould halt efforts to take a coordinated approach to pollution from \ndioxin, mercury, PCB's and other bioaccumulative pollutants in the \nGreat Lakes. Another House rider would block new rules regulating toxic \nair emissions from hazardous waste incinerators or from oil refineries. \nThat means more, not less but more, cancer-causing chemicals in the \nair. And, for Americans who live near refineries, it means further \nyears of living in a place that just, simply, smells bad.\n  Another one--these are the House riders--would block EPA enforcement \nof the wetlands program under section 404 of the Clean Water \nAct. Though we all know that we need to reform the wetlands program. I \ndo not think there is a Senator here who has not heard of the need to \nreform the wetlands program. In Montana, for example, my State, farmers \nare fed up with the confusion and paperwork over the 404 program.\n\n  But the House rider is not reform. It is a complete rollback. It \nstops the wetlands program dead in its tracks, period. Stops it. We \nlose thousands of acres of wetlands.\n  Another would prohibit the implementation of the Clean Water Act \nlimitations on industrial and municipal stormwater runoff. Other riders \nwould stop the implementation of rules for combined sewer overflows. \nAnd the list goes on and on.\n  In each case, Mr. President--this is an important point--there may be \na legitimate underlying issue. There probably is a legitimate \nunderlying issue in each case. Take combined sewer overflows, for \nexample. What are combined sewer overflows? First of all, it is a \npretty unpleasant situation. They are sewer systems that overflow \nduring heavy rains, thereby pouring raw sewage directly into rivers and \nharbors and sometimes onto the shore. That is what combined sewer \noverflows are. There are a lot of them in our country.\n  Over 1,000 communities have combined sewer overflows. They are a very \nsignificant cause of pollution and can cause serious public health \nproblems. It is a major problem in many cities in our country. However, \nthey are difficult and they are expensive to control.\n  So the old command-and-control approach may not work best in dealing \nwith the problem of combined sewer overflows.\n  A few years ago, cities and environmental groups negotiated a more \nflexible approach. That is, both sides, on opposite sides of the \nproblem, got together and negotiated a solution. The Environment and \nPublic Works Committee endorsed this approach in the clean water bill \nthat it reported last year, and the full House did the same in the \nclean water bill that it reported earlier this year.\n  What does the House appropriations rider do about this? It is very \nsimple. It prevents the EPA from doing anything to control these sewer \noverflows. It cannot even enforce the negotiated approach that everyone \nagreed to. Think of that. It cannot even enforce the negotiated \napproach that everyone agreed to. As a result, all across the country \nwe will be doing less to reduce the overflow of raw sewage into public \nbeaches.\n  Clearly, this is the wrong approach to reform. What is the right \napproach? The Environment and Public Works Committee is working to \nreauthorize several of the major environmental laws. We are taking \nfresh approaches. For example, the new version of the Safe Drinking \nWater Act will dramatically reduce the cost of rules and regulations \nwithout weakening the protection of our drinking water. We are doing \nthat. We are reforming the Safe Drinking Water Act in a good, solid, \nand balanced way.\n  With some compromises by big business and insurers, we can also get a \nconsensus reform of Superfund, a reform that cuts litigation costs for \nindustry and speeds up cleanup of hazardous wastesites for local \nfamilies.\n  Other efforts--some of them even more ambitious--are underway. For \nexample, under the leadership of Senators Mikulski and Bond, Congress \ncommissioned a study of EPA by the National Academy of Public \nAdministration. What did that study say? It said essentially that EPA \nshould develop a long-term mission. It said that EPA should delegate \nmore authority to States. And it said we should replace our hodgepodge \nof environmental laws with an overarching, uniform environmental law.\n  If we can find consensus on turning these recommendations into law, \nEPA would be able to focus its efforts on the highest priority threats \nto public health and the quality of life rather than pursuing this \nhodgepodge of statutes which currently exists and which, I must say, \nthese riders do not in the remote sense even begin to address. In fact, \nthey go the opposite direction. We could make the environmental \nprotection much more effective if we could adopt these recommendations. \nBusinesses, farmers, and landowners would see paperwork dramatically \ncut back and compliance with laws made much more simple. The public \nwould see the elimination of needless layers of bureaucracy.\n  The House riders do none of this. They will simply mean a less \nhealthy, less pleasant life for Americans. It is that simple.\n  I am pleased to say that this Senate bill takes a much more moderate \napproach. It does not pursue the draconian riders to the same degree \nthe House does. The Senate bill does contain some restrictions that, to \nmy mind, do not belong. But there are fewer riders in the Senate bill, \nand several of those reflect previous Senate action and will not \nundermine environmental protection.\n  For this reason, it is important for the Senate to make a strong \nstatement against loading this bill up with riders that will gut our \nenvironmental laws, degrade the air and water, threaten public health, \nand worsen the quality of life for hundreds of thousands of Montanans \nand millions of Americans.\n  My amendment makes just such a statement. It is very simple. Here is \nwhat it says.\n\n       . . . any prohibition or limitation in this Act on the \n     implementation or enforcement, or any law administered by the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, shall \n     not apply if the Administrator \n\n[[Page S 14297]]\n     determines that the application of the prohibition or limitation would \n     diminish protection of human health and the environment \n     otherwise provided by law.\n\n  The amendment would act as kind of a circuit breaker. If the final \nversion of the bill contains environmental riders, the amendment \nauthorizes the EPA Administrator to review the implication of those \nriders.\n  If the Administrator finds that the rider threatens public health or \nthe environment, she would invalidate the restriction. In that case, \nshe would continue to apply current law.\n  As a result, the American people would know that their health, their \nair, and their rivers and streams are safe.\n  I ask the Senate to support this amendment, to support the thoughtful \nenvironmental reform and to stand up for the quality of life, the \npublic health, and our responsibility to the next generation of \nAmericans.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, before I begin, I need to ask unanimous \nconsent to add to the list of amendments that we just adopted the \nfollowing five amendments due to miscommunication on our side. These \nwere left off.\n  They are, No. 1, Senator McCain, VA medical care; No. 2, Senator \nWarner, EPA contractors; No. 3, Senator Simpson, EPA Senior Employment \nProgram; No. 4, Senator Chafee, EPA brown fields; No. 5, Senator \nThurmond, VA programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues on the other side. \nI very much appreciate that. I hope we can get all of these amendments \ntogether. I believe after we have several of these on which we will \nhave votes--they are very important votes--I believe and hope that we \ncan work out many of these so that they will not require rollcall \nvotes.\n  Let me address this amendment. Mr. President, maybe I have been on \nthe floor too long today. But this one really amazed me. I listened to \na description of the riders, and I soon realized that the riders that \nmy friend from Montana was referring to were riders in the House bill. \nAnd we have heard lots of discussion about those riders.\n  We are talking about the Senate version. The Senate does not have \nthose measures in it. We are not proposing to put those measures in it.\n  But to remedy those measures, the power that my colleague from \nMontana would give to the administrator of EPA is totally awesome. The \nAdministrator of EPA under his amendment would be able to have a super \nveto, would be able to make her own judgment as to whether she wanted \nto follow a law passed by the House and the Senate and signed by the \nPresident. That is truly breathtaking. I do not know when we have ever \nset up a super-veto power to give the regulator a power to veto what \nCongress does and the President signs.\n  I have been around here working on regulatory reform. We have been \nvery careful on regulatory reform to suggest procedures that an agency \nmust go through to make sure they use common sense, to make sure that \nthey have the cost and the benefits considered. If they cannot \ndetermine those with exactitude, they need to let us know what they do \nknow. We ask that they use good, sound science. But we were very \ncareful in drafting our regulatory reform bill not to have a \nsupermandate, not to allow the Congress or anyone challenging \nregulations to go back wholesale and open up a whole series of \nregulations and overturn regulations.\n  Here in front of us is a provision giving a supermandate to the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to say, ``In my \njudgment, that particular statute might diminish the protection of \nhuman health or the environment. Therefore, it does not apply.''\n  I am absolutely overwhelmed at the breathtaking simplicity, \nstraightforwardness and unconstitutionality of the provision. And I am \nnot going to bother to go into any great length discussing the riders. \nI would just ask my colleagues when they come in tomorrow to take a \nlook at it and see if we want to set the Administrator up somewhere \nabove the Supreme Court.\n  I appreciate the kind things the Senator from Montana has said about \nwhat we tried to craft in this bill. We do want to work with them. \nCertainly we have been very careful to try to keep the EPA legislative \nprovisions to what we think are reasonable. We look forward to working \nwith them. But I urge my colleagues not to give the EPA, the \nAdministrator, power to veto laws enacted by Congress and signed by the \nPresident.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana controls 8 minutes 40 \nseconds; the Senator from Missouri has 15 minutes 13 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Mr. Baucus \namendment and in strong opposition to the House riders that would \nsubstantially weaken environmental and health protections.\n  The riders approved by the other body are an example of special \ninterest legislation at its worst.\n  Lobbyists for corporate polluters had a field day. They included a \nlong list of anti-environmental provisions, with little opportunity for \nserious analysis, hearings or debate.\n  Unfortunately, these riders are part of a broad assault on our \nenvironment by corporate polluters and their Republican allies. These \nattacks are attempting to turn back the clock on critical environmental \nprotections that have proven highly successful over the past 25 years.\n  Mr. President, since 1970, smog has decreased 70 percent. Acid rain \nhas decreased 45 percent. Since 1973, the number of lakes and other \nwater bodies that are swimmable and fishable has increased from 40 \npercent to 60 percent. Since 1988, toxic emissions have fallen by 42 \npercent.\n  In other words, we have been making tremendous progress. But unless \nwe hold the line, that progress will unravel. And the end result will \nbe disappearing wetlands, increasingly polluted air and water, and \nbeaches strewn once again with waste.\n  There are so many problems with the riders in the House bill that I \ncannot list them all. But let me just review some of the more offensive \nprovisions.\n  First, the House bill would punch a variety of special interest \nloopholes in the Clean Air Act. One rider would provide a special \nexemption for the oil industry, which no longer would have to comply \nwith the Act's hazardous toxic air pollution standards.\n  Another rider would specifically lower the toxic air pollution \nstandards for cement kilns. Not for any other type of incinerator, just \ncement kilns.\n  Then there is a provision that would exempt the oil and gas industry \nfrom risk management requirements. The result of that loophole would be \nto exclude 45,000 facilities from standards that are designed to \nprotect workers from injuries and deaths resulting from accidental \nchemical releases.\n  That is a particularly offensive loophole to me because a recent \nexplosion in a chemical factory in Lodi, NJ, could have been prevented \nif a risk management plan was in place.\n  Another rider would essentially make the Clean Air Act voluntary. \nThis rider eliminates EPA's ability to impose sanctions, even if a \nState fails to submit a permit program or proves unable to implement \nits own permit program. This would rip the heart out of the Clean Air \nAct.\n  I am also concerned about a House rider that would badly weaken the \nso-called right to know law that sponsored.\n  The right to know law is arguably one of the most effective \nenvironmental laws on the books. It has no prescriptive requirements, \nyet it has led to more voluntary pollution prevention than any other \nstep we have taken.\n  It imposes no regulatory controls, requires no permitting, sets no \nstandards and requires no registration, labeling or reductions in \nemissions. It doesn't even require monitoring. All it requires are \nestimates of the amount of toxic chemicals the facilities release into \nour environment. This information is helpful for the city officials, \nfor the fire and emergency personnel, and for those who live near the \nplants.\n  Despite its dearth of requirements, the Right to Know law has \nprobably led to more voluntary pollution prevention \n\n[[Page S 14298]]\nefforts and environmental clean up than any other environmental law.\n  The Right to Know law requires companies to list the amount of \ncertain chemicals that leave their facilities through air, water, or \nshipment to land disposal facilities.\n  Mr. President, the impact of the Toxic Release Inventory is \nimpressive. Emissions from facilities have decreased 42 percent \nnationwide since 1989; a reduction of two billion pounds. Let me repeat \nthat--a 42 percent reduction since 1989.\n  Despite the success, the authors of the House riders try to limit the \ntype of information EPA can collect under that law. That is just wrong. \nAnd we should reject it.\n  These House riders do not limit their target to gutting air pollution \nprograms. One rider would give a green light for destruction of our \nwetlands. Another would stop EPA from regulating the most significant \nsource of water pollution in our urban areas, storm water and combined \nsewer overflows.\n  Yes, the House bill includes provisions allowing the discharge of \nuntreated sewage into the water of the United States as well as our \ncoastal beaches.\n  Forget about clean drinking water, forget about cleaning up toxic \nwaste sites, forget about lakes you can swim in and streams you can \nfish in.\n  Overall, the 17 House riders would gut the national effort to protect \nthe environment. And that was their intent.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment to allow EPA to ignore \nthose riders which place in jeopardy the health and safety of our \ncitizens.\n  Let us stand up for ordinary Americans and for the environment. And \nlet us stand up to the lobbyists for corporate polluters. It is the \nright thing to do. I am convinced that if we do the right thing, the \nAmerican people will support us.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will be very brief. We do not have much \nremaining time anyway.\n  The Senator from Missouri made two points. The first is, gee, why are \nwe doing this? Because of the onerous, objectionable, heinous riders \nthat he by implication agreed are objectionable, heinous, bad \nprovisions in the House bill, not the Senate bill.\n  That point is irrelevant because what we are saying here is the \nAdministrator would have the discretion to not follow a rider whether \nit is in the House bill or Senate bill, if it is enacted into law, \nbecause obviously when the conference is completed probably in the \nspirit of compromise the Senate is going to agree to a few of these \nobjectionable, heinous dastardly riders. So we are just saying that in \nthe event the conference, in a spirit of compromise with the Senate, \nagrees to a certain rider, this provision is available to give the \nAdministrator the authority to protect the public health by not \nimplementing it. So the basic point that the Senator from Missouri \nmade, the first point, is irrelevant.\n  The second point I think is really misconstrued. He said, gee, there \nis a supermandate.\n  Mr. President, when we were dealing with the supermandate issue in \nregulatory reform, the question was whether an administrator of an \nagency could override law as a general principle, override law in \ndrafting regulations as a general principle. That is very broad.\n  This is much different, totally different. We are dealing here with \napproximately 17 specifically crafted House riders and a few \nspecifically crafted Senate riders. Most of them would meet the test, \nbut a few of them very specifically crafted would not.\n  In addition, if the Administrator found that this rider would cause \nharm to the environment or public health, she then would simply have to \njust follow current law. She would say she would not follow the rider \nbut she would follow current law. If someone did not like her decision, \nthat is reviewable under the Administrative Procedures Act and \nultimately reviewable in the Federal courts.\n  It seems to me that our main goal, the main objective is to be sure \nthat we do not pass laws, particularly riders in this case, which have \nthe effect of causing more harm to public health. So I urge my \ncolleagues to do something pretty reasonable, that is, adopt this \namendment because it will better protect human health and the \nenvironment.\n  Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Baucus \namendment, and I would like to thank the Senator for coming and \noffering the amendment this evening. It is enormously appreciated. We \nknow he has had a difficult day in the Finance Committee. We also thank \nhim for his leadership in the authorizing committee.\n  Like Senator Baucus, I wish to compliment the chairman of the \nsubcommittee on the effort that he has made in the area of EPA reform. \nYet, at the same time, we also support the Baucus amendment because we \nbelieve it will help weed out those riders that have the serious and \nnegative impact on public health or the environment.\n  Yes, it does give the Administrator flexibility, and it also will \nallow those who know the science the authority to help make the \ndecisions.\n  Most importantly, I believe this amendment will act as a safety valve \nif the House insists on any of its riders when we get to the \nconference. I believe the Senate bill now has a moderate, clear \nframework on how to deal with these riders, and I believe the Senate \nframework should be the prevailing one. This country has entrusted EPA \nwith the health and well-being of its citizens, and this is one Senator \nwho wants to make sure this trust continues.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand firm on protecting the environment and \npublic health by supporting the Baucus amendment, then supporting the \nBond framework as we move through this legislation and into conference.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  I believe we are about finished with this amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might say to the Senator I know of no other Senators \nwho wish to speak.\n  Mr. BOND. All right. I know of no other Senators who wish to speak on \nthis side.\n  I say once again, I very much appreciate the kind words of the \nSenator from Maryland and the Senator from Montana about our efforts to \nwork on the riders. I assure them we will continue to work with them. \nWe cannot control what the House will do. I do not think that even if \nwe were to adopt this Baucus amendment, the House would accept it. I \njust believe, while I can appreciate the concern, it is \nunconstitutional, and I will urge my colleagues not to support it.\n  I want to speak briefly about the language in the committee report \nwhich calls for a report by the Environmental Protection Agency on the \nneed for a second rule to establish emissions limits on small nonroad \nengines like lawnmowers and chainsaws. In response to questions by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency as to the scope of the report, I want \nto ensure that it not become an undue burden on EPA, particularly in \nthe event that the regulatory negotiation rule reaches consensus on the \nrule.\n  EPA has already issued one rule applicable to this industry pursuant \nto a schedule dictated by a consent degree, not the Clean Air Act. That \nschedule also applies to the second rule which is under development, \nthrough a negotiation process. The committee supports the continuation \nof efforts for a negotiated second rule that would achieve a cost \neffective consensus acceptable to the industry, EPA, and the other \nparticipants. If that consensus is reached later this year, we would \nexpect the report to be merely a statement of the agreement, an \nexplanation of the actions to carry out the agreement, and assurances \nthat the rule as proposed will conform to the agreement in all detail.\n  If, however, the parties to the regulatory negotiation are unable to \nreach consensus, then the report should explain in reasonable detail \nthe air quality need in ozone and carbon monoxide nonattainment areas \nfor a second rule. The report should also explain what additional air \nquality benefits would be achieved, and in what time frame, by a \nnonconsensus second rule regulating these small engines beyond the \nrequirements of the first rule.\n\n[[Page S 14299]]\n\n  Most importantly, we would expect that EPA would work with us and our \nstaff over the next few months in fashioning a report, probably in \nletter form, that would not be a burden on the EPA staff, but would \nfully address the oversight needs of the committee. We do not wish to \ndivert EPA from its efforts to reach the consensus or form implementing \nany consensus agreement.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remaining time on my side on this \nissue.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BOND. I believe that the Senator from----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to table and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Montana yield back his \ntime?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second on the motion to \ntable? There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask that that be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Arizona is ready \nto present an amendment I believe will be found acceptable on both \nsides.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2787\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop a \n plan for the allocation of health care resources of the Department of \n                           Veterans Affairs)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, the distinguished \nsubcommittee chairman, and the ranking member, Senator Mikulski, of \nMaryland, for allowing me to bring this amendment forward and agreeing \nwith it.\n  I will not take much time. The hour is late. The amendment is at the \ndesk. And I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2787.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert:\n\n     SEC. --. PLAN FOR ALLOCATION OF HEALTH CARE RESOURCES BY \n                   DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.\n\n       (a) Plan.--(1) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     develop a plan for the allocation of health care resources \n     (including personnel and funds) of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs among the health care facilities of the Department so \n     as to ensure that veterans having similar economic status, \n     eligibility priority and, or, similar medical conditions who \n     are eligible for medical care in such facilities have similar \n     access to such care in such facilities regardless of the \n     region of the United States in which such veterans reside.\n       (2) The Plan shall reflect, to the maximum extent possible, \n     the Veterans Integrated Service Network, as well as the \n     Resource Planning and Management System developed by the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs to account for forecasts in \n     expected workload and to ensure fairness to facilities that \n     provide cost-efficient health care, and shall include \n     procedures to identify reasons for variations in operating \n     costs among similar facilities and ways to improve the \n     allocation of resources so as to promote efficient use of \n     resources and provision of quality health care.\n       (3) The Secretary shall prepare the plan in consultation \n     with the Under Secretary of Health of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs.\n       (b) Plan Elements.--The plan under subsection (a) shall set \n     forth--\n       (1) milestones for achieving the goal referred to in that \n     subsection; and\n       (2) a means of evaluating the success of the Secretary in \n     meeting the goals through the plan.\n       (c) Submittal to Congress.--The Secretary shall submit to \n     Congress the plan developed under subsection (a) not later \n     than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Plan Implementation.--The Secretary shall implement the \n     plan developed under subsection (a) within 60 days of \n     submitting such plan to Congress under subsection (b), unless \n     within such period the Secretary notifies the appropriate \n     Committees of Congress that such plan will not be implemented \n     along with an explanation of why such plan will not be \n     implemented.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is a simple one.\n  This amendment would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \ndevelop and implement a plan to remedy serious and ongoing \ndiscrepancies in the allocation of funds to Veterans Health Care \nfacilities across the country. The plan would require the Department to \nallocate funding to ensure that veterans have equal access to quality \nhealth care no matter what region they live in or which facility \nprovides them services.\n  Mr. President, as we know, the pending appropriations bill would \nprovide the Department of Veterans Affairs with approximately $17 \nbillion to maintain and operate 173 hospitals, 376 outpatient clinics, \n136 nursing homes, and 39 domiciliaries.\n  The other thing we know, Mr. President, is that the United States has \nbecome a very mobile nation. And there are significant demographic \nshifts that take place around the country. The Department of Veterans \naffairs has attempted in the past through a function known as RPM, \nwhich is the Resource Planning and Management system, to obtain better \nallocation of the funds, but they have not done a very good job in \ndoing so.\n  Congress has a responsibility to ensure that these resources are \ndistributed in a manner that will ensure our nation's veterans, whether \nthey live in Maine or Arizona, have equal access to quality health \ncare.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of Veterans Affairs has not \ntraditionally allocated funding to provide equal access to or account \nfor increasing workloads at its medical facilities.\n  Some months ago I asked the General Accounting Office to examine VA \nmedical funding deficiencies. The GAO found that facility costs and \ntheir respective budgets vary widely, even after facilities of similar \nmission and size are grouped and adjustments are made to account for \ndifferences such as case mix, locality costs, salaries, training and \nresearch.\n  While, Veterans Hospital Administration officials have acknowledged \nbudget allocation problems, GAO investigations found that the \nDepartment has failed to fully implement the new budgeting method known \nas the ``Resource Planning and Management System'' which the Department \ndeveloped to remedy funding inequity.\n  Let me quote the GAO report:\n\n       Because VHA lacked resources to fund all facilities' \n     expected needs, it chose to limit the resources given to \n     facilities with growing workloads. On the other hand, for \n     facilities with decreasing workloads, VHA chose not to reduce \n     their funding in proportion to the expected decreases in \n     workload. These decisions led to only small adjustments in \n     the funding for the projected cost of increased workload, \n     while facilities with decreasing workloads received more \n     resources than they were projected to need.\n\n  The GAO goes on to say:\n\n       For example, VHA forecast that the Carl T. Hayden Medical \n     Center needed an additional $2.3 million for fiscal year 1995 \n     based on expected increases in workload. However, the Center \n     actually received an additional $400,000  . . . By contrast, \n     the San Juan facility had the greatest decline in workload \n     within Carl T. Hayden's facility group. Its declining \n     workload led to a projected $3 million decrease in budget \n     needs, yet the facility's budget decreased only $500,000.\n\n  Mr. President, it's easy to see what's happening here. The Department \nof Veterans Affairs is reluctant to reallocate resources to meet \nshifting demand. Facilities which are accustomed to a certain level of \nfunding refuse to do with less even though there case loads are \nshrinking. And, those with growing caseloads, like Carl T. Hayden, are \nsimply expected to make do with what they have been getting.\n  This practice may serve the needs of bureaucrats, but it does not \nserve the veteran.\n  Mr. President, this problem hit very close to home. I've spent quite \na bit of time at the Carl T. Hayden Medical Center. In the winter \nmonths and at many other times throughout the year, veterans wait in \nline for hours to conduct the most perfunctory administrative \nfunctions, much less to receive treatment. The facility is simply \nunundated.\n  Last year, the Veterans of Foreign Wars conducted a comprehensive \nstudy and found that the Carl T. Hayden Medical Center in Phoenix is \n``grossly \n\n[[Page S 14300]]\nunderfunded,'' receiving twenty-five percent less funding than the \naverage urban VA hospital.\n  In fiscal year 1994, the facility received $52 million less then the \nNew York VA hospital, yet saw 15 percent more patients. This serious \nshortfall in funding is particularly serious for Phoenix which is one \nof only three areas in the country where the veteran population is on \nthe rise, and which is inundated every winter with visitors who place \neven greater demand on the facility and its insufficient resources.\n  Passage of this amendment will ensure that we develop a plan to \nallocate resources in a manner that will assure equal access to service \nby veterans and which will take into account projected changes in the \nworkload of each facility.\n  Mr. President, what this amendment does--and as I mentioned earlier \nit is a very simple one--it requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nto develop a plan for the allocation of health care resources, \nincluding personnel and funds of the Department of Veterans Affairs, \namong the health care facilities of the Department so as to ensure that \nveterans having similar economic status, eligibility priority and/or \nsimilar medical conditions who are eligible for medical care in such \nfacilities have similar access to such care in such facilities \nregardless of the region of the United States in which such veterans \nreside.\n  Mr. President, I will admit to a certain amount of parochialism in \nthis amendment because I come from a State that is growing in \npopulation, especially as a retirement area, and there are insufficient \nfunds. But by this amendment I do not mean to be imposing any penalties \non any VA facility anywhere in our Nation. But I think we should \nappreciate the fact that we do have a mobile veterans population. In \nthe summertime they may be visiting Minnesota, and in the wintertime \nthey may be in Arizona, or they may be in Missouri or even in the \nsummertime in the State of Maryland.\n  We want to make sure that there are facilities available on an \nequitable basis for all of our veterans. And I am sure that this will \nnot result in a decrease in funding for much-needed facilities, but a \nbetter allocation of scarce resources.\n  I would like to thank and I do believe that the VHA will come up with \na fair and equitable formula for the distribution of the all-too-scarce \nfunds. We all know that as we face an aging veterans population, the \nneeds become greater and greater. The medical challenges that we face \nhave changed also significantly over the years. And I think we can, by \nadoption of this amendment, take a small step towards fulfilling our \nobligation and commitments that we made to the men and women who serve \nin our Nation's defense.\n  I thank my friends, and I will take no more time on the amendment. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I commend my friend and colleague from Arizona on the very \nthoughtful amendment. I have had the opportunity to discuss this \namendment with my ranking member. It moves the Veterans Administration \nin the direction which we feel it is vitally important for the VA to \nmove.\n  We have already addressed here on this floor many of the problems in \nthe way the VA operates. We think it could be far more efficient, far \nmore effective in the service it provides to the veterans. And I \nbelieve that my distinguished colleague from Arizona has outlined a \nplan for implementation of improvements that will be very good \noperating procedure for the Veterans Administration.\n  I am ready to accept the amendment on this side, and I ask if there \nare any other speakers or if my ranking member----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am going to accept the amendment as well.\n  Mr. BOND. I do not see any--does the Senator from Arizona wish to add \nto his remarks?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that a GAO study, plus a letter \nfrom the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material is ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               U.S. General Accounting Office,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 12, 1995.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n       Dear Senator McCain` At your request, we are currently \n     reviewing the Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) process \n     for allocating the medical care appropriation to its medical \n     facilities across the nation--the Resource Planning and \n     Management System (RPM).\\1\\ Historically, VHA allocated \n     resources by making incremental changes to each facility's \n     prior year budget. After recognizing the need to better link \n     resources to each facility's actual workload, VHA in 1985 \n     implemented the Resource Allocation Methodology (RAM). VHA \n     officials indicated that because the RAM allocations were \n     generally based upon workload as defined by clinical \n     diagnoses, facilities soon recognized that their allocations \n     would be increased as the number of procedures performed \n     increased. This open-ended expansion of workload led to \n     budgeting problems and concerns about inappropriate care \n     being provided.\n       RPM--first used to allocate fiscal year 1994 facility \n     budgets--was intended to improve upon past allocation \n     systems. VHA's stated goals for RPM are to (1) improve VA's \n     resource allocation methodology, (2) move from retrospective \n     to prospective workload management, and (3) reform medical \n     care budgeting. Accordingly, RPM was designed to be patient-\n     based, forward-looking, and policy-driven. It defines \n     workload as patients served, rather than procedures \n     performed--hence, VHA's characterization of RPM as \n     ``capitation-based''--and it uses projections of future \n     workload to determine what resources are needed. A VHA \n     strategic plan was also intended to be the driving force \n     behind RPM, giving it a set of goals, performance standards, \n     and workload priorities.\n       You asked us to review VHA's allocation process, expressing \n     a concern about the equity of the process in ensuring that \n     facility funding meets the medical needs of a changing \n     veteran population.\\2\\ As part of our efforts to keep you \n     informed about our ongoing review of RPM, we have regularly \n     briefed your staff on our progress toward issuing a report \n     later this year. As a result of our most recent briefing, you \n     asked us to provide you with preliminary information on the \n     way VHA is using RPM to better link resources to workload by \n     examining the variations that RPM data show in facility \n     operating costs to determine the reasons for those \n     variations, and allocating resources among facilities so that \n     veterans within the same priority categories have the same \n     availability of care, to the extent practical, throughout the \n     VA health care system.\n       In summary, RPM appears to be an improvement over VA's \n     previous resource allocation systems. Specifically, it \n     creates forecasts of expected workload and provides data, \n     such as differences in operating costs, that VHA could use in \n     better matching resources to anticipated workload. It also \n     reduces the ability of facilities to ``game'' the system by \n     providing or seeming to provide more or more costly \n     procedures. However, our work to date suggests that VHA has \n     made limited use of RPM in understanding the reasons for \n     those differences and in changing allocations from what \n     facilities received in the past. Furthermore, VHA has not \n     used RPM to allocate resources in a way that considers \n     differences in veterans' access to care throughout the \n     system.\n\n\n             USE OF RPM TO EXPLORE WHY OPERATING COSTS VARY\n\n       Although the RPM data show significant differences in \n     facility operating costs, VHA has not, as it originally \n     planned, developed processes to allow a better understanding \n     of potential reasons for those variations. Originally, VHA \n     intended to assess reasons for variations in costs among \n     facilities through a formal review and evaluation process, \n     including structured site surveys of facilities with \n     especially high and low operating costs. VHA had said that \n     such a process would be useful to identify efficiencies that \n     could be applied at other facilities and to identify \n     potential quality problems caused by limited resources.\\3\\ \n     VHA hoped to further explore the impact of resources on \n     quality by linking RPM cost data with quality indicators. \n     Officials told us that without a better understanding of the \n     reasons for the variations or a clear standard against which \n     to measure the costs, they had little basis for determining \n     which, if any, facilities were receiving too few or too many \n     resources. We have had some difficulty finding out why VHA \n     has not analyzed the variations as planned; the main reasons \n     seem to be the generally lower priority attached to that \n     effort and the uncertainty about who would conduct the \n     analyses and how the analyses would be done. We hope to have \n     more information about this matter in our detailed report.\n       Our initial assessment of RPM data shows that facility \n     costs vary widely, even after facilities of similar mission \n     and size are grouped and adjustments are made to account for \n     differences such as case mix, locality costs, salaries, \n     training, and research. For example, adjusted costs per \n     standardized workload measure in one facility group ranged \n     from $3,024 to $4,141 with the average cost being $3,635; \n     facilities ranged from about 17 percent below average to \n     about 14 percent above average in cost.\n       Nonetheless, VHA officials appear to have used RPM to \n     change facilities' historical budgets only minimally during \n     the two budget cycles in which RPM has been used. For \n\n[[Page S 14301]]\n     example, we estimate that the maximum loss to any facility's historical \n     budget in fiscal year 1995 was only about 1 percent and that \n     the average gain was also about 1 percent.\n       While the optimal amount of resources that should be \n     shifted is unclear, the facilities most disadvantaged by \n     not shifting more resources are those that (1) \n     historically have received less funding for comparable \n     workload and (2) have a faster growing number of patients. \n     For example, because VHA lacked resources to fund all \n     facilities' expected needs, it chose to limit the \n     resources given to facilities with growing workloads. On \n     the other hand, for facilities with decreasing workloads, \n     VHA chose not to reduce their funding in proportion to the \n     expected decreases in workload. These decisions led to \n     only small adjustments in the funding for the projected \n     cost of increased workload, while facilities with \n     decreasing workloads received more resources than they \n     were projected to need. For example, VHA forecasted that \n     the Carl T. Hayden Medical Center needed an additional \n     $2.3 million for fiscal year 1995 based on expected \n     increases in workload. However, the center actually \n     received an additional $400,000 as a result of workload \n     adjustments arising from RPM.\\4\\ By contrast, the San Juan \n     facility had the greatest decline in workload within Carl \n     T. Hayden's facility group. Its declining workload led to \n     a projected $3 million decrease in budget needs, yet the \n     facility's budget decreased only $500,000.\n\n\n      use of rpm to reduce inconsistencies in availability of care\n\n       We reported in 1993 \\5\\ that veterans' access to outpatient \n     care at VHA facilities varied widely--veterans within the \n     same priority categories received outpatient care at some \n     facilities but not at others.\\6\\ Using a questionnaire to \n     medical centers, we found then that of 158 centers queried, \n     118 reported they rationed outpatient care for nonservice-\n     connected conditions in fiscal year 1991 and 40 reported no \n     rationing. This rationing generally occurred in fiscal year \n     1991 because resources did not always match veterans' demands \n     for care. Medical centers rationed care by limiting the \n     categories of veterans served,\\7\\ the medical services \n     offered, and the conditions for which they could receive \n     care.\n       When we reported on these differences in 1993, VA officials \n     responded that RPM--under development at the time--would help \n     overcome these differences. Specifically, officials indicated \n     that to address wide variations in veterans' access to health \n     care systemwide, VA was designing a new resource planning and \n     management process with several objectives, including the \n     elimination of gaps in service for veterans systemwide. In \n     February 1994 correspondence to the Congress, the Secretary \n     of Veterans Affairs reiterated that RPM would begin to \n     alleviate some of the inconsistencies in veterans' access to \n     care noted in our report.\n       In our current review, however, we are finding that \n     overcoming these kinds of inconsistencies in availability of \n     care has not been incorporated as a specific goal of RPM.\n       Perhaps because reducing inconsistency has not been \n     established as an RPM goal, the system does not use data on \n     the eligibility category of veterans served at a facility. \n     RPM predicts costs and workload without regard to facility \n     differences in the provision of discretionary care, that is, \n     without regard to the priority category of the veterans being \n     served.\n       Although the lack of relevant data prevents us from \n     confirming whether the kind of rationing reported in our 1993 \n     report persists, we see indications that inconsistencies \n     still exist. For example, fiscal year 1995 data showed a \n     difference in the extent to which facilities treated \n     nonservice-connected higher income veterans:\\8\\ at some \n     facilities 13 percent of veterans treated fell into that \n     category, while other facilities provided no care to such \n     veterans.\n       We discussed the draft of this letter with VA's Deputy \n     Undersecretary for Health and other VA officials who \n     generally agreed with its contents. These officials noted, \n     however, that resource allocation is an inherently complex \n     and difficult process, that VA's implementation of RPM is \n     still evolving, and that they expect to use the process to \n     make substantially increased budget adjustment for facilities \n     in the next fiscal year. They indicated that VHA faces many \n     challenges that make implementation of the process difficult, \n     including complex eligibility requirements, mandates to care \n     for certain specialized populations of veterans, and the \n     inability of facilities to change personnel levels quickly. \n     They also cited several current initiatives that they expect \n     to help in the implementation of the resource allocation \n     process, including the restructuring the VA health system \n     into Veterans Integrated Service Networks, the implementation \n     of VA's Decision Support System, and the linking of planning, \n     policy and performance measurement responsibilities within \n     one organizational office.\n       We are sending copies of this correspondence to the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs and other interested parties. \n     The information contained in it was developed by Frank \n     Pasquier, Assistant Director; Linda Bade; Katherine Iritani; \n     Douglas Sanner; and Evan Stoll. Please contact me at (202) \n     512-7101 or Mr. Pasquier at (206) 287-4861 if you or your \n     staff have any questions.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                           Carlotta C. Joyner,\n\n                                   Associate Director, Health Care\n                                      Delivery and Quality Issues.\n     \\1\\ For fiscal year 1996, the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     (VA) is seeking an appropriation of about $17 billion to \n     maintain and operate 173 hospitals, 376 outpatient clinics, \n     136 nursing homes, and 39 domiciliaries.\n     \\2\\ You also raised a specific concern about funding at the \n     Carl T. Hayden Medical Center in Phoenix, which we have \n     explored as part of our work.\n     \\3\\ The closest VHA has come to conducting such a review was \n     through one of the six Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs) it \n     formed for its RPM patient categories, such as primary care \n     or chronic mental illness. The Chronic Mental Illness TAG has \n     done some limited data analysis (that is, length of stay, \n     discharge cost, and costs/day differences) to develop further \n     explanatory data on facility cost variations in the care of \n     chronic mental illness patients. The directive establishing \n     the TAGs' purpose, role, operation, and management within \n     RPM, including their role in studying cost, practice, and \n     quality variations among facilities, had not been formalized \n     at the time of our review.\n     \\4\\ Carl T. Hayden and other medical centers also received \n     funds outside the RPM process. Carl T. Hayden received \n     approximately $124 million in fiscal year 1995, of which \n     about $90 million came through the RPM allocation process. In \n     fiscal year 1994, it received approximately $117 million, of \n     which $78 million came through RPM. The percentage of Carl T. \n     Hayden's budget received outside the process was comparable \n     to (within about 3 percent of) the national average.\n     \\5\\ VA Health Care: Variabilities in Outpatient Care \n     Eligibility and Rationing Decisions (GAO/HRD-93-106, July 16, \n     1993).\n     \\6\\ As we reported in VA Health Care: Issues Affecting \n     Eligibility Reform (GAO/T-HEHS-95-213, July 19, 1995), VA \n     uses a complex priority system--based on such factors as the \n     presence and extent of any service-connected disability, the \n     incomes of veterans with nonservice-connected disabilities, \n     and the type and purpose of care needed--to determine which \n     eligible veterans receive care within available resources. \n     (An eligible veteran is any person who served on active duty \n     in the uniformed services for the minimum amount of time \n     specified by law and who was discharged, released, or retired \n     under other than dishonorable conditions.)\n     \\7\\ When medical centers rationed care by veteran category, \n     they generally followed the priorities set by the Congress: \n     they limited care first to higher income veterans, then to \n     lower income veterans, and finally to veterans with a \n     service-connected disability.\n     \\8\\ ``higher income'' veteran is one whose income was above \n     the means test threshold, which as of January 1995 was \n     $20,469 for a single veteran, $24,565 for a veteran with one \n     dependent, plus $1,368 for each additional dependent.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          Veterans of Foreign Wars\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                                  April 7, 1994.  \n     John T. Farrar, M.D.,\n     Acting Under Secretary for Health, Veterans Health \n         Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dr. Farrar: A member of my staff, Robert F. O'Toole, \n     Senior Field Representative, conducted a survey of the \n     Phoenix, Arizona, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical \n     Center, on March 14-15, 1994. During his time at the medical \n     center, he was able to talk with many patients, family \n     members and staff. This enabled him to gather information \n     concerning the quality of care being provided and the most \n     pressing problems facing the facility.\n       While those receiving treatment in the clinics and wards \n     felt that the quality was good, they almost all commented on \n     the long waits in the clinics and the understaffing \n     throughout the medical center. In discussing their problem \n     with various staff members, it was noted that nurses were \n     under extreme stress. More than one was observed by Mr. \n     O'Toole in tears when completing their tour. The nursing \n     staff on evening shifts must rush continually through their \n     duties in an attempt to cover all their patients needs due to \n     the shortage in staffing in both support and technical \n     personnel.\n       In attempting to determine the reason for this problem, it \n     became apparent that the station was grossly underfunded. \n     Which means that the staff must either take unwanted \n     shortcuts or continue to work beyond the point expected of \n     staffs at the other medical centers. While it is well \n     understood that the Veterans Health Administration is \n     underfunded throughout the system, it is clear from the \n     comparisons that this facility has not received a fair \n     distribution of the available resources resulting in the \n     deplorable situation now facing the health care team.\n       Another problem in Phoenix that must be addressed is the \n     serious space deficiency, especially in the clinical areas. \n     The ambulatory care area was designed to handle 60,000 annual \n     visits. In fiscal year 1993, the station provided 218,000 \n     annual visits, almost four times the design level. Many \n     physicians are required to conduct exams and provide \n     treatment from temporary cubicles set up inside the waiting \n     rooms. This bandaid approach has added to the already \n     overcrowding.\n       The other problem that we feel should be pointed out is \n     that of the staffing ceiling assigned to the Carl T. Hayden \n     Veterans Medical Center. Currently, the medical center has \n     FTEE of 1530 which is over the target staffing level. Based \n     on available reports, the medical center would need an \n     additional 61 registered nurses just to reach the average \n     Resource Program Management (RPM) within their group. This \n     facility operates with the lowest employee level in their \n     group when comparing facility work loads, and 158th overall. \n     To reach the average productivity level of the Veterans \n     Health Administration medical centers, they would need an \n     additional 348 full-time employees. While it is realized that \n     this station will never be permitted to enjoy that level of \n     staffing, it is felt that they, at the least, should have \n     been given some consideration for their staffing \n\n[[Page S 14302]]\n     problems during the latest White House ordered employee reductions.\n       To assist the medial center to meet their mandatory work \n     load, and the great influx of winter residents, it is \n     recommended that the $11.4 million which was reported to the \n     Arizona congressional delegation to have been given Phoenix \n     in addition to their FY 94 budget be provided. To enable the \n     station to handle the ever increasing ambulatory work load, \n     the Veterans Health Administration must approve the pending \n     request for leased clinic space in northwest Phoenix and, the \n     implementation plan for the use of the Williams Air Force \n     Base hospital as a satellite outpatient clinic, along with \n     the necessary funding to adequately operate the facility. In \n     addition, VHA should approve and fund, at a minimum, the \n     expansion of the medical centers clinical space onto the \n     Indian School land which was acquired for that purpose.\n       Approval of the above recommendations would make it much \n     easier for this medical center to meet the needs of the ever \n     increasing veteran population in the Phoenix area. There is \n     no indication that the increasing population trends will \n     change prior to the year 2020. This hospital cannot be \n     allowed to continue the downhill slide. The veterans of \n     Arizona deserve a fair deal and the medical staff should be \n     given the opportunity to provide top quality health care in a \n     much less stressful setting.\n       I would appreciate receiving your comments on the Phoenix \n     VA Medical Center at your earliest opportunity.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Frederico Juarbe Jr.,\n                              Director, National Veterans Service.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to thank again the distinguished chairman and the \nranking member.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, again, I commend the Senator from Arizona. I \nbelieve we are ready to proceed to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 2787) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, now I ask unanimous consent that added to \nthe list of relevant amendments be an amendment by Senator Baucus \nentitled ``Relevant.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                National High Magnetic Field Laboratory\n\n  Mr. MACK. I would like to engage the chairman and ranking member of \nthe VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee in a colloquy relative to the \nNational High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee. Senators \nGraham, Domenici, and Bingaman will also join with me in this. Let me \nbegin by commending the chairman for putting forth a bill that balances \nthe needs for fiscal restraint with necessary investment. An excellent \nexample of necessary and productive investment is the National Science \nFoundation's decision 5 years ago to establish the principal facility \nin Florida and a component facility at Los Alamos. The proposal to \nembark on this important basic research was a vision of Dr. Jack Crow, \nthe lab's director. The NSF agreed with this vision and made the \ncrucial decision and investment. It was a very wise decision, and I \ncommend them for it.\n  Mr. BOND. The subcommittee has heard of many of the NHMFL's \naccomplishments in its short 3-year history. New magnet development, at \nthe cutting edge of technology, has created the finest array of the \nworld's most powerful magnets. It has allowed the United States to \nreclaim world leadership in magnet science and technology.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This laboratory is truly a partnership between Florida \nState University, the University of Florida and the Los Alamos National \nLaboratory in New Mexico. It is clearly a Federal/state/industrial \npartnership that works well and produces tremendous breakthoughs. \nFurthermore, industrial involvement and support is paving the way for \nfuture progress.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Senator Graham, the NSF's interest in partnerships and \ntheir decision to locate the facility in Florida were key ingredients \nfor its success. This partnership between two universities, a fine \nnational laboratory, the State of Florida, and several industries has \nled to outstanding science and new technologies as well. And I'm told \nthe lab has a world-class collection of scientists and engineers that \nwill continue to lead the world for years to come.\n  Mr. DOMENICI, Mr. Chairman, let me underscore the importance of this \npartnership which includes Los Alamos National Laboratory working \nclosely with Florida State University and the University of Florida. At \nlast year's dedication in Tallahassee, Erich Bloch said, ``Absent any \none of the three partners, this important project would not have come \nto fruition.'' That is still true today. In these tight budget times, \nLos Alamos has committed precious resources to this endeavor because it \nis important to do so. And my friend Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida has \ninvested heavily and wisely with scarce State resources. I want to \nencourage the subcommittee to provide NSF the resources necessary to \nkeep this laboratory world-class.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The research, the development, and the educational \nactivities that come from this partnership between NSF and DOE, between \nuniversities and a national laboratory, and the facility that is state-\nof-the-art is truly a unique national resource that should make all who \nare involved proud of it. I commend the NSF for its efforts, and I \ncommend this subcommittee for its diligence in providing the resources \nthat will maintain world leadership.\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate the comments. The subcommittee recognizes the \nimportance of this partnership and the need to keep the United States \nat the forefront of this important scientific and technological area. \nWe are confident NSF will continue to view this facility as one of its \n``crown jewels,'' and support it appropriately. I thank the Senators \nfor their views.\n\n\n                            permits program\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Title V of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act \nrequires EPA to issue a rule establishing the minimum elements of a \npermit program for sources regulated under the act. The act requires \nthat this permit rule be issued within 1 year of enactment. The 1990 \namendments further required States within 3 years to develop and submit \nto EPA for approval their own programs that comply with the Federal \nminimum elements as defined by the EPA permit rule. Even under the \nambitious schedule of the 1990 amendments, Congress clearly provided \nthat States were to have 2 full years to respond to EPA's rule \nestablishing the minimum elements of a permit program.\n  Although EPA promulgated a final rule in 1992, the controversy that \nsurrounded this rule prompted the agency to revisit many key issues in \nthe rulemaking. Today, 3 years later, I am sorry to report that EPA has \nstill been unable to resolve fundamental elements of the Federal \nprogram which States must comply with in establishing their own \nprograms. As recently as this summer, EPA has issued a new proposal, \ndespite having not relieved states of the requirement to comply with \nthe 1992 rule.\n  The result, predictably, has been an untenable level of confusion and \nuncertainty. States are spending considerable resources in developing \nprograms that may or may not comply with EPA's final permit program. \nSimilarly, sources across the country are now submitting permit \napplications, despite the lack of clear Federal guidance.\n  Mr. BOND. My colleague from Oklahoma is correct in expressing \nmisgivings over EPA's current implementation of the permit program. As \nthe result of similar concerns, the Senate Appropriations Committee \nincluded language in the report accompanying this bill urging EPA to \ndelay enforcement of the title V program for 1 year. This would give \nEPA the opportunity to resolve outstanding issues and reduce the \nlikelihood that States and sources will adopt provisions that may \nultimately conflict with EPA's final rule. The one-year delay would \nalso give EPA and states sufficient time to develop more cost-effective \napproaches to permitting. Given the severity of the problems which have \nbeset EPA's implementation of this program, I believe this provision is \ncritical.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I would also like to thank the Senator from Oklahoma \nfor raising this issue, which has been of significant concern to the \nsubcommittee on Clean Air, Wetlands, Private Property and Nuclear \nSafety, which I chair. Over the course of this past year, our \nsubcommittee has been closely \n\n[[Page S 14303]]\nmonitoring EPA's implementation of the title V permit program. We \nconducted a hearing on title V on August 1, 1995. In addition we have \nraised several questions with the agency over its progress to date. \nAlmost 4 years have passed since the deadline for promulgating a \nFederal permit rule, yet EPA has still not finalized the part 70 \nprogram. Additionally, EPA has been slow to issue long-needed \npermitting guidance, such as the ``white paper'' guidance on permit \napplications, and does not appear to be promoting the rapid \nimplementation of such guidance. The lack of resolution of key elements \nof the permit program puts States in an enormous quandary in developing \nand seeking approval of their own programs. We are also concerned over \nthe impact of this confusion on regulated ``sources''--that is to say, \nthe employers of this nation--which are required by law to submit \npermit applications within 12 months of the date that States receive \napproval for their programs. The application process alone has proven \nto be unnecessarily costly and time consuming for sources--problems \nthat are clearly linked to EPA's inability to develop Federal minimum \nelements in a timely manner.\n  It is important to keep in mind that the title V program is extremely \ncostly; even EPA has estimated that the program will cost taxpayers and \nbusinesses more than $2.5 billion in the first 5 years of the program. \nWith this much money at stake, confusion is unacceptable. A 1-year \ndelay could save significant resources and prevent many programmatic \nmissteps.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would like to thank my colleague from Missouri for \nincluding language in the Senate Committee Appropriations report on \nthis important issue. My involvement with this difficult issue dates \nback to the debate held in this body over the 1990 amendments when many \nof us expressed concern over the complexity of the title and its \npotential for imposing unnecessary costs on sources and States. Given \nthe severity of the problems which have beset this program, I hope the \nconferees to this bill will reflect on this debate and include \nstatutory language requesting a 1-year delay in order to protect the \nvital interests of States and sources who are in the unfortunate \nposition of having to comply with a regulatory moving target.\n  I also want to thank my colleague from North Carolina for his close \nscrutiny of this issue and his willingness to hold oversight hearings \non the agency's implementation of the permit program.\n  Mr. BOND. Thank you for raising these important issues. Considering \nthe potential for well-meaning States to be punished unfairly, I am \nsure my colleagues will consider your comments and those of the Senator \nfrom North Carolina most carefully.\n\n\n                             refinery mact\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to ask the distinguished \nchairman of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, the gentleman from \nMissouri, to engage in a colloquy with me on an issue of importance to \nmy constituents in Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOND. I would be pleased to discuss an issue with the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, a member of the full Appropriations Committee.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I want to compliment the Senator from Missouri for \naddressing the issue of the Environmental Protection Agency's refinery \nMACT rule in the Appropriations Committee's report on H.R. 2099. In my \nopinion, if ever a set of regulations needed to be reformed, it is the \nrefinery MACT rule.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator from Arkansas is correct. In its report on the \nbill under consideration today, the Appropriations Committee expressed \nits dissatisfaction with the procedures EPA has employed in \npromulgating all MACT regulations, particularly the refinery MACT rule. \nThe committee directed EPA to reevaluate the refinery MACT rule after \napplying principles of sound science.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I, and many of my colleagues in the Senate, commend the \nchairman for including that directive in the committee report.\n  In addition, I would like to specifically address an issue which is \nof particular importance to both the Senator from Missouri and myself. \nThat issue is the impact of the refinery MACT rule on smaller refiners \naround the Nation. The Senator from Missouri serves as the chairman of \nthe Small Business Committee, and I am proud to serve as the senior \nDemocrat on that committee.\n  In its refinery MACT rule, EPA made no provision for lessening the \nimpact of its rule on small businesses. In many cases, these smaller \nrefineries are located in attainment areas--areas in which the need for \nexpensive emissions control devices are questionable at best. In fact, \nEPA estimated that seven of these refineries would be forced to close \nunder the refinery MACT rule.\n  EPA's disregard for the impact of the refinery MACT rule on the small \nbusinesses of this Nation is disturbing to this Senator, as I am sure \nit is to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I share the Senator from Arkansas' concerns about the \nimpact of the refinery MACT rule on small business. This is one of the \nreasons the committee has directed the EPA to reexamine the refinery \nMACT rule. Placing a disproportionate burden on the Nation's small \nbusinesses is not sound regulatory policy. It is my hope that EPA will \naddress this issue, as well as the many other problems inherent in its \ncurrent refinery MACT rule, when it reassesses the rule as a whole.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator. I look forward to working with him \non this issue as this bill moves to conference and as EPA carries out \nthe committee's directive.\n\n\n                  environmental technology initiative\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I wish to bring to Chairman Bond's \nattention a matter regarding the Environmental Technology Initiative \n[ETI] and the proposed reductions to its budget. The underlying bill \nwill reduce funding for ETI by approximately $100 million. I do not \ntake issue with the committee's actions to reduce this particular \nbudget. I have every confidence that the remaining funds appropriated \nby the committee will be sufficient to fulfill the mission of this EPA \ninitiative. My concern lies chiefly in a clarification of the \nobjectives ETI should be pursuing with the resources that are being \nappropriated in this legislation.\n  On page 88 of the committee report, we state that the remaining \nfunds--approximately $20 million--are to be directed toward technology \nverification activities and other continued efforts that do not \nduplicate private sector initiatives. Is it your understanding Mr. \nChairman that the funds allocated by the committee to ETI are \nsufficient for, and ought to be used to complete EPA's multiprogram \nefforts to streamline the approval process for new analytical methods \nincluding the move toward performance-based standards?\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct. The committee would agree that allocating \nfunds for completing efforts to encourage new performance-based \nanalytical methods and other streamlining methods is entirely \nconsistent with the stated purpose of targeting ETI funding for \nverification efforts.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I think the chairman for his clarification. I am sure \nthat we both agree on the importance of analytical methods to ensure \ncompliance with environmental laws. Without them, it would be \nimpossible to determine whether industry was meeting the effluent \nstandards established by law and through the permit process. Efficient \nanalytical methods are also used to characterize hazardous waste and \nensure that our drinking water is free of harmful concentrations of \ncontaminants. Unfortunately, while methods to ensure compliance \ncontinue to improve and are more accurate, the current EPA process for \napproving the use of new methods keeps getting slower and more bogged \ndown.\n  I understand that EPA recognizes this problem, and several program \noffices have been working to reduce the backlog of analytical method \napproval requests and to reduce the time it takes to review and approve \nthese methods. Once a streamlined process is in place, these moneys \nwill be needed for a limited time to educate States and supervise \nimplementation. EPA has laid the foundation and the funds appropriated \nby the committee will be needed to put these procedures into practice.\n\n  Overall, this effort will decrease the time and resources that are \nneeded to approve analytical methods, resulting in more and better \nmethods. From the Agency perspective, this effort will provide a way to \nincrease the number of methods that can be used to meet statutory \nrequirements. In addition, \n\n[[Page S 14304]]\nEPA's efforts to streamline the approval process for new analytical \nmethods will spur new technologies and create new jobs. The money \nallocated to this process will significantly lower the cost of \nenvironmental measurements, thereby reducing the cost of environmental \ncompliance for industry and municipalities. I thank the chairman for \nhis time and support in this matter.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator and agree that EPA's efforts to \nstreamline its approval processes and move toward performance-based \nstandards for analytical methods are a vital part of environmental \ncompliance. Clearly, the completion of EPA's ongoing efforts in this \nregard is within the scope of funding provided in this bill for ETI.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the chairman.\n\n\n                    EPA ENERGY EFFICIENCY ACTIVITIES\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, may I engage in a colloquy with the \nchairman of the appropriations subcommittee and the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana regarding programs at the Environmental \nProtection Agency that result in improved energy efficiency in the \neconomy?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I proposed some report language on this topic that was \naccepted by the full Committee on Appropriations at its markup and \nwould be happy to discuss it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The report language states that:\n\n       The Committee notes that these programs overlap and \n     conflict with statutory authority provided to the Department \n     of Energy in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Therefore, EPA \n     should transfer to DOE those energy efficiency and energy \n     supply programs that DOE, not EPA, is authorized to carry \n     out. Future appropriations for these programs should be \n     requested as part of the DOE budget submission.\n\n  What is intended by this language?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The intention is very clear and specific. In the \nPresident's budget submission to Congress, funds were requested for EPA \nfor a series of 21 activities, many of which clearly overlapped and \nduplicated specific statutory authority provided to the Secretary of \nEnergy and others by the Congress through the Energy Policy Act of 1992 \nand the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. The Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources, of which I am the ranking member, has jurisdiction \nunder the Senate's rules for all aspects of energy policy, energy \nregulation, and conservation, energy research and development, and oil \nand gas production and distribution. Yet the committee has never been \napproached by the administration with a request to authorize any \nactivities for EPA in this area. The committee, rather, has made some \nfairly clear assignments of responsibility to agencies other than EPA \nfor topics such as product labeling for energy efficiency. I do not \nbelieve that it is acceptable for the administration to request funds \nin a manner that contravenes the clear intent of Congress with respect \nto statutory assignments of responsibility.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Of course, improving energy efficiency may be one way \nto prevent pollution, and Congress has authorized EPA to pursue \npollution prevention activities in the Clean Air Act and the Pollution \nPrevention Act of 1990. Do you intend that any activity in the EPA that \nrelated to energy efficiency would, by that very fact, be transferred \nto the Department of Energy?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No; the report language that I proposed is very clear. \nIf EPA lacks statutory authority for a particular activity that the \nDepartment of Energy or some other agency possesses, then EPA should \nnot undertake that activity. The report language that I proposed would \nnot preclude EPA from exercising its legitimate statutory authorities. \nFor example, EPA is working with the gas industry in a program called \nNatural Gas Star to reduce losses of methane to the atmosphere from gas \npipelines and other transmission equipment, under the aegis of the \nPollution Prevention Act. My report language would not transfer this \nprogram to DOE.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Would the Senator be open to requesting a report from \nthe EPA and from the Department of Energy to the Congress addressing \nhow their programs that promote improved energy efficiency or that \nresult in an energy supply that has less of a possibility of \ncontributing to global climate change relate to one another and to the \nexisting statutory authorities in the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and \nelsewhere?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes; I think that such a report would assist the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources in exercising its \njurisdiction, under the rules of the Senate, over energy conservation \nand energy supply issues. As you know, the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources must reauthorize the Energy Policy and Conservation \nAct in this Congress, and if a majority of members of the committee \nwere to believe that the EPA had a valuable role to exercise in this \narea that is not duplicative of what DOE or some other Federal agency \nis contributing or could contribute, such a role might be legitimately \ncreated in that context.\n  Mr. BOND. This has been a helpful and clarifying discussion. I \nsupport the suggestion of requiring a joint report to the appropriate \ncongressional committees from the EPA and the Department of Energy on \ntheir activities related to improving the energy efficiency of energy \nsupply and use, including a discussion of the statutory authorities \nunder which they are conducted. I will ask that report language to this \neffect be inserted in the conference report on this bill.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           TRAVIS VA HOSPITAL\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I rise today in strong opposition to the VA, HUD and \nindependent agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 1996. I would \nlike to focus on just one of the numerous reasons I will oppose this \nlegislation--the lack of any funding for the Travis VA Hospital in \nnorthern California.\n  Let me briefly describe the current situation for northern California \nveterans seeking inpatient health services. A veteran in this service \narea must drive an average of 4 to 5 hours, sometimes as many as 8 \nhours, to get to a VA acute care facility. The veteran's family, \nbecause they are so far from home, generally must stay in a hotel for \nthe duration of the veteran's hospital stay. Once the veteran is \nreleased from the hospital, he and his family must drive back and forth \nfrom home to the VA facility again for check-ups. This story could be \nrepeated as many as 450,000 times. That's right, nearly half a million \nveterans who used to have complete access to inpatient health services \nare now without adequate care.\n  I am appalled that the members of the Senate Appropriations Committee \nturned their backs on nearly a half a million veterans by not \ncontinuing to fund the replacement VA Hospital at Travis Air Force \nBase. This facility is desperately needed to replace the VA Medical \nCenter in Martinez, CA which was closed in 1991 because of earthquake \ndamage.\n  While awaiting the replacement facility at Travis, the Veteran's \nAdministration has been forced to piece together a patchwork healthcare \nsystem. They have had to borrow bed space at Travis AFB's David Grant \nHospital, and have transferred patients to facilities hundreds of miles \naway. I commend the VA for doing an admirable job in such a bad \nsituation. Unfortunately, since the closure of the Martinez hospital, \nonly 27 percent of that facility's inpatient services have been \ncontinued.\n  As bad as the situation has been, our veterans have been exceedingly \npatient. At the ground-breaking ceremony on June 2, 1994, attended by \nVice President Gore, we all were optimistic that northern California's \nveterans would not have much longer to wait for quality healthcare. \nMore than a year later, the plans are nearly complete and the land is \nready to begin construction of the replacement hospital early next \nyear. But instead, that land will stay empty, and nearly a half a \nmillion veterans will continue to be unserved.\n  The Travis VA Hospital is not a luxury to these veterans. They must \ndrive between 4 and 8 hours to get inpatient healthcare. Should someone \nwho served this country in war be required to drive from Washington, DC \nto New York City for healthcare? Now imagine that drive in order to \nobtain emergency medical care. That is correct. Veterans in northern \nCalifornia have no access to VA emergency services on evenings, \nweekends, or holidays. Currently, these veterans are forced to go to \nlocal health care facilities at either their own cost or at additional \ncost to the \n\n[[Page S 14305]]\ntaxpayers. This situation is simply unacceptable, it is unnecessarily \ncostly and is disrespectful of our veterans.\n  Please consider that this northern California area which would be \nserviced by Travis VA Hospital is one of the largest, most \ngeographically dispersed, and highly populated veterans areas in the \ncountry. More veterans live in northern California than in 27 \nindividual States and the District of Columbia. Would any Senator from \nthose States allow the needs of every veteran in their State be \nignored?\n  It is a sad day when the men and women who have served our country \nwithout question--and who have the right to expect their government to \nfulfill its promises--are now being told ``tough luck.'' It is simply \nunconscionable.\n  I appeal to my colleagues to honor the commitment we as a Nation have \nmade to our veterans, and join me in voting against this bill that so \nfundamentally fails to address the needs of so many veterans. I also \nhope that the President will veto this legislation which so flagrantly \nignores the needs of America's veterans.\n\n\n                             watertown, sd\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Senate consideration of the fiscal year \n1996 VA, HUD, and independent agencies appropriations bill provides an \nappropriate opportunity to raise an issue involving the Environmental \nProtection Agency [EPA] and Watertown, SD, that merits our attention.\n  Fifteen years ago, acting upon the recommendation of the EPA, \nWatertown installed a infiltration/percolation [I/P] pond for the \ntreatment of its wastewater. At the time, local officials were assured \nby the EPA that the community would be compensated for any future \nmodification or repair of the system that might be needed for it to \nremain operational. That EPA pledge was a significant factor in the \nCity's decision to install the I/P technology.\n  Unfortunately, the I/P system has not functioned as advertised. Since \n1982, Watertown has invested more than $8 million in its wastewater \ntreatment facility in an effort to make it work properly.\n  Despite these modifications, all of which were endorsed by the EPA, \nthe system has never functioned to EPA's satisfaction. As a result, \nWatertown has failed to meet EPA regulations since 1988, and community \nofficials continue to work with the EPA and the Justice Department to \nbring their wastewater treatment plant into compliance with the Clean \nWater Act and other regulations.\n  Watertown will need to make major capital investments to reach this \nend. I am informed that $15 million will be required for treatment \nplant improvements and an additional $10 million for sewer collection \nimprovements.\n  While Watertown is one of the largest cities in my state, it has a \npopulation of less than 20,000. The scope of this problem greatly \nexceeds the availability of local resources to resolve it.\n  Nonetheless, the community is determined to be part of the solution. \nWatertown Mayor Brenda Barger and other local leaders have already \npledged $3 million toward this project and will be exploring revenue \nbonds and other long-term debt financing mechanisms to secure \nadditional revenues.\n  While the community's determination to participate in the solution of \ntheir wastewater treatment dilemma is commendable, the responsibility \nshould not be theirs alone. The commitment that the federal government \nmade to this community should not be ignored.\n  It bears emphasis that Watertown's decision to install its I/P system \nwas based on assurances from EPA that the technology would work. \nFifteen years ago, EPA provided what amounted to a guarantee of the \ntechnology.\n  Local and Federal officials shared in the genesis of this problem \nand, therefore, it deserves a joint local/federal solution. Last May, I \nwrote the Senate Appropriations Committee to request federal funding to \nhelp upgrade the Watertown wastewater treatment plant.\n  While the federal government could be held accountable for full \nfunding of this project, it is worth noting that Watertown recognizes \nits responsibility in this matter and has worked hard to secure \nsignificant local funding sources.\n  It is a reasonable request that this appropriations bill include \nfunding for the City of Watertown. The Federal government was part of \nthe fateful decision to go the I/P route. Moreover, in past years this \nbill has included funding for communities that installed I/P systems at \nthe recommendation of the EPA. Complicity and precedent argued for \nFederal participation in the search for a solution. Absent such \nassistance, Watertown will be unable to solve its wastewater treatment \nfacility problems.\n  Mr. President, the final version of the fiscal year 1996 VA, HUD, and \nindependent agencies appropriations bill should include a substantial \nlevel of federal funding for the replacement of Watertown, South \nDakota's wastewater treatment facility. I will continue to work with \nthe managers of this bill to seek a fair resolution to this issue and \nhope that before this process is completed, a solution can be worked \nout.\n\n\n                              yellow creek\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of engaging in a \nshort colloquy with the distinguished Senator from Missouri, the \nchairman of the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee.\n  Will the Senator assist me in clarifying an issue in the bill under \nconsideration today?\n  Mr. BOND. I would be pleased to assist my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator from Missouri. The issue I wish to \nclarify is the Appropriation Committee's intent on the transfer of the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Yellow Creek \nfacility to the State of Mississippi.\n  As the Senator knows, the Federal Government has a long history of \ninvolvement in Yellow Creek, located near Iuka, Mississippi. The site, \noriginally purchased by the Tennessee Valley Authority for use as a \nnuclear energy plant, was subsequently transferred to NASA after the \nnuclear energy plant's cancellation. NASA intended to use Yellow Creek \nto build the Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) and, after its \ncancellation, instead committed to use the site to build nozzles for \nthe Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM). On May 2, 1995, due to its \ncurrent budgetary constraints, NASA terminated the RSRM nozzle \nproduction effort at Yellow Creek.\n  Would the Senator agree that the bill language included by the \nAppropriations Committee on the transfer of the NASA Yellow Creek \nfacility reflects the most recent commitment made by NASA Administrator \nDan Goldin to the Governor of the State of Mississippi. The major \ninvestment by the State of Mississippi in facilities and infrastructure \nto support Yellow Creek, in excess of $100 million, is a key factor in \nNASA's agreement to turn the site over to the State of Mississippi.\n  Mr. BOND. I agree with the Senator's assertion.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Would the Senator further stipulate that the main \nelements of the agreement reached between NASA and the State of \nMississippi, which the conferees would expect to be adhered to by both \nparties, are as follows:\n  First, the Yellow Creek facility will be turned over to the \nappropriate agency of the State of Mississippi within 30 days of \nenactment of this legislation. All of the NASA property on Yellow Creek \nwhich the State of Mississippi requires to facilitate the transfer of \nthe site transfers with the site to the State, subject to the following \nexceptions anticipated by the conferees:\n\n       Any property assigned to a NASA facility other than Yellow \n     Creek prior to May 2, 1995, but located at Yellow Creek will \n     be returned to its assigned facility;\n       Only those contracts for the sale of NASA property at \n     Yellow Creek signed by both parties prior to May 2, 1995 \n     shall be executed;\n       Those items deemed to be in the ``national security \n     interest'' of the federal government shall be retained by \n     NASA. The national security clause shall be narrowly \n     construed and shall apply only in a limited manner, \n     consistent with established criteria relating to national \n     security interests. This clause shall not be used to \n     circumvent the intent of this legislation, which is to \n     transfer the site and all of its property, except as \n     otherwise noted, to the State of Mississippi.\n       Other items of interest to NASA may be retained by NASA \n     with the consent of the State of Mississippi.\n\n  Further, it is the expectation of the Appropriations Committee \nconferees \n\n[[Page S 14306]]\nthat all other NASA personal property will transfer to the State of \nMississippi. The Appropriations Committee also expects facilities on \nthe site not subject to the above provisions, such as the environmental \nlab, to be left as is.\n  Second, any environmental remediation of Yellow Creek necessary as a \nresult of the activities of governmental agencies, such as NASA, or \nquasi-governmental agencies, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority, \nwill be the responsibility of the federal agency or quasi-federal \nagency, including any successors and interests.\n  Third, within 30 days of enactment of this legislation $10 million \nwill be transferred from NASA to the appropriate agency of the State of \nMississippi.\n  And lastly, the site's environmental permits will become the property \nof the State of Mississippi. NASA will provide all necessary assistance \nin transferring these permits to the State of Mississippi.\n  Mr. BOND. I would agree with the Senator's stipulations.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the chairman. I appreciate his willingness to \naddress the Yellow Creek transfer in the committee report.\n\n\n                        drug elimination grants\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to engage Senator Bond in a colloquy. It \nis my understanding that H.R. 2099 contains funding for the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development's drug elimination program. I would \nlike to know if it is the Senator's understanding that this funding \nwill be available to privately owned, assisted housing?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, this funding will be available to public housing and \nprivately owned, federally assisted housing.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator for clarifying this. Drug \nelimination grants have been enormously helpful in my state in the \nbattle against drugs and drug-related crimes at public and assisted \nhousing projects. This program is a critically important tool for us to \nmaintain this country's multi-year investment in decent, affordable \nhousing. I would like to thank Senator Bond for his leadership in \nsupporting this successful and worthwhile program.\n\n\n    the center for international earth science information networks\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs, \nHousing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies in a brief \ndiscussion regarding the impact of H.R. 2099 on this year and future \nyear's Mission to Plant Earth projects. The Committee Report \naccompanying H.R. 2099 directs a $6 million deletion in the Mission to \nPlanet Earth program for the Consortium for International Earth Science \nInformation Networks [CIESIN] in Saginaw, Michigan. This center is one \nof NASA's nine Distributed Active Archive Centers [DAACs] supporting \nthe Earth Observing System Data and Information System. CIESIN is the \nonly one that provides integrated socioeconomic data access for the \nstudy of the effect society has upon the environment. Because of this \nunique capability, I understand CIESIN fielded more requests for data \nlast year than all of the other eight DAACs combined. I also understand \nNASA officials have stated the product provided by CIESIN is vital to \nthe Earth Observing System program. In light of these considerations, I \nwould ask my distinguished colleague from Missouri why the Committee \nrecommends deleting the CIESIN budget request from the 1996 \nappropriations?\n  Mr. BOND. I understand my colleague's concerns regarding the Mission \nto Planet Earth program, but I wish to assure him the deletion \nrecommendation is not targeted against CIESIN as an institution, but \ninstead towards ensuring the function of CIESIN is integrated within \nNASA's Earth Observing System program to bring it in line with the \nstructure of the other DAACs. That is why the full Appropriations \nCommittee changed the Subcommittee recommendation on integrating this \nprogram into the EOS plan from 1997 to 1996; with that provision, the \nsocioeconomic data function can continue uninterrupted if so desired by \nNASA.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Senator for that clarification, and wish to \nfollow-up regarding how that data will be provided. Given NASA itself \nmade the recommendation for CIESIN funding, I believe it is apparent \nthis is a valid program given the Committee's recommendation to \ncontinue significant funding for the Mission to Planet Earth program. \nIf NASA wished to bring in an outside contractor to provide this \nsocioeconomic data service, would the Committee report language prevent \nCIESIN from bidding upon, and potentially winning such a contract?\n  Mr. BOND. Absolutely not. Nothing in the Committee report would \nprevent NASA from participating in any funded activities with CIESIN, \nwhether within the Mission to Planet Earth program, or some other \nfederal program.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. If the Senator would be so kind, I would just like to \nwrap up with one more question. Given the House Report on H.R. 2099 \nalso deletes $6 million for CIESIN, would the Senator from Missouri \nspeculate as to whether similar language in a Conference report would \nalso allow for CIESIN to receive a NASA contract for these services?\n  Mr. BOND. I believe the Conference language likely on this issue, \ngiven the close similarity between House and Senate positions, would \nallow for CIESIN to compete and win a NASA contract to provide this \nsocioeconomic data, or to participate in any other federal program. As \nmy distinguished counterpart in the House of Representatives stated on \nthe House floor July 27th, ``* * * there is nothing in the [House NASA] \nappropriations bill that prejudices competitive success by CIESIN for \nNASA funding in future requests or for bids of proposal.'' I will \npursue such an interpretation in Committee and oppose any measures to \npreclude CIESIN from competitively bidding for federal contracts.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to thank the chairman of the \nSubcommittee for that explanation and for the kind assistance he has \nprovided me and my staff in resolving this issue. Mr. President, I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2099, the \nDepartments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and \nindependent agencies appropriations bill for 1996.\n  This bill provides new budget authority of $81 billion and new \noutlays of $46.3 billion to finance the programs of the Departments of \nVeterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, the Environmental \nProtection Agency, NASA, and other independent agencies.\n  I congratulate the Chairman and Ranking Member for producing a bill \nthat is within the Subcommittee's 602(b) allocation. When outlays from \nprior-year BA and other adjustments are taken into account, the bill \ntotals $80.8 billion in BA and $92.5 billion in outlays. The total bill \nis under the Senate subcommittee's 602(b) nondefense allocation for \nbudget authority by $36 million and under its allocation for outlays by \n$18 million. The subcommittee is also under its defense allocation by \n$18 million in BA and $20 million in outlays.\n  Although the bill is under the allocation for 1996, I would like to \npoint out the budgetary effect that two of its provisions would have in \n1997. The bill includes a demonstration program to start reducing the \nrental assistance subsidies to multifamily projects that are insured by \nFHA at above-market value, as well as a preservation grant program with \na minimal paperwork process.\n  Both provisions, however, would not take effect until October 1, \n1996--the beginning of fiscal year 1997. Because this provision would \nincrease costs in the mandatory FHA program by $280 million in 1997, \nthe discretionary cap for that year would be reduced by that amount.\n  In addition, because reducing the paperwork for the preservation \ngrant program in 1997 is designed to increase the outflow of funds, \n1997 outlays will be $400 million greater than they would be from that \nappropriation under the way the program currently works. This has the \neffect of a delayed obligation that will cost the committee $400 \nmillion against its allocation before it even starts marking up next \nyear.\n  I ask Members of the Senate to refrain from offering amendments which \nwould cause the subcommittee to exceed its budget allocation and urge \nthe speedy adoption of this bill. \n\n[[Page S 14307]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       VA-HUD SUBCOMMITTEE--SPENDING TOTALS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL       \n               [Fiscal year 1996, in millions of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    Budget              \n                                                   authority    Outlays \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefense discretionary:                                                  \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed..................................  ..........          78\n    H.R. 2099, as reported to the Senate........         153          92\n    Scorekeeping adjustment.....................  ..........  ..........\n                                                 -----------------------\n        Subtotal defense discretionary..........         153         169\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed..................................  ..........      45,660\n    H.R. 2999, as reported to the Senate........      61,464      28,963\n    Scorekeeping adjustment.....................  ..........  ..........\n                                                 -----------------------\n        Subtotal nondefense discretionary.......      61,464      74,624\nMandatory:                                                              \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed..................................  ..........         133\n    H.R. 2099, as reported to the Senate........      19,362      17,213\n    Adjustment to conform mandatory programs                            \n     with Budget................................  ..........  ..........\n        Resolution assumptions..................        -224         341\n                                                 -----------------------\n        Subtotal mandatory......................      19,138      17,688\n                                                 =======================\n          Adjusted bill total...................      80,754      92,481\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n    Defense discretionary.......................         171         189\n    Nondefense discretionary....................      61,500      74,642\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund..........  ..........  ..........\n    Mandatory...................................      19,138      17,688\n        Total allocation........................      80,809      92,519\nAdjustment bill total compared to Senate                                \n Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                        \n    Defense discretionary.......................         -18         -20\n    Nondefense discretionary....................         -36         -18\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund..........  ..........  ..........\n    Mandatory...................................  ..........  ..........\n        Total allocation........................         -55         -38\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, the appropriations bill before us today \nrepresents a major step backward for the environment. While less \nextreme than the House-passed measure, it still proposes to cut EPA's \nbudget by $1.7 billion--fully 23 percent below the levels enacted in \nfiscal 1995--and contains 11 so-called riders which would significantly \nundermine the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to administer \nand enforce environmental laws and perform its important mission of \nprotecting public health and the environment.\n  Maryland alone would lose over $14 million in funding needed to \nupgrade outdated sewage treatment facilities--projects which have a \ndirect impact on the water quality of the Chesapeake Bay, our coastal \nbeaches and bays, and local waters. Legislative provisions in the \nunderlying measure would prohibit EPA from implementing section 404(c) \nof the Clean Water Act which gives the agency authority to review U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers wetlands permit decisions and provides another \nsystem of checks and balances in protecting the quality of our Nation's \nwaters. In addition, the proposed cut of some $20 million in EPA's \nenforcement and compliance assurance program would severely impact upon \nthe agency's ability to inspect industrial and Federal facilities in \nMaryland and prosecute violations.\n  Mr. President, this bill unfairly singles out EPA to bear a \ndisproportionate share of the deficit reduction burden. It will not \njust decrease the rate of increases, but will severely cut EPA's \nfunding. Its riders would undercut a number of our Nation's \nenvironmental statutes, without adequate hearings, public involvement \nor review. These actions are unjustified and unwarranted and for these \nand other reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this \nbill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1254, a bill \nto block reductions in penalties for crack dealing proposed by the \nUnited States Sentencing Commission. If the Congress does not act, \nthose changes will take effect this November 1.\n  According to the Department of Justice, which has also asked us to \nblock implementation of the changes, the new penalty structure will \nmake base sentences for crack anywhere from two to six times shorter \nthan they are now.\n  That is simply irresponsible public policy. It would send a terrible \nmessage both to crack dealers and to communities trying to fight back \nagainst the crack trade.\n  No one, not even the Sentencing Commission, denies that the brunt of \ncrack's social consequences have fallen on poor, urban, minority, \nresidents. Given what crack has done to our cities, it frankly amazes \nme to hear people arguing for lower sentences. Especially from people \nwho wouldn't for one moment tolerate an open-air crack market in their \nneighborhood in Scarsdale or Chevy Chase.\n  The Commission's own report, moreover, acknowledges that crack's \npsychoactive effects are far more intense than powder cocaine, which \nmeans that crack is far more addictive.\n  Members of the Sentencing Commission are concerned that the current \nsentencing structure creates a perception of unfairness because most \nconvicted crack dealers are African-Americans, whereas a majority of \nconvicted powder dealers are White or Hispanic. I am sensitive to these \nconcerns. This Congress will deal severely and aggressively with any \nindication that prosecution or sentencing is being driven by racial \nconsiderations. We will not tolerate any racial discrimination in our \ncriminal justice system.\n  But Mr. President, it is also important to remember that the number \nof people convicted for crack violations each year is just 3,430. I am \nmore concerned, to be blunt, about the millions of people living in our \ncities whose quality of life is being ruined. These people have equal \nrights to safe neighborhoods.\n  To those who say the Federal Government is locking up tens of \nthousands of nonviolent, low-level offenders, let me say this: We \nstudied that question. What we found was that out of the 3,430 crack \ndefendants convicted in 1994, the number of youthful, small-time crack \noffenders with no prior criminal history and no weapons involvement, \nsentenced in Federal courts, was just 51. The median crack defendant \nwas convicted of trafficking 109 grams--more than 2,000 rocks or doses. \nOnly ten percent of crack defendants had trafficked less than 2-3 grams \nof crack--the equivalent of 40-60 doses.\n  And finally, on Tuesday, September 12, HHS released alarming figures \nshowing drug use up sharply among our young people. Mr. President, this \nis not the time to be sending the message that we are weakening social \nsanctions against the drug trade.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/26/senate-section/article/S14307-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14307-S14308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   D.C. BOOTH HISTORIC FISH HATCHERY\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the \nrededication of the D.C. Booth Historic Fish Hatchery in Spearfish \nafter extensive renovations. These developments represent exciting \nopportunities for learning and historic preservation.\n  It was Senator Pettigrew, one of South Dakota's earliest and most \nprominent Senators, who first appropriated funding for the hatchery in \nthe 1890's. Originally called the Spearfish National Fish Hatchery, it \nwas later renamed in honor of the original superintendent, D.C. Booth. \nThe facility is now almost 100 years old and has been listed on the \nNational Register of Historic Places. It is one of the oldest fisheries \nwest of the Mississippi River and now plays a significant role in \nwestern South Dakota's tourism industry, bringing in over 200,000 \nvisitors each year.\n  I worked closely with my colleagues on South Dakota's congressional \ndelegation to authorize the renovation of the D.C. Booth Fish Hatchery. \nIn 1991, Congress recognized the historic importance of this fish \nhatchery. Funding was subsequently provided to renovate the existing \nfacilities. In addition, an \n\n[[Page S 14308]]\nunderwater fish viewing area and a new historical fishery records and \narchive center were constructed. The archive center, which collects and \npreserves the national public historical fishery records and artifacts, \nis the only one of its kind in the country.\n  Over the years, the hatchery has also made strides towards improving \nfish population and diversity in western South Dakota. Interestingly \nenough, the trout which are raised at the D.C. Booth Fish Hatchery are \nnot native to the Black Hills area. This hatchery originally was \nresponsible for stocking not only the Black Hills, but also Yellowstone \nNational Park.\n  One particularly interesting feature which will soon be available to \ntour is an old Federal Fishcar Service railroad car. At one time, trout \neggs were transported to and from Spearfish in refrigerated rail cars. \nWith the advent of faster transportation, this method has long since \nbeen abandoned. When the exhibit is finished, visitors will be able to \nwalk through a renovated rail car, complete with original dishes and \ntrout egg storage trays.\n  On Sunday, September 24, 1995, a ceremony was held in Spearfish, SD, \nto rededicate the renovated D.C. Booth Historic Fish Hatchery. This \nceremony would not have been possible without the hard work and \ndedication of Mr. Arden Trandahl, director of the site for the Fish and \nWildlife Service. During his tenure in Spearfish, he has been \nthoroughly committed to preserving the historic significance of the \nhatchery.\n  Thanks to the devotion of Arden Trandahl and the Fish and Wildlife \nService, the State of South Dakota, and the community of Spearfish, \nthis renovation project is now a reality. I would also like to thank \nMolly Salcone and the other members of the D.C. Booth Society. As \npresident of this non-profit society, she has fostered a unique \nprivate-public partnership which provided valuable assistance in the \nrestoration of the D.C. Booth Fish Hatchery. This project is a great \nexample of how we can all work together to make things happen.\n  The renovated D.C. Booth Historic Fish Hatchery provides a unique \neducational experience, combining past and present fish management. I \nextend my congratulations and best wishes for the future success of the \nfacility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/26/senate-section/article/S14307-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE FOUR EAGLES MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I would like to call attention to \na monument recently dedicated to the memory of four men who lost their \nlives in a catastrophic plane crash near Minot, ND. The crash occurred \nduring a blizzard in February 1994, as the pilot and passengers--three \nIndian Health Service [IHS] doctors--were travelling to several IHS \nclinics in the area.\n  The West River Monument Co. of Rapid City, SD, constructed a monument \nmade of Dakota mahogany granite as a tribute to the victims of the \ncrash. This monument, entitled ``Four Eagles Memorial,'' was dedicated \non Saturday, September 16, 1995.\n  For years now, I have been a strong advocate for small aircraft \nsafety. It saddens me each time I learn of aircraft-related fatalities. \nThe men who lost their lives in the crash were dedicated to their work, \ntheir families, and their friends. Their loss continues to be felt.\n  Yet, tributes like the one made to these men are heartfelt. While a \nyear and one-half have passed since this tragedy, we will not forget \nthe victims of the crash. My thoughts continue to be with the families \nand friends of the men who perished in this unfortunate accident. The \nFour Eagles Memorial will serve to remind us always of these four \nadmired and well-respected men.\n  A recent article appeared in the Rapid City Journal of Rapid City, \nSD, regarding the dedication of the memorial. I ask unanimous consent \nthat this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Rapid City Journal, Sept. 15, 1995]\n\n                 Memorial to Doctors Dedicated Saturday\n\n                            (By Bill Harlan)\n\n       Granite monument will honor the three Indian Health Service \n     doctors killed in 1994 plane crash.\n       Stone cutter Ken Krzyzanowski will etch the doctor's names \n     into the monument. Brandon Zander, a Stevens High School \n     senior who works part-time at West River Monument Co., helped \n     create the design. He is the son of the manager of West River \n     Monument.\n       John DuBray says many people helped create the monument to \n     three Indian Health Service doctors who died in a plane crash \n     last year.\n       But DuBray is especially grateful to LeRoy Zander, manager \n     of West River Monument Co. of Rapid City, which is building \n     the memorial.\n       ``He didn't know us from Adam, and he went above and \n     beyond. He really did his best,'' DuBray said.\n       The ``Four Eagles Memorial'' is a granite monument that \n     will stand nearly four feet tall when placed on its round \n     concrete base in front of the main building at Sioux San \n     Hospital.\n       DuBray and other Sioux San personnel will dedicate the \n     memorial in a ceremony at 11 a.m. Saturday at the hospital, \n     where two of the three doctors worked. The public is invited.\n       This week, the doctors' names are being etched on three \n     sides of the ``Dakota mahogany'' granite, along with brief \n     professional and personal descriptions.\n       An inscription on the fourth side will describe the purpose \n     of the monument, which is ``in lasting memory of our \n     courageous physicians.''\n       The four-sided memorial will rest on a round base, and two \n     granite benches will be installed nearby, inscribed with \n     names of the members of the doctors' families.\n       DuBray is a public health nursing assistant at Sioux San, \n     and he also is coordinating the memorial project. He also \n     worked with two of the doctors.\n       The doctors' plane went down in a blizzard near Minot, \n     N.D., on Feb. 24, 1994. IHS were visiting IHS clinics in the \n     region.\n       DuBray said four eagles on the monument and four juniper \n     trees that will be planted at the site will memorialize the \n     three doctors and the pilot, who also was killed.\n       The memorial cost $6,500, all of it donated.\n       Funds came from Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., Sen. Larry \n     Pressler, R-S.D., doctors of the Black Hills Regional Eye \n     Institute, families of the doctors who were killed and other \n     donors.\n       The doctors killed were Arvo Oopik, 37, a cardiologist \n     based in North Carolina; Christopher Krogh, 45, a maternity \n     and infant-care specialist based at Sioux San, and Ruggles \n     Stahn, 46, a diabetes specialist also based at Sioux San.\n       The pilot of the plane was Ed Mellen, 53, who also died in \n     the crash, and flew for B Aviation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/26/senate-section/article/S14308-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14308-S14309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          U.S.-SINO RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, last Friday I had the opportunity to speak \nbefore the Washington chapter of the Asia Society on the subject of \nU.S.-Sino relations. I would like to share that speech with my \ncolleagues, and ask unanimous consent that the text be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Towards a New China Policy\n\n       I'm very pleased to be here this morning to inaugurate the \n     Asia Society's new forum series featuring members of Congress \n     with responsibility for Asian policy issues. I'm also pleased \n     to see Ambassador Nathan of Singapore, the new Sri Lankan \n     ambassador, and Minister Zhang Keyuan from the Chinese \n     embassy are here with us today.\n       The Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs of the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which I chair, has \n     jurisdiction over Asia from Burma and Mongolia east to the \n     shores of California. As you are all well aware, this area is \n     probably the most dynamic in the world right now. With China, \n     Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Vietnam, it is the \n     economic engine that will drive the world economy into the \n     21st Century and beyond.\n       Among all these established and developing economies, with \n     1.2 billion people, a GDP equivalent around $2.73 trillion, a \n     national product real growth rate last year of 13.4 percent, \n     it is clear that the chief economic and political ``tiger'' \n     that will dominate Asia in the years to come is the People's \n     Republic of China. As such, the dynamics of our bilateral \n     relationship will become even more important--both for us and \n     the other countries in the region--in the years ahead. The \n     U.S.-Sino relationship is a major focus of the work of the \n     subcommittee. Of the six substantive hearings the \n     subcommittee has held this year, four have concerned the PRC; \n     we are planning at least three more before the close of the \n     year. It is that relationship which I have been asked to \n     address this morning.\n       It will come as no surprise to those of you here this \n     morning that the US-Sino relationship is not presently at its \n     best. Since the administration's decision to admit Taiwan's \n     President Lee for a private visit, we have seen the most \n     serious deterioration of relations since the Tiananmen \n     Massacre. I won't engage in a step-by-step analysis of each \n     of the incidents which have afflicted our relationship in the \n     past year for two main reasons. First, I believe that you are \n     all intimately familiar with them and their recitation would \n     be redundant. More importantly, \n\n[[Page S 14309]]\n     however, I believe that the problem is much more fundamental than those \n     issues.\n       The core problem in U.S.-Sino relations is that we lack a \n     coherent and clearly articulated foreign policy. \n     Unfortunately, the phrase ``Clinton foreign policy'' is an \n     oxymoron. Instead, of having clear proactive policy goals, \n     and making them and our strong commitment to them known to \n     the countries concerned, this administration drifts from \n     reaction to reaction. The pitfalls of this kind of reactive \n     policy are clearly apparent in what's been going on in \n     Bosnia; and they are clearly apparent in our relationship \n     with the PRC.\n       In my view, for there to be a viable foreign policy \n     between, say, country A and country B, you should be able to \n     ask officials from A what its policy towards B is, ask B what \n     A's policy towards B is, and get pretty close to the same \n     answer from each. According to the Chinese, however, our \n     policy towards them is one of containment. According to our \n     State Department, it is one of ``constructive engagement.'' \n     You can see the problem here--there is a very large \n     conceptual gap between these two.\n       ``Constructive engagement'' seems to me, and others I have \n     spoken with, to be a bit vague. The administration describes \n     it this way. Say there are 1,000 different individual issue \n     strands that make up our over-all bilateral relationship. On \n     some of the issues we're in complete agreement, others in \n     partial agreement, and others in complete disagreement. So, \n     we'll work on those areas where we might expect some \n     progress, and not press those where we conflict. The \n     administration calls this a policy. In my view, though, this \n     is no policy at all, but 1,000 separate conflicting little \n     policies. From what I hear from the Chinese, both officially \n     and unofficially, they find it rather confusing as well.\n       This confusion is made worse by the domestic climate in \n     each respective country. First, in the United States, there \n     are the complications caused by the fact that nature, and the \n     Congress, abhor a vacuum. When Congress perceives a lack of \n     leadership on the foreign policy stage, it has traditionally \n     been quick to step in and supply its own. This often leads to \n     conflicting policies between the two branches and sends \n     confusing signals abroad. A clear example is the visit of \n     President Lee. The administration stated categorically that \n     it would not issue a visa for Lee to pay a private visit to \n     the United States. Both houses of Congress, on the other \n     hand, made clear by overwhelming votes that he should be \n     admitted.\n       In the P.R.C., the ongoing jockeying for power in the soon-\n     to-be-post-Deng-Xiaoping era has also accentuated the \n     problems in the bilateral relationship. In times of political \n     flux in China, one of the tried and true ways of establishing \n     one's conservative communist bona fides is to be stridently \n     xenophobic. To be seen as coddling the United States, or \n     giving in to its ``demands,'' can thus be the functional \n     equivalent of political suicide. As a result, during periods \n     of transition such as this Chinese reaction to incidents it \n     considers provocations is often overblown for domestic \n     consumption. I hate to keep coming back to Taiwan as an \n     example, but I strongly believe the PRC's overreaction to our \n     admitting President Lee--for an unofficial visit well within \n     the parameters of the three joint communiques--is a direct \n     result of its leadership courting the political support of \n     the conservatives in the PLA.\n       So, ladies and gentlemen, given all these problems I \n     believe that the time has come to reevaluate and restructure \n     our China policy, and that reevaluation needs to start with \n     the very core premise upon which it is built. I'm sure if \n     you've ever listened to administration or PRC officials, read \n     the Congressional Record or the People's Daily, or spoken \n     with a variety of public policy figures, you have heard the \n     oft-repeated statement that our two countries need to be good \n     friends, or need to return to being good friends, or \n     shouldn't let present frictions stand in the way of what \n     should be our close friendship.\n       I would love for the U.S. to be close friends with China, \n     but expecting us to be close friends at this point in history \n     overlooks a fundamental problem: the PRC is a totalitarian \n     state, a communist dictatorship; the United States is a \n     democracy. Almost by definition, a close friendship between \n     two such diametrically opposed systems is impossible. \n     Friendships are based on shared aspirations, shared goals, \n     shared dreams; but our most fundamental views of politics and \n     human freedoms are poles apart. This is not a pessimistic \n     view, or the view based on some anti-China bias, or a \n     Republican view, or a conservative view; it is a reality. The \n     Chinese are rightly fond of their proverbs, and I would \n     invoke one here to illustrate my point: ``Hu lu bu tong \n     xong''--``Tigers and deer do not walk together.'' To delude \n     ourselves into thinking that as countries we will be anything \n     near close friends is just that, a delusion.\n       I think both we and the Chinese government have to \n     recognize that there are certain fundamental issues upon \n     which, under our present political systems, we will never \n     agree and which realistically preclude the kind of \n     relationship we have with other countries in the region such \n     as Japan. Having said that, however, I would note it does not \n     mean that we can't establish a constructive working \n     relationship with them based on areas where we have shared \n     interests. I think that it's the difference between the \n     friendship among close personal friends and a friendship \n     based on, say, a business relationship. For example, it's the \n     difference between my friendship with fellow Wyoming Senator \n     Al Simpson and my friendship with Chinese Ambassador Li \n     Daoyu. I grew up in Wyoming with Al, went to the same high \n     school; the two of us have shared experiences and ideals that \n     have made us the best of friends. Ambassador Li and I have a \n     different friendship. I enjoy our meetings, I find our \n     contacts helpful and informative, but our friendship is \n     primarily business-based; there is not that closeness, nor \n     would we either of us expect that there would be.\n       What our two countries need to do, then, is start over from \n     that point, and work to reshape the very nature of our \n     bilateral relationship. We need to build that relationship \n     around a core of mutual respect and our shared goals. We need \n     to state what the parameters of the policy are, and then we \n     need to stick to them. In that way there are no surprises, no \n     unmet expectations, no confusion on either side.\n       The most obvious area where we share interests is in the \n     economic sphere. It is a symbiotic relationship; we have the \n     technological know-how and the products, they have the desire \n     to expand their economy and the almost unlimited market. This \n     is probably our most stable and dependable commonality, \n     problems with the rule of law and intellectual property \n     rights aside. This stability is illustrated by the fact that \n     during the recent downturn in our relationship, our economic \n     ties remain relatively unscathed. Consequently, trade would \n     probably be a good place to start to restructure the basis of \n     the relationship. Secondly, we both have a general interest \n     in maintaining a stable Asia. Instability endangers markets, \n     endangers both our national security interests, and alienates \n     and endangers our relationships with other countries in the \n     region. This provides another base from which to build.\n       There will continue to be areas of real disagreement \n     between us. But I believe that by mutually redefining our \n     relationship (and I do not mean here, for the benefit of the \n     Chinese government, in any way redefining our commitment to \n     the three communiques or the ``one China'' policy) we can \n     perhaps minimize the effect those disagreements have on our \n     bilateral relationship. I think that by being a bit more \n     realistic about what kind of friendship we can have, we will \n     somewhat lower our mutual expectations. When expectations in \n     a relationship are lowered, blows to that relationship tend \n     to have less of a disruptive impact.\n       Let me note in closing that I am not an Asia expert. Many \n     of you in this room this morning have been pursuing Asian \n     affairs for decades. I do not pretend to know all the nuances \n     and eddies and currents of this part of the world. But let me \n     quote once again a Chinese proverb: ``Dang ju zhe mi, pang \n     guan zhe qing''-- ``Observers can see a chess game more \n     clearly than the players.'' Perhaps it is time for a fresh \n     approach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/26/senate-section/article/S14308-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit for interest paid on education loans; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n              the higher education investment act of 1995\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation on behalf of myself and my able colleague from Illinois, \nSenator Moseley-Braun. We call it the Higher Education Investment Act \nof 1995. We hope that this bill will launch an individual income tax \ncredit for interest paid by young people on their student loans.\n  Our own young people are the ones who truly must balance the Federal \nbudget for the long run. I believe that if we on Capitol Hill want to \ndo our part to balance the Federal budget for the long run, then we \nmust aid human investment in one of its highest forms: knowledge gained \nthrough education. As the U.S. Senate, with an obligation toward the \nnational economy, we must underwrite higher education as an economic \ninvestment toward future Federal tax revenues. This bill is the \nworkable legislative vehicle.\n  As a practical matter of income tax credits, the Higher Education \nInvestment Act of 1995 provides targeted taxpayers with a credit for up \nto 20 percent of the interest paid during the first 5 years in which \npayments are required on qualified educational loans. A student \ntaxpayer may utilize both this credit and the standard deduction. Thus, \na young person, or young married couple, can utilize this credit \nregardless of whether they are fortunate enough to have the money to \nbegin buying a home and enjoying its related tax benefits. In fact, we \nintend this bill to aid young people, who are just starting out in \nlife, in their effort to retain enough cash so that they too can have a \nchance at beginning the good life that many of us from older \ngenerations have enjoyed.\n  As a Congress, we have been decades in saddling the next generation \nwith the burden of paying off our national debt. At a minimum, we \nshould allow its members a mechanism to leverage themselves to \naccomplish their enormous task. To earn the necessary cash flow to \nsucceed, and to not slip into a lower standard of living that we \ncurrently enjoy, the members of the next generation must arm themselves \nboth with knowledge and income potential. During the past decade, \ntuition and fees at both public and private colleges and universities \nhave increased at rates far exceeding inflation. During the same decade \nwe in Congress eliminated the interest deduction for student loans. \nThus, we require the next generation to not only borrow more than we \nborrowed, we force them pay more than we paid. All of us must find it \nironic that, in their efforts to settle up on our open account, which \nis full of our excesses, we have denied them the same tax benefitted \neducation that we enjoyed.\n  The social cost is enormous. Large volumes of student loan debt steer \nstudents away from socially useful though low paying careers such as \nteaching, research, or public service. It curbs entrepreneurial action \nbecause entrepreneurial ventures involve risk, and large, fixed, \nmonthly student loan repayment obligations do not lend themselves to a \nyoung person's appetite for \n\n[[Page S 14313]]\nrisk. Without this student loan interest credit, which is consistent \nwith a progressive tax code, we will fail to invest in our most long \nlived and productive assets: the minds of our electorate.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, we challenge our colleagues to once again \nunderwrite knowledge by first underwriting and co-sponsoring this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include the bill in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1273\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Higher Education Investment \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CREDIT FOR INTEREST ON EDUCATION LOANS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of \n     chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     nonrefundable personal credits) is amended by inserting after \n     section 22 the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 23.

For \n     purposes of this paragraph, any loan and all refinancings of \n     such loan shall be treated as 1 loan.\n       ``(2) Dependent.--If the qualified education loan was used \n     to pay education expenses of an individual other than the \n     taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse, a credit shall be allowed \n     under this section for any taxable year with respect to such \n     loan only if--\n       ``(A) a deduction under section 151 with respect to such \n     individual is allowed to the taxpayer for such taxable year, \n     and\n       ``(B) such individual is at least a half-time student with \n     respect to such taxable year.\n       ``(e) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n       ``(1) Qualified education loan.--The term `qualified \n     education loan' means any indebtedness incurred to pay \n     qualified higher education expenses--\n       ``(A) which are incurred on behalf of the taxpayer, the \n     taxpayer's spouse, or a dependent of the taxpayer,\n       ``(B) which are paid or incurred within a reasonable period \n     of time before or after the indebtedness is incurred, and\n       ``(C) which are attributable to education furnished during \n     a period during which the recipient was at least a half-time \n     student.\n\n     Such term includes indebtedness used to refinance \n     indebtedness which qualifies as a qualified education loan. \n     The term `qualified education loan' shall not include any \n     indebtedness owed to a person who is related (within the \n     meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)) to the taxpayer.\n       ``(2) Qualified higher education expenses.--The term \n     `qualified higher education expenses' means the cost of \n     attendance (as defined in section 472 of the Higher Education \n     Act of 1965, 20 U.S.C. 1087ll, as in effect on the day before \n     the date of the enactment of this Act) of the taxpayer, the \n     taxpayer's spouse, or a dependent of the taxpayer at an \n     eligible educational institution.

And we ought to do it.''\n  President Clinton even declared on March 16th that he needs \nlegislative reforms to: ``* * * fix provisions of RCRA * * * [to avoid] \nhigh costs and marginal environmental benefit.''\n  Vice-President Gore, this spring, promised that: ``* * * \nenvironmental protection * * * will protect more and cost less * * *'' \nin his Reinventing Government brochure.\n  EPA Administrator Browner, this spring, testified to our Senate's \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee that: ``* * * reform efforts are \nso crucial; we must meet these challenges with commonsense cost-\neffective measures.''\n  EPA's Head of the Office of Solid Waste, Mr. Shapiro, this summer, \ntestified to the House's Commerce Subcommittee that: ``* * * we have \nlearned [to] rely on * * * our State partners, and we have learned that \nflexibility is vital to our success.''\n  EPA, this spring, reaffirmed its commitment to permanently implement \nthe regulatory status of petroleum contaminated media under the \nUnderground Storage Tank Program to avoid `` * * * delays in \nremediation action and increases in remediation costs.''\n  EPA's briefing document, this summer, reported that DOD wanted cost \nto be factored into level of cleanups, and even OMB advocated a one-\nregulator cleanup approach.\n  The Reinventing Government brochure went on to assure that by July 15 \nof this year a package of rifle shot reforms would be delivered to \nCongress.\n  The administration was sending out a loud and consistent theme:\n  First, RCRA reforms are desired;\n  Second, RCRA reforms are needed this year; and\n  Third, RCRA reforms must be legislative.\n  I heard the administration's message.\n  Let's also recognize that Americans clearly are fed up with \nineffective environmental programs that do little for clean-up, but \nlots for lawyers. They do not want their hard-earned tax dollars being \nwasted.\n  Thoughtful citizens are exhausted by excessive, prescriptive \nregulations that exaggerate risks which too often are based upon \nemotion rather than scientific evidence. Buzzword phrases like \n``rational rules,'' ``reasonably expected scenarios,'' ``stop Federal \nmandates,'' and ``one-size does not fit-all'' are typical and part of \neveryday, commonplace dialogue from Hernando to Excatawpa, MS.\n  I heard the Public's message too.\n  Before I go any further, I want to be up-front about my goals for \nthis legislation: First, make RCRA work faster and cheaper; Second, \nremove regulations that are counterproductive to cleanups; Third, \nstreamline agency decisionmaking; and Fourth, give states authority to \nmake decisions.\n  Now, I want to explain why my environmental policy reform bill just \nconcentrates on RCRA:\n  True, it is a program that does not have an attention getting name, \nlike Superfund. Some would even say it is a program with an \nunpronounceable name.\n  True, it is a program which perhaps many Americans are not aware of. \nBut it is far more widespread then Superfund.\n  My colleagues need to hear a few numbers to understand why Congress \nneeds to deal with RCRA:\n  There are five times as many RCRA sites as there are Superfund sites. \nIn Mississippi there are just two Superfund sites, but there are over \n40 RCRA Corrective Action Sites.\n  And, a respected study conducted 4 years ago reported that roughly \n$240 billion will be spent on RCRA remediation. As a reference point \nthat is nearly $100 billion more than will be spent on the notorious \nSuperfund.\n  RCRA is a big, albeit invisible, and expensive program that the \nadministration wants to reform.\n  Well, so do I.\n  I have responded with a sensible, responsive and responsible \nlegislative solution. It is not a comprehensive across-the-board \nreform, rather it is surgical approach which targets just a few \nspecific problem areas. The administration calls it rifle-shot \nlegislative fixes.\n  My legislative solution has two basic straight-forward features which \nwill save billions and remediate quicker all without inhibiting or \nlessening environmental protection:\n  First, it replaces inappropriate RCRA requirements originally \ndesigned to minimize the amount of routinely generated hazardous waste \nwith a remediation action plan concept which will maximize site cleanup \nby empowering state regulators to make common sense cleanup decisions, \nand to give them authority to enforce these decisions.\n  Second, it codifies the regulatory status of cleanup materials \nensuring the continuation of the highly successful Underground Storage \nTank Corrective Action Program.\n  I believe it makes sense to focus this environmental reform effort to \nan incremental method. We need to go step-by-step making directed \nchanges and then pausing to examine the consequences before returning \nwith additional legislation.\n  That is why my bill deals with only two issues. It avoids \nWashington's Christmas tree mentality of loading up on numerous \ndisconnected changes. It also sidesteps policy matters which are more \nappropriately handled through the upcoming Superfund reauthorization.\n  My legislative solution will merely tailor RCRA's regulatory process \nto site-specific remediation to ensure common sense, enforceable \ncleanup occur. I urge my colleagues to examine my proposal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1274\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for appropriate remedies for prison \ncondition lawsuits, to discourage frivolous and abusive prison \nlawsuits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the prison conditions litigation reform act\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that I \nbelieve is essential if we are to restore public confidence in \ngovernment's ability to protect the public safety. Moreover, it will \naccomplish this purpose not by spending more taxpayer money but by \nsaving it.\n  This legislation removes enormous obstacles the Federal Government \nhas placed in the path of States' and localities' ability to protect \ntheir residents. I would like to highlight three of these obstacles and \nexplain what we are going to do to remove them.\n  First, in many jurisdictions including my own State of Michigan, \njudicial orders entered under Federal law raise the costs of running \nprisons far beyond what is necessary. These orders also thereby \nundermine the legitimacy and punitive and deterrent effect of prison \nsentences.\n  Second, in other jurisdictions, judicial orders entered under Federal \nlaw actually result in the release of dangerous criminals from prisons.\n  Third, these orders are complemented by a veritable torrent of \nprisoner lawsuits. Although these suits are found non-meritorious the \nvast majority of the time (over 99 percent, for example, in the ninth \ncircuit), they occupy an enormous amount of State and local time and \nresources; time and resources that would be better spent incarcerating \nmore dangerous offenders.\n  Let me start with the problems in my own State of Michigan.\n  Under a series of judicial decrees resulting from Justice Department \nsuits against the Michigan Department of Corrections, the Federal \ncourts now monitor our State prisons to determine:\n  1. How warm the food is.\n  2. How bright the lights are.\n  3. Whether there are electrical outlets in each cell.\n  4. Whether windows are inspected and up to code.\n  5. Whether prisoners' hair is cut only by licensed barbers.\n  6. And whether air and water temperatures are comfortable.\n  Elsewhere, American citizens are put at risk every day by court \ndecrees. I have in mind particularly decrees that cure prison crowding \nby declaring that we must free dangerous criminals before they have \nserved their time, or not incarcerate certain criminals at all because \nprisons are too crowded.\n  The most egregious example is the city of Philadelphia. For the past \n8 years, a Federal judge has been overseeing what has become a program \nof wholesale releases of up to 600 criminal defendants per week to keep \nthe prison population down to what she considers an appropriate level.\n  Under this order, there are no individualized bail hearings on a \ndefendant's criminal history before deciding whether to release the \ndefendant before trial. Instead, the only consideration is what the \ndefendant is charged with the day of his or her arrest.\n  No matter what the defendant has done before, even, for example, if \nhe or she was previously convicted of murder, if the charge giving rise \nto the arrest is a non-violent crime, the defendant may not be held \npretrial. Moreover, the so-called non-violent crimes include stalking, \ncarjacking, robbery with a baseball bat, burglary, drug dealing, \nvehicular homicide, manslaughter, terroristic threats, and gun charges.\n  As a result Philadelphia, which before the cap had about 18,000 \noutstanding bench warrants, now has almost 50,000. In reality, though, \nno one is out looking for these fugitives. Why look? If they were \nfound, they would just be released back onto the streets under the \nprison cap.\n  In the meantime thousands of defendants who were out on the streets \nbecause of the cap have been rearrested for new crimes, including 79 \nmurders, 959 robberies, 2,215 drug dealing charges, 701 burglaries, \n2,748 thefts, 90 rapes, and 1113 assaults.\n  Looking at the same material from another vantage point: In 1993 and \n1994, over 27,000 new bench warrants for misdemeanor and felony charges \nwere issued for defendants released under the cap. That's 63 percent of \nall new bench warrants in 1993 and 74 percent of all new bench warrants \nfor the first 6 months of 1994.\n  Failure to appear rates for crimes covered by the cap are all around \n70 percent, as opposed to, for example, non-covered crimes like \naggravated assault, where the rate is just 3 percent. The Philadelphia \nfugitive rate for defendants charged with drug dealing is 76 percent, \nthree times the national rate.\n  Over 100 persons in Philadelphia have been killed by criminals set \nfree under the prison cap. Moreover, the citizenry has understandably \nlost confidence in the criminal justice system's ability to protect \nthem. And the criminals, on the other hand, have every reason to \nbelieve that the system can't do anything about them.\n\n  All of this would be bad enough if it were the result of a court \norder to correct serious constitutional violations committed by the \nPhiladelphia corrections system. But it is not.\n  Indeed, a different Federal judge recently found that conditions in \nPhiladelphia's oldest and most decrepit facility--Holmesburg Prison--\nmet constitutional standards.\n  These murderous early releases are the result of a consent decree \nentered into by the prior mayoral administration from which the current \nadministration has been unable to extricate itself.\n  Finally, in addition to massive judicial interventions in State \nprison systems, we also have frivolous inmate litigation brought under \nFederal law; this litigation also ties up enormous resources. Thirty-\nthree States have estimated that Federal inmate suits cost them at \nleast $54.5 million annually. The National Association of Attorneys \nGeneral have extrapolated that number to conclude that nationwide the \ncosts are at least $81.3 million. Since, according to their \ninformation, more than 95 percent of these suits are dismissed without \nthe inmate receiving anything, the vast majority of the $81.3 million \nbeing spent is attributable to non-meritorious cases.\n  Mr. President, in my opinion this is all wrong. People deserve to \nkeep their tax dollars or have them spent on projects they approve. \nThey deserve better than to have their money spent, on keeping \nprisoners in conditions some Federal judge feels are desirable \n(although not required by any provision of the Constitution or any \nlaw). And they certainly don't need it spent on defending against \nfrivolous prisoner lawsuits.\n  And convicted criminals, while they must be accorded their \nconstitution rights, deserve to be punished. I think virtually \neverybody believes that while these people are in jail they should not \nbe tortured, but they also should not have all the rights and \nprivileges the rest of us enjoy, and that their lives should, on the \nwhole, be describable by the old concept known as hard time.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will return sanity and State \ncontrol to our prison systems. It will do so by limiting judicial \nremedies in prison cases and by limiting frivolous prisoner litigation.\n  First, we must curtail interference by the Federal courts themselves \nin the orderly administration of our prisons. This is not to say that \nwe will have no court relief available for prisoner suits, only that we \nwill try to retain it for cases where it is needed while curtailing its \ndestructive use.\n\n[[Page S 14317]]\n\n  Most fundamentally, the proposed bill forbids courts from entering \norders for prospective relief (such as regulating food temperatures) \nunless the order is necessary to correct violations of individual \nplaintiffs' Federal rights.\n  It also requires that the relief be narrowly drawn and be the least \nintrusive means of protecting the federal rights. And it directs courts \nto give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or \nthe operation of the criminal justice system caused by the relief.\n  No longer will prison administration be turned over to Federal judges \nfor the slightest reason. Instead, the States will be able to run \nprisons as they see fit unless there is a constitutional violation, in \nwhich case a narrowly tailored order to correct the violation may be \nentered.\n  The bill also will make it more difficult for judges to release \ndangerous criminals back into the population, or to prevent the \nauthorities from incarcerating them in the first place.\n  To accomplish this, the legislation forbids courts from entering \nrelease orders except under very limited circumstances. The court first \nmust have entered an order for less intrusive relief, which must be \nshown to have failed to cure the violation of Federal rights. If a \nFederal court reaches this conclusion, it must refer the question of \nwhether or not to issue a release order to a three judge district \ncourt.\n  This court must find by clear and convincing evidence that crowding \nis the primary cause of the violation of a Federal right and that no \nother relief will remedy the violation of the Federal right. Then the \ncourt must find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the crowding \nhad deprived particular plaintiffs of at least one essential, \nidentifiable human need, and that prison officials have either \ndeliberately subjected the plaintiffs to this deprivation or have been \ndeliberately indifferent to it.\n  As important, this legislation provides that any prospective relief \norder may be terminated on the motion of either party 2 years after the \nlater of the grant of relief or the enactment of the bill. The court \nshall grant the termination unless it finds that the original \nprerequisites for granting it are present at that time.\n\n  No longer, then, will we have consent decrees, such as those in \nMichigan under which judges control the prisons literally for decades.\n  Finally, the bill contains several measures to reduce frivolous \ninmate litigation. The bill limits attorney's fee awards. In addition, \nprisoners no longer will be reimbursed for attorney's fees unless they \nprove an actual statutory violation.\n  No longer will courts award attorney's fees simply because the prison \nhas changed pre-existing conditions. Only if those conditions violated \na prisoner's rights will fees be awarded.\n  Prisoners who succeed in proving a statutory violation will be \nreimbursed only for fees directly and reasonably incurred in proving \nthat violation.\n  In addition, attorney's fees must be proportionally related to the \ncourt ordered relief. No longer will attorneys be allowed to charge \nmassive amounts to the State for the service of correcting minimal \nviolations.\n  And no longer will attorneys be allowed to charge very high fees for \ntheir time. The fee must be calculated at an hourly rate no higher than \nthat set for court appointed counsel. And up to 25 percent of any \nmonetary award the court orders the plaintiff wins will go toward \npayment of the prisoner's attorney's fees.\n  The bill also prohibits prisoners who have filed three frivolous or \nobviously nonmeritorious in forma pauperis civil actions from filing \nany more unless they are in imminent danger of severe bodily harm.\n  Also, to keep prisoners from using lawsuits as an excuse to get out \nof jail for a time, pretrial hearings generally will be conducted by \ntelephone, so that the prisoner stays in prison.\n  Mr. President, these reforms will decrease the number of frivolous \nclaims filed by prisoners. They will decrease prisoners' incentives to \nfile suits over how bright their lights are. At the same time, they \nwill discourage judges from seeking to take control over our prison \nsystems, and to micromanage them, right down to the brightness of their \nlights.\n  This is a far-reaching bill, Mr. President. One aimed at solving a \ncomplex, costly, and dangerous problem. Its several provisions will \ndiscourage frivolous lawsuits and promote State control over State \nprison systems. At the same time, this legislation will help protect \nconvicted criminals' constitutional rights without releasing them to \nprey on an innocent public or keeping them in conditions so comfortable \nthat they lose their deterrent effect.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1275\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

In determining the intrusiveness of \n     the relief, the court shall give substantial weight to any \n     adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a \n     criminal justice system caused by the relief.\n       ``(2) Preliminary injunctive relief.--In any civil action \n     with respect to prison conditions, to the extent otherwise \n     authorized by law, the court may enter a temporary \n     restraining order or an order for preliminary injunctive \n     relief.

Mr. President, Jason Reese is a remarkable young \nman who is attending the University of Tennessee as a national merit \nscholar. He was named last week as the Boys and Girls Clubs of America \n``Youth of the Year.'' I join all my fellow Tennesseans in saluting \nJason, and wishing him well as he enters college.\n  I ask that an article that appeared in the October 2, 1995, edition \nof U.S. News & World Report be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n           [From the U.S. News & World Report, Oct. 2, 1995]\n\n                    Bootstraps--Trying in Tennessee\n\n                          (By Dorian Friedman)\n\n       As an introverted child from a troubled family, Jason Reese \n     never imagined himself as a role model. So when a young \n     neighbor saw him recently on TV and told him ``he wanted to \n     grow up to be like me, it just about made me cry.'' Jason \n     wasn't alone: There were more than a few teary-eyed admirers \n     in a Capitol Hill audience last week when the Boys & Girls \n     Clubs of America named the 18-year-old its National Youth of \n     the Year.\n       Abandoned by his father as an infant and shuttled between \n     grandparents and a struggling single mother, Jason was raised \n     in ``the projects'' of Morristown, Tenn, a neighborhood where \n     drug dealing and gunfire were not uncommon. A haven where \n     Jason found surrogate fathers and friends was the local Boys \n     & Girls Club. There, he tutored the younger school kids, \n     helped run park cleanups and food drives and pitched in at a \n     nursing home. He also worked at a local auto-parts company, \n     tended to his two little brothers so there mother could \n     finish college and maintained nearly perfect grades in \n     school. He graduated from Morristown High West this year as a \n     National Merit scholar and drew a full scholarship to the \n     University of Tennessee, where he will study biology and \n     chemistry in hopes of becoming a doctor.\n       As Youth of the Year, he voiced a message to other \n     teenagers: ``Stay determined, pursue your dreams and never \n     let anybody tell you that you can't get there.'' That \n     approach was taken long ago by another Boys Club product--\n     originally from a place called Hope--who told Jason and the \n     other finalists how proud he was of them in the Oval \n     Office.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/26/senate-section/article/S14323-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPROVISIONS OF THE FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS BILL PERTAINING TO \n                                 TURKEY\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senate recently adopted two \namendments to the foreign operations appropriations bill which I think \ndeserve further comment.\n  The first of these, an amendment offered by Senator Dole, will \nprohibit U.S. assistance from going to any country that impedes the \ndelivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance. I am a cosponsor of this \namendment, as well as of the original legislation on the subject, the \nHumanitarian Aid Corridors Act, and I believe strongly in the principle \nwhich it reflects. Countries that block our humanitarian efforts should \nnot be receiving our foreign aid. I wish that such legislation were not \nnecessary, but unfortunately the third largest recipient of United \nStates foreign aid, Turkey, continues to prevent the delivery of most \nhumanitarian assistance to neighboring Armenia. We can no longer ignore \nthis situation.\n  After enduring mass slaughter at the hands of the Ottoman Empire, and \nmore than 60 years under the repressive rule of the Soviet Union, \nArmenia has been embroiled since achieving independence 4 years ago in \na bloody dispute with Azerbaijan to its east and has been subjected to \nan economic blockade by Turkey on the west. The United States and the \nrest of the Western community have provided humanitarian aid to help \nreduce the severe shortages of fuel, food, and other essential \nsupplies. Unfortunately, Turkey has maintained a blockade on the most \nefficient land routes, thereby greatly complicating this relief effort.\n  I had hoped that diplomacy alone could ensure the delivery of the \nmuch-needed assistance to Armenia. However, the lack of progress on the \ndiplomatic front and my commitment to ensuring the unrestricted \ndelivery of humanitarian assistance to Armenia--and my commitment to \nthe important principle of permitting unrestricted humanitarian \nassistance to the civilian casualties of any nation--have convinced me \nthat Senator Dole's legislation is necessary. I believe it is the most \neffective avenue to bring pressure to bear on those hindering the \ndelivery of humanitarian assistance to Armenia.\n  The second amendment I wish to discuss also affected Turkey and, had \nit been adopted, would have capped United States economic assistance to \nTurkey at $21 million. I also cosponsored this amendment, offered by \nSenator D'Amato as a way of expressing to our Turkish allies our \nextreme disappointment with their continued intransigence in Cyprus, \ntheir deplorable human rights record in dealing with the Kurdish \ninsurgency in southeastern Turkey, and their continuing land blockade \nof Armenia.\n  I am well aware of the important strategic role that Turkey played \nduring the cold war and of its role in the international coalition \nduring the Persian Gulf war. I appreciate the significant contributions \nTurkey has made to reasonable action and discourse in the Moslem world. \nI would like for Turkey and the United States to be close cooperating \nfriendly allies. I do not relish the idea of taking punitive measures \nagainst a valued NATO ally, but we must look at the relationship across \na spectrum of issues and in many areas Turkey comes up short. The \nTurkish occupation in Cyprus just entered its third decade and there \nseems to be little movement toward a settlement. The United States \nState Department reported that, despite constant urgings from the \nWestern community, human rights abuses in Turkey worsened last year. \nThis behavior is incompatible with Turkey's drive for inclusion in the \nEuropean Union. Because all other means of delivering the message and \nsecuring altered behavior have failed, I agree that we are reduced to \nusing the few remaining vehicles available to deliver our message, a \nreduction of our assistance.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I want Turkey to continue as a trusted \nally, but we cannot let our desire for good relations blind us to \nTurkey's flaws. I am pleased that Senator Dole's amendment was adopted \nand I hope that the Turkish leadership receives the message sent by \nboth amendments--our relationship since the cold war has changed and \nTurkey's strategic location is no longer enough to shield them from the \nbright light of international scrutiny. I also hope that Turkey's \nresponse will not be intransigence and obstinacy, but instead will be \nrecognition that this message comes from a nation and a people that \nvalues our friendship and wants our future relations to be friendly and \ncooperative and will ensure they are friendly and cooperative if Turkey \nwill comport itself in accord with established standards of behavior \nfor sovereign states.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/26/senate-section/article/S14323-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14323-S14324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEMORIAL TO M. SGT. CARL BILLIG\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this morning, the family of \nretired M. Sgt. Carl Billig said their final farewells to this devoted \nhusband, father, and war veteran who passed away on Friday, September \n22, 1995.\n  Sergeant Billig's dying wish was to receive his long-sought military \nawards and medals. After more than a year of trying to track down those \nmedals, they finally arrived 2 days before his death. In a touching \nceremony, Sergeant Billig's family gathered at the home around his bed \nwhere he lie terminally ill with cancer. The family looked on as Maj. \nMartin Harris presented Sergeant Billig with 14 military medals and \nbadges--including the Purple Heart and the Award of Meritorious Service \nin recognition of his 23 years of service spanning World War II through \nthe Vietnam conflict. \n\n[[Page S 14324]]\n\n  In a final act of patriotism, Sergeant Billig mustered all of his \nstrength to return Major Harris' salute. His eyes brightened as he \nrecognized the great honors being paid to him by those gathered about \nhim. Following that salute, his hand dropped to his side, still holding \nit in the salute position and soon his eyes closed, never to open \nagain.\n  Sergeant Billig was discharged from the Army 25 years ago. He had \nbeen actively working to obtain his medals for the last 17 months, but \nto no avail. Letters were answered with form responses that they were \nworking on it. Carl's body wasted and weakened with lung cancer and \nknowing his time was short, he chose to stay at home during his final \ndays. But Carl continued to express his great desire to receive his \nmilitary medals before his death. He told friends and family he wished \nto be buried in full military uniform, complete with all medals and \nribbons.\n  Hospice nurse Lori Olsen Marks overheard him express this dying wish \nand on September 14 contacted my office to see if I could help in any \nway. She sensed the urgency of Carl's wish and said his physicians felt \nthere might only be 3 to 4 weeks left to obtain his honors. My office \nimmediately contacted the U.S. Army. In her typical, caring style, \nMargaret Tyler, Congressional Liaison for the Army, began work on the \nrequest. On September 19, Carl's son Tom called to say it appeared to \nbe only a matter of hours. His father was in great pain and was having \nincreasing difficulty breathing.\n  Another call was made to the Army. Margaret Tyler contacted Gail \nGoers-Wurmb and Vicki Ramoni in Philadelphia and St. Louis. Within the \nhour, these women had obtained all authorizations and worked into the \nnight to locate all of the awards and thoughtfully had Carl Billig's \nname engraved on each medal. An overnight carrier was located, and \nalmost in miracle fashion, the package arrived the next morning in \nIdaho Falls.\n  An awards ceremony was quickly scheduled.
