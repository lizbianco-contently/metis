Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the effort to roll \nback the 4.3-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax that was part of the 1993 \ndeficit reduction package. I seriously question the wisdom of repealing \nthe 4.3-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax at this time.\n  I think it is important to remember how we got this 4.3-cent-per-\ngallon gasoline tax. We got this as a result of the 1993 deficit \nreduction package. It was a time when there was an understanding that \nthere was great urgency to reduce the budget deficit in this country. \nAt that time, when President Clinton came into office, the budget \ndeficit for the previous year had been $290 billion. Since that time, \nafter we passed the 1993 budget plan, the deficit has been reduced to \n$145 billion this year. In other words, the deficit was cut in half. It \nwas cut in half because some of us voted for a package to cut spending \nand, yes, to raise taxes, primarily on the wealthiest among us, in \norder to get our fiscal house in order.\n  Now we have a proposal before us to reduce the gasoline tax by 4.3 \ncents. Most people think it is a political move. Most people think it \nis politically popular. But sometimes what is politically popular, at \nleast for the moment, does not stand much scrutiny. I believe that is \nthe case with this proposal. I just had 40 members of the rural \nelectric cooperatives from my State in my office, and I asked them, \n``What should we do? How would you vote if you were here representing \nNorth Dakota?'' By 38 to 2 they said, ``Keep the gasoline tax and if \nthere is a proposal to offset the revenue lost by repealing the gas \ntax, take those funds and reduce the deficit. That should be the \npriority in this country.''\n  I think those folks from North Dakota have it exactly right. The top \npriority ought to be to continue to reduce the deficit. Yes, it is true \nwe have cut it in half since 1993, but the job is not done, and we \nought to complete that job. We ought to get it done.\n  Some are saying that this 4-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax is the reason \ngas prices have gone up. That defies common sense and it defies logic. \nClearly, a 4-cent gasoline tax put into effect in 1993 has nothing to \ndo with rising gas prices experienced in the spring of 1996. In fact, \nwhen that tax went into effect in October 1993, gas prices went down. \nThey did not go up, they went down.\n  The recent rise in gas prices has been caused by a number of factors \ntotally unrelated to gasoline taxes: an unusually cold and longer than \naverage winter that drove up demand for home heating fuel; refinery \nbreakdowns across the country; more low-mileage sport utility vehicles \nthat are on the road that increase the demand for fuel; the speed limit \nhas been increased, again increasing the demand for fuel; and oil \ncompanies are holding lower than average inventories, moving to just-\nin-time inventory management in order to save money. But even with all \nof that occurring, driving up the price of gasoline in the spring, the \nprice of gasoline is now showing signs of coming down.\n  In my home State of North Dakota, the price for a gallon of regular \nunleaded gasoline in Fargo, ND, the biggest city in my State, is now \nabout $1.25, down about 4 cents in the past 2 weeks.\n  It is not just in North Dakota that we have seen gas prices come \ndown. As this news story from the Los Angeles Times indicates--the \nstory ran last week--a major headline: ``Gas Prices Show Signs of \nDecline as Production Surges.''\n  Los Angeles, CA, we all know, has been the hardest hit by increases \nin gasoline prices.\n\n       Average cost at the pump falls half a cent, and state \n     officials predict more reductions. . . . After lagging, \n     refineries again operating at close to normal output.\n\n  Mr. President, that is what has happened. Gas prices are starting to \ncome down because of market forces.\n  Additionally, the price of gasoline in the United States is very low \nin comparison to other industrialized countries.\n  Saturday's Washington Post included a column comparing gas prices in \nother countries. I thought it was an excellent graphic that compared \nwhat folks are paying in other countries versus what we are paying. It \nis $4.66 a gallon in the Netherlands; $4.49 a gallon in France; $4.39 \nin Italy; $3.68 in Britain; $1.30 in the United States.\n  We have the lowest gas prices of any industrialized country in the \nworld. Now we are talking about taking off 4 cents instead of applying \nit to deficit reduction, deficit reduction that over 7 years amounts to \n$30 billion?\n  I really do not understand why we dig the hole deeper before we start \nfilling it in. The people that I represent believe the highest priority \nis to eliminate these deficits so we can start to see this economy \ngrow.\n  Mr. President, there is also a question of whether this repeal would \never benefit consumers. The whole theory has been if you take off the \n4-cent gasoline tax, that is going to benefit consumers.\n  The Washington Post last week had a headline that says: ``Experts Say \nGas Tax Cut Wouldn't Reach the Pumps. Oil Industry Called Unlikely To \nPass on Savings to Consumers.''\n  Mr. President, these are not my views. These are not views of other \nMembers of the Congress or other Members of the U.S. Senate. These are \nthe views of oil industry experts.\n  I go to one energy expert, Mr. Verleger, who is quoted in the story \nas saying:\n\n       The Republican-sponsored solution to the current fuels \n     problem . . . is nothing more and nothing less than a \n     refiners' benefit bill.\n\n  He makes the point these reductions in the gas tax will not be passed \non to consumers, but the real beneficiaries will be the folks that \nrefine the gasoline. Those are the folks that will get the benefit of \nany repeal of the 4-cent gas tax.\n  The president of the conservative Cato Institute, a former member of \nPresident Reagan's Council of Economic Advisors, said:\n\n       I don't think there is anything the Republicans can \n     credibly do to guarantee that the tax reduction gets passed \n     through to the consumer.\n\n  Mr. President, I think he is right. We have not only had the \ntestimony of those energy experts, but we have heard from the oil \nindustry itself. The CEO of ARCO, Mike Bowlin, said last week:\n\n       There are other market forces that clearly will overwhelm \n     that relatively small decrease in the price of gasoline. . . \n     . People's expectations will be that the minute the tax is \n     removed, they want to see gas prices go down 4.3 cents, and \n     that won't happen.\n\n  Mr. President, what could be more clear? I think these three experts \nhave said it about as clearly as it can be stated. There is no way that \nthis reduction in the gas price can be assured to be passed on to \nconsumers. But what we can be assured of--what we can be assured of--is \nthis is going to blow a $30 billion hole in the plans to reduce the \nbudget deficit in this country.\n  I believe deficit reduction is more important than taking off the 4-\ncent-per-gallon gasoline tax that we have no assurance will be passed \nthrough to consumers anyway. I understand the majority leader has \nprovided offsets to pay for the gas tax repeal, at least for the next \nseveral months.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to offer an amendment that would take his \noffsets and, instead of repealing the gas tax, apply it to reducing the \nbudget deficit that is still $145 billion this year. That is what we \nought to do if we are, instead of playing politics, serious about \nmanaging the fiscal affairs of this country.\n  If we are really serious about helping families, I think we ought to \nlook at the benefit of reducing the deficit in comparison to the \nbenefit of repealing this 4-cent gasoline tax.\n  This chart shows the benefit to a typical family of balancing the \nbudget versus what a typical family would gain from repealing the 4-\ncent-a-gallon gasoline tax, and that is assuming every penny got passed \non to consumers. We already know, from what I have already presented, \nthat that gas tax repeal is unlikely to get passed on to consumers. But \nlet us just look at what\n\n[[Page S4987]]\n\nhappens, what the benefits are of balancing the budget to the average \nfamily versus what the gas tax repeal would do.\n  Balancing the budget, balancing the unified budget, would reduce the \nhome mortgage for a typical family in the United States by $917 a year. \nThat is because interest rates would be reduced; a car loan savings \nwould be $97 a year; student loan savings $56 a year; in comparison to \nwhat the gas tax would mean to a family, $42 a year.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me very clear that the priority ought to \nbe in further reduction of the deficit rather than in a repeal of the \ngas tax, which is unlikely to ever be passed through to consumers. The \nbenefit to consumers, the benefit to families, lies in further deficit \nreduction.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today with America on my mind to \napplaud our favorite Republican Senators and Republican Congressmen who \nhave worked so diligently in trying to present a budget that stays in \nbalance and would balance the budget in 6 years and still would not \nraise taxes.\n  It is interesting that my colleague from North Dakota would also put \nin there that he likes the balanced budget. We would like to see him \nvote for one. Take-home pay, if the budget is balanced, will increase, \npredictability in the marketplace, predictability of jobs. That is what \nworries people today: ``Will I have my job in a year?''\n  Government has to be more responsible when it comes to spending. I \nlook here at this cartoon. ``What are you looking at?'' He says, ``Our \npaychecks!'' He takes a magnifying glass to see it.\n  The Republican budget will balance by the year 2002 and does it by \nliving within its means without raising taxes. This budget provides \nreal welfare reform, real welfare reform that the President and the \nadministration has called for but has vetoed. It provides tax relief \nfor job expansion, predictability in the workplace, and, more \nimportantly, it gets us on the road of saving and preserving Medicare \nfor future generations, of which our colleagues, some of them, have \nstuck their heads in the sand.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BURNS. It looks out for the long term, not just the short term.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BURNS. I would like to make my statement, and then I have a \ncommittee meeting to go to, if the Senator does not mind.\n  Balancing the budget, without raising taxes, and deals also with \nFederal spending. You know, spending money, especially other people's \nmoney, is sort of like alcoholism. A fellow asked, ``Does he have a \ndrinking problem?'' And he says, ``No, he has a stopping problem.'' \nThat is what we have in this Government. But if we deal with the \nspending problem, here is what has to happen. Families have to balance \ntheir budget. Government does not have an income problem. It has a \nspending problem. Mr. President, 38.2 percent of the family's income \nright now goes for taxes. So there is no doubt about it, a balanced \nbudget will put more money in the pockets of Americans, not just a \nselected few, all Americans--single-income taxpayer, double-income \ntaxpayer, newlyweds, farmers, ranchers, high tech, low tech. Everybody \nwins with a balanced budget.\n\n  The best way to increase our take-home pay, not only earn more but \nsave more, to keep more in your pocket at the end of the month--it is \nbetter than any other program--is to go with a balanced budget. I \napplaud my colleagues who have worked so hard on this budget, \npresenting it to this Congress later on this week. I stand in support \nof that budget. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we extend morning \nbusiness so I may be permitted to make a 10-minute presentation that is \naccounted for in the previous order of the Senate.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask if the Senator would be so kind to \nextend that for another 5 minutes so I may have 5 minutes when he \nconcludes his 10-minute presentation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me further amend the unanimous \nconsent, if I might. My colleague, Senator Conrad, had wanted to \nrespond. Let me ask if we might add 2 minutes to respond because the \nprevious speaker spoke of Senator Conrad and refused to yield to him. I \nmake a unanimous-consent request that Senator Conrad be accorded 2 \nminutes. I continue to seek my 10 minutes, and I am happy to \naccommodate the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Not only have I voted for \nbalanced budget plans, I have helped author them, or in some cases \nauthored them in their entirety.

Mr. President, I watched yesterday. We had, I think, six \nof my colleagues from the other side of the aisle come to the floor. We \nhave seen six or seven of them virtually every day come to the floor of \nthe Senate and describe to us what is wrong with the President's agenda \nand what is right about their agenda.\n  Yesterday, specifically, the discussion was about the proposed \nreduction in the gasoline tax of 4.3 cents a gallon. The point was \nrepeatedly made that the gasoline tax was increased in 1993 in order to \naccommodate more Federal spending. That, of course, is not the case. \nThe gas tax increase of 4.3 cents a gallon was a result of it being \nincluded in a very large package of spending cuts and, yes, some tax \nincreases, in order to reduce the Federal budget deficit. It is worth \nnoting that since that time, the Federal budget deficit has been \nreduced by 50 percent on a unified budget basis.\n  Last week, on Thursday, we faced the spectacle at that point of \nhaving a proposal brought to the floor of the Senate to reduce the \ngasoline taxes by 4.3 cents a gallon and to pay for it with kind of a \nByzantine scheme of telecommunications spectrum sales beginning in \n1998, and some other things that the Office of Management and Budget \nsaid would increase the Federal deficit by $1.7 billion next year. In \nother words, a proposal was brought to the floor of the Senate that \nsaid, ``Let's reduce the gasoline taxes by 4.3 cents a gallon.''\n  The experts say there is no guarantee that the consumers will see the \nbenefit of that, or that it will be passed through for a reduced pump \nprice to the consumers. However, we would then see a $1.7 billion \nincrease in Federal deficit in the next year as a result of it.\n  In the very next breath, we are told that there is something wrong \nwith\n\n[[Page S4988]]\n\nothers in the Chamber who do not support a balanced budget. I do not \nknow who those others are, but somehow those who bring a proposal to \nthe floor to increase the Federal budget deficit, even as they repeal \nthe 4.3-cent gasoline tax, are accusing others of not supporting a \nbalanced budget. It is an interesting paradox in political dialogue.\n  I thought it would be useful today, just for a couple of minutes, to \ntalk about some of these proposals more generally. Those who bring the \nproposed cut in the gas tax to the floor of the Senate, I suspect, \nthink it is very popular, and it may be popular for someone to bring a \nbill to the floor to say, ``Let's repeal all taxes. Let's have no one \nany longer be a taxpayer. Let's get rid of all taxpayers.'' But, of \ncourse, we provide for the common defense. That costs some money. We \nbuild roads in this country. We provide for schools. We hire police and \nfirefighters. We do all the things necessary to govern.\n  Then we have people come and say, ``Today is tax freedom day; it is \nthe day beyond which no one ever has to support government again,'' \nsuggesting, somehow, that the taxes that have been paid earlier in the \nyear to invest in Social Security, Medicare, a police department, a \nfire department, or a Defense Department or the Centers for Disease \nControl, somehow none of that mattered, and all of that was squandered \nand wasted.\n  I guess I do not understand some of the logic. But the same people \nwill bring to the floor apparently next week a proposal for a $40 to \n$60 billion national defense plan, a new iteration of star wars. These \nsame people who propose a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution \nthat, by the way, would raid the Social Security trust fund, now say, \n``Let's embark on a new program called national missile defense.'' They \nsay, ``On the little issues, we insist that the Pentagon does not know \nwhat it ought to spend. We demand that the generals and admirals spend \n$12 billion more than they ask for. We insist they buy planes they do \nnot ask for, they buy trucks they do not need, they buy submarines they \ndo not want. We insist they buy all of that because generals and \nadmirals do not know how much they want to spend. We in Congress know \nbetter,'' and then insist they spend $12 billion more than the Pentagon \nhas asked for.\n\n  On top of that, we insist on a new, expensive, gold-plated star wars \nprogram now named ``national missile defense.'' Oh, it is not star \nwars, they say. Oh, yes, it is. The bill suggests that we build space-\nbased lasers. Of course it is star wars. Will it cost a lot of money? \nYou bet your life it will cost a lot of money--$40 to $60 billion. The \ntragedy is this: There is relatively little likelihood of a rogue \nnation getting hold of an ICBM missile in order to put a nuclear tip on \nthe top of it and threaten the United States. There is so little \nlikelihood of that. There is so great a likelihood of some terrorist \nnation, some rogue nation, some band of independent terrorists getting \na nuclear device and putting it in the trunk of a rusty Yugo and \nparking it on a New York City dock, or a glass vial that big with the \ndeadliest biological agents known to mankind to threaten a major \nmetropolitan area, or, yes, even a rental truck with a fertilizer bomb.\n  We understand about terrorism and about the threat to this country. \nThe threat is not a rogue nation having a sophisticated \nintercontinental ballistic missile. It is the threat of terrorists with \ndeadly biological agents and suitcase bombs, including suitcase nuclear \ndevices that will threaten this country. Yet, we are told a national \nmissile defense star wars program is what this country needs.\n  My colleague this morning said the issue is paychecks, the issue is \npaychecks and jobs. I agree with that. There is no social program in \nthis country that has the value of a good job that pays well. That is \none of the reasons I would like to do a number of things. I would like \nto straighten out our trade mess in this country. Our trade deficit is \nunforgivable. We ought not have a $30 billion trade deficit with China \nand then have them, when they need to buy airplanes, tell us, ``You \neither make them in China or we will not buy them from you.'' We ought \nnot have a recurring $60 billion annual trade deficit, a $30 billion \ncombined trade deficit with Mexico and Canada. Jobs leave America.\n  The second point is we ought to have the courage in this Chamber to \nshut off the tax incentive that exists in our tax laws telling firms, \n``Move your jobs overseas and we will give you a tax break.'' I am \nstill waiting for one person to stand up and say, ``I support that \nprovision,'' but we cannot get it repealed.\n  We have a tax incentive to move jobs overseas. Finally, another step \nof paycheck and jobs issues is the minimum wage. Yes, we care about the \nminimum wage. The fact is, a whole lot of folks in this country work \nfor minimum wage and have now been, for 5 years, at the bottom rung of \nthe economic ladder without a 1-cent increase.\n  The last time the minimum wage was increased, on April 1, 1991, the \nstock market was at 2881. It is now almost double that. The minimum \nwage has not moved a cent. But CEO's at the top of the economic ladder \ngot a 23-percent increase in their compensation last year--an average \nof $11,000-a-day compensation for the CEO's at the top of the ladder. \nBut it is $8,800 a year, full-time minimum wage, for the folks at the \nbottom. They have not had an adjustment for 5 years.\n  I say to some, if you do not believe in the minimum wage, bring a \nbill to the floor to try to repeal it. If you believe there ought to be \na minimum wage, then you ought to believe in an adjustment at some \npoint. The question is how much and when. Let us discuss that.\n  If I might, in the last minute, read again a letter I received last \nweek from a young woman who has four children, has had a tough life. \nShe has had setbacks almost every minute, every time they turn around, \nit seems. Their trailer house burns and they lose everything, or there \nare operations or medical problems with the four children. She, in a \nfour-page letter, says:\n\n       How can we make it like this. I wish somebody in an \n     official capacity could be the one to tell my boys they can't \n     play baseball this summer because I can't afford the $25 fee \n     for each of them, let alone the money for bats and gloves \n     they would need. We don't spend our money on alcohol or \n     drugs. We don't go out on the town. Our lives revolve around \n     trying to make ends meet. Our dream of owning a home is long \n     gone. We are better off, I know, than a lot of others who \n     have to live on the street, but how far are we from that? One \n     check maybe?\n       We are in that forgotten group of people called the working \n     poor, the people that fall through the cracks of Government. \n     We want to have something to show for working hard every day \n     instead of slipping further in the hole. We are suffocating, \n     and the future looks dim for us. I beg you shamelessly, for \n     the sake of my children, to please help us find a glimmer of \n     hope to help us dig our way out of this hopelessly grim \n     situation.\n\n  This is from a woman and her husband who work at the minimum wage, \nare unskilled, and have suffered setback after setback and cannot find \na way at the bottom to pull themselves up. They, for 5 years, have had \ntheir wages frozen because there has not been a one-penny adjustment in \nthe minimum wage. During that time, the stock market has doubled. CEO's \nare doing great. They got a 23-percent increase last year alone.\n  The folks at the bottom deserve some kind of adjustment. They are the \nvoiceless that we ought to give a voice to. They are the hopeless that \nwe ought to offer hope to, as we work in the U.S. Senate, and say we \ncare about you and we are going to try to do something to offer some \nhelp to those on the bottom rung of the economic ladder. I hope we can \ndo that together in a bipartisan way in this Chamber in the coming \nweeks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to make the basic \nand simple point that numbers do not lie. I am chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee. I have been very \nmuch concerned about making sure that the people who serve this country \nin the military get the kind of care that has been promised by the \nVeterans' Administration.\n  The VA deals, primarily, with those who have suffered war-related \ninjuries, and who are medically indigent now. Yes, there are \nefficiencies that can be\n\n[[Page S4989]]\n\nmade and there are certain steps being taken within the VA to operate \nmore soundly. But I was shocked when I saw the President's proposal for \nVeterans' Administration spending for the next 6 years.\n  The President now says he wants to balance the budget. But how does \nhe do it? Well, Mr. President, he takes it out of the vitally important \nmedical care and health care services for the veterans. I joined with \nChairman Pete Domenici to beat back efforts by our Democratic \ncolleagues in the subcommittee to substitute the President's budget, \nwhich he claims gets us to balance. I thought it was so serious that I \nwanted to speak on the floor. I spoke this weekend back home in \nMissouri, talking about the tremendous decline that the Clinton budget \nproposes for Veterans' Administration spending over the next 6 years, \nwhich is almost 23 percent.\n  Mr. President, the Veterans' Administration cannot live with that \nkind of cut. That is the kind of cut that the President proposes the VA \nwill have to follow to get to a balanced budget for the entire \nGovernment in the year 2002. At least the President agrees that we need \nto get to a balanced budget. But does he really mean this budget?\n  Well, Mr. President, it was very interesting to me to read in the \nnewspaper on Saturday morning--in the St. Louis newspaper--a report by \npolitical correspondent, Jo Mannies, who called the White House after I \npresented this information and she says: ``A White House aide replied \nthat Bond was misrepresenting the facts.''\n  Misrepresenting the facts? Mr. President, here are the facts. Under \nthe Clinton budget, the Veterans' Administration have a budget \nauthority that goes from $17.3 billion in 1997, to $15.9 billion in \n1998, to $14.5 billion, to $13.0 billion, to $13.29 billion, to $13.8 \nbillion. That comes out to be a $12.979 billion cut in Veterans' \nAdministration funding in that 6-year period.\n\n  Can the VA live with that? No. Secretary Jesse Brown said, when I \nasked him before the Appropriations Committee, ``Are you planning to \nlive within this budget?'' He said, ``I am not planning to live with \nit. I am not planning to live with your budget to green line''--which \nat that time was a flat line--``nor am I planning to live with the \nPresident's line.'' Secretary Brown went on to say, ``I think his \nbudget means something to me because he has given his word that he is \ngoing to negotiate with the veterans' community.''\n  Really? Does the President not mean what he said when he presented \nthe balanced budget that shows these cuts? The interesting part of the \nstory, the White House aide Jo Mannies referred to was Lawrence Haas of \nthe White House Office of Management and Budget. He said the \nRepublicans were misrepresenting their plans and the President when it \ncomes to spending for veterans.\n  President Clinton's 1997 budget plan contains an outline for reaching \na balanced budget by 2002. ``The outline cites across-the-board \nspending cuts of equal percentages for most discretionary programs, \nincluding the VA,'' he said. ``The outline is not a hard and fast \nproposal for any of the programs,'' he said, ``because the President \nand the Congress review discretionary programs each year.'' He said \nthat he expected changes for many of the specific programs. He said, \n``If past practices continue, the VA would be treated well and wouldn't \nexperience much, if any, of a cut.''\n  Mr. President, we have the President presenting a budget showing that \nhe gets to balance by making a 23-percent cut in the Veterans \nAdministration. Oh, incidentally, it is not an across-the-board cut \nbecause the President, at the same time, proposes a 28-percent increase \nin the spending on AmeriCorps, our national service.\n  Mr. President, we are left with the amazing proposition that the \nWhite House official spokesperson said that it is the official policy \nof the Clinton administration that you should not believe the official \npolicy of the Clinton administration. The Clinton administration sent \nup a budget that shows a 23-percent cut, a $12.9 billion cut over 6 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, that is how they get there--a budget that I think has \nmisplaced priorities. It does not make the cuts needed in Medicaid and \nin welfare spending, so they have to slash things like Veterans' \nAdministration. Either they mean this and they are going to get to a \nbalanced budget and the veterans are going to be unhappy, but they have \nan Office of Management and Budget saying they do not mean it. They \nhave told the Secretary of Veterans Affairs they do not mean it.\n  So, Mr. President, we are left with this real question: Which numbers \nare lying--the numbers they presented in the budget, or the numbers \nthey are telling the Veterans' Administration they are going to get?\n  I intend to work with my colleagues to make sure that the Veterans' \nAdministration is adequately funded.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S4988-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. W. JAMES RIVERS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, it is no secret that a career dedicated \nto the service of others is a calling that garners minimal financial \nreward and often little recognition. Individuals will labor their whole \nlives working to make the world a slightly better place, only to \nreceive few, if any, accolades or commendations. Today, I want to take \nthis opportunity to recognize one person who has dedicated his life to \nGod and his fellow man, Dr. W. James Rivers, and whose commitment to \nboth has made South Carolina a better place to live.\n  Dr. Rivers' calling to the ministry did not come until he was in his \nthirties, but he knew early on that he wanted to dedicate his life to \nserving others. Upon his graduation from the University of South \nCarolina, he earned a commission in the United States Air Force and \nfound himself on the Korean Peninsula, where the United States and the \nUnited Nations were waging a war against the expansionist Communists of \nNorth Korea and China. The fighting in this conflict was brutal and it \nwas not long before the young officer was in the thick of it, and \nduring his time in Korea, he flew 50 combat missions against our \nenemies. When a cease-fire agreement was finally reached, and the \nshooting finally stopped, James Rivers decided to remain in the Air \nForce and climbed to the rank of captain; however, in 1958, he heard \nthe Lord's call, resigned his commission, and began the process of \nbecoming a minister.\n  After returning to school, Dr. Rivers began his second career of \nservice, this time to God, which began with a 4-year stint ministering \nat Dutch Fork Baptist Church. In 1967, Dr. Rivers moved from Columbia, \nSC, to my hometown of Aiken, where he became the pastor of Millbrook \nBaptist Church. For the past 29 years, he has ministered to the needs \nof his flock with great compassion, and has proven to be an effective \nleader for his church, performing more than 1,400 baptisms, and more \nthan 1,000 marriages. Additionally, under his direction, Millbrook \nBaptist Church has more than trebled in size, added both a Christian \nActivities Center and educational building, and has established three \nmission churches in other States. It takes a man of great spirit, \nability, and energy to accomplish such impressive tasks.\n\n  Mr. President, Dr. W. James Rivers will be retiring from his career \nas a minister on May 19, and in recognition of his many years of \nselfless service, the mayor of Aiken has set aside that Sunday as Jim \nRivers Day. I am pleased to join my fellow Aikenites and South \nCarolinians in recognizing and thanking Dr. W. James Rivers for all his \ncontributions to our State. We are grateful for all his hard work and \nproud to claim him as a leader of our community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S4989-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to talk today about repealing the \ngasoline tax, and I want to talk about it from two angles:\n  No. 1, the gasoline tax we adopted in 1993, where the money went to \ngeneral revenue, was an unfair and discriminatory tax that should be \nrepealed.\n  No. 2, I want to talk briefly about gasoline prices, something that \nall of Washington talks about but no one actually does anything about. \nBy passing the pending amendment, by repealing the 4.3-cent-a-gallon \ntax on gasoline, we can bring the price of gasoline down by about $1 a \ntank whenever you fill up your car, your truck, or your van.\n  Historically, Government has understood that gasoline taxes are \ninherently discriminatory since the level of gasoline usage varies \ngreatly depending on where you live. The average resident of a State \nlike Texas spends almost twice as much money on gasoline as the average \nresident of a State like New York. People who live in rural areas, by \nthe very nature of their living in rural areas, travel great distances \nand use a lot of gasoline and diesel in their cars and trucks. As a \nresult, government has concluded that taxing gasoline as a source of \ngeneral revenue is inherently discriminatory. It discriminates against \npeople who live in rural areas as compared to urban areas, it \ndiscriminates against people who have to travel great distances to \nwork, and it discriminates against people who live in the Western part \nof the country where you have more open spaces and people generally \ndrive more.\n  To try to deal with the inherently unfair nature of a gasoline tax as \na source of general revenue, what we have normally done is to dedicate \nthe gasoline tax to pay for roads and bridges. Since the 1950's, it has \nin essence become a user fee: the people who use the roads the most pay \nthe most gasoline taxes, and they are the largest beneficiaries.\n  Before we adopted the Clinton gas tax, we had never, since we started \nthe highway trust fund, imposed a permanent gasoline tax that was not \ndedicated to highway building. The Clinton gas tax is unique in that it \nis a permanent tax on gasoline where the money goes not to road \nbuilding, so that the people who are paying the taxes are the principal \nbeneficiaries, but instead goes to the general revenue. In fact, if you \nlook at the Clinton budget since 1993, you will see that the money \nbasically goes to social programs and social welfare. In 1993, through \nthe Clinton gasoline tax, we imposed a new general tax on gasoline--\npaid for by people who have to drive their cars and their trucks great \ndistances to earn a living--in order to pay for benefits going to \npeople who by and large do not work.\n  We, therefore, created through this gasoline tax an incredible \nredistribution of income and wealth--the Clinton gasoline tax imposed a \nnew burden on people who drive to work for a living in order to \nsubsidize people who by and large do not go to work.\n  We have an opportunity in the pending amendment to solve this problem \nby repealing this gasoline tax thereby eliminating this burden on \npeople that have to drive their cars and trucks great distances to earn \na living. In my State, it is not uncommon for someone to live 40 miles \nfrom where they work and, as a result, a gasoline tax imposes a very \nheavy burden on them.\n  We have an opportunity to eliminate that inequity by repealing the \n4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline, a permanent gas tax that, for the \nfirst time ever, went into general revenues to fund social programs \ninstead of paying for highway construction.\n  Now, everybody is talking about rising gasoline prices--the President \nhas asked for an investigation by the Justice Department and we are \nholding hearings all over Capitol Hill. Yet, we all know one thing for \ncertain: if we really want to lower the price of gasoline this week, \nthere is only one thing that we can do--repeal the Clinton gasoline \ntax.\n\n  If we repeal the gasoline tax today in the Senate, if the House \npassed it tomorrow, and if the President signed it on Thursday, on \nFriday morning every filling station in America would lower their \nposted price by 4.3 cents a gallon and everybody in America who fills \nup their car, their truck, or their van with gasoline would save about \n$1 a tank. This is something that we can do, it is something that we \nhave the power to do, but the question is: Do we have the will to do \nit?\n  I would like to remind my colleagues, and I would like to remind \nanybody who is listening, that I offered the amendment to repeal the \nClinton gasoline tax 19 days ago. My effort to offer that amendment was \nstopped by the Democratic leadership in the Senate who decided not to \nallow this amendment to come up for a vote.\n  The President now says he would sign the bill repealing his gasoline \ntax and our Democratic colleagues in the Senate say that they too are \nfor it. My guess is, if we had a vote today, 80 Members of the Senate \nwould vote to repeal this gasoline tax. Yet, for 19 days we have denied \nlower gas prices to the American people. We have denied the equity that \nwould come from repealing this gasoline tax which, for the first time \nsince the creation of the highway trust fund, taxes people who drive \ntheir cars and trucks to work in order to subsidize welfare for people \nwho do not work. For 19 days, despite the fact that almost everybody \nagrees this is something we should do, we have not done it.\n  Unless some kind of an agreement is worked out, at 2:15 p.m. today we \nare going to vote on breaking the Democratic filibuster of the gasoline \ntax repeal amendment.\n  If you want to repeal the gasoline tax, then you should vote to end \ndebate and let us have a vote on actually repealing the gasoline tax.\n  I hope the American people will make note of how individual Senators \nvote, and will remember that people who want to repeal the gasoline tax \nare going to vote to end the debate. After 19 days of stalling, after \n19 days of perpetuating an inequitable tax, after 19 days of \nartificially holding up gasoline prices, I hope our Democratic \ncolleagues in the Senate are ready to let this Senate do its will.\n  I believe the Senate is ready to repeal the gasoline tax and I am \nconfident that we will vote to repeal it if the Democrats will just let \nus. After 19 days of the Democrats stalling, I am ready to vote, and I \nam sure the American people are also ready for us to vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Some of the things \nthat Senators are saying about the gas tax are being perceived as \ngrandstanding positions in my state of California. The people of \nCalifornia know, because the experts in the industry have told them, \nthat they may never see the effect of the tax repeal. As Senator Conrad \nhas stated, the experts believe the benefit will go to the refiners. \nWhat could happen is that we would lose $30 billion from deficit \nreduction.\n\n  It seems to me most people understand this. I think it is really \nimportant to find out the causes of this runup in prices. I have \nwritten to Hazel O'Leary and asked her to undertake an investigation. \nThe President acted to sell some of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in \nan effort to add to the supply. There was an article in the Los\n\n[[Page S4991]]\n\nAngeles Times that traced the increase in prices, and it concluded that \nprices kept rising regardless of inventories.\n  So I think the American people are a lot smarter than some would \nbelieve in this Senate. I think they understand that repealing this 4-\ncent tax has could result in huge deficit increases. I think they \nunderstand that the gas price runup has many causes. Repealing the 4-\ncent tax does not guarantee that the people will see any benefit.\n  What is interesting to me is the way my Republican friends want to \npay for this repeal. It seems it has seen various proposals come \nforward. The first one was the majority leader on the other side, Dick \nArmey, who suggested we cut education to pay for this gas tax repeal. \nThank goodness that proposal was shot down. It seems to me unbelievable \nto cut back in education when we know that the future of our Nation \ndepends upon how well our children are educated and that the best jobs \ngo to the best educated. So that Republican idea seems to be buried.\n  Then we were going to sell broadcast spectrum, but then they found \nout that any income generated by the auction would not be seen for many \nyears.\n  And now there is a proposal to place a charge on banks and savings \ninstitutions, to better prepare them in case there is another crisis in \nsavings and loans and bank failures.\n  So I think every plan that I have seen is quite wanting. There are a \nlot of tax loopholes out there I would like to see closed. Let us look \nat some of those.\n  So I think as we get to this vote on the gas tax it is going to be \ninteresting to hear the debate. What is the most important thing for \nthe country, a repeal of a 4-cent tax that may never see its way to the \nconsumers pockets?\n  I would love to be able to guarantee that it would go to the \nconsumers' pockets. It would be an interesting proposal to try to work \non something like that. But let us hear the debate.\n  It is a very important issue, I think in many ways symbolic of \nwhether our actions match our rhetoric around here. So I am looking \nforward to the debate.\n  Mr. President, I also heard that the Senator from Missouri was \nattacking the President on funding for veterans, and I find that very, \nvery interesting since the President vetoed the appropriations bill \nthat included veterans' funding because of unwise policy riders \ninserted by the Congress. Also, the President felt this Congress was \nnot being fair to veterans because it cut hospital programs promised by \nprevious administrations. I have a case in point in my own State where \nwe are supposed to build a veterans hospital at Travis Air Force Base \nand this Republican Congress deleted those funds. The President has it \nin his budget.\n  I would be happy to join with the Senator from Missouri to make sure \nour veterans are taken care of. I would love to start with the hospital \nat Travis, which the veterans need to have and the President has \nsupported.\n  So I find it interesting that colleagues from the other side come \ndown and blast the President for not supporting this country and not \npresenting a budget that meets this country's needs when, in fact, if \nyou look at the President's budget versus the budget of the Republicans \nthat just got through the Budget Committee on which I serve, what you \nsee very clearly is that the Republicans go after Medicare; they go \nafter Medicaid; they go after the earned income tax credit, resulting \nin a tax increase on the working middle income and poor; and that the \nDemocrats, behind this President, are willing to make investments, \ninvestments in education, investments in the environment, investments \nin medical research and in advanced technology research. That is what \nthe future is about. So I look forward to all these debates and I hope \nwe will have them soon.\n  At this time I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the bill before us has amendments which \nhave been debated involving a great number of very important issues \nincluding issues relative to the gas tax repeal, minimum wage, and the \nso-called TEAM bill. The fact that those are much more public issues \nand have been the subject of much greater public debate has caused many \nto overlook the substance of the underlying bill to reimburse the \nattorney fees of former Travel Office employees.\n  There have been some comments made on the floor that the underlying \nbill, H.R. 2937, is an important bill because it is fair, right, and \nremedial. Some have said it is noncontroversial. Then the debate moves \non to the more publicly debated issues--the gas tax, the minimum wage, \nand the TEAM Act, which have had greater public notice. Then little is \nsaid further about the Travel Office bill.\n  I have questions about the implications of what we would be doing if \nwe passed this Travel Office bill. As best as I can determine, if we \npass this bill, it would be the first time in our history that we will \nhave passed legislation to pay the attorney fees of someone who has \nbeen indicted. In order to be indicted, a grand jury has to determine \nthat there is probable cause that the person committed the alleged \ncrime. It is a system that we use thousands of times a year across this \ncountry. In order to be indicted, a prosecutor must present evidence to \na grand jury to show that there is probable cause that a crime has been \ncommitted and that the person at issue is the one who committed the \ncrime. That is what has happened in the case, or what did happen in the \ncase of Billy Dale. The grand jury determined that there was probable \ncause that he committed a crime against the United States and that he \nshould stand trial.\n  Once a person is indicted, the prosecutor must meet a higher standard \nof proof--proof beyond a reasonable doubt the indicted individual \ncommitted the crime. That is the way the system works. Then it goes to \na trial. A judge is usually presented with a motion for a directed \nverdict, or might be presented with a motion for a directed verdict, \narguing that there is insufficient evidence before the court to permit \na reasonable juror to find that person is guilty of the crime beyond a \nreasonable doubt. It is my understanding that there was a motion for a \ndirected verdict in Billy Dale's case and that the judge denied the \nmotion for a directed verdict.\n\n  With this legislation, what we are then doing is taking the \nunprecedented step of saying that in this case we believe that the \nprosecutor who presented a case to a grand jury and the judge who \ndenied a motion for a directed verdict was so wrong that the taxpayers \nshould pay Billy Dale's attorney fees. If we do that in this case, \nthere is no reason why we will not be asked to do that in hundreds of \nother cases.\n  What is the precedent that we are setting for evaluating whether or \nnot we should be paying attorney fees in cases where persons are \nindicted and whose cases go to a jury? In other words, where there is a \nmotion for a directed verdict which is denied and who are then \nacquitted.\n  We have not had 1 hour of hearings in the Senate on this bill. There \nis no Senate committee report on this bill. The committee report that \nis before us is a House committee report which does not even discuss \nthe nature of the indictment, the facts surrounding the indictment, nor \nthe basis for it. It just ignores some very critical facts.\n  There are about 5,000 Federal criminal defendants each year who are \neither acquitted or have their cases dismissed after indictment. Do we \nwant to open ourselves to the possibility of reviewing each and every \none of those cases to decide whether or not the grand jury and the U.S. \nattorney acted properly, and whether a judge was correct in denying the \nmotion for a directed verdict? Are we going to set up a special \nsubcommittee of the Judiciary Committee to consider attorney fees for \nindicted but acquitted individuals? Will we have some criteria to guide \nus in the future?\n  I do not want to get into a litany of the recent acquittals that \nwould make many of us blush in equating them with unfair prosecution. \nBut the fact that somebody is acquitted does not mean that a \nprosecution was unfair.\n  Some may argue, ``Well, here the acquittal came in a matter of a few\n\n[[Page S4992]]\n\nhours, and that confirms the unfairness of the situation.'' Is that the \nstandard--quick acquittals? Are we then going to subject the Treasury \nof the United States to claims for attorney fees?\n  For the past 15 years or so, I, along with Senator Cohen, have been \nsponsoring reauthorizations of the independent counsel law. That law \nhas a provision in it for payment of attorney fees for persons who are \ninvestigated. But it has a very clear and explicit condition--in fact, \na couple of them.\n  First, the attorney fees would be paid only if they would have been \nincurred but for the use of the independent counsel.\n  Second, they will not be paid to any person who has been indicted. It \nis explicit in the independent counsel law. Attorney fees are not \navailable to persons who have been indicted by the independent counsel.\n  When we added that provision in 1982, there was no question by any \nwitness at our hearing or any advocate for the statute about paying \nattorney fees for indicted individuals, and yet in this bill, this \nunderlying bill, we are crossing a very significant line. We are \ntalking about using taxpayer dollars to do it. To the best of our \ninformation, it is the first time it will be done, and it is being done \nwithout a Senate hearing or a Senate committee report laying forth \ncriteria as to what will be the future standards.\n  Some people say, well, this bill is just for a half-million dollars. \nWe closed down an agency of the Government last year that had a total \nbudget of $1.2 million. That was the Administrative Conference of the \nUnited States. We said we could not afford the $1.2 million for that \nagency. So we cannot treat this expenditure as if it does not matter. \nIt does.\n  And also problematical is the fact that there is no requirement that \nthe taxpayer pay only reasonable attorney fees. For instance, if the \ncitizen Billy Dale here paid $500 an hour for his attorney, should we \nbe reimbursing him at that rate? I cannot support that. But the bill is \nsilent in terms of reasonableness of attorney fees. We have limits on \nattorney fees in all the other statutes that I know about. In the \nindependent counsel law we require that the court determine that the \nfees paid to eligible persons be reasonable and market rate.\n  And by the way, as I mentioned before, the independent counsel law \ndoes not permit an attorney fee to be paid to someone who has been \nindicted. But where the attorney fee is permitted there is a \nrequirement that the attorney fee be reasonable and market rate. That \nrequirement is not present here. In the Equal Access to Justice Act we \nlimit the amount paid to an attorney to $150 an hour, and that act \napplies where a court determines that a government's civil case against \na small business had no substantial justification. There is no \nrequirement like that in this bill. I think that is a disservice to the \nAmerican taxpayers as well.\n  In addition, there is no ceiling in this bill on the overall total. \nIf Mr. Dale's attorneys are going to say that they worked 100 hours, we \nare going to presumably sock the taxpayers for 100 hours even though \nthere has been no judgment as to whether or not the 100 hours was an \nappropriate length of time, and maybe it only should have been 50 \nhours.\n  In an earlier bill that was introduced, Senator Hatch did have a \nceiling on the amount the taxpayers would have to pay. But the bill \nbefore us does not do that. There is no ceiling. It is unlimited. So \nlet us look again at what the underlying bill does. First, it \nauthorizes the use of taxpayer dollars to reimburse the legal expenses \nof an individual indicted for the commission of a Federal crime.\n  Congress has never, to the best of my knowledge, authorized that type \nof payment. Second, the bill authorizes the payment of all legal \nexpenses incurred without any requirement that the expenses were \nnecessary, appropriate or reasonable in amount. The bill does not place \na ceiling on the amount of money that may be paid. It creates an open-\nended entitlement.\n  So even though the amount may seem small, we are opening a wide door \nhere to the Federal Treasury and we should take more care before we are \ndoing so.\n  At this point, I would make a parliamentary inquiry of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state the inquiry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask the Chair whether or not the bill before us is a \nprivate bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is a private bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate is at a regrettable impasse. For \nseveral weeks now, Democrats have been trying to bring an increase in \nthe minimum wage to a vote on the Senate floor. We were repeatedly \nblocked by parliamentary maneuvers. The majority insisted on lumping a \nnumber of unrelated matters together and resisted the right of the \nminority to offer any amendments to any of matters involved. This is a \nvery unfortunate circumstance. We should deal with each of these \nmatters, the minimum wage increase, the TEAM Act, the proposed repeal \nof the gasoline tax, and the matter related to the White House Travel \nOffice separately, debate them, amend them according to the will of the \nSenate, and then pass or defeat each. Instead, in an effort to score \npolitical points in a contest with the President, the majority has used \nparliamentary rules to produce distorted results. First, four different \nbills were bundled together in one, and if the effort to shut off \ndebate had succeeded, with no ability to amend except very narrowly. \nFor example, it might have proven impossible to offer an amendment to \nthe gas tax repeal provision to try to assure that the benefit goes to \nthe consumer and not to the oil companies. It might also have proven \nimpossible to amend the provision to attempt to assure that the repeal \nis adequately paid for and does not increase the federal deficit. Now, \nwe face yet another amendment without the ability to amend it and yet \nanother effort to cut off debate.\n  The minimum wage issue is straightforward. It's about whether or not \nwe are truly committed to helping working people earn a living wage. \nRecently, we have begun to hear more concern expressed about jobs and \nwages for the working family in America. Some have newly discovered the \nproblems that working families face today: The declining purchasing \npower of their wages, increasing health care costs, and the high cost \nof child care are among those most important. But, for some of us, and \nfor the American people, these are not new issues.\n  The last time we gave minimum wage workers a raise was 5 years ago \nApril 1. The current minimum wage is $4.25. In the last 5 years, \nbecause of inflation, the buying power of that wage has fallen 50 cents \nand is now 29 percent lower than it was in 1979--17 years ago.\n  With this amendment, the hourly minimum wage would rise to $4.70 this \nyear, and to $5.15 next year. Close to 12 million American workers \nwould take a step forward toward a more equitable living wage.\n  Remarkably, there are some in this Congress who not only oppose an \nincrease to a fair level: Some would eliminate the minimum wage \ncompletely. But, I thing that they comprise a tiny extreme minority. \nThe last increase had overwhelming bipartisan support. On November 8, \n1989, the Senate passed the increase by a vote of 89 to 8. Supporting \nthat increase were the current GOP and Democratic leaders. In the \nHouse, this bill passed by a vote of 382 to 37. Voting ``yes'' were the \ncurrent Speaker of the House and the Democratic leader. And, the bill \nwas signed into law by President George Bush.\n  Discounting inflation, a Rand study shows that the median income of \nfamilies fell more then $2,700 over 4 years to about $27,000 in 1993. \nBut people at the lower rungs of the economic ladder have it the worst.\n  Rand's researchers found that between 1989 and 1993, the top fifth of \nthe economic spectrum earned nearly 10 times what those in the bottom \nfifth earned. The gap between the top and the bottom is very wide--and \ngetting wider.\n  These figures illustrate that although our economy is growing and \nunemployment is relatively low, working families are confronting \ndifficult and uncertain times. This amendment would provide a modest \nboost in earnings for many of these households.\n  A higher minimum wage could help reverse the growing wage inequality\n\n[[Page S4993]]\n\nthat has occurred since the 1970's especially among women.\n  While some claim a moderate increase in the minimum wage will cost \njobs, leading economists find little evidence of loss of employment. \nInstead, they find that a ripple effect could expand the impact beyond \nthe immediate minimum wage work force. Some workers in low-wage jobs \nwho currently earn more than the minimum wage may see an increase in \ntheir earnings as minimum wages rise.\n  As the richest nation on Earth, our minimum wage should be a living \nwage. But it isn't close. When a father or mother works full-time, 40 \nhours a week, year-round, they should be able to lift their family out \nof poverty.\n  The current minimum wage is actually about $2 an hour less than what \na family of four needs to live above the poverty line. At $4.25 an \nhour, you earn $680 a month, gross. That is $8,160 per year.\n  Adults who support their families would be the prime beneficiaries of \nour proposal to raise the minimum wage. Nearly two-thirds of minimum \nwage earners are adults and more than one-third are the sole \nbreadwinners. Nearly 60 percent of the full-time minimum wage earners \nare women. Often these are women bringing home the family's only \npaycheck.\n  In 32 States over 10 percent of the work force would benefit directly \nfrom an increase in the minimum wage. In Michigan, 324,000 workers, \nalmost 12 percent of the work force are making the minimum wage. Some \n435,000 workers earn less than $5.15 per hour.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is work should pay, and the current \nminimum wage is not enough to live on. The minimum wage is a floor \nbeneath which no one should fall. But we should make sure that standing \non the floor, a person can reach the table. A full-time minimum wage \njob should provide a minimum standard of living in addition to giving \nworkers the dignity that comes with a paycheck. Hard-working Americans \ndeserve a fair deal.\n  Mr. President, it is ironic that many who are the strongest line-item \nveto proponents and who, last year, indeed were proposing a version of \nline-item veto which would have caused bills to be carved up into \nhundreds of separate bills for the President's signature or veto, now \nare trying to do the reverse. They are taking clearly unrelated matters \nand lumping them together while blocking important relevant amendments. \nWe need to get on with the business of the Nation. We should address \nthe gas tax proposal, the minimum wage increase, and the other matters \nbefore the Senate in separate bills, allow Senators to propose their \namendments, debate the issues, vote, and send legislation to the \nPresident for his signature or veto. The only reason this is being \nwrapped up in one big package and hamstrung it with parliamentary \nentanglements, is Presidential politics. I predict it will not benefit \nthose who concocted the strategy. Our Nation deserves better.\n  Mr. President, I did want to spend a few minutes this morning \npointing out some of the difficulties that I think will be created if \nwe pass this underlying bill without criteria being established, \nwithout a Senate committee report, without a requirement that fees be \nreasonable, without a limit on the amount of the authorization here, \nthe obligation of the Federal Treasury. There are some precedents that \nare being set here if we pass this bill as is, which should not be set \nwithout further deliberation by the Senate because of the implications \nto the Treasury of thousands of people who have been indicted who are \neither then acquitted or whose cases are dismissed who might also be \nable to make claims under the precedent that could arguably be set by \nthis bill.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, even though we are in morning business, \nI want to address the issue that was on the floor prior to the vote \nthat we just had. That vote on cloture was our attempt, on the majority \nside, to stop a filibuster and to get to a vote on reducing the \ngasoline tax by 4.3 cents.\n  Once again we have run up against the minority's unwillingness to \nallow us to have a vote on President Clinton's gas tax. We know it \nwould pass overwhelmingly. The President has already said he would sign \nit. It seems to me it is something we ought to do.\n  We had 54 votes--I think that is 53 Republicans and one Democrat \nvote--to stop debate so we could get to a vote on final passage. We \nwould have more than 51 votes to pass it. So it would pass, but we \nneeded six more votes from the Democratic side to make cloture happen. \nWe did not get them. So we are at a standstill here on this piece of \nlegislation. It is needlessly being held up, and those holding it up \nare needlessly causing the taxpayers of this country, those people who \ndrive cars, to pay more tax while the price of gasoline continues at a \nvery high level. Consequently, I hope we can bring the repeal of \nPresident Clinton's gas tax to a vote. I particularly would like to \nrepeal it because the repeal is something that can be passed very \nquickly. We know that this is true because it is something that the \nPresident said he would sign.\n  We Republicans strongly feel that President Clinton's gas tax should \nbe repealed because we, en bloc, voted against President Clinton's tax \nbill of 1993. We knew it was the biggest tax hike in the history of the \ncountry, and we felt it would do harm to the economy. We are finding \nout that it is doing harm to the economy. Even though we have had a \nrecovery, we could have created 3 million more jobs in this recovery, \ncompared to other recoveries, had President Clinton not increased \ntaxes. These are jobs that are not being created because of the damper \non the economy that the biggest tax increase in the history of the \ncountry has given us, of which the 4-cent gas tax increase was a major \npart.\n  I thank the majority leader for calling this bill up that repeals the \nClinton gas tax, and for his bringing it to the immediate attention of \nthe Senate.\n  If I can begin by way of conclusion, I believe the Senate should join \nthe House Committee on Ways and Means in passing a swift repeal of the \nClinton gas tax increase of 1993. In 1993 the Committee on Ways and \nMeans, then controlled by Democrats, estimated what this bill would \ncost the drivers of the various States. They figured what they think it \nwould cost my Iowans, based on the assumption that Iowans drive 12,396 \nmiles per year. I think that this estimate is probably a number that is \nsmaller than what Iowans truly drive. I do not think these estimates by \nthe economists for the Ways and Means Committee include the fact that \nfarmers and many other people in rural America have to drive long \ndistances, not only for their business, but also to get their kids to \nschool and back home every day and all the other things associated with \na family. I think the 12,396 miles that was estimated by the Committee \non Ways and Means in 1993 is probably too small.\n  Nonetheless, the Committee went on to say that if you take that \n12,396 miles that Iowans would drive on average per automobile, and \nmultiply that times the Clinton gasoline tax increase of 4.3 cents, it \nis going to cost Iowans an extra $26.66 per year to drive a car. That \nis assuming a one-driver family. Most families are two-driver families \nand then would expend twice that amount of money at $53.32.\n  I think families with children have better use for their $53.32 fuel \ntax expense than funding the President's big spending habits that were \npart of his 1993 budget and tax increase. For example, $53.32 for the \naverage family would buy any of the following items in a typical Iowa \nfarm town: 24 gallons of milk at $2.15 a gallon, 67 pounds of apples at \n79 cents a pound, 71 cans of tomato soup at 75 cents a can, 14 boxes of \nbreakfast cereal at $3.69 a box, 44 dozen eggs at $1.19 a dozen, 53 \nloaves of bread at 99 cents a loaf, 60 pounds of hot dogs at 89 cents a \npound, and 106 boxes of macaroni and cheese at 50 cents a box.\n  Alternately, if a family wants to have summer activity for children, \n$53.32 will buy either three unlimited summer children's passes at the \nswimming pool or two activity fees for the youth little league baseball \nprogram.\n  These are real opportunity costs affecting real families in my State \nbecause we have this gas tax increase that has been a damper on the \neconomy and families. Because Iowa families have been paying the \nClinton fuel tax for all of 1993 and all of 1994, you must readily see \nthat President Clinton has denied these families some of these \nnecessities. He has done so, not only once, but he has done it twice.\n  Now, in 1996, Iowa families desperately need Congress to repeal the \nPresident's 1993 fuel tax increase. The American Farm Bureau \nFederation, which speaks for a lot of people in rural America, agrees \nwith the need for the repeal of the tax. The American Farm Bureau notes \nthat President Clinton's gas tax increase is the first time in which \nfuel taxes have ever been used for anything other than transportation \nfunding.\n  The highway trust funds are important to farmers because Iowa farmers \nneed someone to improve rural bridges and roads, not only for getting a \nfamily back and forth to town, but also to get their inputs into their \nfarming operations as well as the grain and other products that they \nproduce to market. We find in our State that many of our roads and \nbridges used by farmers do not currently meet safety engineering \nstandards.\n  If we need to have a gas tax, then I say let it be spent on roads and \nhighways and bridges to move people. It is a user fee. It ought to be \nused for that purpose.\n  This 4.3-cent gas tax increase in 1993 went into the general fund. As \nSenator Ashcroft, of Missouri, said better than any of us can say, it \nis a Clinton gas tax increase paid for by people going to work. It goes \ninto a fund that is going to go to programs for those people that do \nnot go to work.\n  If we are going to tax working people 4 more cents for gas, it ought \nto go into the road fund so that it is going for the people that are \nusing the roads. So if we take this 4 cents out, and President Clinton \nstill feels that this money ought to be spent on some of these programs \nwith the general fund as their source of revenue, then the President \nshould agree to cut spending elsewhere in the budget rather than taking \nmoney that ought to go to build better roads, safer roads, and safer \nbridges. But his act of 1993 does not build any roads or bridges with \nhis fuel tax.\n  So the President had an opportunity to cut spending when we passed \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1995. I like to remind people that because \nsome are cynical about Congress' ability to pass legislation to balance \nthe budget that the Republican Congress succeeded in doing it.\n  Mr. President, if I am running out of time, I ask unanimous consent \nfor 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am sorry that I went over time, but I \nwill make this last point.\n  The President in December vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. \nThis\n\n[[Page S4995]]\n\n1,800-page bill that we sent to the President was the product of about \n8 months of work by the Senate and the House. It was the product of 13 \ndifferent committees. Every committee had to change the programs that \nare under its jurisdiction to fit into the effort. That effort was the \npolicy to balance the budget. Our bill did that.\n  So, once in awhile, I like to reconsider our now vetoed Balanced \nBudget Act of 1995, because I have been working with other people in \nthe Congress for a long time and we said that we could balance the \nbudget. But, quite frankly, until last year we never delivered on that \npromise.\n  We tend to overpromise in Congress which can be wrong. We should be \ncareful not to overpromise. We should perform in office commensurate \nwith the rhetoric of our campaign.\n  We had promised to balance the budget over so many years in the \n1970's and 1980's and early 1990's--the last time we had a balanced \nbudget was in 1969--but we did not succeed, and yet we had promised it. \nThat is why some people are so cynical about some of us in public \noffice.\n  I suppose if you would have asked me 12 months ago, would we ever \nhave gotten to a balanced budget, I would have been cynical myself \nabout our ability to succeed. I would have said, ``Well, no. It's a \ngood goal, but we'll never get it done.'' I never said that at the \ntime, but that is what I thought. Yet, I am on the committees that have \nto deliver on it. We were able to produce a budget that the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office declared balanced. And the President vetoed \nit.\n  We are going to be able to start, maybe tomorrow morning, to put \ntogether another balanced budget act. This will be the balanced budget \nact of 1996. We will still have a lot of tough decisions to make, but \nat least now we have the President on record as saying that he was for \na balanced budget. He said he was for a balanced budget, only he would \ndo it in 10 years even though our's did it in 7 years. The new one to \nbe taken up soon will do it in 6 years. It will ultimately balance \nbecause we said 12 months ago we were going to balance it. At least now \nwe have the President saying he is for a balanced budget. I hope he \nreally is. After June of last year, he said he was for a balanced \nbudget. We passed it, and he still vetoed it.\n  So the process starts over again. I am not cynical about whether or \nnot we can balance the budget now because we proved to the public we \ncould do it. Most importantly, we had to prove it to ourselves that we \ncould do it, and we did.\n  So I think that the President has an opportunity now to hopefully \nreject this business that you can tax people with a gas tax for money \nthat ought to go into the road fund to build safer highways. Currently, \nPresident Clinton's gas tax is going to fund a bunch of programs with \ngasoline user fees that have nothing to do with the people that are \nusing the highways. Here is a way that he could help repeal that. He \nsaid he would do it. I hope he sends a message to the minority party up \nhere on the Hill that he will do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S4994-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4995-S4996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to the \nSenator from Iowa's speech, as I have listened virtually to every \nmember of the Republican Party of the Senate who has consistently \nlamented the deficit-reduction package of 1993. I did not enjoy voting \nto raise taxes in 1993 any more than I enjoyed cutting spending in \n1993. But to set the record straight, that deficit-reduction package \nwas intended to reduce the deficit compared to what it would otherwise \nbe, by $500 billion over a period of 5 years.\n  It was a very dramatic time in the Senate. Fifty Democrats voted aye. \nEvery single Republican voted no. And Vice President Gore, who was \nseated in the chair that day, voted aye and broke the tie. And so the \n$500 billion deficit-reduction package became law. At least two \nSenators on this side of the aisle lost their reelection campaigns \nbecause they voted aye, a very courageous and responsible vote.\n  The Office of Management and Budget estimates that rather than \nproduce $500 billion in savings, but because interest rates came down \nas a result of that package and because economic activity went up, the \n1993 Clinton budget bill will actually reduce the deficit by $800 \nbillion over the same 5-year period, 1993 to 1998.\n  So I ask my Republican colleagues who find that deficit-reduction \nbill passed by 50 very courageous Democrats in 1993, I ask them to tell \nall Americans as we start to work on the budget tomorrow, where you \nwould get that $800 billion if we had not acted so responsibly?\n  The budget we will debate tomorrow, which I have absolutely no \nintention of voting for, again, has substantial cuts in Medicare and \nMedicaid, and--listen to this--a $60 billion cut in education over the \nnext 6 years.\n  Who gets the money? Why, the Republican budget provides for an $11.3 \nbillion increase next year alone in defense spending. Now, Mr. \nPresident, for the edification of anybody who cares, out of a roughly \n$1.7 trillion budget, less than one-third of that is for what we call \ndomestic discretionary spending--education; the environment; medical \nresearch; medical care and a whole host of other things.\n  Mr. President, $515 billion is provided for discretionary spending, \nbut defense gets the bulk of that, including a nice, handsome $11-plus \nbillion increase, and everything else that makes us a great country \nworth defending goes down. The environment, including funding for EPA's \nenforcement, takes a whopping hit. In 1970, 65 percent of the lakes and \nstreams in this country were neither swimmable nor fishable. In 1995, \n65 percent of the lakes and streams in this Nation are swimmable and \nare fishable because EPA, through their enforcement acts, made people \nquit dumping their sewage into the rivers and streams and made the soap \nmanufacturers come up with cleaner soaps without chemicals in them.\n  How does the Republican budget respond to that kind of progress? Why, \nthey cut EPA's enforcement because they argue the business community \njust cannot take it. I am the first to admit that some regulations are \ncrazy and do not make sense. But nobody, Republican or Democrat alike, \nin their heart of hearts wants to turn the clock back on cleaning up \nthe lakes and streams of this Nation, or polluting the air we breathe, \nwhich is much, much cleaner now, principally because we made the \nautomobile industry put catalytic converters in their cars.\n  So when the Republicans talk about that big tax hike in 1993, what is \ntheir answer? Maybe in their heart of hearts they are feeling a little \nbadly about having voted against cutting the deficit by an honest-to-\nGod $800 billion--not over 7 years; over a 5-year period. What is their \nanswer to it? Cut the gasoline tax 4.3 cents. I thought my good \ncolleague from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, had a great line. That is \nlike spitting in the ocean and trying to make it rise.\n  The gas tax did not cause the gasoline price increase and it is not \ngoing to contribute to reducing it. It will go into the pockets of the \noil companies. Everybody says that by October, gas prices will be back \nwhere they started from and we will be sitting here with $3 billion \nadded to the deficit.\n  What is it with the Republicans? They will not vote for deficit \nreduction, they keep on increasing defense spending, they keep wanting \nto repeal the gas tax. And their budget has an enormous billion tax \ncut. I am not voting for any tax cuts until we get the deficit under \ncontrol.\n  You know what is really paradoxical about the proposed tax cut that \ngives families a credit for each child? Listen to this: Six to nine \nmillion people in this country work for anywhere from $4.25 an hour to \n$6 and $7 an hour, 6 to 9 million of them. We give them a little check \nat the end of the year called the earned income tax credit because we \nbelieve that is preferable to their quitting work and going on welfare. \nSo we say we will give you up to $2,800 at the end of the year if you \nwill just stay on the job. That is a lot cheaper than $9,000 a year on \nwelfare. It is a good investment for us.\n  What does the Republican budget do? It cuts investment tax credit by \napproximately $20 billion. What does this mean to the 6 to 9 million \npeople who are working for essentially minimum\n\n[[Page S4996]]\n\nwages, up to $7 an hour? Effectively, they get a tax increase because \nthe earned income tax credit has been cut.\n  Do you know what else is really ironic about it? Those people do not \npay taxes. They do not make enough to pay taxes. So you know what? They \ndo not get a child tax credit. They are getting a tax increase by \ncutting the earned-income tax credit, and they get nothing to offset it \nbecause it is only if you pay taxes that you can offset the tax cut for \neach child.\n  What kind of lunacy is this? What do the American people expect from \nus? They expect a little decency and they expect fairness.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, first, I want to say to the Senator from \nArkansas, thank you for coming to the floor today and talking to us and \nto whoever is watching here. As the Senator has a way of doing, he \nfinds the truth. He finds the truth in all of this. The truth that he \npointed out--and then I will ask a question--when you get through with \nthis Republican budget, what you realize is that it hurts the people of \nthis country. It hurts the hardest working people of this country. We \nwill bring that out in the next few days.\n  The question I want to ask the Senator is this: We know when the \nGovernment shut down and we had that crisis, it was because the \nPresident of the United States stood up and said to this Republican \nCongress, ``I'm not going to back down. I'm going to stand up for \nMedicare and the elderly who rely on it. I'm going to stand up for \nMedicaid and the poorest children who rely on it, and the poorest \nseniors in nursing homes who rely on it.'' He was going to stand up, \nand he did, for the environment and for education.\n  I say to my friend, has he looked at this Republican budget that they \nhave just unveiled with great fanfare, and that budget which the \nPresident vetoed, and does he see similarities between the two?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed for 4 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me say to the Senator from California, this question \nreminds me of something Franklin Roosevelt said. My father taught us \nwhen we died we were going to Franklin Roosevelt's. He was the only one \nwho ever did anything for us.\n  This budget is a manifestation of almost total disdain for people \ntrying to reach for the first rung on the ladder. It is protectionism \nat its worst of those who have much. Franklin Roosevelt once said, and \nI know the Senator is familiar with the quote, ``The groans of the full \npocketbooks of the wealthy are louder than the churning of the empty \nstomachs of hungry people.'' That is not so true now as it was during \nthe Depression, but the principle in this budget is the same.\n  You think about cutting education $60 billion. You think of how many \nchildren will not be educated as a result of that. I have said time and \ntime again if it had not been for the GI bill waiting for me when I got \nout of the service, I would not be standing here right now.\n  And that applies to millions and millions of people. There was a very \npoignant story in the Post this morning about a woman who said, ``I \nwouldn't be in this position if it hadn't been for student loans and \nstudent grants.'' So what are we doing? We are cutting education $60 \nbillion. Everybody wants clear air and clean water. So what are we \ndoing? Cutting the environment. Nobody wants to see a child go without \nhealth care. So we are cutting Medicaid. I could go on and on. But I \nfind this budget almost identical to the budget we debated last year--\n--\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is right.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The one followed by a reconciliation which the President \nhad the good sense and the courage to veto. Had he not vetoed it, we \nwould be on our way to third-world status right now. That is how bad I \nfelt it was.\n  Mr. President, I know my time has about expired. Every time I think \nof the fact that two of my very best friends and best Senators in the \nU.S. Senate lost their seats because they cast a very courageous vote \nhere in 1993, it makes me sad.\n  So, Mr. President, there are going to be a limited number of \namendments. I have a number that I wish I could offer on the budget, \nbut I know time constraints will not permit that. However, I will offer \na few. One amendment would keep the U.S. Government from selling assets \nto balance the budget. Think about selling the power marketing systems. \nThink about selling the Elk Hills Petroleum Reserve. Sell everything. \nWhat do you do for an encore when everything is gone?\n  A woman once said her husband came home from the law office and said, \n``I had a great day today.'' She said, ``What happened?'' He said, ``I \nsold my desk.'' That is what we are doing in this budget. I am not \ngoing to vote for it. I am going to vigorously speak against it, and \nthere will be 53 Republicans that will vote for it. We are starting \ndown the same road we just left.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S4995-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4996-S4997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GAS TAX REPEAL\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, a few moments ago, the other side of \nthe aisle effectively blocked the efforts to repeal President Clinton's \nAugust 1993 increase on gasoline, diesel fuel, and jet fuel. Now, just \nto put this in perspective, when the President was running for the \noffice he now holds, he said, in unequivocal terms, that a gas tax was \nthe wrong thing to do, he said it was egregious for low income, and he \nsaid it was harmful to the elderly, all of which is true. It is as \nregressive a tax as one can find because the lowest income families in \nAmerica pay the highest share of their disposable incomes. It ranges as \nhigh as 8 percent of their disposable income that has to be invested in \nthe purchase of gasoline.\n\n  So those that have the least resources are those for which this tax \ncauses the most difficulty, which, as I am sure, is why the President \nsaid it was the wrong thing to do. Nevertheless, on arrival at the \nWhite House, an increase in gasoline taxes was put in his tax increase \non America, which, as we all know, was the largest tax increase in \nAmerican history. These policies have had the effect of costing \nAmerica's average families, all of them put together, about $2,000 to \n$3,000 in lost income.\n  Some people around here do not seem to think that is a lot of money. \nBut for the average family in Georgia, let me try to put it in \nperspective. An average family in Georgia makes $45,000 a year. Both \nparents have to work to get that. In fact, in many cases today, the \nkids have to work, too, to make ends meet. By the time this average \nfamily in Georgia pays their Federal taxes, FICA, Social Security, \nMedicare, State and local taxes--their share of the regulatory \napparatus in our country, which is at an all-time high--they have 48 \npercent of their gross income left to do everything that we have asked \nthem to do. That is unbelievable.\n  If Thomas Jefferson were here today, or any of the other Founders, \nthey would absolutely be stunned that we have grown up the Government \nso large that it takes over half the resources from labor, leaves them \nwith less than half of what they earned to do what they have to do, to \npromote their own dreams, to educate, to house, to feed, to clothe, to \ntransport, to provide for the health of their families and their \ncommunities. No wonder there is so much anxiety in the workplace today, \nso much anxiousness among our people. We have literally pushed the \nAmerican family to the wall.\n  So, suddenly, there is a phenomenon that makes everybody focus on the \nprice of gasoline. The prices have been skyrocketing because there is a \nrefinery shortage, because there was a bad winter, because the price of \nthe crude product costs much more today. And so some Members came to \nthe floor and said let us at least, in the face of this, get rid of \nthat burden. Let us repeal that gas tax. Let us remember what the \nPresident said when he ran for President. And then even the President \nsaid, ``Yes, I agree. I would sign a repeal of the gas tax.''\n\n  But when we tried to do it in these last 5 or 6 days, with us saying \nit should be done, with the President finally agreeing, remembering his \nremarks during the campaign that it was\n\n[[Page S4997]]\n\na wrong tax, a regressive tax, a tax hard on low income, a tax that is \nhard on senior citizens--so we had the majority and the President both \nagreeing. But the other side will not let it come to a vote. They will \nnot even allow this modest reduction of economic pressure on the \nAmerican family.\n  In the face of vast public support, a modest attempt to put a few \nmore dollars in the checking accounts of these American families, for \nwhich--to step back a moment, Mr. President, last week we acknowledged, \njust for taxes--forget the regulatory reform--an American family, a \nGeorgia family in my case, works today from January 1 to May 7 for the \nGovernment, and May 8 is the first day they get to keep their paycheck. \nFor Heaven's sake, a family in America has to work from January 1 to \nMay 7, and on May 8 gets to keep their first paycheck.\n  I might add that, under this administration, the date you get to keep \nyour check is the latest in the year that it has ever been. These \npolicies have added 3 more days that a family has to work for the \nGovernment before they can keep their own earnings.\n  We just heard remarks from the Senator from Arkansas bemoaning \nattempts to try to lower that impact. The last balanced budget that the \nCongress sent to the President would have put $2,000 to $3,000 in the \nchecking account of that average Georgia family I was talking about. \nThat is the equivalent of a 10- to 20-percent pay raise. Now, if you \nare currently having over half of your resources taken, just think what \nan important event it would be to be able to keep another $2,000 to \n$3,000 in the checking account of that average family. A phenomenal \nimpact.\n  As I said, it is almost not comprehensible. I would never have \nbelieved while growing up that I would be in the U.S. Senate at a time \nwhen a family has to work from January 1 to May 7 before they get to \nkeep their first paycheck.\n  If we ask Americans what would be a fair tax level, no matter their \ncircumstances, they will tell us 25 percent. That would be working from \nJanuary 1 to March 1, and then on March 2 you get to keep your \npaycheck. But no. No. Now it is May 8 before you get to keep your \npaycheck.\n  We came forward and said, ``Look, the President has vetoed all this \ntax relief. But let us at least at a minimum take this gas tax burden \noff the backs of the working families.'' I might point out that it \nwould mean somewhere around $100 to $200 that would be left in the \nchecking account. Several people on the other side have suggested that \nis too little money to be concerned about. Well, if it is such a small \namount, why are we in such an argument about returning it to the \nfamilies that earned it? Let us go ahead and give it back to them. If \nit does not matter to them, why does it matter to us?\n  I remember several years ago in my State when we raised the fee on \nthe license tag $10 to $l5, and it almost created a revolution, from my \nmother to every neighborhood. ``Why am I paying this additional $5?'' \nWe got rid of that in a hurry, and we ought to get rid of this gas tax. \nWe ought to leave that money in the checking account for those who \nearned it.\n  In my State alone, the gas tax removed $238 million annually from the \neconomy. That is an enormous sum of money. Removing that money from the \nState, taking it out of the families that earned it and the businesses \nthat earned it and shipping it up here to the Treasury so some \nWashington wonder wonk can decide where to spend it makes no sense \nunder the current conditions that we face.\n  But even this modest attempt to lower taxes even the slightest amount \nhas found stiff opposition from the other side, and they have \nconsistently refused to allow this measure--which now their own \nPresident says he is willing to sign--they will not let it get passed; \ndeadlocked; cannot end the debate; another filibuster, which I might \npoint out is a 60-to-50 effort to stop a filibuster, more than any \nother session in contemporary history.\n  Whenever we get into these tax questions, Mr. President, I always get \nback to this average family. I asked for a snapshot of that family \nabout 3 months ago. It has been absolutely fascinating. I do not think \nmany people in America, even those paying this burden, understand that \nhalf of what they earn is being taken right out of their checking \naccount and shipped up here so that another set of priorities can be \nimposed.\n\n  That is an inordinate burden, and there is no institution in America \nthat has had a more profound effect on the American family and its \nbehavior than their own Government--more than Hollywood, more than all \nthese cultural issues that we talk about all the time. There is no \ninstitution other than our own Government that has had such a profound \neffect. I mean, what else can sweep through your home and take half the \nresources you earn?\n  When I was a youngster, I was told that the largest single investment \nthat I would ever make was my home. Wrong. The largest single \ninvestment I make and all my fellow citizens make is the Government. We \nhave long since surpassed the investment in the home with the \nGovernment. The Government now takes more than your mortgage, clothing, \nand transportation combined--the Government.\n  Back in 1950 when the quintessential family was Ozzie and Harriet, \nOzzie was sending 2 cents to Washington out of his paycheck. If he were \nhere today, he would be sending a quarter; 2 cents to a quarter in 50 \nyears. Do you know that Harriet would not be at home either? She would \nbe in the workplace. She would have to be in the workplace so that they \ncould maintain what they are charged to do for their family and deal \nwith the tax burden.\n  Several months ago I took a chart from 1950 to 1996 and tracked the \ntax burden, which has grown and grown from 2 cents to 25 cents \nfederally. I tracked a number of families in which both parents had to \nbe in the workplace, and you will not be surprised, Mr. President, they \ntrack each other identically right on the line. As the tax burden went \nup, another set of families had to have both parents in the workplace.\n  I know there are many other features of our new world--the desire for \nprofessional accomplishment, the lifting of the glass ceiling. There \nare many factors that are in the workplace. But I argue that the most \nsignificant reason is tax pressure. In fact, there was a recent study \nthat asked the other spouse, ``Are you pleased to be in the \nworkplace?'' You will not be surprised, Mr. President, a third of them \ndo not want to be there at all, a third of them want to be there as \nvolunteers, and another third of them would work just part time. But \nthe economic pressures that time and this new era have put on those \nfamilies has literally pressured a total realignment of who is in the \nworkplace.\n  Families today are in the workplace, husband, wife, and children, \njust to keep their standard of living in place. The tax burden, Mr. \nPresident, has had a more profound effect on the workplace than any \nother single event in the last 25 years.\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to conclude my remarks. But let me just say \nI am absolutely stunned that even a slight attempt, a modest effort, to \ngo in the correct direction of relieving the tax pressure on the \nAmerican working family is opposed by the other side of the aisle--\nattacks in the road, and the barricades across the road to relieving \nAmerica's families of the enormous tax burden they bear today. They \nwork from January 1 to May 7, and finally on May 8, get to keep 1 day's \npaycheck. We try to push that clock back just the slightest degree and \nare railed against by the other side of the aisle. It is perplexing, \nMr. President, and I am sure it is to America's families across our \nland as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S4996-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4997-S4999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE GAS TAX, THE BUDGET, AND OBSTRUCTIONISM\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about several \nthings.\n\n[[Page S4998]]\n\nI am not the one who is, of course, engaging in the obstruction of the \ngas tax repeal that we have been going through now for nearly a week. I \nwould like to comment just a bit on the budget. Even though we are not \ninto the budget debate, there are comments that have been made this \nafternoon that I think require some little comment. Finally, just a \nlittle comment on where we have been this year in terms of \nobstructionism and holding us back.\n  It is kind of frustrating, maybe more so for those of us who are new \nhere, and I think very frustrating for the people in the country, to \nsee the Senate not able to move forward on issues that certainly cause \ndisagreement. Nevertheless, we do have a system for that, and that is \ncalled voting. If the issue gets more votes than it does not get, then \nit passes. It if does not, it does not. That is the concept of most of \nus on how to run things. So it is a little frustrating finding yourself \nin the position of not moving when there are things to be done, when \nthere are things that are important to families in this country.\n  One of the other things I think is particularly frustrating is we \nhave here, and very proudly so, a government of the people and by the \npeople, where people make the final decisions on how they stand, how \nthey believe on issues. But, to do that, it is necessary to have the \nfacts. Increasingly in our society, I think, and it troubles me a bit--\nwe have more ability now to communicate than we have ever had. We have \nthe opportunity now, regardless of what happens here or what happens \naround the world, to know about it instantly through this \ncommunications system. Yet, at the same time, despite that system, we \nfind ourselves with more noninformation all the time. It is not the \nprovince of any one particular party, it is not the province of any one \nperson, but we find ourselves, I think, with more and more information \nthat is spun to make a point and that is not, frankly, accurate. I \nthink that is too bad. It is really difficult to make decisions with \nrespect to policies and issues if the information we have is distorted. \nI think we see that increasingly happen to us.\n\n  Talking about the budget, a little bit ago there was discussion on \nthe floor about the budget that will be brought out and talked about \ntomorrow. Among other things it was said EPA takes a whopping cut. The \nfact of the matter is discretionary spending at the EPA would remain at \nthe level provided in the recently signed appropriations bill. It is \nnot a cut. It stays as it is.\n  The allegation was also made that education would be cut. Education \nwill increase from $47.8 to $52 billion. That is not a cut. Last year \nwe got into this business about Medicare and talking about the cuts. \nThere were no cuts. What it was was reducing the level of growth so we \ncould maintain that program. If you like Medicare, if you like health \ncare for the elderly, then you have to do something. We thought then \nthat you had to do something by about 2005 or whatever. Now it has been \nrefined to where you have to make some changes by 2001 or the system \nwill go broke. That is no one's projection except the trustees, three \nof whom are appointed by the President.\n  The resolution, as a matter of fact, would increase the spending for \nbeneficiaries from $4,800 in 1995 to $7,000. That is not a cut. Yet we \nhear, and the media continues to utilize that word, ``cut.''\n  So it is very difficult, it seems to me, to really deal with this. \nThere is a legitimate difference of view. I understand that. Much of \nthe conversation that goes on here, even though we talk about details, \nis basically a philosophical difference. A little bit ago one of our \nassociates on the other side of the aisle was talking about the \nbenefits of tax increases because they helped reduce the deficit. Of \ncourse they do. But the philosophical question is, do you want to \nreduce the deficit by controlling spending and reducing the level of \nspending, the rate of spending which would balance the budget, or do \nyou want to continue to spend at the same level and raise taxes to \noffset it? That is a philosophical difference. That is basically what \nwe talk about here.\n  It is a defining choice. I suspect everyone, even though it does not \nhappen, says: Yes, let us balance the budget. We have talked about a \nconstitutional amendment here, talked about it this year--everybody, \nwhen they initially stood, said, ``I am going to balance the budget. We \ndo not need a constitutional amendment. We can do it.''\n  Yes, we can. We have not done it for 25 years, however. So it does \nseem to me a constitutional amendment is something reasonable. But \nfurther than that, and at least as important, is what is the philosophy \nof doing it? Do you want to continue to grow at the rate we have in the \npast, which is like 8 percent a year faster than the growth in the \neconomy? Or do we want to reduce that level, that rate of growth, and \nbalance the budget that way? I happen to favor that idea.\n  I think voters said, in 1994, the Federal Government is too big, it \nis too costly, we need to do something to contain it. I think we should \ndo that. So that is the great debate. To have that debate, you have to \nhave some facts there. You have to talk about the same numbers. Then we \nargue about the philosophical difference, because there is one.\n  The idea, somehow, the statement that ``I am not going to vote for \nany tax cuts'' does not seem to me to be the kind of thing that I \nsupport. I think we ought to have tax cuts. I think we ought to be able \nto leave more money in the pockets of American families. About 40 \npercent, on average, of our income goes to some level of taxation. I do \nnot think anybody ever intended for that to be the case.\n  Of course, there are functions of Government that we all support. \nThere are functions of Government that we need to fund and finance, but \nI do not think anyone had the notion that we would be doing it at the \nlevel of 40 percent of our income.\n  So I hope as we go through this budget--and it is more apparent in \nbudgets than anything else--that we can say: Here are the basic sets of \nfacts. We ought to start there. Then if you disagree, fine. \nDisagreement is what it is all about.\n  Let me talk a minute about the gas tax filibuster. We have been \ntrying to do that for a while. What are we talking about? First of all, \nthe bill that is on the floor has to do with Travelgate reimbursement, \nreimbursing those employees who were unjustly taken to court, who had \nworked at the White House, to pay their legal fees. That is the basic \nissue.\n  The amendments to that included a gas tax reduction of 4.3 cents. It \nhas to do with the minimum wage, a controversial issue, but a valid \nissue, useful. It has to do with the TEAM concept of allowing employers \nand employees to be able to come together to use some of the new \ntechniques that have been developed in management, to allow employers \nto call upon employees to find better ways to do things. We have seen \nthis happen around the world. I come from Cody, WY. The guy who started \nthat kind of management in Japan came from Cody, WY, of all places. And \nit works. But we do not allow that to happen unless there is a change.\n  The minimum wage is a legitimate issue. Interestingly enough, it came \nup here in the Senate about a month ago and had not been talked about \nfor 3 years. But when the AFL-CIO was here and promised $35 million for \nthe election, suddenly it became an issue. It is a legitimate issue. We \nought to talk about it.\n  The gas tax, however, the 4.3 cents--the average gas tax paid in this \ncountry is about 38 cents. About half is Federal, about half State. I \ncome from Wyoming where people drive a good deal more. Someone \nmentioned their family, when using their car, would save about $20. \nOurs is about $70, because we do drive a great deal more. So it is a \nlittle unfair regionally. I have a parochial concern about that.\n  I think one of the interesting things, though, is that this 4.3 \ncents, out of the 18 cents, is the only portion of the gas tax that \ndoes not go to the maintenance and building of highways. It goes into \nthe general fund. I think it would be a mistake to begin to tax this \ncommodity generally for nonhighway uses. That is what we have done. So \nwe have an opportunity now to change that.\n  One of the reasons it comes up, of course, is because of the \nextraordinary recent prices in gasoline over the last month or less. Is \nthis the answer to that? No, of course not. But this needs to be \nrepealed under any circumstances. It provides an opportunity\n\n[[Page S4999]]\n\nto talk about it, some way to say, ``Well, the 4.3 cents will never get \nto the consumer.''\n  I do not believe that. First of all, it has such a high level of \nvisibility that it surely will have to go there. Second, there is great \ncompetition, as you know. If I have a gas station on one corner and you \nhave one on the other, and I lower mine, you are going to lower yours, \ntoo. That is going to happen. Competition has a great deal to do with \nthat.\n  We had a hearing this week and took a look at the costs of gasoline, \nand it is roughly a third--about a third for crude oil, about a third \nin the refining and marketing, and about a third in taxes. Not many \ncommodities are taxed that high. So we ought to do that.\n  I am very disappointed that instead of voting on it, instead of \nfollowing the advice of the President, who over the years has indicated \nthat he was opposed to a gas tax, who indicated during his campaign \nthat that was not a good tax because it taxed the poor at a much higher \nlevel of a percentage of their income than the rich--it is true--now \nsupports it, brought it to us. So we need to change that. Why do we \nnot? Because our friends on that side of the aisle will not let it come \nup.\n  Filibuster. This is not the classic filibuster where people stand up \nand talk all night and bring their sleeping bag and cook dinner out in \nthe back. This is the kind where it is simply obstructionism that will \nnot let it come to the floor, and it continues.\n  So we need to change that, Mr. President. We need to move forward. \nLet these issues stand for all as they will.\n  Finally, I think there has been some frustration, at least on my \npart, this year in that this is not the first time or the only time it \nhas happened. My friend from Georgia just indicated that some 60 times \nthis has happened this year, more than any other time in recent \nhistory. We have set about to make some changes this year.\n  I think those of us who just came last year in the last election are \nmaybe more aware of the need for change, feel more of a mandate to make \na change. I think, to a large extent, we have succeeded in causing that \nchange to happen. We have not come to closure on as many things as I \nwish we would have and could have, but I can tell you that we have \nchanged the debate here.\n  Now we are talking about how do you balance the budget, arguing about \nwhich aspects of the budget we can change to balance it. For 25 years \nwe did not talk about balancing the budget at all. Now we are. Now we \nare talking about ways to make Government more efficient and more \neffective and, indeed, to move some of the functions of Government back \ncloser to people, the States and the counties. That is a new idea. Not \nsince the Great Society with Lyndon Johnson have we talked about making \nit smaller rather than larger. So there have been a lot of things that \nthis same sort of obstructionism has caused not to happen.\n  Tort reform. A lot of people believe that we ought to do something in \nour legal system, do something about litigation so that we do not have \nthis constant pressure. We cannot do that because there is obstruction \nfrom the White House.\n  Regulatory reform. Almost everybody understands and recognizes that \nwe are overregulated. Sure, we need regulations, but they need to be \nthe kind that are efficient and effective and not so costly. We did not \nget regulatory reform because it was obstructed.\n  The balanced budget amendment to the Constitution failed by one vote \nin the Senate. As I mentioned, people argue, ``Well, we don't need to \ndo that.'' The evidence is we do. We do it in my State. We do it in \nmost of our States. We do it in about 43 States, I think. There is a \nconstitutional amendment that you cannot spend more than you take in. \nThat makes sense. It is morally and fiscally responsible. We ought to \ndo that.\n  Welfare reform. Almost everybody believes that we need to help people \nwho need help, but we need to help them back into the work force, and \nwe need to make some changes so that can happen. We need to move that \nmuch more to the States. Certainly the delivery system in Wyoming for \nwelfare needs to be different than it is in Pennsylvania. We have \n100,000 miles and 475,000 people, half of what is in Fairfax County \nacross the river. Our system has to be different. We need to let the \nStates devise that delivery system.\n  Health care reform is stalled right now. It is not an extensive \nhealth care reform, but it has to do with portability; it has to do \nwith accessibility to insurance. It is hung up now. We cannot move \nforward.\n  I have been involved, as have many of us, with Superfund reform. \nEverybody knows Superfund reform has to come about. One of the main \ncontributors to cleaning up Superfund sites are insurance dollars, and \n85 percent of those dollars go to legal fees, not to cleaning up \nSuperfund sites. That needs to be changed. We need to reduce spending. \nTalk about balancing the budget--spending has continued to grow.\n  So, Mr. President, those are some of the effects, it seems to me, of \nsort of obstructing moving forward. This one is more pronounced than \nmost. We cannot move on the gas tax. But it has been going on all year. \nThat apparently is the strategy to move into this election, to make \nsure we do not do anything. I think that is too bad.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we can do something about it. I hope \nwe can make a move. I think the 4.3-cent gas tax needs to be repealed \nand needs to be returned. I hope, as we move into the debate on the \nbudget, that we can at least talk about facts, put the numbers out \nthere as they really are, and then argue about whether you like it or \nnot. I hope that we can move forward on a great many of the issues that \nI believe people would like to see considered and would like to see \npassed.\n\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Are we in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S4997-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4999-S5000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CLINTON ADMINISTRATION POLICY ON DRUG SMUGGLERS\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, after reading a May 13 report in the Los \nAngeles Times, I wrote to Attorney General Reno expressing my shock at \nreports that Clinton administration officials are letting drug \nsmugglers go free as a matter of official policy.\n  Although I have not yet heard back from Attorney General Reno, this \nis a disturbing matter that requires action now. Drug use among our \nchildren is on the rise and is contributing to the rise in juvenile \ncrime.\n  Therefore, tomorrow I plan to offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \ncalling on Attorney General Reno to investigate this matter and report \nback to Congress in 30 days, and calling on the Attorney General to \nensure that any policy that allows drug smugglers to go free is stopped \nand that all such persons be vigorously prosecuted.\n\n  Mr. President, the Clinton administration has been indifferent, at \nbest, to the war on drugs right from the beginning when President \nClinton largely dismantled the drug czar's office. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in sending a strong message that, for the sake of our \nchildren today and tomorrow, we believe we must aggressively put these \ndrug smugglers--who are nothing more than merchants of death--where \nthey belong, behind bars.\n  I will point out a few statistics. These are not Senator Dole's \nfacts. These are facts given to us by people who are experts in the \narea. The number of young people between 12 and 17 using marijuana has \nincreased from 1.6 million in 1992 to 2.9 million in 1994. That has \nprobably increased a lot more since the end of 1994. And the category \nof ``recent marijuana use'' has increased a staggering 200 percent \namong 14- to 15-year-olds. About one in three high school students uses \nmarijuana, and 12- to 17-year-olds who use marijuana are 85 percent \nmore likely to graduate to cocaine than those who abstain from \nmarijuana. Juveniles who reach age 21 without ever having used drugs \nalmost never try them later in life. If you make the first 21 years\n\n[[Page S5000]]\n\nwithout using drugs, then you are probably not going to be addicted.\n  The latest results from the Drug Abuse Warning Network shows that \nmarijuana-related episodes jumped 39 percent and are running at 155 \npercent above the 1990 level. Another frightening figure is that \nbetween February 1993 and February 1995, the retail price of a gram of \ncocaine fell from $172 to $137 and a gram of heroin also fell from \n$2,032 to $1,278, which means it is going to be more accessible and \nreadily available because it costs less. The number of defendants \nprosecuted for violations of the Federal drug laws has dropped from \n25,033 in 1992 to 22,926 in 1995.\n  So it seems to me that we have a very serious problem on our hands. \nIt is not a partisan issue. It is not politics at all, as far as I \nknow. So I hope my colleagues will have an opportunity here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and the letter I sent \nAttorney General Reno be printed in the Record, which I send to the \ndesk.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Sense-of-the-Senate Resolution on the Administration's Practice \n              Regarding the Prosecution of Drug Smugglers\n\n       Whereas, drugs use is devastating to the nation, \n     particularly among juveniles, and has led juveniles to become \n     involved in interstate gangs and to participate in violent \n     crime;\n       Whereas, drug use has experienced a dramatic resurgence \n     among our youth;\n       Whereas, the number of youths aged 12-17 using marijuana \n     has increased from 1.6 million in 1992 to 2.9 million in \n     1994, and the category of ``recent marijuana use'' increased \n     a staggering 200% among 14- to 15-year-olds over the same \n     period;\n       Whereas, since 1992, there has been a 52% jump in the \n     number of high school seniors using drugs on a monthly basis, \n     even as worrisome declines are noted in peer disapproval of \n     drug use;\n       Whereas, 1 in 3 high school students use marijuana;\n       Whereas, 12- to 17-year-olds who use marijuana are 85% more \n     likely to graduate to cocaine than those who abstain from \n     marijuana;\n       Whereas, juveniles who reach 21 without ever having used \n     drugs almost never try them later in life;\n       Whereas, the latest results from the Drug Abuse Warning \n     Network show that marijuana-related episodes jumped 39% and \n     are running at 155% above the 1990 level, and that \n     methamphetamine cases have risen 256% over the 1991 level;\n       Whereas, between February 1993 and February 1995 the retail \n     price of a gram of cocaine fell from $172 to $137, and that \n     of a gram of heroin also fell from $2,032 to $1,278;\n       Whereas, it has been reported that the Department of \n     Justice, through the United States Attorney for the Southern \n     District of California, has adopted a policy of allowing \n     certain foreign drug smugglers to avoid prosecution \n     altogether by being released to Mexico;\n       Whereas, it has been reported that in the past year \n     approximately 2,300 suspected narcotics traffickers were \n     taken into custody for bringing illegal drugs across the \n     border, but approximately one in four were returned to their \n     country of origin without being prosecuted;\n       Whereas, it has been reported that the U.S. Customs Service \n     is operating under guidelines limiting any prosecution in \n     marijuana cases to involving 125 pounds of marijuana or more;\n       Whereas, it has been reported that suspects possessing as \n     much as 32 pounds of methamphetamine and 37,000 Quaalude \n     tablets, were not prosecuted but were, instead, allowed to \n     return to their countries of origin after their drugs and \n     vehicles were confiscated;\n       Whereas, it has been reported that after a seizure of 158 \n     pounds of cocaine, one defendant was cited and released \n     because there was no room at the federal jail and charges \n     against her were dropped;\n       Whereas, it has been reported that some smugglers have been \n     caught two or more times--even in the same week--yet still \n     were not prosecuted;\n       Whereas, the number of defendants prosecuted for violations \n     of the federal drug laws has dropped from 25,033 in 1992 to \n     22,926 in 1995;\n       Whereas, the efforts of law enforcement officers deployed \n     against drug smugglers are severely undermined by \n     insufficiently vigorous prosecution policies of federal \n     prosecutors;\n       Whereas, this Congress has increased the funding of the \n     Federal Bureau of Prisons by 11.7% over the 1995 \n     appropriations level;\n       Whereas, this Congress has increased the funding of the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service by 23.5% over the 1995 \n     appropriations level: Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate that the \n     Attorney General promptly should investigate this matter and \n     report, within 30 days, to the Chair of the Senate and House \n     Committees on the Judiciary;\n       That the Attorney General should change the policy of the \n     United States Attorney for the Southern District of \n     California in order to ensure that cases involving the \n     smuggling of drugs into the United States are vigorously \n     prosecuted; and\n       That the Attorney General should direct all United States \n     Attorneys vigorously to prosecute persons involved in the \n     importation of illegal drugs into the United States.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                              Office of the Republican Leader,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 13, 1996.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     U.S. Department of Justice, 10th Street and Constitution \n         Ave., NW., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Reno: I am writing to request your \n     response to a disturbing Los Angeles Times story (``Drug \n     Runners Arrested at Border Often Go Free,'' May 13, 1996) \n     that suggests that U.S. Attorney Alan Bersin has adopted an \n     official policy allowing some drug smugglers to return to \n     Mexico without prosecution.\n       According to the Times article, officials at the U.S. \n     Attorney's office ``confirm that under a program quietly \n     adopted two years ago, an increasing number of suspected \n     traffickers have been sent back to Mexico without arrest or \n     prosecution in either federal or state court'' and ``more \n     than 1,000 smuggling suspects have been processed in this way \n     since 1994.'' More specifically, the Times article reports \n     that:\n       Two suspects with 32 pounds of methamphetamine, and another \n     with 37,000 Quaalude tablets, were simply ``excluded'' from \n     the United States after their drugs and vehicles were \n     confiscated.\n       After a seizure of 158 pounds of cocaine, one defendant was \n     cited and released because there was no room at the federal \n     jail and the charges against her were dropped.\n       U.S. Customs Service records show that some drug smugglers \n     have been apprehended two or more times--even in the same \n     week--and have not been jailed or prosecuted.\n       No prosecutorial action has been taken against a number of \n     drug smugglers captured with more than 125 pounds of \n     marijuana.\n       According to one Drug Enforcement Administration agent \n     cited in the article, ``there is virtually no risk [to \n     smugglers] as long as they keep quantities down. First of \n     all, the chances of getting caught are slim, and the chances \n     of prosecution are almost zero if you get caught with a small \n     quantity and if you're a Mexican national.''\n       Attorney General Reno, my questions to you are simple ones: \n     Is the Los Angeles Times story accurate? And if so, do the \n     policies of the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles \n     represent the policies of the Justice Department and the \n     Clinton Administration?\n       With teenage drug use on the rise here in the United States \n     and with the ascendancy of Mexico as a major U.S. supplier of \n     cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamine, the American people \n     would rightfully expect that we would be hard at work \n     strengthening our fight against the Mexican drug trade, not \n     weakening it, as the Los Angeles Times story suggests.\n       Thank you for your prompt attention to this important \n     matter. I have attached a copy of the full Los Angeles Times \n     article for your review.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Bob Dole,\n                                           Senate Majority Leader.\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I think so often of that November evening \nlong ago, in 1972, when the television networks reported that I had won \nthe Senate race in North Carolina. It was 9:17 in the evening and I \nrecall how stunned I was.\n  I had never really anticipated that I would be the first Republican \nin history to be elected to the U.S. Senate by the people of North \nCarolina. When I got over that, I made a commitment to myself that I \nwould never fail to see a young person, or a group of young people, who \nwanted to see me.\n  I have kept that commitment and it has proved enormously meaningful \nto me because I have been inspired by the estimated 60,000 young people \nwith whom I have visited during the 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  A large percentage of them are greatly concerned about the total \nFederal debt which back in February exceeded $5 trillion for the first \ntime in history. Congress created this monstrous debt which coming \ngenerations will have to pay.\n  Mr. President, the young people who visit with me almost always are \ninclined to discuss the fact that under the U.S. Constitution, no \nPresident can spend a dime of Federal money that has not first been \nauthorized and appropriated by both the House and Senate of the United \nStates.\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 25, 1992. I decided that it was important that a daily record \nbe made of the precise size of the Federal debt\n\n[[Page S5001]]\n\nwhich, at the close of business yesterday, Monday, May 13, 1996, stood \nat $5,094,150,618,714.59. On a per capita basis, the existing Federal \ndebt amounts to $19,234.76 for every man, woman, and child in America \non a per capita basis.\n  The increase in the national debt in the 24 hours since my report \nyesterday--which identified the total Federal debt as of close of \nbusiness on Friday, May 10, 1996--shows an increase of more than $1 \nbillion--$1,335,403,008.84, to be exact. That 1-day increase alone is \nenough to match the total amount needed to pay the college tuition for \neach of the 198,015 students for 4 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S5000-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CHUCK LOWE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, America is a nation that has a \nfascination with pop culture, especially the movies and television, and \nindividuals often form their opinions about issues based on what they \nsee on screens in their living room or in a theater. Unfortunately, \nthis practice often leads to misimpressions about the facts of life. \nTake for example organized crime. So often in movies and television \nshows, those who are involved in organized crime are depicted as sharp \ndressed and honorable men who simply choose to make their money and \nlive their lives outside the law. One cannot help but have a \nromanticized and idealized notion of what it is like to be a wiseguy.\n  To those of us who understand and study such issues, we know that \nnothing could be further from the truth. The real faces of organized \ncrime are the heartless killers and goons who put a stranglehold on \ntrucking, rackets, and unions, they are not manicured, honorable men; \nthey are the outlaw bikers who peddle methamphetamines and dabble in \nwhite slavery, they are not fun loving rebels who just want to ride \nmotorcycles; they are the gangs from our cities' ghettos who wholesale \ncrack and terrorize neighborhoods with their indiscriminate violence, \nthey are not misunderstood youths; and, they are the ``new mafias'' \nfrom places such as Russia, Mexico, and Vietnam, men and women who \nprefer intimidation and criminal enterprise to hard work, unlike their \nhonest immigrant peers who are fighting to realize the American dream. \nOrganized crime is about as an ideal lifestyle as having a terminal \ndisease, and it is just as deadly and destructive. Simply put, in a \nnation of laws, there is no room to tolerate organizations whose sole \nreason for existence is to commit crime and victimize hard working and \nhonest Americans.\n  In the last 30 years, the Federal Government has begun to take the \nfight against organized crime right to the enemy's doorstep. Through \nstatutes such as RICO, the allocation of resources dedicated to \ncombating organized crime, and intensified cooperation between law \nenforcement agencies, we are making real progress in subduing our \nNation's criminal classes. Today, I want to take a moment to salute an \nindividual who has devoted his life to this fight, Mr. Charles D. \n``Chuck'' Lowe, who serves as the Director of the Regional Organized \nCrime Information Center.\n  Chuck Lowe began his career in law enforcement back in the late \n1950's as a member of the U.S. Coast Guard's New York City Port \nSecurity Unit. In that position, he worked closely with the New York \nPolice Department, the Customs Service, and the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service. Certainly it must have been his time fighting \ncrime in the city that never sleeps where he found the career he loved \nand he learned the importance and effectiveness of cooperation between \nenforcement agencies. In the years following Chuck's enlistment in the \nCoast Guard, he served ably and capably with the Washington, DC, \nMetropolitan Police Department as a plainclothes detective, and then \nwith the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. During his 22-year \ncareer with BATF, Chuck was involved in a multitude of interesting and \ndangerous cases, he helped to protect the President, and he held a \nnumber of key leadership positions within that agency. His efforts as a \nFederal agent earned him numerous citations and recognitions, including \nawards for superior performance, case preparation, and training.\n  In 1988, Chuck left the BATF to join the Regional Organized Crime \nInformation Center [ROCIC], an organization committed to collecting, \nevaluating, analyzing, and disseminating information concerning \nwhitecollar career criminals, narcotics violators, gangs, and other \nviolent offenders. As he had done in his previous assignments, Chuck \nimmediately threw himself into his work, and it was a surprise to no \none when he became the Director of ROCIC in 1991, only 3 short years \nafter joining the organization.\n  Under his supervision, ROCIC has grown tremendously, more than \ntripling the number of agencies it serves, and it has greatly expanded \nthe services it provides to its 1,157 members. His efforts to modernize \nROCIC have improved morale at that agency, made it more efficient, and \nhas given law enforcement officers a potent tool with which to \ncoordinate their efforts against organized crime.\n  Mr. President, it is with regret that I report that Chuck Lowe has \ndecided to hang up his badge and gun and retire from his distinguished \ncareer as a law enforcement leader. In his more than 30-year career as \na cop, Chuck has contributed much to keeping our streets safe. We are \nproud of the work he has done and we wish him well in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S5001-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5001-S5002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to very \nbriefly follow up on a rather lengthy statement I made on May 3 \nregarding the present intellectual property rights dispute with the \nPeople's Republic of China. Since then, I have read a number of reports \nin the Chinese media regarding their view of the present situation \nwhich I feel bear examination and call for some response.\n  First, I am struck by the fact that the Chinese Government's position \non its level of compliance with the IPR agreement appears to be \nsomewhat schizophrenic. On the one hand, I have seen statements from \nboth the Foreign Ministry and Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic \nCooperation stating, for example, that ``the Chinese side has fully and \nconscientiously carried out its duties as stipulated in [the] Sino-U.S. \nIPR Agreement.'' On the other hand, I have also read statements from \nthe same spokesmen for the same ministries tacitly acknowledging that \nChina has not adhered to the letter of the agreement but falling back \non the excuse that ``demanding that a developing country such as China \ndo a perfect job [in regards to enforcing the terms of the Agreement] \nwithin a short few years is not practical as well as unfair.''\n  Well Mr. President, which is it? I, and most other observers I \nbelieve, would credit the latter as being closer to the truth. Starting \nfrom that premise, I would remind the Chinese that we are not asking \nthat they do a perfect job of rooting out IPR piracy. We are simply \nasking that they adhere to an agreement that they signed; we are simply \nasking that they live up to their voluntarily assumed responsibilities. \nIf, as the Chinese assert, it is unfair for us to assume that they can \ntry to stem IPR piracy in only a few years, then why on Earth did they \nsign the agreement to do so in the first place? How can it be unfair to \nhold the Chinese to their own word?\n  It is sort of like two ranchers who sign a contract, one agreeing to \nbuy 10 head of cattle from another. The buyer takes the 10 head, but \ngives the seller only one-third of the agreed-on payment. When the \nseller complains, the buyer says that it's unfair to blame him for not \nliving up to the agreement in full because he doesn't have enough money \nto pay for all 10 head. Well, the buyer knew going into the deal that \nhe couldn't live up to his side of the agreement, but went ahead in \nspite of that and signed it anyway. So who is the guilty party, Mr. \nPresident, certainly not the aggrieved seller.\n  Second, the Chinese have repeatedly stated that they are opposed to \nour imposition of sanctions because economic and trade disputes \n``should be settled through consultations in the spirit of mutual \nrespect, equality, and mutual benefit.'' Well Mr. President, we have \ntried consultations, only to have the Chinese side continually promise \nadherence but fail to carry through. As the Chinese are so fond of \nsaying, ``deeds speak louder than words''; and their deeds clearly show \nthat they are not living up to the agreement. We\n\n[[Page S5002]]\n\nhave tried mutual respect, but there is no mutual respect when one side \nsystematically fails to live up to an agreement. We have tried mutual \nbenefit, but there is no mutual benefit when IPR piracy in the People's \nRepublic of China costs United States' companies in excess of $2 \nbillion in lost revenue per year.\n  Third, as I noted in my last statement, I have noticed a tendency on \nthe part of some Chinese officials when faced with statements regarding \nthe lack of Chinese adherence to the agreement to attempt to deflect \nthe criticism by taking the offensive and claiming that the United \nStates has not held up its side of the agreement. Unfortunately, Mr. \nPresident, when pressed for specific examples of that alleged \nnoncompliance, my Chinese friends have grown somewhat vague and \nnoncommittal.\n  Mr. President, as the two sides continue 11-hour talks on this \nimpasse, I hope that the Chinese side will remember that it is the \nUnited States, and not them, that is the aggrieved party.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S5001-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF DOLLARS FOR SCHOLARS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on May 16 in Boston and Fall River in \nMassachusetts, volunteers and supporters from throughout the Nation \nwill gather to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the Dollars for \nScholars program. It is fitting that this celebration take place in \nMassachusetts. Our State is the home of the Nation's first Dollars for \nScholars chapter, which was founded in Fall River by Dr. Irving \nFradkin, a local optometrist. Thirty-five years ago this month, the \nDollars for Scholars parent organization was formally incorporated in \nBoston. From its roots in Massachusetts, Dollars for Scholars has grown \nto 760 chapters in 40 States. Last year, chapters across the country \nraised a total of $15.8 million and helped over 15,000 students achieve \ngreater educational opportunity.\n  Massachusetts has some of the most successful Dollars for Scholars \nchapters in the country. Its 68 chapters last year alone awarded more \nthan $1.5 million in college scholarships to over 2,500 students. In \nBoston, Holyoke, Worcester, Middleboro, Gloucester, and other \ncommunities, local citizens are reaching out to young men and women \nwith a powerful message about the importance of education. Since its \nfounding in Fall River, Dollars for Scholars chapters in Massachusetts \nhave had a significant impact in our State--distributing a total of \n$17.5 million in scholarships to more than 37,000 students.\n  The 35th anniversary events being held in Boston and Fall River this \nweek are part of the Year of the Scholar activities across the country. \nThe Year of the Scholar salutes the 30,000 volunteers who have helped \ncolleges and communities across the country work cooperatively to \nconfront the rising costs of higher education. It celebrates the \nsuccess of student scholars who have been able to go college with the \nhelp of the Dollars for Scholars Program. Dollars for Scholars deserves \ngreat credit for its extraordinary work in helping students fulfill \ntheir dream of a college education.\n  Education is the key to the work force of the future and the Nation's \nrole in the global economy. Access to quality education for all \ncitizens is a national priority. All children deserve an opportunity to \nlearn and fulfill their potential. We must continue to improve our \nschools and make college education more accessible and affordable, in \norder to build a stronger economy and maintain a strong democracy.\n  I commend the citizens of Massachusetts for their long-standing \ncommitment to education for all, and I am honored to take this \nopportunity to congratulate the Dollars for Scholars volunteers for \ntheir impressive work on this auspicious anniversary.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in connection with the debate, which I \nsuspect will soon be superseded by debate on a budget agreement, a few \npoints are still very, very much in order.\n  No. 1, there is a concerted effort here on the floor of the Senate to \nprevent a vote on a reduction in the gas tax, a reduction triggered by \nthe rapid runup in the price of a commodity of vital importance to \nevery American. But I think often overlooked in this debate is the fact \nthat this is not just any run-of-the-mill gas or motor vehicle fuel \ntax.\n  This tax, imposed about 3 years ago at the time of President \nClinton's first budget, represented an unprecedented change in the use \nof motor vehicle fuel tax. Always previously here in the Congress--and \nfor all practical purposes almost always in our States--motor vehicle \nfuel taxes were used for transportation purposes, generally for the \nconstruction and maintenance of highways, but more frequently in the \nrecent past for mass transit systems, whether bus related or on fixed \nrails.\n  As such, motor vehicle fuel taxes were usually less objected to by \nthe vast majority of people than was the case with many others taxes \nbecause they could see what they were getting for their money, because \none paid in proportion to one's use of those very transportation \nfacilities.\n  President Clinton, however, flouted that convention in 1993 and \ndetermined that this gas tax was to be used for various social \npurposes. As the junior Senator from Missouri so eloquently put it a \ncouple of days ago, the net result was that people who must use their \nautomobiles to get back and forth to work were paying a tax to pay \nwelfare to people who were not working at all and, in some cases, had \nno intention of doing so.\n  So, Mr. President, the concentration on the removal of this tax is \nnot only based on the proposition that the American people are too \nheavily taxed as it is but on the fact that this one is peculiarly \nunfair and peculiarly unprecedented. Nevertheless, the vote was taken a \ncouple of hours ago on this floor. Once again there was an eloquent \nstatement on the part of the President's party that they would not \nallow this repeal to come to a vote.\n  The second element of that filibuster is directed at the TEAM Act, an \nact absolutely essential to validate the new sense of cooperation which \nis gaining wider and wider acceptance in labor-management relations \nacross the United States and, indeed, is necessary if we are to meet \nthe competitive pressures of the present economic world. Close to 90 \npercent of American workers in the private sector are not unionized and \nhave chosen not to be. Yet, they are prohibited from entering into \nvoluntary relationships with their employers to discuss matters of \ncommon interest, of morale, of productivity, of the very future of \ntheir jobs by a recent ruling of the Supreme Court enforced by the \nNational Labor Relations Board.\n  A TEAM Act to encourage that cooperation will be of great importance \nin enhancing American competitiveness and in making many American \nworkplaces happier and more interesting places for the vast majority of \nAmericans to spend their working hours.\n  Because of their distaste for each of these proposals, \nthe President's party, ironically enough, they are filibustering an \nincrease in the minimum wage, a proposition made out to be of urgent \nand vital importance, more important than anything else before this \nbody. Their actions speak louder than their words in this connection. \nThey are not willing to let the majority of this body make a judgment \non a gas tax repeal and on the TEAM Act while at the same time \nincreasing the minimum wage if those issues are joined together, \nthough, of course, it was originally their idea to join the minimum \nwage to an immigration bill to which it had no relationship whatsoever.\n\n  Finally, of course, Mr. President, underlying all of this bill is a \nmodest, House-passed piece of legislation to provide overdue and just \nrelief to those wrongfully fired from the White House Travel Office 2 \nyears ago and, in one case, prosecuted for actions determined not to \nhave been remotely criminal by a jury.\n  So three significant matters are now being filibustered by the \nPresident's\n\n[[Page S5003]]\n\nparty in order to protect the President from the embarrassing situation \nthat, in order to get three pieces of legislation which he has said he \nwould sign, he would also have to take one vehemently opposed by the \nchiefs of organized labor but supported by the overwhelming majority of \nAmerican men and women who are a part of these labor-management teams \nat the present time.\n  Mr. President, my advice to the majority leader is to continue on his \ncourse of action, that it is appropriate to say that we should look at \na larger world and the relationships on these pieces of legislation, \nthat we should not say to the President we will not ask you to do \nanything embarrassing, we will simply send legislation to you that you \nhave already fully endorsed both publicly and privately and anything \nthat might be a bit controversial we will allow it to be killed by \nfilibusters in the U.S. Senate. No, Mr. President, their pairing is an \nappropriate pairing.\n  I hope we will continue until we and, not at all incidentally, the \nAmerican people succeed in getting the relief to which they are \noverwhelmingly entitled.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S5002-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S5003-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY RELATIVE TO NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, AND \n          CHEMICAL WEAPONS--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 143\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 204 of the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)) and section 401(c) of the National \nEmergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)), I transmit herewith a report on \nthe national emergency declared by Executive Order No. 12938 of \nNovember 14, 1994, in response to the threat posed by the proliferation \nof nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons (``weapons of mass \ndestruction'') and of the means of delivering such weapons.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to designate the United States Courthouse at 235 \nNorth Washington Avenue in Scranton, PA, as the ``William J. Nealon \nUnited States Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n     the william j. nealon u.s. courthouse designation act of 1996\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \nname the new U.S. courthouse being constructed in Scranton, PA, for one \nof Pennsylvania's most distinguished Federal judges, Judge William \nNealon.\n  Judge Nealon was born and raised in Scranton and attended its public \nschools. After service in the Marine Corps during the Second War, Judge \nNealon graduated from Villanova University and then received a law \ndegree from Catholic University here in Washington. Returning to \nScranton to practice law, he became a widely respected trial lawyer. \nWhen a vacancy opened up on the Lackawanna County Court of Common \nPleas, Judge Nealon was appointed by President Kennedy to serve as U.S. \ndistrict judge for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. At the time of \nhis appointment, Judge Nealon was the youngest Federal judge in the \nNation.\n  Judge Nealon has served the people of the middle district of \nPennsylvania for almost 34 years since then, including over 12 years \nchief judge of the court. He has been widely respected among the bar of \nthe middle district for his intelligence, dedication, and judicial \ndemeanor. Throughout his long career, he has been considered by many to \nbe the model of a trial judge.\n  Judge Nealon has been active in many efforts to improve the \nadministration of justice across the Nation. He served as the \nrepresentative of the third circuit to the Committee on the \nAdministration of the Criminal Law of the Judicial Conference of the \nUnited States for 6 years. For 4 years he served as a member of the \nThird Circuit Judicial Council, and for 3 years, from 1987 to 1990, he \nwas elected by the other district judges in the third circuit to serve \nas a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States, the \npolicymaking body that oversees the Federal courts.\n\n[[Page S5005]]\n\n  To this record of distinction in his professional career, Judge \nNealon can add a record a community involvement matched by few others. \nIt can truly be said that Scranton is a better place because of Judge \nNealon. He is a former chairman of the board of Mercy Hospital in \nScranton, of the Scranton Catholic Youth Center, and of the University \nof Scranton. He has also served as a member of the board of Lackawanna \nJunior College, St. Michael's School for Boys, the Everhart Museum, and \nthe Scranton-Lackawanna Health and Welfare Authority. He has received \nthe Distinguished Service Award from the Boy Scouts of America and was \nthe 1995 recipient of the Champion of Youth Award of the Boys & Girls \nClubs of Scranton, in addition to numerous awards from legal and \nacademic institutions.\n  One would think that this lengthy record of accomplishment would be \nenough for any one person, but Judge Nealon has also raised an \noutstanding family. He and his wife Jean have 10 children and 26 \ngrandchildren.\n  Earlier this year, I sponsored Senate passage of a bill introduced in \nthe House by Representative Kanjorski to name the U.S. Courthouse in \nWilkes-Barre after Judge Max Rosenn of the third circuit, Wilkes-\nBarre's leading jurist. I can think of no one more deserving than Judge \nNealon of the honor of having the new U.S. Courthouse in Scranton named \nafter him.\n\n  I am pleased to introduce this legislation. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport it and that the Senate will adopt it this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1754\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Agriculture Improvement and \nReform Act providing that insurance shall be available under the \nNoninsured Crop Assistance Program for native pasture for livestock, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n the federal agriculture improvement and reform act of 1996 amendment \n                              act of 1996\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, we are having a drought \nin the State of New Mexico that is about as serious a situation as we \nhave had. We have read about the forest fires. Obviously, the forest is \ndry, but, also, the grazing land is dry. The ranchers are unable to \ngraze cattle. That is a very important part of our life in New Mexico.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill. Yesterday, I introduced one with \nSenator Bingaman. He was the prime sponsor. Today he joins me in this \none, which would take some of the assistance that is given for other \ncrops in the event of a disaster and make that apply to the forage that \ngoes for cattle. We think maybe it was intended, but it is not clear.\n  So this would provide emergency relief to some of the cattle people \nin our State and in the arid parts of America where we are having a \ndisaster with drought. It makes some of this available to them. Because \nof the forage they use for the cattle, it would make that subject to \nthe same kind of emergency assistance as other crops when those crops \nare in a drought situation.\n  Mr. President, yesterday, Senator Bingaman and I introduced a bill \nthat would provide short-term assistance for our cattle producers in \nNew Mexico and across the United States.\n  Cattle producers are suffering economically due to historically low \ncattle prices, and high feed costs.\n  In New Mexico, these conditions are made even worse by extensive \ndrought conditions, which have had an impact on some areas of the State \nfor 3 years.\n  The Bingaman-Domenici bill would provide $18 million in feed \nassistance, by extending the authority of the for the Emergency \nLivestock Feed Program through the end of this calendar year.\n  This assistance is extremely urgent for livestock producers in \ndrought-affected areas.\n  In some parts of States like New Mexico, producers typically harvest \nand store feed reserves for the coming winter during the summer months, \nwhile their livestock graze on high country summer pastures.\n  Many of these summer ranges are located on Federal land, and in order \nto prevent overuse during the drought, many of these areas will not be \navailable for grazing this year.\n  In order to maintain enough livestock to remain in business, many \nproducers will be forced to graze areas that would normally be set \naside for hay and winter feed production, leaving them little or no \nforage to get them through the coming winter.\n  The temporary extension of this program through December will allow \nthe Secretary to provide these individuals with assistance in obtaining \nthese needed feed resources.\n  Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill that will provide a \nmore permanent solution.\n  This bill would clarify in law, as is currently the case in USDA \nregulations, that native pasture for grazing livestock would qualify \nunder the Noninsured Crop Assistance Program [NAP].\n  Specifically, the bill would amend the law to read:\n\n       The term ``eligible crop'' shall include floricultural, \n     ornamental nursery and Christmas tree crops, turfgrass sod, \n     seed crops, aquaculture (including ornamental fish), native \n     pasture for livestock, and industrial crops.\n\n  NAP was created under the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1994 and \namended in the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act of 1966 \n[FAIR].\n  The NAP is a disaster program for noninsured crops. Following a major \ncrop loss, it provides benefits similar to those for insurable crops, \nbut only at the catastrophic level.\n  This is by no means a windfall for livestock producers; on the \ncontrary, catastrophic coverage provides a minimal benefit in a \ndisaster, or emergency cases of the most dire need.\n  This bill has not been scored by the Congressional Budget Office \n[CBO], however, if CBO scores a cost with the bill I will provide an \noffset to ensure that it remains budget neutral.\n  I understand that the current regulations provide NAP catastrophic \ncoverage for improved and native pasture.\n  I am concerned, however, that without the clarification provided by \nthis legislation, the inclusion of native pasture may be at risk as the \nadministration promulgates its new regulations under the FAIR Act.\n  Mr. President, I believe that failing to provide assistance to our \nranchers today will cost us tomorrow. Many communities in New Mexico \ndepend on the cattle industry.\n  In fact, livestock products accounted for $1.1 billion of cash \nreceipts for all agricultural commodities in New Mexico in 1994.\n  The support we give our livestock industry during this period of \ndrought, low prices, and high feed costs will save numerous small, \nfamily-owned business in these devastated areas.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this clarification to \nexisting law.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Kerry, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 1756.

Mr. President, pension policy decisions will \ndetermine, in no small part, the kind of life Americans will live in \ntheir older years. The amount invested in retirement savings has an \nimportant impact on our national savings rate, our economy generally, \nand the kind of life every American lives today. Now, more than ever, \ntherefore, all Americans\n\n[[Page S5006]]\n\nneed to consider the role that pensions play in determining the quality \nof life for retirees, and the implications of pension policy decisions \nfor our society as a whole.\n  Pension issues are convoluted yet critically important. I am reminded \nof a poem written by the late Karl Llewellyn, a professor at my alma \nmater, the University of Chicago, in connection with an introduction to \nthe study of the law.\n  Entitled ``The Bramble Bush,'' the poem said: ``I jumped into the \nbramble bush and scratched my eyes out; I jumped out of the bramble \nbush and scratched my eyes in again.'' As a student, I had no idea what \nhe was talking about. Later in life, I understood that he meant the \nbramble bush as an analogy to the law. One had to master the \ncomplexities and details of it--by jumping in--in order to reach \nunderstanding of the whole--upon jumping out.\n  And so it is, I think, with pension reform. The subject has been \ncalled esoteric, abstruse, mysterious, even eye glazing, but in the \nfinal analysis it is really about whether our society will arrange a \nsystem of security for people who have gone past their earning and \nworking years, or whether our society will make retirement a \ndeterminant of a widening income gap between the rich and the poor. It \nis about fairness and gender equity and economic power. It goes to the \nheart of our challenge to treat the end of life as the golden years \nrather than the disposable years. It is about the permanence of the \nAmerican dream.\n  The importance of retirement savings and investment to our Nation's \neconomy, as well as to individuals, cannot be overstated. We should \nencourage private saving, and our pension laws should reflect that \npolicy goal. It is equally important that these laws be reality based, \nand that reform should address the elimination of historical and \ninstitutional inequities and unfairness. Fairness is fundamental. \nWomen, however, have traditionally been the overlooked and silent \nunintended beneficiaries of policy decisions which reinforce \ninstitutional sexism.\n\n  Our pension system was not designed for working women, either those \nin the work force or in the home. Countless statistics show that women \nare far more likely to spend the final years of their lives in poverty. \nWomen make up 60 percent of seniors over 65 years old, but 75 percent \nof the elderly poor. An elderly woman is twice as likely as a man to \nlive below the poverty line. These women are more likely than not to \nlive alone. The demographics of mortality differences between men and \nwomen were never adequately addressed in the development of policy for \nretirement security. That a woman is more likely to be widowed, or \ndivorced in retirement was similarly not taken into account. Pension \npolicy making has traditionally been predicated on a fictionalized \nmodel of women's role in the society and the economy.\n  Over a lifetime, women earn about two-thirds of a man's income. Since \npensions are based on a formula which combine the number of years of \nwork and salary earned, women suffer a gender gap that carries over \ninto retirement. As a result, women are far more likely to receive \ninadequate pension support. Moreover, because women are more often \ncalled upon to interrupt jobs in order to raise children or care for \nsick relatives, pension security is a more illusive objective for us.\n  A 25-year-old man--on average--will spend 70 percent of his adult \nlife in the work force, while a woman will spend less than 45 percent \nof her adult life in the work force. What this can mean is that a woman \nwith a 40-year career who takes 7 years out of the work force may get \nhalf of the pension benefits she might have enjoyed with continuous \nemployment. Our real support for the care-giving role of women in our \nsociety is more accurately reflected in this fact than in all of the \nplatitudes given ``family values.''\n  For women who never enter the work force, the jeopardy of divorce or \nwidowhood can mean the difference between security and penury. It is \nestimated that nearly 80 percent of women who are poor as widows were \nnot poor before their husbands died.\n  These are costs not just borne by the individual affected directly, \nbut by our society as a whole, as the widening income gap occasioned \nand influenced by pension inequities shows up as increased demand for \ntransfer payments and public support.\n  Retirement security has been likened to a three-legged stool. Social \nSecurity, private pensions, and personal savings constitute the basis \nof an income stream for the later years of life.\n  Social Security, contrary to popular opinion, is not now nor has it \never been adequate to support a comfortable retirement. The average \nSocial Security benefit earned by a woman who worked outside the home \ntoday provides about $538 a month, less than the minimum wage. Social \nSecurity provides about 40 percent of a workers' income while working. \nOur system assumes the other legs of the stool will help make up the \ndifference.\n\n  However, only one third of private sector retirees receive a private \npension. Of those, there are essentially two variants: the defined \nbenefit plan and the defined contribution plan. The former is \nstructured around the guaranteed payout or benefit upon retirement. The \nlatter is structured around the treatment of payments into the plan \nduring the working years. It is probably a commentary on the change in \nthe climate of policy making that the traditional benefit plan is being \novertaken as the approach of choice by the newer products associated \nwith contribution plans.\n  As to personal savings, we have in this country the lowest private \nsavings rate in the industrialized world, a source of great hand \nwringing among economists and policy makers. Given that the baby boom \nis about to become the elder explosion--with a baby boomer turning 50 \nevery 7 seconds this year--efforts to promote personal frugality are \namong the policy challenges of the pension debate.\n  And yet, pensions represent a major part of the wealth of our Nation. \nThere are 700,000 private pension plans in this country worth $3.4 \ntrillion dollars (one trillion equals $1 per second for 32,000 years). \nThe Federal Government provides about $75 billion annually in tax \nincentives to encourage pension savings, a tax expenditure which has \nnever really been coordinated with the direct investment in Social \nSecurity. Pension contributions now total roughly $42 billion annually, \nmaking them the single largest source of private investment capital.\n  A playing field this vast has got to be fair to the whole community, \nand so the need for equity for women has never been greater.\n  The Congress has taken steps to correct the inequities facing women. \nIn particular, the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 made several important \nchanges, requiring that workers receive the consent of their spouses \nwith regard to retirement benefits after death. It also required that \nprivate pension plans honor State court orders to divide pension \nbenefits in divorce proceedings. This legislation made pensions \naccessible to millions of workers, widows, and divorced homemakers, but \nonly if they understand the law or the legal forms. These, and other \nreforms, have made a difference. However, the issues continue to \nconfound us, and further change is essential.\n  Pension maintenance, particularly in the context of divorce and \nwidowhood, remains a challenge. In 10 years the IRS has not come up \nwith clear guidance for the circumstances under which one can sign away \npension rights. It is time to provide for informed decisionmaking, and \nfor the equitable division of such rights in case of divorce. \nSimilarly, the rules pertaining to pension distribution among \nGovernment employees--both military and civil service--should not \npenalize the divorced or widowed spouse.\n  I am here today to introduce legislation which will begin to address \nthe problems women face as they try to hold on to their pension for \ntheir retirement. The Women's Pension Equity Act of 1996:\n  It creates a simple model of the form that a woman must sign in order \nto waive her benefits if she survives her husband.\n  And by the way, I point out that the language of the bill is gender \nneutral, so in that regard it would refer to men as well.\n  It creates a model of the form that couples must use if they wish to \ndivide a pension upon divorce that includes contingencies for pre- and \npost-retirement survivors benefits.\n  It allows a widow or divorced widow to collect their husband's civil \nservice pension if he dies after leaving his civil service job and \nbefore collecting his pension benefits.\n\n[[Page S5007]]\n\n  It allows a court that awards a woman part of her husband's civil \nservice pension upon divorce, to extend that award to any lump sum \npayment made if the husband dies before collecting benefits.\n  It extends the military pension benefits awarded to a spouse upon \ndivorce in cases where the husband rolled that pension over into a \ncivil service pension.\n  It allows a spouse to continue receiving Tier II railroad retirement \nbenefits awarded upon divorce, upon the death of her husband.\n  I should like to take a moment to further describe what these \nprovisions do and give some examples of the problems this legislation \nsolves.\n  Sometimes a woman buries her husband only to discover that she has \nnothing. Her husband did not understand--and neither did she--that if \nthey signed the survivor benefits waiver, she would get nothing if he \ndied.\n  As one woman wrote:\n\n       My husband . . . died 12/11/91. [He] and I were together \n     for 40 years . . . At . . . retirement he opt[ed] to get the \n     maximum. I know that he didn't realize what he had did \n     because he kept telling everyone that his wife would be \n     independent if he predeceased me. . . .\n       Till the day before he passed he must have know something \n     was happening to him. He told me ``you have nothing to worry \n     about.'' I was shocked when his job told, ``I would get \n     nothing''.\n  That was an actual quote, and you can see that the Syntax and the \ngrammar were a little fractionated in the letter.\n  This woman is not educated. She and her husband counted on his \npension to carry them through retirement. When they signed some pension \nforms from the company, the forms did not state clearly enough that she \nwould lose her pension if he died.\n  This happens, unfortunately, all too frequently it is a very sad \nsituation to face.\n  Women also unknowingly give up their future right to a share of their \nhusbands' pension benefits when they divorce and do not sign a complete \nQualified Domestic Relations Order, QDRO. Pensions are often the most \nvaluable asset a couple owns--earned together during their years of \nmarriage.\n  Judy Horstman of Joliet, IL, was divorced in October 1989, after 23 \nyears of marriage. She was awarded half of her husbands pension from \nhis 18 years of service with General Motors. Her husband continued to \nwork in the plant until he died in November 1990. When he died, she \nreceived no pension from General Motors. She was informed that she was \nno longer entitled to any of his benefits because her divorce decree \nonly referred to joint and survivor's benefits, not pre-retirement \nbenefits in case he died. Because he died before retirement and not \nafter, and because her lawyer forgot to put one line in writing, she \nlost her rights to a pension.\n  Judy Horstman lost her right to retain part of her husbands pension \nbecause her lawyer did not know the right questions to ask. They missed \nsomething when they wrote the Qualified Domestic Relations Order and so \nnow, 7 years later, Judy still has no pension benefits from her 24 \nyears of marriage.\n  This bill simplifies the spousal consent form so that average women \ncan read and understand it. It also simplifies the QDRO for women, \nlawyers, and businesses so everyone knows what to consider and include \nin a divorce decree.\n  And it also includes provisions to correct some of the most illogical \nparts of pension laws that are unduly harmful for women. Let me give \nyou four examples of the problems the bill will fix.\n  First, when a couple is married for 30 years, and the husband is in \nthe military, upon divorce the court can ensure that the wife receives \n50 percent of the pension benefits.\n  If, however, the husband leaves the military after the divorce, \nenters the civil service, and rolls his military pension over into his \nGovernment pension, his wife loses any claim on her spouse's pension. \nThis legislation ensures that this kind of injustice will not occur in \nthe future.\n  Second, a husband working in the civil service leaves his job to work \noutside the Government. He does not begin collecting his pension yet, \nbecause he has not yet retired.\n  If he dies after leaving the civil service and before collecting \npension benefits, his widow receives nothing. If he died while working \nin the civil service or after retirement, she would receive a \nsurvivor's pension from the Federal Government. This legislation \nensures that this kind of injustice will not occur in the future.\n  Third, a husband dies before retirement and his civil service pension \nis rolled over into a lump sum payment to whomever he names as his \nbeneficiary.\n  The courts cannot require that he name his ex-wife as a partial \nbeneficiary even if the court awarded her a portion of his pension. \nThis legislation ensures that this kind of injustice will not occur in \nthe future.\n  Fourth, an ex-wife has been awarded a portion of her husbands tier II \nrailroad retirement benefits. The tier II benefits are the equivalent \nof a private pension for the railroad retirees. The ex-husband dies and \nher Tier II benefits cease immediately.\n  In other words, at the moment he dies her private pension rights die \nwith him.\n  This legislation ensures that this kind of injustice will not occur \nin the future.\n  These are just some examples of the kinds of unjust, ridiculous, \nconfusing, and harmful pension laws this legislation addresses. These \ninitiatives help bring about equity in the pension system for married \nwomen.\n  I am keenly aware that we must address broader issues as well. And we \nwill address them. We should focus on making participation in private \npension plans easier, and not the game of roulette which all too often \nleaves people surprised at their retirement. Women, particularly, \nshould not be penalized for career interruptions by vesting rules which \nrequire long-term employment. Current vesting rules depend on 5 years \nof continuing employment. The average job tenure for women is around 4 \nyears--again, going in and out of the work force because of family \ndemands very often. Women should not be penalized for taking care of \ntheir families.\n  Portability, an issue which is even now being debated in the Congress \nin the context of health security, remains a hurdle for retirement \nsecurity.\n  The President's recently unveiled Retirement Savings and Security Act \naddresses portability in regards to the popular 401(k) plans, and is a \nwelcomed advance in this area. We need to continue to address the \nability of workers to transfer earned pensions.\n  Women who have spent many years in the work force should be able to \ncount on their own pension income during retirement. It is important \nthat we both improve the situation for women after a divorce or the \ndeath of a spouse, and the situation for women entering the work force. \nIt is important to recognize that these issues of financial security go \nhand in hand. I will continue to work with my colleagues to bring \npension equity to all aspects of the nation's pension laws.\n  Retirement security is not an expense we cannot afford. It is an \ninvestment we cannot avoid. Our economy will benefit. Our society will \nbenefit. Our people will benefit if we undertake the macro and micro \nchallenges of this issue.\n  The Bramble Bush illustrates that we are all in this together, and, \nif with Grace, we live long enough to retire it ought not be a \npunishment of longevity. The haves and have nots share an equal stake \nin the outcome of pension reform. That advocacy, in my opinion, is \npatriotism in the most classic sense, seeking to preserve the American \ndream for future generations.\n  There is no reason that this legislation cannot be enacted right \naway. The benefits are obvious and the changes simple.\n  I urge every one of my colleagues to support the rapid adoption of \nthe Pension Equity Act of 1996. This legislation is being cosponsored \nby Senator Olympia Snowe, Senator Patty Murray, and Senator John Kerry.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and a summary of its \nprovisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1756\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

For the past 10 \n     years, the IRS, at the urging of the GAO, has been preparing \n     a model consent form for couples that choose to take a larger \n     annuity during the husband's life and give up the survivor \n     annuity--but that form has never been completed.\n       Require the Department of Labor to create a model QDRO \n     form.\n       Background--The 1984 REA required pension plans to honor \n     court orders dividing pensions upon divorce. But the law does \n     not protect spouses automatically. The divorced woman, or her \n     lawyer, must ask for a court order specifically including the \n     pensions in the divorce settlement. Without a qualified \n     domestic relations order (QDRO) spelling out how, to whom, \n     and when the pension should be paid, plans don't have to pay \n     the divorced spouse a dime.\n       Problem--(1) Many lawyers do not know to ask for a QDRO. \n     (2) There are no model QDRO's for lawyers, or couples who \n     divorce without a lawyer, and pension plans will not honor \n     the orders unless they are complete. (3) Pre- and post-\n     retirement survivor benefits are often forgotten.\n\n\n                    Civil Service Retirement System\n\n       Make widow or divorced widow benefits payable no matter \n     when the ex-husband dies or starts collecting his benefits.\n       Background--If the husband dies after leaving the \n     government (either before or after retirement age) and before \n     starting to collect retirement benefits, no retirement or \n     survivor benefits are payable to the spouse or former spouse.\n       Problem--The widow or divorced wife loses everything: the \n     ex-wife's benefits never start because he didn't choose to or \n     didn't live to start collecting his benefits, and the widow's \n     benefits are canceled because he wasn't working in the \n     federal government at the time of his death.\n       Authorize courts to order the ex-husband to name his former \n     wife as the beneficiary of all or a portion of any refunded \n     contributions.\n       Background--In the case of a husband dying before \n     collecting benefits, his contributions to the CSRS are paid \n     to the person named as the ``beneficiary.'' The employee may \n     name anyone as the beneficiary.\n       Problem--A divorce court cannot order him to name his \n     former spouse as the beneficiary to receive a refund of \n     contributions upon his death, even if she was to receive a \n     portion of his pension.\n\n\n                       Military Retirement System\n\n       Transfer the pension benefits awarded during divorce from a \n     military to a civil service pension, if the spouse rolls the \n     military pension into a civil service pension.\n       Background--The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' \n     Protection Act of 1982 (USFSPA) provides that a court may \n     treat only the member's ``disposable'' retired pay as marital \n     property. The definition of disposable now includes, among \n     other deductions, government salary or pension.\n       Problem--The allowed deductions can leave former wives with \n     little if any pension. For example, if an ex-husband leaves \n     the military and enters the civil service, he can roll over \n     his military pension into his civil service pension and the \n     ex-wife loses the military pension awarded to her during the \n     divorce settlement.\n\n\n                       Railroad Retirement Board\n\n       Allow payment of a Tier 2 survivor annuity after divorce.\n       Background--The Tier 1 benefits under the Railroad \n     Retirement Board take the place of social security. The Tier \n     2 benefits take the place of a private pension.\n       Problem--Unlike the nondivorced widow, the divorced widow \n     loses any Tier 2 benefits she may have been receiving while \n     her ex-husband was alive, leaving her with only a Tier 1 \n     annuity.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Moseley-\nBraun today in cosponsoring the Women's Pension Equity Act of 1996. \nThis legislation addresses one of the most important issues facing \nwomen today--retirement security. Of course, both men and women share \nmany of the same concerns about growing old and planning for the \nfuture. But, the fact is that women face a unique set of circumstances \nthat put us at a disadvantage for living comfortably in our retirement.\n  We are all very aware of the anxiety being felt by our friends and \nneighbors as they see and hear about the wave of corporate downsizing \ntaking place in many of America's largest industries. American workers \nno longer expect to hold down one or two jobs throughout their working \ncareers. Rather, most Americans expect to hold five or six different \njobs throughout their careers.\n  This job insecurity ripples through every aspect of our lives and \nimpacts the way one determines how to afford a home, pay for a child's \neducation, and set aside savings for retirement.\n  This anxiety is real and it is justified. Working families throughout \nWashington State are telling me they are worried about their futures \nand that of their children. My constituents recognize the skyrocketing \ncosts of long-term health care, doubt whether they can ensure a \nsuccessful and prosperous life for their children, and are losing faith \nin the Social Security system.\n  We all know that women often play the role of caregiver for sick \nparents or children. In this role, they are forced to leave their jobs \nand, in turn, jeopardize their own future security. As the daughter of \ntwo aging parents, I understand this anxiety and want to do all I can \nto ensure women are not penalized for doing the right thing--for taking \ncare of their families.\n  In today's world, it takes two incomes to raise a family. This is not \nsolely an issue of improving the security of retired women. This is \nabout providing stability and peace of mind for working families and \ntheir children. It is about opportunities for the future and \nstrengthening the resources that families can depend on tomorrow. This \nis about ensuring that both parents' hard work is rewarded.\n  The Women's Pension Equity Act corrects current pension laws, which \noften fail to account for the special pattern in a women's working \nlife. Our employment patterns differ from our male counterparts in the \nwork force. Women's tenures tend to be shorter--4.8 years compared with \n6.6 years for men. Many women leave their jobs before they reach the \nrequired years of service to qualify for employer retirement plans; \nusually 5 to 7 years.\n  Also, under current law, if a woman's husband dies after leaving \nGovernment service but before starting to collect retirement benefits, \nno retirement or survivor benefits are payable to the spouse. This \nbill, among other things, will amend the Civil Service retirement \nsystem to make sure the spouse doesn't lose the benefits to which her \nfamily is entitled.\n  We can alleviate some of the anxiety Americans are experiencing. For \ninstance, we can help Americans save for their future by expanding \npension opportunities for the employees of small businesses. Only 24 \npercent of all employees in small businesses have pension plans, while \n76 percent of employees in large businesses have pension plans. Or we \ncould widen the scope of Individual Retirement Accounts. For instance, \nI am a cosponsor of S. 287, a bill that allows spouses who work at home \nto get a full IRA deduction.\n  Congress has the ability to improve the savings opportunities for \nmillions of Americans, and Senator Moseley-Braun's bill will do so for \nmillions of working and retired women. This legislation makes sense and \nsuccessfully highlights the discrepancy that exists between male and \nfemale retirees and it lays out several ways to narrow the income \ndivide that exists between them.\n  The facts are clear. Older women are twice as likely as older men to \nbe poor. According to the Older Women's League, more than 70 percent of \nnearly 4 million persons over 65 living in poverty are women. Fewer \nthan 25 percent of older women receive any pension income. And in 1993, \nthe median pension benefit received by new female retirees was half \nthat of men. Given all this, we must keep in mind that once they reach \n65 women live on average 4 years longer than men.\n  This bill helps Americans save for the future, and it will make \nretirement life more secure for millions of women. It is an important \nfirst step to addressing the many obstacles which women face as they \ntry to plan for their futures and those of their children. I commend \nSenator Moseley-Braun for her leadership on this issue, and I look \nforward to working with her on behalf of working families across our \nNation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nWomen's Pension Equity Act of 1996, and to thank Senator Moseley-Braun \nand Senators Mikulski, Murray, Boxer, and Feinstein for their \nleadership on this important issue.\n\n[[Page S5010]]\n\n  Mr. President, women are five times as likely to live out their final \nyears below the poverty line. Research also indicates that almost 80 \npercent of widows living in poverty were not poor because their \nhusbands died--while the same is not generally true of men, according \nto the General Accounting Office.\n  I am proud to say that my wife, Teresa Heinz, contributed important \nwork toward this bill. In April, she sponsored a conference in Boston \nentitled ``Women, Widows, and Pensions--The Unfinished Agenda.'' \nSenator Moseley-Braun was the keynote speaker and I believe many of the \ninsights from the conference contributed to this bill.\n  But I also want to highlight a letter from a woman named Marian from \nAttleboro, MA. She wrote me recently that she just turned 81 years old \nand worked from 1934 to 1994. Because of family responsibilities, she \nhad to take a total of 7 years off from work to raise her children. She \nsaid that since her various jobs paid less than what a man would make, \nshe now receives a worker's benefit that is less than one-half the \nbenefit that was earned by her husband when he was alive.\n  Mr. President, current pension laws do not take into account the \ncircumstances of women in the work force. This bill takes an important \nstep toward correcting pension inequities and helps to redress the \noverwhelming poverty suffered by older women.\n  The bill would require the IRS to create a model form for spousal \nconsent for survivor annuities so that couples understand the \nconsequences of taking a larger annuity during the husband's life and \ngiving up the survivor annuity. The bill would also require the \nDepartment of Labor to create a model order so divorced spouses get the \npensions they deserve.\n  Ultimately, we need fundamental reforms to address these pressing \nissues. Fewer women than men receive pensions and they receive less \nbecause they have fewer years in the work force: the average woman \nspends 11.5 years out of the work force largely due to greater time \nspent in nonpaying caregiving roles. Additionally, women earn less than \nmen and are more likely to change jobs frequently and be affected by \nlack of pension portability and high vesting hurdles.\n  But, Mr. President, along with the President's recent pension \ninitiative the Retirement Savings and Security Act, this bill will move \ntoward a day when the laws governing our Nation's pension system are \ntruly gender neutral and older women are not faced with living their \nfinal years in poverty.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 1757. A bill to amend the Developmental Disabilities Assistance \nand Bill of Rights Act to extend the act, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n  extension of the developmental disabilities assistance and bill of \n                               rights act\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today I am introducing a simple \nextension of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of \nRights Act. This act is the result of more than 25 years of national \nbipartisan collaboration to secure basic rights for our Nation's most \nvulnerable citizens.\n  Before the Developmental Disabilities Act was signed in 1970, \nAmericans who happened to be born with developmental disabilities such \nas mental retardation and severe physical disabilities often lived and \ndied in institutions where many were subjected to unspeakable \nconditions far worse than conditions found in any American prison.\n  As a nation, we had a lot to learn about how we could help people \nwith developmental disabilities live more independent and more \nproductive lives. We had a lot to learn about: How to help families \nfind the strength to bring up their children with developmental \ndisabilities in their family home; how to teach children with \ndevelopmental disabilities in our schools; how to make room for these \ncitizens to live and work in the heart of our communities; and how to \nensure safe and humane living environments for those citizens with \ndevelopmental disabilities who remain in residential facilities.\n  It has taken courage to face the fact that we had so much to learn. \nBecause of the Developmental Disabilities Act, we have made tremendous \nprogress across the Nation in all of these areas--education, living \narrangements, and meaningful participation in community activities for \nmany individuals with developmental disabilities. We are still \nlearning.\n  When we reauthorize the Developmental Disabilities Act, we show that \nwe support programs that help people with developmental disabilities \ncontinue to live independent and productive lives--and with as little \nbureaucracy and government intrusion as possible.\n  This goal was almost unthinkable two decades ago. New technology, new \nservices, new professional practices, and new ways of thinking about \nAmericans who have the most severe and life-long disabilities have \ncreated opportunities beyond what we thought possible. Research has \nshown that the DD Act programs make significant contributions to this \nprogress, and they do it with minimal Federal control.\n  The DD Act programs are flexible and responsive to the needs of \nconsumers--people with developmental disabilities and their families--\nin each State. Federal funding is limited, so successful programs must \nleverage Federal funds by seeking State grants and training contracts, \nand grants from other sources. The programs have demonstrated that they \ncan be cost-effective while attaining good results for the people who \nuse them.\n  Since the DD Act was originally authorized, it has created a lean \ninfrastructure of programs including, in each state, a university \naffiliated program to educate university students in developmental \ndisabilities-related fields and to conduct research and training to \nmeet the needs of State agencies; a Developmental Disabilities Council \nappointed by the Governor of each State to define and carry out State \ninitiatives; and a protection and advocacy organization to provide \nlegal assistance to persons with developmental disabilities, especially \nthose who are living in institutions.\n  DD Act networks have been successful at creating new service models \nfor people with developmental disabilities without creating new \nbureaucracies. With the 1994 amendments, made only 2 years ago, we can \nreauthorize it as it stands today and know that the continuous \nimprovements we expect will be sought. As a nation, we are now able to \ncreate opportunities for many Americans with developmental disabilities \nto live and work in our communities, where services are decentralized \nand cost-effective. From this success, we have identified new \nchallenges, and we still need to work to improve these community-based \nprograms so they can meet any client's needs.\n  Clearly, our work is not finished.

Res. 254\n\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1791, President George Washington commissioned \n     Pierre Charles L'Enfant to draft a blueprint for America's \n     capital city; they envisioned Pennsylvania Avenue as a bold, \n     ceremonial boulevard physically linking the U.S. Capitol \n     building and the White House, and symbolically the \n     Legislative and Executive branches of government.\n       (2) An integral element of the District of Columbia, \n     Pennsylvania Avenue stood for 195 years as a vital, working, \n     unbroken roadway, elevating it into a place of national \n     importance as ``America's Main Street''.\n       (3) 1600 Pennsylvania, the White House, has become \n     America's most recognized address and a primary destination \n     of visitors to the Nation's Capital; ``the People's House'' \n     is host to 5,000 tourist daily, and 15,000,000 annually.\n       (4) As home to the President, and given its prominent \n     location on Pennsylvania Avenue and its proximity to the \n     People, the White House has become a powerful symbol of \n     freedom, openness, and an individual's access to their \n     government.\n       (5) On May 20, 1995, citing possible security risks from \n     vehicles transporting terrorist bombs, President Clinton \n     ordered the Treasury Department and the Secret Service to \n     close Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic for two blocks \n     in front of the White House.\n       (6) By impeding access and imposing undue hardships upon \n     tourists, residents of the District, commuters, and local \n     business owners and their customers, the closure of \n     Pennsylvania Avenue, undertaken without the counsel of the \n     government of the District of Columbia, has replaced the \n     former openness of the area surrounding the White House with \n     barricades, additional security checkpoints, and an \n     atmosphere of fear and distrust.\n       (7) In the year following the closure of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue, the taxpayers have borne a tremendous burden for \n     additional security measures along the Avenue near the White \n     House.\n       (8) While the security of the President is of grave concern \n     and is not to be taken lightly, the need to assure the \n     President's safety must be balanced with the expectation of \n     freedom inherent in a democracy; the present situation is \n     tilted far too heavily toward security at freedom's expense.\n\n     SEC. 2 SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the President should \n     order the immediate, permanent reopening to vehicular traffic \n     of Pennsylvania in front of the White House, restoring the \n     Avenue to its original state and returning it to the People.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, in just 6 days, the closing of Pennsylvania \nAvenue in front of the White House will mark its 1-year anniversary.\n  I rise today to speak for the 15 million tourists who visit the \nNation's Capital each year, the local businessmen and women whose \nlivelihoods depend upon open access, the government of the District of \nColumbia, the commuters who rely on our roads, and the people who call \nWashington, DC, home. On their behalf, I am submitting a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that Pennsylvania Avenue be reopened \nto traffic and returned to its historic use. The May 20th closing is \none anniversary we should not have to commemorate.\n  This resolution has the support of many with strong ties to the \nWashington community. I am grateful to have the endorsement of District \nof Columbia Mayor Marion Barry, and I am also proud that D.C. Council \nChairman David Clarke and Councilmember Frank Smith support this \neffort. I ask unanimous consent that statements from Mayor Barry and \nChairman Clarke and Councilmember Smith be included in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAMS. In addition, my resolution has the strong support of more \nthan a dozen of the area's residential, business, and historical \norganizations representing thousands of job providers and the \nDistrict's half million residents. I ask unanimous consent to submit \nthis list and supporting letters for printing in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor several times over the past \nyear to voice my concerns about the closure of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  I have talked about the damage it has done to Washington's business \ncommunity, and the fear that it is scaring off new jobs and prompting \npotential retail and commercial tenants to stay away from the downtown \narea. I have talked about the damage it has done to Washington's \nbusiness community, and the fear that it's scaring off new jobs and \nprompting potential retail and commercial tenants to stay away from the \ndowntown area. I have discussed the hardships caused by the closing for \nanyone whose paycheck depends on access to the avenue, people like cab \ndrivers and tour bus operators. I have outlined problem after problem \nthe closing has created for the District itself, which had one of its \nmajor arteries unilaterally severed by the Federal Government without \nany consultation. I have discussed the inconvenience of our tourists, \nespecially the elderly and disabled, many of whom are now being \ndeprived of a close look at the White House. And I have talked about \nthe tremendous cost for the taxpayers, a cost which has already reached \ninto the millions of dollars.\n  I have raised each of those aspects of the closing because they are \nall relevant and pressing concerns. But that is not what I want to \ndiscuss today. There is another side to this issue that is easy to \noverlook amid all the other more obvious problems: the question of what \nthe closing of Pennsylvania Avenue has done to the psyche of this city, \nand what we give up when we give in to fear.\n  The air was thick with fear in the weeks following April 19, 1995, \nwhen terrorists attacked the Federal building in Oklahoma City. How \ncould something like this happen within our own borders, people \nwondered. And fear took hold. That was certainly the atmosphere in \nWashington--an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust that prompted the \nTreasury Department to close down two blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue a \nmonth after the tragic Oklahoma City bombing.\n  Now, obviously, protecting the President and those who work and visit \nthe White House must be a primary concern, a matter never to be taken \nlightly. The occupant of the Oval Office deserves every reasonable \nmeasure of security we can provide. So if the Secret Service had \ninformation that the White House was a terrorist target and the \nPresident was in danger, then it was absolutely prudent at the time to \nclose Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  But that was an entire year ago, and a decision that may have \nappeared prudent then strikes many as regrettable and short-sighted \ntoday. Rather than helping the Nation face down our fear, the \nGovernment's decision to close Pennsylvania Avenue--and keep it \nclosed--has only perpetuated it.\n  This is the White House today. Not a pretty sight, is it? The stretch \nof Pennsylvania Avenue that stood for 195 years as ``America's Main \nStreet'' is empty of any traffic--more a vacant lot than a working \nstreet.\n\n[[Page S5012]]\n\n  Gone is the thrill for visitors of driving by the White House for the \nfirst time--the concrete barricades, traffic sawhorses, and ever-\npresent patrol vehicles and armed officers have put an end to that.\n  Gone, too, is the sense of openness that inspired generations of \nvisitors to feel close to the Presidency and their Government when they \nvisited the Executive Mansion.\n  Today, there is an ominous atmosphere at the White House that you \nfeel nowhere else in Washington. Visitors seem more to be tolerated \nthan welcomed, and the fortress-like effect they discover there is \nunnerving.\n  I have no doubt that the place is secure--as secure as a bunker. But \nthe price we have paid for all this security is immense because it has \ncome at the expense of freedom.\n  Was it not Benjamin Franklin who warned against ``giving up essential \nliberty to obtain a little temporary safety''? And liberty is precisely \nwhat we have given up by closing off Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  While we may have obtained some temporary safety, we have surrendered \nto fear in order to get it, even though one of the first lessons we \nteach our young people in their American history classes is that \nfreedom cannot coexist with fear.\n   Mr. President, a visit to the Nation's capital can have a profound \nimpact on the schoolchildren who visit here every year. It is a place \nwhere history comes alive, and every monument, museum, and historic \nsite they visit is a page right out of the textbooks.\n  The feeling they get by being immersed in history can not be \nduplicated in a classroom, and I know that a trip to Washington, DC has \ninspired many, many young people to seek careers in public service.\n  But how confused they must be when they visit the White House. Before \ntravelling here, they have studied the Revolutionary War.\n  They have read the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. \nConstitution. They have been taught that the foundation upon which this \nNation was built was our absolute right to be free from oppression. It \nis that freedom, we tell them--a freedom we hold sacred, and treasure \nabove all else--that makes this Nation so different from any other.\n  So what do you suppose goes through their minds when they at last \nvisit the home of their President and find it barricaded behind all \nthat concrete?\n  The preamble to the Constitution, with its talk of securing the \nblessings of liberty, must ring awfully hollow if this is what liberty \nreally looks like.\n  What lesson are we teaching them about the freedom we claim to value \nso highly? What kind of message are we sending our children when they \ndiscover that the very center of the free world is not so very free \nafter all?\n  I can tell you what they are thinking. I visit the White House two or \nthree times a month, and I have heard their comments and seen the \ndisappointment in their faces. They tell me it is shameful, it is \ndisappointing, and it is wrong.\n  If there is a compelling reason to keep Pennsylvania Avenue \npermanently closed, I hope someone will step forward and make their \ncase. I have been asking the question for nearly a year now, and have \nnot yet heard a reasonable answer.\n  The monetary cost of shutting Pennsylvania Avenue down has been \nenormous Mr. President, but the emotional cost of keeping it closed \nforever would be devasting.\n  We may only be talking about two, short blocks, but those two blocks \nhave represented freedom and access since nearly the birth of this \nNation.\n  While we must never allow ourselves to become reckless about our \nsecurity, it is equally true that we must never allow ourselves to \nbecome reckless about our freedom, either, especially when freedom is \nrepresented by such a visible symbol as the White House.\n  The way Pennsylvania Avenue looks today, well, that is just not the \nAmerica, envisioned by our Founding Fathers. It is certainly not the \nAmerica John Kennedy spoke of in his 1961 inaugural address:\n\n       Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, \n     that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any \n     hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to \n     assure the survival and success of liberty.\n\n  That resolve may have softened on Pennsylvania Avenue, but it is not \ntoo late to rekindle that spirit.\n  I believe that good sense will prevail and the avenue will reopen. \nAnd someday, Mr. President, when they are old enough to appreciate what \nit all means, I will take my grandchildren to the White House.\n  I will show them the home of the Presidents--great leaders like \nThomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln, who defined liberty for a young \nNation and ensured that this would forever be a place where freedom \ncould flourish.\n  And when they realized that the President lives in a house just like \nthey do, along a street a lot like theirs, my grandchildren will smile.\n  Castles and kings require moats and crocodiles, but Presidents, well, \nthey make their homes in houses, set on busy streets, in the hearts of \nbusy cities. Open and accessible. And that is just the way Presidents \nought to live.\n  My grandchildren may not understand just what liberty and freedom \nreally mean, but they will feel its powerful presence and I hope they \nwill be inspired.\n  There are a thousand good reasons to reopen Pennsylvania Avenue, Mr. \nPresident, but only one reason I can see for keeping it closed, and \nthat is fear. We cannot allow fear to claim this victory.\n  We cannot allow the 1-year anniversary of the closing of Pennsylvania \nAvenue to pass without this Senate taking a stand on the side of \nfreedom.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     We Support the Senate Resolution Calling For The Reopening of \n            Pennsylvania Avenue In Front of the White House\n\n       District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry.\n       D.C.

The effects on \n     traffic patterns and drivers' convenience, business income, \n     parking revenue, and most important, public access to the \n     White House, have all been significant.\n       I hope that your legislation expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that Pennsylvania Avenue be reopened in front of the \n     White House can be approved. I would appreciate your \n     conveying my support for such legislation to your colleagues.\n       Please contact me or my staff if you have any questions or \n     requests that I can help with. Again, thank you for your \n     understanding and appreciation of the consequences of the \n     blockades.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Marion Barry, Jr.,\n     Mayor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n      Statement of D.C. Council Chairman David A. Clarke and D.C. \n                       Councilmember Frank Smith\n\n       We wholeheartedly support and applaud the effort by Senator \n     Rod Grams and others to reopen Pennsylvania Avenue in front \n     of the White House to vehicular traffic--and thereby restore \n     this most public of public streets to its historic use.\n       District of Columbia residents, businesses and visitors \n     have suffered for one year with the constant traffic \n     gridlock, uncompensated economic costs, and loss of freedom \n     from this vehicular barricade between the east and west ends \n     of America's historic main street and our downtown. We call \n     upon the federal government to pay for the entire cost of \n     identifying and mitigating every adverse impact which has \n     resulted from the federal government's vehicular restrictions \n     in the economic and historic heart of the nation's capital.\n       In July 1995 the Council of the District of Columbia \n     unanimously adopted a resolution expressing concerns about \n     the restriction of vehicular access to streets around the \n     White House, which now also applies to restrictions\n\n[[Page S5013]]\n\n     placed upon other streets around certain Congressional and \n     other federal buildings in Washington.

Rod Grams,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Dirksen Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grams: On behalf of the Greater Washington \n     Board of Trade's membership, I applaud your efforts to reopen \n     the 1600 block of Pennsylvania Avenue and offer whatever \n     assistance this organization might provide. As a \n     representative of over 1,000 businesses located in the \n     greater Washington region, we have heard from many of our \n     members about the impact that the street closing has had on \n     their businesses. In short, the closing of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue, paired with the closing of the parallel section of E \n     Street between 15th and 17th Streets, has resonated \n     throughout the District of Columbia's road system. The \n     resulting gridlock is, at best, impeding the mobility of \n     business people, residents and tourists.\n       Of even greater concern is the likelihood that this is just \n     the beginning of an imposing security trend; already we have \n     heard rumors that additional street closings will occur \n     Street closings cannot be an appropriate solution to security \n     concerns; rather, they are nothing more than a ``cure by \n     amputation.'' Already, the Pennsylvania Avenue experiment has \n     demonstrated the crippling effect such a policy has on \n     traffic flow, and additional street closings would further \n     exacerbate the difficulty of doing business in the District \n     of Columbia.\n       In your April 29th letter to President Clinton, you cite \n     the rich history of Pennsylvania Avenue as ``America's Main \n     Street'' and its symbolism of freedom, openness and access to \n     government. But equally important are the more direct \n     economic impacts that the street closing has imposed on the \n     operation of the District of Columbia. Traffic on surrounding \n     streets has reportedly increased far beyond capacity, despite \n     efforts by the local government and the Federal Highway \n     Administration to create one way corridors traveling east and \n     west to improve traffic flow. And while rush hour traffic has \n     always been difficult, travel times across the downtown \n     business district have more than doubled even during the \n     mid-day hours.\n       Although many people consider Washington, DC to be only the \n     home of the federal government, the City has a significant \n     private sector community. A large number of those businesses \n     are service oriented, requiring them to remain accessible to \n     clients and customers. Thus, the closing of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue is creating a hardship on the city's private sector, \n     and in many cases, forcing them to reconsider whether they \n     must relocate their operation outside of the District. In a \n     city that is struggling to cope with dwindling revenues and \n     the skyrocketing costs of human services, this is just one \n     more factor contributing to the problems faced by the local \n     government, the Congressionally appointed financial control \n     board, and inevitably, the Congress in its role as steward of \n     the Nation's Capital.\n       The business community recognizes that the safety of the \n     President of the United States must be the top priority in \n     decisions such as these. We believe, however that there may \n     be more appropriate alternatives that would sufficiently \n     mitigate potential security risks without shutting down the \n     Nation's Capital piece by piece.\n       A decision to reopen Pennsylvania Avenue would go a long \n     way to toward restoring mobility in the Nation's Capital. \n     This is important to the people who live and work here every \n     day, but it is also important to the millions of visitors who \n     come from all 50 states. Should there be a decision to \n     revisit the closing of Pennsylvania Avenue, the Greater \n     Washington Board of Trade would be happy to work with \n     Congress, the Executive Branch and the local government to \n     identify more realistic options for improving security in the \n     Nation's Capital. Thank you for your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joseph T. Boyle,\n                                         Chair, KPMG Peat Marwick.\n     John Milliken,\n     Chair, Venable, Baetjer and Howard.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              District of Columbia\n\n\n                                Building Industry Association,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 6, 1996.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: I am writing to you in my capacity \n     as president of the District of Columbia Building Industry \n     Association. Our Association represents several thousand \n     business people in the District of Columbia.\n       It has been almost one year since the executive order of \n     the Secretary of the Treasury was issued restricting traffic \n     on Pennsylvania Avenue, State Place and Executive Avenue. We \n     understand that this was a very difficult directive for you \n     to sign and that you had resisted several efforts by the \n     Secret Service to restrict traffic in the vicinity of the \n     White House in the past. While we in the Washington, D.C. \n     business community were concerned about the process whereby \n     this major traffic conduit was closed, the business community \n     and citizens generally did not object to this action given \n     the circumstances at that time.\n       In the past year, we have had time to experience the \n     results of this action and feel it is time to reexamine this \n     situation. Of course, your safety and the safety of the First \n     Family and your staff are of paramount importance to all of \n     us as citizens of the United States. However, the rerouting \n     of traffic around the White House has resulted in serious \n     traffic congestion on a daily basis, and exacerbated traffic \n     problems during special events which are constant in \n     Washington, DC, such as the Cherry Blossom Festival. \n     Moreover, it has divided our city into an East and a West \n     side causing both commerce and tourism to suffer negative \n     economic consequences at the same time they are impacted by \n     the City's debilitating fiscal crisis. These combined \n     circumstances have had a disastrous effect on business and \n     trade in DC.\n       While the emergency temporary restriction of traffic on \n     these streets was warranted by the unique circumstances at \n     that time, we do not feel this should be viewed and accepted \n     as the long term solution to these security issues. Right \n     now, there is a team of architects employed by the U.S. \n     Government meeting to discuss alternatives for closing \n     Pennsylvania Avenue prior to the official, legal closing of \n     the street itself. We believe that alternative methods to \n     provide long term improved security to the White House, such \n     as structural reinforcements, improved fencing, electronic \n     surveillance, limited traffic on adjacent streets to cars \n     only, etc. should be reconsidered now. These alternatives may \n     actually be more economical than the closing of these streets \n     and certainly will be less costly in terms of diminished \n     national prestige.\n       With the end of the Cold War five years ago, our country is \n     more secure than at any time in this century. Since this time \n     of relative peace is due in large part to American \n     leadership, it is truly ironic that symbolically we are \n     retreating by further limiting access to and around the White \n     House. One could only imagine the outcry by Parisians if the \n     French Government closed the Champs-Elysees in front of the \n     Presidential Palace. Washingtonians have been very patient \n     and understanding with the temporary closing of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue, the most important street in the L'Enfant Plan. But \n     now is the time to search for a better long term solution.\n       Just as we are sure you would reject suggestions that you \n     limit your personal interaction with the American people such \n     as your daily jogging, town meetings and other high-risk \n     interactions with the public, we urge you to reconsider this \n     highly visible statement to the American people and \n     international tourists and reopen Pennsylvania Avenue.\n       So while we fully support the temporary measures taken by \n     your administration to restrict traffic around the White \n     House, we urge you to set up a task force to find alternate \n     means of providing adequate security for the White House with \n     the ultimate goal of reopening these streets by Inauguration \n     Day 1997. Our Association is prepared to participate in this \n     task force and provide whatever resources are necessary in \n     order to accomplish this goal.\n           Sincerely yours.\n                                                 Thomas W.

Robert E. Rubin,\n     Secretary, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Rubin: I am writing to you in my capacity as \n     Chairman of the Legislative and Governmental Affairs \n     Committee of the District of Columbia Building Industry \n     Association (``DCBIA'').\n       For your information, DCBIA is comprised of over 275 member \n     organizations and over 1,000 individuals ranging from \n     lenders, property owners, developers, property managers, \n     construction companies, contractors, subcontractors, \n     architects, engineers, lawyers, accountants, and others \n     involved in the real estate industry. In other words, those \n     who finance, own, develop, renovate, upgrade, improve and \n     manage real property in the District, together with all of \n     the providers of the additional services necessary to the \n     real estate industry.\n       May 19, 1996 will mark the first anniversary of your \n     directive to the Director of the United States Secret Service \n     to close a portion of Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. and certain \n     other streets. This emergency, temporary directive was \n     intended to enhance the perimeter security of the White \n     House. Under applicable federal law, your authority to \n     prohibit vehicular traffic on public streets is temporary in \n     nature, and is predicated on certain findings of fact which \n     must be applicable at the time of the initial directive and \n     at all times thereafter while the directive remains in \n     effect.\n       DCBIA believes that now is an appropriate time to undertake \n     a number of endeavors, including but not limited to, \n     reexamining the factual determinations of one year ago, \n     confirming that the Department of the Treasury is in \n     compliance with the requirements of the National \n     Environmental Policy Act, the Advisory Council on Historic \n     Preservation, the Department of Transportation's Federal \n     Highway Administration, the Department of\n\n[[Page S5014]]\n\n     the Interior's Comprehensive Design Plan for the White House, \n     the National Park Service, the National Capital Planning \n     Commission, and all other applicable local and Federal \n     requirements.\n       Now is also an appropriate time to reexamine the economic, \n     physical and psychological impact of the street closures on \n     the many thousands of American citizens that have had to bear \n     the direct and immediate impact of your directive. Some of \n     these people travel to the Nation's capital daily for their \n     jobs and businesses, while others are visitors from places \n     near and far. All of them have shared the serious and \n     significant delays, detours and related problems of the \n     street closures. The serious negative impact upon the local \n     business community has become difficult if not impossible to \n     accurately assess. The directive has simply divided our city \n     to the detriment of all, and has fostered a ``bunker \n     mentality'' among the citizens of the city, many of whom \n     observe, on a daily basis, the barricades, uniformed Secret \n     Service personnel and similar indicia of a city under siege \n     directly in front of the Presidential residence.\n       DCBIA wishes to be absolutely clear on the issue of the \n     safety of the President and the First Family. It is not a \n     question of whether or not any of us doubt the supreme \n     importance of protecting the President of the United States. \n     We assert emphatically that the security of the President is \n     and should be of profound importance to every American \n     citizen, and every person who loves freedom and democracy. \n     But at the same time, the directive issued in the name of \n     safety and security is quite simply killing the city. When \n     people cannot move freely and easily it impacts productivity \n     and commerce. But the impact does not stop there. Eventually \n     there are psychological and spiritual effects that are no \n     less real or important. The District of Columbia cannot \n     afford to make it more difficult than it already is to work, \n     play and live here. The directive issued almost one year ago \n     is doing just that.\n       DCBIA urges you and your staff, in conjunction with other \n     public officials, to reopen the entire issue of the street \n     closures for full and fair consideration. DCBIA seeks to be \n     an active participant in this process and is committed to \n     using its resources to help reopen Pennsylvania Avenue.\n       We look forward to your response and appreciate having this \n     opportunity to raise this matter with you.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Nelson F. Migdal,\n\n                                Chairman, Legislative/Governmental\n     Affairs Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S5011-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I'd like to take a few minutes of \nSenate business today to talk about chronic fatigue and immune \ndysfunction syndrome [CFIDS].\n  Mr. President, this past Sunday, May 12, marked the observance of \nInternational CFIDS Awareness Day. While the CFIDS Association of \nAmerica coordinated a national awareness and educational campaign with \nrespect to CFIDS, I'd like to make particular mention of the efforts of \nan organization in Pennsylvania, the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome \nAssociation of the Lehigh Valley.\n  The severity of chronic fatigue syndrome is largely unknown to the \nAmerican public, and the observance on May 12th served as a very \nimportant and worthwhile opportunity to inform, educate, and increase \nthe awareness of the illness. I commend the Lehigh Valley organization \nfor their tireless efforts in combating CFIDS and for their \nparticipation and coordination of activities on May 12. In recognition \nof their efforts, I would like to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues the following proclamation, and I encourage the Senate's \nconsideration and endorsement.\n\n                              Proclamation\n\n       Whereas, the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Association of the \n     Lehigh Valley joins the CFIDS Association of America in \n     observing May 12, 1996 as International Chronic Fatigue and \n     Immune Dysfunction Syndrome Awareness Day; and\n       Whereas, chronic fatigue syndrome is a complex illness \n     affecting many different body systems and is characterized by \n     neurological, rheumatological and immunological problems; \n     incapacitating fatigue; and numerous other long-term severely \n     debilitating symptoms; and\n       Whereas, while there has been increased activity at the \n     national, State and local levels, continued education and \n     training of health professionals is imperative in garnering \n     greater public awareness of this serious health problem and \n     in supporting patients and their families; and\n       Whereas, although research has been strengthened by the \n     efforts of the Centers for Disease Control, the National \n     Institutes of Health, and other private research \n     institutions, the CFS Association of the Lehigh Valley \n     recognizes that much more must be done to encourage further \n     research so that the mission we share with the CFIDS \n     Association of America, ``to conquer CFIDS and related \n     disorders'', can be achieved. Therefore, be it Resolved, that \n     the United States Senate hereby commends the designation of \n     May 12, 1996 as CFIDS Awareness Day and applauds the efforts \n     of those battling the illness.\n\n  I appreciate the Senate's consideration of this issue, and thank my \ncolleagues for their attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S5014-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5014-S5016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ADVISORY BOARD ON WELFARE INDICATORS APPOINTED\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, just last week, on May 7, the \nHouse of Representatives appointed its four members of the Advisory \nBoard on Welfare\n\n[[Page S5015]]\n\nIndicators, as provided by the Welfare Indicators Act of 1994, \nincorporated in the Social Security Act amendments of that year. The \nmeasure was introduced on the first day of the 103d Congress, January \n31, 1993, the first legislative day that is, and signed just at the end \nof that Congress. In a floor statement at the time of introduction, I \nnoted that the measure was directly modeled on the Employment Act of \n1946. This was a statement of a large national goal, accompanied by \nprovision for an annual assessment of progress toward that goal. \nCongress declared it to be the continuing policy and responsibility of \nthe Federal Government to promote maximum employment, production, and \npurchasing power. Words at first, but great consequences followed in \nour ability to measure and understand these purposes. I stated on the \nfloor:\n\n       Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Welfare \n     Dependency Act of 1993. The purpose of the bill, which is \n     directly modeled on the Employment Act of 1946, is to declare \n     it the policy and the responsibility of the Federal \n     Government to strengthen families and promote their self-\n     sufficiency. To this end, the bill directs the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services to conduct a study to determine \n     which statistics, if collected and analyzed on a regular \n     basis, would be most useful in tracking and predicting \n     welfare dependency. Within 2 years, the Secretary would \n     report the conclusions to Congress, and, a year later, would \n     submit a first report on dependency. Thereafter, reports \n     would be submitted annually. These reports would include \n     annual numerical goals for recipients and expenditures within \n     each public welfare program. For the interim, the bill \n     establishes a goal of reducing dependency to 10 percent of \n     families with children.\n       For the first time in American history the largest \n     proportion of persons in poverty are to be found among \n     children, not among adults or among the aged. This is new. \n     When we first began to notice this trend in the 1960's, it \n     seemed that we had discovered something uniquely American. \n     Then we began to get the returns of the Luxembourg Income \n     Survey. Children, it seems, are poorer than adults in all \n     manner of places: Australia, Canada, Germany, England, as \n     well as the United States. For too long we have been trying \n     to measure a postindustrial phenomenon--dependency--with \n     statistics designed to track industrial-era phenomena.\n       We used to know something about how to predict welfare \n     dependency. In the early 1960's when I was Assistant \n     Secretary in the Department of Labor for Policy, Planning, \n     and Research, we found that there was an extraordinary \n     correlation between male unemployment and new welfare cases \n     from the period starting in 1946 up to about 1958-59. Then \n     the correlation weakened, until finally in 1963 the lines \n     crossed and the relationship became negative--the lower the \n     unemployment rate, the higher the number of AFDC cases. Now, \n     even during prosperous periods for our Nation, a shockingly \n     high percentage of our children are dependent on public \n     support.\n       We do have some data on the magnitude of this problem, if \n     not its origins. Back in the 1960's the Office of Economic \n     Opportunity had the good sense to put up money for a \n     longitudinal study of families at the Institute for Social \n     Research at the University of Michigan. The researchers \n     computed the incidence of welfare dependency among children \n     born in the late 1960's. The findings are dismaying. Almost \n     one quarter--22.1 percent --of these children were dependent \n     on AFDC for at least 1 year before reaching their 18th \n     birthday. That's 72.3 percent of black and 15.7 percent of \n     nonblack children.\n       But these findings on the extent of the problem tell us \n     little about what causes it or how to address it. Certainly \n     some part of this explosion in welfare dependency can be \n     attributed to changes in family structure. Three decades ago \n     there was nothing notably amiss with the traditional family. \n     American divorce rates were high, but stabilizing. The \n     traditional family of parents with children was the norm. As \n     recently as 1970, 40 percent of the Nation's households were \n     made up of a married couple with one or more children. The \n     proportion dropped to 31 percent in the next decade. It is \n     now around a quarter of all families. Simultaneously, the \n     proportion of families headed by a single mother has \n     exploded. In 1970, 11.5 percent of all families with children \n     were headed by a single mother. In 1980, 19.4 percent. In \n     1990, 24.2 percent. Now a quarter of all live births are out \n     of wedlock.\n       Our data collection needs to become more systematic and \n     institutionalized. As we did earlier in this century for the \n     problem of unemployment when we enacted the Employment Act of \n     1946, we need to define welfare dependency as a national \n     problem and to begin to measure, analyze, and address it. \n     Since 1946 unemployment has hardly disappeared but neither is \n     it ignored, much less denied. I am introducing this bill on \n     the first day of the new Congress because I believe that its \n     passage would represent one of the most important moments \n     in social welfare policy since Aid to Families with \n     Dependent Children was enacted as part of the Social \n     Security Act of 1935.\n\n  It might be noted here that in 1946 it was commonly assumed that with \nthe war over, the Depression of the 1930's would resume. Western \nsociety had been stunned by that catastrophic and protracted economic \ncrisis, a crisis which was interrupted by world war, but which was \nwidely thought to be systemic, and which would accordingly resume. No \none seemed to know how to make a modern industrial economy work. Some \neconomists had ideas about this, but these were not widely subscribed \nto. A more common view was that industrial democracies were inherently \nunstable and would necessarily disappear. It helps in this time of vast \nunease associated with the breakdown of family structure to recollect \nwith some tranquillity that capitalism was deemed doomed not a half \ncentury ago.\n  Here are the specifics for the statute:\n\n       (a) Congressional Policy.--The Congress hereby declares \n     that--(1) it is the policy and responsibility of the Federal \n     Government to reduce the rate at which and the degree to \n     which families depend on income from welfare programs and the \n     duration of welfare receipt, consistent with other essential \n     national goals; (2) it is the policy of the United States to \n     strengthen families, to ensure that children grow up in \n     families that are economically self-sufficient and that the \n     life prospects of children are improved, and to underscore \n     the responsibility of parents to support their children; (3) \n     the Federal Government should help welfare recipients as well \n     as individuals at risk of welfare receipt to improve their \n     education and job skills, to obtain child care and other \n     necessary support services, and to take such other steps as \n     may be necessary to assist them to become financially \n     independent; and (4) it is the purpose of this section to \n     provide the public with generally accepted measures of \n     welfare receipt so that it can track such receipt over time \n     and determine whether progress is being made in reducing the \n     rate at which and, to the extent feasible, the degree to \n     which, families depend on income from welfare programs and \n     the duration of welfare receipt.\n       (b) Development of Welfare Indicators and Predictors.--The \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this section \n     referred to as the ``Secretary'') in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Agriculture shall--(1) develop--(A) indicators \n     of the rate at which and, to the extent feasible, the degree \n     to which, families depend on income from welfare programs and \n     the duration of welfare receipt; and (B) predictors of \n     welfare receipt; (2) assess the data needed to report \n     annually on the indicators and predictors, including the \n     ability of existing data collection efforts to provide such \n     data and any additional data collection needs . . . [The \n     Welfare Indicators Act of 1994, as incorporated in the Social \n     Security Act Amendments of 1994, P.L. 103-432].\n\n  No notice was taken of the measure at the time of enactment, and so \nit is not inappropriate to do so now that the appointments to the \nAdvisory Board are completed. An interim report is due from the \nSecretary by next October 31, 2 years from enactment, as provided in \nthe statute, with a regular annual report to be prepared thereafter. I \nwould note that the measure was a long time coming; indeed, that we \nseemed somehow reluctant to learn too much about this subject. In March \n1991, the Subcommittee on Social Security and Family Policy of the \nSenate Committee on Finance held hearings at which a number of the \nNation's most respected social scientists, including several experts \nwho are now members of the Advisory Board, commented on the subject of \n``Welfare Dependency.'' Many urged the need for a continuing Federal \nassessment of this matter, as baffling in our time as was the issue of \nunemployment a half century ago. That eminent scholar, Douglas J. \nBesharov of the American Enterprise Institute, noted that ``There used \nto be a National Center for Social Statistics * * * . It was a Federal \nagency and had a client. Its client was the * * * Social and \nRehabilitative Service.'' But when that program was reorganized there \nwas no client to support the Center and it simply faded away. Now, \nhowever, we have the responsibility firmly lodged with the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services. We can expect diligent attention from the \ndistinguished incumbent, Donna Shalala, and from her ingenious, \nindustrious and committed associate, Wendell Primus, Deputy Assistant \nSecretary for Human Service Policy.\n  The Secretary will receive, I cannot doubt, great good counsel from \nthis Advisory Board, now finally constituted.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay a special tribute \nto Sister Mary Benita O'Connor, R.S.M. It is a great pleasure to \nrecognize Sister Mary Benita for her 60th anniversary in the religious \nprofession and for her life-long dedication to serving others.\n  A former member of St. Munchin's Parish in Cameron, MO, Sister Mary \nBenita entered the Sisters of Mercy novitiate in Council Bluffs, IA, on \nAugust 6, 1933. She made her first vows in March, 1936, and in August \nof the same year was assigned to teach business education, English, and \nreligion classes at St. Mary's High School in Independence, MO. \nFollowing teaching assignments at Glennon High School, Kansas City, and \nthe College of St. Mary's in Omaha, NE, Sister Mary Benita was once \nagain assigned to St. Mary's, Independence.\n  After completing 40 years of teaching, Sister Mary Benita became \nactive in St. Mary's Parish Council where she served as parish \nministries coordinator. As director of social ministries for the \nparish, she coordinated St. Vincent de Paul's outreach to the poor, the \nLegion of Mary's evangelization efforts, youth service activities, the \nOver 50 Club and Marian ministry. She continues her ministry to the \nhospitalized and homebound.\n  Sister Mary Benita has been an active member of the Neighborhood \nCouncil, a board member on Meals on Wheels, has participated in \nneighborhood education programs and has held a continued interest in \nSt. Mary's High School Alumni activities.\n  Currently, Sister Mary is sponsoring faith development groups and is \nthe librarian for the parish library. It is an honor to congratulate \nSister Mary Benita on her long-lasting faithfulness to the Church and \nthe Independence community. I wish her the best of luck on May 19, 1996 \nat her celebratory Mass of Thanksgiving at St. Mary's, and also in all \nof her future pursuits. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S5016-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        HOUSE INVESTIGATION OF IRANIAN ARMS SHIPMENTS TO BOSNIA\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, last week the House of \nRepresentatives decided on an almost strict party line vote to create a \nspecial subcommittee to investigate the Clinton administration's \ndecision not to stop Iran from shipping weapons to the Bosnian \nGovernment in violation of the arms embargo. And they voted to spend an \nadditional $995,000 above their planned budget to conduct this \ninvestigation. $995,000. While not technically correct, I hope you can \nindulge me if I just round up and call it an even million. That's \nreally what it is.\n  Mr. President, while I believe Congress should look into this matter, \nwe also need to be concerned about how we conduct our investigations.\n  The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has already held five \nhearings on the administration's decision not to intervene and prohibit \nthe shipment of Iranian arms into Bosnia. Chairman Specter, myself, and \nthe other members of the committee are well into our investigation at \nthis point and will press on expeditiously to finish in a timely \nmanner. It is important to note, however that we have conducted these \nhearings and will conduct further hearings as part of our normal \noversight responsibilities using our regular committee staff fully \nwithin our regular committee budget for fiscal year 1996. And we have \ndone this with the cooperation of both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, this is why I find the House Republican's actions so \ndisconcerting. We on this side of the Capitol can investigate this \nmatter with the cooperation of both parties, and without additional \nspace, staffing, funding, and committees. Meanwhile, our House \nRepublican counterparts have voted to spend an additional $1 million \nabove their normal budget to acquire more space, to hire more staff, \nand to form another subcommittee to investigate this same issue. \nKnowing how difficult it is to start up a new organization, I'd bet we \non the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence will probably finish our \ninvestigation before the House's special subcommittee gets moved into \nits new offices.\n  I know the House is just as concerned as the Senate about the cost of \nperforming necessary Government functions in these times of billion \ndollar budget deficits. The new Republican House leadership took some \nimportant, difficult measures to cut the cost of running Congress when \nthey took control in 1994. I believe that was the right thing to do. So \nwhy spend a million dollars unnecessarily? Especially in this election \nyear, you do not have to be a cynic to believe it was for political \nreasons. But even a cynic would be dumbfounded trying to figure out why \nthe House Republicans went this extra, excessive step to try to try and \nmake a political point.\n  Mr. President, when you talk day-in and day-out about billion dollar \nweapons systems, hundreds of billion dollar deficits, and trillion \ndollars budgets, a one with just six zeroes after it doesn't seem to be \nvery much. And I guess 9-9-5 plus three zeroes looks even smaller. But \nit takes 135 average Nebraska families working full time for 3 months \nto produce $1 million dollars in tax revenue. When there's already a \ncommittee structure, staffing, and budget to do the job, the $1 million \nHouse Special Committee to investigate Iranian arms flow into Bosnia is \na prime example of superfluous Government spending.\n  Mr. President, I say, let's perform our legislative oversight \nresponsibilities, let's look for the truth in this matter, let's \ndetermine who did what when and whether their actions were within the \nletter and spirit of the law. But let's do it the way we are already \norganized to do it and within the budgets we set for ourselves. Let's \nlive within out means like we expect or citizens to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S5016-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5016-S5017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          BERTHA M. GLOTZBACH--55 YEARS OF GOVERNMENT SERVICE\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, too often we are ready to \ncriticize those who work for the Government but rarely recognize \nindividuals who have dedicated their lives to public service. That is \nwhy, today, I would like to pay tribute to Bertha Glotzbach of the U.S. \nAgency for International Development [USAID]. On April 23, 1996, Ms. \nGlotzbah completed 55 years of Government service.\n  Born on the Fourth of July raised in my home State of Kansas, Ms. \nGlotzbach attended Strickler's Business College in Topeka. Her \nGovernment career began just before World War II on April 23, 1941, \nwith the Department of Labor. Ms. Glotzbach first worked for the Bureau \nof Labor Statistics and later with the Special Assistant for \nInternational Relations to the Secretary of Labor.\n  In 1949, Ms. Glotzbach joined the Economic Cooperation Agency, which \nCongress created in 1948 to administer the Marshall plan. She has \nworked continuously for foreign assistance agencies ever since. In \naddition to the numerous awards and commendations Ms. Glotzbach has \nreceived over the years, her service with USAID and its predecessor \nagencies sets a 47-year record.\n\n[[Page S5017]]\n\n  Mr. President, it is with great pleasure and gratitude that I rise \ntoday with USAID, to honor and congratulate Ms. Glotzbach for her \ndedicated service to the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S5016-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SELFRIDGE AIR NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVES\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in my home State of Michigan, we are \nboth proud and fortunate to have Selfridge Air National Guard Base \nlocated in Harrison Township, Macomb County. Though the base started as \nan Air Force Base and was transferred in 1971 to the Michigan Air \nNational Guard, it is the home of many diversified branches of the U.S. \nmilitary. ``Team Selfridge'' takes pride in being the only Reserve \nForces base to have permanently assigned units from all five of the \nuniformed services: Army, Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, and the Coast \nGuard, including the Air Force Reserve as well as the Air National \nGuard. This feature makes Selfridge unique among U.S. military bases.\n  On May 18, 1996, the 927th Air Refueling Wing will be celebrating \nBosses Day. Each year, the 927th pays tribute to local employers who \nsupport their Reserve employees. Reservists invite their employers to \nSelfridge so that they can gain an up-close view of the patriotic and \nunselfish manner in which reservists are serving their community and \nNation. The 927th first arrived at Selfridge in 1963. For nearly 33 \nyears it has depended on the flexibility and support of local employers \nfor much of its success.\n  National Guard and Reserve Forces will play an even greater and more \ndiverse role in the times ahead, as the Nation comes to rely more on \nthem in peacetime and in war. It is the vital support of America's \nemployers that enables the National Guard and Reserves to continue to \nstrengthen our Nation's security. We owe these employers our gratitude \nfor being part of our national security team.\n  This celebration of Bosses Day on May 18 will be particularly \nappropriate because that is the day this country will be observing \nArmed Forces Day, a day when we recognize and honor the service and \nsacrifice of our Armed Forces. On that day we can give our thanks to \nthe men and women in the Armed Forces, as well as to the employers who \nsupport the Guard and Reserve members.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S5017-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MONTGOMERY ACADEMY FORENSICS TEAM WINS ALABAMA FORENSICS CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today \nto share with my Senate colleagues the outstanding accomplishments of a \nvery talented group of students from Montgomery. On April 13, the \nMontgomery Academy Forensics Team won the State forensics championship \nat the Alabama Forensic Educators Association State Tournament. While \nthis is wonderful achievement, it was an even more impressive showing, \nfor this is the second consecutive year the Montgomery Academy team has \nwon this award.\n  For the past 5 years, the team has been led my Mr. James W.

To win two consecutive State championships is \nan impressive accomplishment, and I wanted to share their success with \nmy colleagues. The Montgomery Academy Forensics Team has certainly \nearned their award, and I would wish them the best of luck in next \nyear's competition and in all of their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S5017-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PUBLIC BUILDING REFORM ACT\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1005 \nas reported by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. I \nbelieve that this bill incorporates many valuable concepts which would \nsave the Federal Government money by imposing controls on the design \nand costs of Federal buildings, and in particular courthouses.\n  When I became chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure, I presented some broad principles which I felt the \ncommittee should use to prioritize General Services Administration \nprojects. At that time, the Administrative Office of the Courts had \nnever sent to our committee a priority ranking of courthouse projects \nmaking authorization on the basis of need very difficult.\n  Today, at my request, I am pleased to report that the Judicial \nConference has approved a 5-year plan, which is a step in the right \ndirection. However, additional reforms in the area of public buildings \nare still needed.\n  Under S. 1005, the General Services Administration and the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts will be required to submit \ntriennial plans in order of priority. Courthouse prospectuses will be \nrequired to include the current number of Federal judges and courtrooms \nas of the date of submissions, and the projected number of Federal \njudges and courtrooms expected to be accommodated by the proposed \nproject.\n  These projected figures will then be justified by further information \non the authorized positions of Federal judges and the number of judges \nexpected to take senior status, as well as the level of security risk \nat the current courthouse as determined by the Administrative Office of \nthe Courts.\n  If a courthouse is not part of the triennial plan for a given fiscal \nyear, it is not my expectation that the committee will approve that \nparticular project.\n  Mr. President, S. 1005 also addresses ongoing concerns over the U.S. \nCourts Design Guide. Many of you have heard about Foley Square and the \nBoston Courthouse, as well as many other costly courthouse construction \nprojects which have been built in the last several years. S. 1005 will \nrequire the General Services Administration to rewrite the design guide \nin consultation with the courts and the Fine Arts Commission. It is my \nexpectation that this will enable the General Services to ultimately \ncontrol courthouse construction costs with the input of the courts.\n  S. 1005, not only addresses concerns raised over courthouse \nconstruction, but it also will require the General Services \nAdministration to file a biennial public buildings plan, to help the \ncommittee to evaluate and set priorities for all projects that require \nconstruction, alteration, or leased space--whether it is a courthouse, \nFederal building, border station et cetera.\n  In this time of Government downsizing, our Federal agencies will have \nto justify their priority ranking or request for additional space needs \nfor ultimate approval by both the House and the Senate.\n  The biennial plan will include a 5-year strategic capital asset \nmanagement plan. Under the plan, the GSA would be able to take \nadvantage of market changes that affect building construction and \navailability, thereby potentially saving our American taxpayer dollars.\n  In light of the austere budget environment we are currently operating \nunder, we need reforms in the area of public buildings. As the chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I strongly \nsupport S. 1005, and urge its swift passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S5017-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5017-S5018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A TRIBUTE TO BILL NAITO, 1925-96\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, Portland, OR, has long been \nhailed as a city of innovation and vigor. While all denizens of the \ncity bask in that community energy, there are a handful of people who \ncan be credited with fostering Portland's uncommon spirit. Through \nvisionary imagination and bold leadership, they have made Portland the \nprogressive city it is today. Bill Naito, who died last week, was one \nof those leaders.\n  Naito was a Portland businessman who combined his business acumen \nwith a deeply-felt sense of civic obligation. Working with his brother, \nhe started his career in 1962 as the proprietor of a bustling import \nbusiness. The brothers soon bought the building that housed their \nbusiness, and thus began Bill Naito's long legacy as a property \ndeveloper. Over the next three decades, he repeatedly built thriving \ndevelopments in areas shunned by other businessmen. Skid Road, home of \nthe Naito\n\n[[Page S5018]]\n\nbrothers Import Plaza, grew into revitalized Historic Old Town. An \nabandoned department store building became the Galleria shopping \ncenter, the 1980's anchor of Portland's commercial revitalization. He \nturned an old warehouse district into the McCormick Pier apartments, \nluring middle-income residents into downtown Portland.\n  While he prospered personally from his business initiatives, Bill \nNaito was generous with his time and assets, and his sense of civic \nresponsibility enriched Portland endlessly. In addition to serving on \ncountless boards and civic organizations, he donated space in office \nbuildings to nonprofit or public agencies. He was a founder of \nArtquake, a long-running annual arts festival. He also donated land to \nhelp launch Saturday Market, a weekly showcase of local performers and \nartisans that has drawn tourists and suburbanites to downtown Portland \nfor a generation. He was perhaps most popularly noted for preserving \nthe White Stag landmark when the company moved out of Portland. Thanks \nto Bill Naito's sense of whimsy, each Christmas season west-bound \nmotorists enjoy the White Stag reindeer's illuminated red nose.\n  Though he was never one to trumpet his own accomplishments, it was \nclear that Naito took the greatest pride in the creation of the \nJapanese-American Historical Plaza in Tom McCall Waterfront Park. Naito \nis the son of Japanese immigrants, and his family was forced to \nrelocate to Utah in 1942 to avoid the internment forced on Portland's \nJapanese community. Though he seemed to carry little personal \nbitterness from those war years--in fact, he joined the Army himself in \n1944--he worked the rest of his life to make sure that Oregonians \nwouldn't forget the lessons learned from the Japanese internment. The \nmemorial he spearheaded, dedicated in 1990, is a moving tribute to the \nfamilies interned during World War II, and serves as a reminder of the \nguarantees the Bill of Rights provides for us all.\n  The accomplishments I have enumerated only begin to convey the varied \ncontributions Bill Naito made to Portland throughout his life. This 70-\nyear-old, who worked long days at an age when most men are content in \nretirement, spent a lifetime fusing community and business pursuits. \nBill Naito seemed the image of hard-working vigor and energy when \ncancer snuck up on him, and he died just a week after being diagnosed. \nHis death saddens those he touched personally, and he enriched the \nlives of many more Oregonians who live, work, and visit the city to \nwhich he brought so much life. The nose of the White Stag reindeer \nburned red last week in tribute to Bill Naito. Portland has truly lost \na treasure, Mr. President, and I want to pay tribute to him again here \ntoday. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S5017-4", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 57\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after I make a \nbrief statement and the Senator from Mississippi makes a statement and \nSenator Daschle makes a statement that the Senate stand in adjournment \nunder the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5019]]\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will take just a minute of the Senate's \ntime to express my disappointment that we were unable to agree on any \nof the unanimous-consent requests that we presented to my colleagues on \nthe other side with respect to the pending gas tax repeal, the TEAM \nAct, minimum wage, taxpayer bill of rights, and the White House travel \nlegislation.\n  It was my hope that we could reach an understanding. I thought, based \non conversations, we might be able to work out some procedure to ensure \nthat the three main issues--the gas tax repeal, the TEAM Act, and the \nminimum wage were split into three separate bills--that the Senate \nwould be able to reach an agreement on an overall consent that would \ninclude these issues in a relatively short timeframe. But unfortunately \nthat does not seem to be the case.\n\n  I think it is fair to say that we have offered pretty much what my \ncolleagues had requested, with some minor changes, a consent agreement \nthat does, in fact, divide the three issues into separate bills and \nlimits time on each issue. I think they could be concluded in as little \nas 5 or 6 hours.\n  But now I understand that there are additional requests to not only \nseparate the issues, but also to require the approval of the final \nlanguage that the House is marking up in the committee today relative \nto the minimum wage. Obviously, I cannot dictate what the House does \nwith minimum wage and cannot ensure what might finally come out of the \nconference.\n  But it seems to me that what we should do is move ahead before \nMemorial Day, resolve these three issues, as well as the taxpayer bill \nof rights, which I understand there is no opposition to.\n  The gas tax repeal is being held hostage because of the demands about \nthe minimum wage. The so-called TEAM Act is unacceptable to my \ncolleagues on the other side. I understand there will be a filibuster \non that issue. I guess the bottom line is, we have been trying to \nfigure out some way to resolve this issue. We have not reached it yet.\n  I do not believe we will ever be in a position to say to my \ncolleagues on the other side that we will guarantee, notwithstanding it \nis a Republican House of Representatives and a Republican Senate, that \nyou draft the minimum wage proposal. I do not think that will happen \nbecause we have some ideas, amendments for the minimum wage. I do not \nknow what my House colleagues have in mind, but they may report that \nout later on today.\n  So I just suggest that we continue to work with the Democratic \nleader, Senator Daschle. Time is running. I hope that we can act on all \nthese issues prior to Memorial Day. But this week we will probably be \non the budget. Next week we hope to do the missile defense measure, \nalong with the DOD authorization bill. That would not leave a lot of \ntime for these three issues.\n  So I just want to report to the Senate that we have not given up. But \nI do not believe we can ever agree that, in effect, we first have to \nclear it with the President before we pass it. I am not certain that \nwill ever happen.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me associate myself with the remarks \nmade by the distinguished majority leader as to the desire to find a \nway to finish our work on all of these important matters prior to \nMemorial Day. I am relatively optimistic that is possible.\n  The majority leader indicated that it is very difficult to make some \nassumption with regard to what the House may do on minimum wage. I \nunderstand what is normally a difficult set of circumstances in \nanticipating anything that the House would or would not do, but I am \nall the more confident that it is possible, given what has just \nhappened on the budget.\n  The distinguished majority leader asked if we could go to the budget \nin an expeditious way tomorrow. We are prepared to do that. I have \nindicated to him after consulting with a number of my colleagues that \nis possible. I want to go back to that point in a moment.\n  That entire budget was preconferenced by Senate and House \nRepublicans. Every single detail of the budget we are going to get \ntomorrow was preconferenced with the House. They decided what the \ndefense number was. They decided what the discretionary number was. \nThey decided what the tax number was. They decided what the entitlement \nnumbers were. They decided what the overall budget plan would be. All \nof it was done.\n  It seems to me if we can negotiate an entire budget for 6 years with \nthe House of Representatives, certainly we could find our way to do one \ntiny little bill on the minimum wage. I hope we could find a way with \nwhich to address that. We have been working in good faith with the \nmajority leader to find a way to make that happen. I feel we are making \nprogress in that regard. All we are asking is one tiny little bill. The \nminimum wage is a tiny bill. But it has profound repercussions for the \neconomic well being, the lives of millions and millions of people.\n  As the majority leader made reference last week to rocket scientists, \nit does not take a rocket scientist to recognize the House could come \nup with a package surrounding the minimum wage increase that might be \nunacceptable. To declare this agreement acceptable, without any \nassurance of what the House would do--the House could come up with a \npackage that we have to vote against, that the President would have to \nveto--that is no agreement, Mr. President. That is not what we are \nattempting to do. We want to find a way to accommodate the concerns of \nthe majority in dealing with this tax issue in spite of the fact we \nhave very serious misgivings on our side. We will have some amendments \nto address those misgivings.\n  The Travel Office legislation--again, some of us have very serious \nmisgivings in terms of the precedent it would set. We want to deal with \nthat. Obviously, there is the TEAM Act, about which we have \nextraordinary misgivings. We will deal with that. Then there is the \ntaxpayer bill of rights for which there is apparently some consensus. \nWe will deal with that. Those are four pieces of legislation the \nmajority wants to deal with. We say we want one, the minimum wage. All \nwe ask is that we are not going to be embarrassed in coming to an \nagreement that ultimately allows us this freestanding vote that we all \nsay we want but then the President will have to veto. That is not \nacceptable. Everybody understands that. That is all we are saying--\ncontinue to work, ensure we know what the House's intentions are. If we \ncan do it on a complete budget agreement, it seems to me we can do it \non one little bill, the minimum wage bill. That is what we are talking \nabout.\n  Now, with regard to the budget, as I said, I have agreed to go to the \nbudget resolution early tomorrow, after consultation with our caucus at \nnoon and with individual Members who raised some very serious concerns \nand even though we have not yet been allowed to see the report. We are \nnot going to make a big deal of the fact we do not have a report. Our \ncolleagues on the Budget Committee were not even allowed to write it. \nNo minority report. That was not allowed. There was no consultation \nwith Democrats, at all--locked out completely.\n  This proposal is the most partisan budget we have seen in many, many \nyears. In fact, at the news conference I recall, the Nation was told \nthis is a Bob Dole budget. It was not the Senate Budget Committee \ndocument. We were told, ``This is the Bob Dole budget.'' I must say, \nwith all this interest in bipartisanship and accommodation and \ncooperation, when it came to the budget, we are not getting a great \ndeal of it. We have not seen much yet. What goes around comes around.\n\n  In spite of the fact that we have not been given very much, if any, \nconsideration with regard to the budget so far procedurally, and it is \ngoing to get worse, we will go to the budget resolution and, \neventually, to the three reconciliation bills that in my view are \nflatout illegal. We will have to face all of that in the future. We \nwill go to the budget tomorrow, because in good faith we are trying to \nwork through these things. We will try to deal with the budget. And we \nare trying to deal with these five bills. But we will not be pushed.\n  I have had to assure my colleagues we will take all the time we need \nto have a good debate, to offer amendments. We will do all of that. We \nwill\n\n[[Page S5020]]\n\ngo to the floor tomorrow as requested of us in order to accommodate the \nmajority in what we know to be a very full schedule. I hope we can \ncontinue to work. I am very hopeful we can achieve all that I know the \ndistinguished majority leader wants to accomplish prior to the time we \nget into the Memorial Day recess.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My question, just so I am fully in tune with the points \nyou were making, the majority leader is telling us that he cannot \naccommodate us in terms of the minimum wage; he says he cannot have any \ncontrol over the way it is handled in the House. What I heard my leader \nsay is when it comes to the budget, which is a huge document and is \nactually a 6-year budget, that, in fact, there was cooperation between \nthe Senate Republicans and the House Republicans. They did, in fact, \npreconference many of these issues so that they were in step.\n  Am I right in assuming when it comes to the minimum wage, the \nmajority leader says: Gee, he just cannot control it, so we could agree \nto all the other measures. You point out this caucus on this side is \nsplit on something because we so much want to see the minimum wage take \neffect and start helping people, millions of people. I might say the \nmajority of them are women, and we talk a lot about the gender gap \naround here. I think the women in this country know who is fighting for \nthem.\n  When it comes to this, we could give away our position, our leverage, \nand wind up with all the other bills and not the minimum wage increase. \nIs that the fear that has been expressed by the Democrat leader?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from California says it so ably and \nsuccinctly. That is our concern. She used the word ``cooperation'' \nbetween the House and the Senate. It was cooperation. But I did not go \nfurther. It was absolute unanimity, agreement right down the line, word \nfor word, paragraph for paragraph, provision for provision. There was \nno disagreement. The joint news conferences by the chairs of both the \nHouse and the Senate Budget Committees certainly made that point. There \nwas no disagreement whatsoever. Normally you would expect cooperation. \nThis was lockstep agreement on every single detail of a 6-year budget \nagreement.\n  It seems to me with that kind of precedent there ought to be an \nopportunity for one little bill, this minimum wage bill, which has such \na profound effect on so many people all through the country. That is \nall we are hoping to do. I intend to work with the majority leader to \nensure that happens. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S5018-6", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5020-S5023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              GAS TAX REPEAL, MINIMUM WAGE, AND THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is unfortunate, indeed, that we are \nnot getting a vote on the repeal of the gasoline tax that was imposed \nin 1993, the 4.3-cent gasoline tax that has been debated and discussed \nhere on the floor for these past 2 weeks now.\n  When the Senate came back into session following the recent recess, \nthe majority leader indicated to the Senate that the order of business \nwould be that we would debate and dispose of the so-called taxpayer \nbill of rights, legislation that has been reported from the Senate \nFinance Committee, that had been discussed for some time over a period \nof the last several years; as a matter of fact, a priority of Senators \non both sides of the aisle. I can recall when my good friend from \nArkansas, Senator Pryor, introduced legislation along that line some \ntime ago and invited Senators to cosponsor. I joined in cosponsoring \nthe legislation.\n  There have been enactments of similar legislation in the past but \nthis seemed to address the current problems. It had bipartisan support. \nTo that legislation, the majority leader proposed to add a temporary \nrepeal of the gasoline tax that had been imposed at the President's \nrequest, and with the opposition, the active opposition of all \nRepublicans in the Congress.\n  The fact of the matter is, this was a part of the initial deficit \nreduction package proposed by President Clinton soon after he came into \noffice. It was opposed by Republicans because for the first time there \nwould be Federal taxation of gasoline that would not be earmarked for \nroad and bridge construction under the Highway Trust Fund Act.\n  Gasoline, tires, batteries, and accessories had been taxed in the \npast, at the initiative of President Eisenhower some time ago, to try \nto build a national defense highway system. It was thought at the time \nthat the American people would support that, if the highway users could \nsupport and pay for it through Federal taxes on gasoline, oil, \nbatteries, and the like, those things that would be purchased by the \nusers of the Nation's highways, those funds would be dedicated for that \npurpose.\n  Now, President Clinton comes into office as President and, for the \nfirst time, suggests that there be a Federal tax on gasoline that would \ngo into the General Treasury, which would not be a part of the highway \ntrust fund. There was strong objection to that. We had a rollcall vote \nin the Congress, and Republicans unanimously voted against that tax. \nWith gasoline prices rising, with people finding it more and more \ndifficult to operate their trucks and cars with these new, high prices, \nit was appropriate, in the view of this side of the aisle, that we act \nto repeal, temporarily, that gasoline tax.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a question because my friend made a statement that \nPresident Clinton was the first President to suggest that gasoline \ntaxes be used to reduce the deficit. In 1990, under George Bush, there \nwas a tax put in until 1995 on gasoline which was used to reduce the \ndeficit. It was part of an agreement under the leadership of President \nBush. So I just wanted to know whether my friend was aware of that.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I would like to respond by saying I do not think that \nwas a suggestion by President Bush. I think at the time of that \nsummit----\n  Mrs. BOXER. He signed onto it. It happened under his administration, \nand he signed the bill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I do not yield further, Mr. President. I am responding \nto the Senator's question. I will continue to respond. That summit \nmeeting was held for a lot of purposes, to try to deal with a lot of \nissues that had been brought up in the Congress. The gasoline tax was \nnot proposed by President Bush.\n  I stand by what I said. President Clinton is the first President who \nsuggested an addition to the gasoline tax that would not be used as a \npart of the highway trust fund.\n  The fact is, the Republican leader in the Senate proposed that there \nbe a repeal of this 1993 tax. He stated the reasons for it. It had \nalmost unanimous support on this side of the aisle and, I think, \nsupport on the Democratic side as well. What happened next was, the \nDemocrats offered an amendment that they wanted to have voted on before \nthe gasoline tax repeal would be voted on, which was to increase the \nminimum wage. Now, it is not unusual to have some Senator offer an \namendment on a completely different subject from the legislation that \nis pending before the Senate. It is one of the unique characteristics \nof the Senate that any Senator on either side of the aisle, at any \ntime, can offer an amendment to any bill or any other amendment and \ndiscuss the merits of that proposal without interruption for as long as \nthat Senator seeks to do so, or at least until 60 Senators vote to \nimpose cloture and cut off debate. That is one of the unique features \nof this body. So I am not criticizing Senators who seek to use the \nrules to call to the attention of the Senate a matter of some urgency \nthat needs the immediate consideration of the U.S. Congress.\n\n  What is curious about that proposal and that amendment, though, was \nthat, for 2 years, the Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress and \nthe administration. President Clinton came into office talking about \ngiving a middle-class tax cut, talking about helping working people \nmeet their goals and achieve their ambitions. Not once did a committee \nchaired by a Democratic Senator report out legislation to increase the \nminimum wage. Not once did a Democratic Senator offer an amendment to \nany bill to increase the\n\n[[Page S5021]]\n\nminimum wage and call this to the attention of the Senate as some \nmatter of urgency or something that would have merit and ought to be \nconsidered by the Congress. But it was advanced as a way to prevent a \nvote on the repeal of a tax, a temporary repeal of a gasoline tax. It \nwas suggested that this was of such grave national urgency--the \nincrease in the minimum wage--that it ought to be considered in advance \nof any other issue that could be brought before or considered or voted \non by the U.S. Senate.\n  Now, if that is not political posturing and grandstanding, I do not \nknow what is. The fact is, for 2 long years, the Democrats--suggesting \nthat they are the friends of the working man, they are going to do what \nthey can to help make life better for those who work for a living--\nnever suggested through legislative proposals on this floor of this \nSenate that the minimum wage should be increased.\n  But at a time when there was a matter brought up by the Republican \nleader, who is in charge of the schedule of the Senate, for the orderly \nconsideration of legislation that there be a repeal of the gasoline tax \nthat this President requested be imposed and which the Democrats had \nagreed to impose, there was this cry to, ``Wait, you cannot even vote \non that in the Senate until you not only vote on, but commit yourself \nto and enact an increase in the minimum wage.'' There is a difference \nbetween a vote on an amendment, or debate of an amendment, and a vote \non a motion to table that amendment or a vote on that amendment as \namended.\n\n  Any Senator has the right, as I said, under the rules--and we are not \ncriticizing that right--to suggest a change in the law, to suggest a \ndiscussion on any subject at any time. The purpose for that is so that \nno one party, no one leader, no one region, no one faction can keep the \nSenate from considering an issue that is of importance to the national \ninterest. No one can keep that from happening. No one is that powerful \nin the U.S. Senate. No party is that powerful, no majority so great \nthat that is prohibited or frustrated. That is why the Senate is so \nunique.\n  In the House of Representatives, for example, on the other hand, if a \nMember of that body wanted to offer an amendment or call to the \nattention of the House of Representatives some issue, it would have to \nbe approved by the Rules Committee, first of all. The Rules Committee \nis dominated by members of one party. That is the way it is. The Rules \nCommittee is an arm of the leadership of the House of Representatives. \nIn my experience as a member of the other body, even if you are a \nMember of the legislative standing committee and would like to offer an \namendment in that committee for consideration, you have very little \nchance of success, if the chairman of that committee is intent on \ndefeating your amendment, in getting an amendment approved by that \nlegislative committee and then finding its way to the floor as a part \nof a bigger bill.\n  Now, I will admit that, in recent years and since I have been in the \nSenate, those rules have been modified somewhat, I am told. But I can \nrecall when it was nigh unto impossible to bring an issue to the \nattention of the House of Representatives on the floor of the House--\nexcept in a 1-minute speech, but I am talking about in a vehicle that \ncould be voted on or enacted--without the permission of the higher-ups, \nthe leadership, the people who control the House.\n  Well, that is not the case in the Senate. We are all members of the \nRules Committee here. Every Senator has a right to say what should be \ndiscussed or debated or considered by the U.S. Senate and can bring \nthat issue up at any time there is a legislative issue on the floor of \nthe Senate. So that is what the Democrats did and took advantage of for \nthe opportunity to bring to the attention of the Senate the minimum \nwage issue. But what needs to be remembered in all of this as we \nproceed now to consider the budget resolution instead of the taxpayer \nbill of rights, which has been on the schedule and scheduled for \nconsideration by the leader, is that this is being used as a device to \nprevent the Senate from conducting the business that was proposed to be \nconducted by the Republican leader. He has sought to reach an agreement \nfor consideration of a minimum wage amendment, and he has done that in \na variety of different configurations--that there be three separate \nbills, that there be separate votes on amendments. There have been \nnegotiations now for the last 2 weeks, and a strong effort has been \nmade by the Democratic leader, I must say--and I agree that he has made \nevery effort--to resolve some of these differences about how we proceed \nto consider the gas tax repeal, the minimum wage issue, and other labor \nrelated issues. The TEAM Act has been discussed as well.\n\n  I might say that the Democratic leader suggested that now it is a \npart of the requirement that is being made for proceeding by the other \nside that the bill, as passed by the House containing the minimum wage \nincrease, must be subject to review before any agreement for \nconsideration of that issue can be made here in the Senate for the \npurpose of ensuring that whatever amendment is adopted here would not \ncause that bill, as passed by the House, to be vetoed by the President.\n  So what is being sought is not an opportunity to debate an issue of \nsome national urgency, not an effort to vote on an issue to put \nSenators on record, but to enact a change in the law. That sounds sort \nof like extortion, does it not? It sounds like extortion. It may not \ntechnically and legally be extortion but it sounds like it to me.\n  Well, where we are now is, with the agreement of the Democrats, we \nare proceeding next to consider the budget resolution which we ought to \ndo. And we all agree, Republicans and Democrats alike, that we ought to \nproceed to the consideration of the budget resolution because it is a \nmatter of high priority. And in the orderly course of legislative \nprocess following the budget resolution we will be able to then take up \nbills to reconcile the law with the resolution, requiring reductions in \nspending, or changes in the law so that we can achieve the goals set \nforth in the budget resolution, and so that the appropriations bills \ncan be enacted consistent with the limits that will be contained in the \nbudget resolution.\n  So as we begin the funding process for the departments of the \nGovernment for the fiscal year that begins on October 1, we will not \nsee--I hope we will not see--what we saw last year. And that was a \nlogjam of activities that frustrated the orderly funding and \nauthorization of Government programs so that there were shutdowns, \nthere were conflicts--some serious--between the House and Senate, \nbetween Senators and among Congressmen of both parties, and with the \nPresident that we had the frustrating experience of seeing the \nGovernment actually having to shut down because of the inability of the \nCongress and the President to agree on the levels of funding for \nvarious activities.\n\n  So it is with the hope that we will avoid that result this year that \nwe can agree quickly on a resolution on the budget, then move to the \ntimely consideration of reconciliation bills and appropriations bills, \nand conclude this session of the Congress in a way that serves the \ncollective interests of the American people. That is my hope. I did not \nsay that ``serves'' the interest of a political party. I think there \nhas been too much consideration in this body this year and last of what \nserves the interests of the political factions and not what proposals \nare really going to solve the problems this country faces.\n  Some of us think the gasoline tax repeal would help solve a problem, \nthat taxes are too high. Republicans are on record wanting to vote on \nthat right now and to take up other tax reduction measures, too, as a \npart of the budget resolution, and we will get to that.\n  But I am hopeful that the beginning of the debate on the budget \nresolution may signal a turn, a change in direction, at least in \nemphasis between political posturing and a good-faith committed effort \ntoward achieving goals like reducing the deficit, tax reform, welfare \nreform, making Government more efficient, eliminating unnecessary and \nwasteful uses of tax dollars and all the rest that go into making for \ngood Government and Government that is one that restores the confidence \nof the American people in our political system. That is important.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n[[Page S5022]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I note the order is to go out. I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, very much, Mr. President.\n  I listened carefully to my friend and to my colleagues on the other \nside as well as to the Democratic leader. I would like to put a little \nbit of perspective on where I see we are as my friends have done; my \nfriend from Mississippi.\n  First, I would like to bring out--in my question to him he was very \nkind enough to yield to me on--that in fact this is not the first time \nthe gas tax has been used to reduce the deficit. Actually it came about \nunder a Republican President, George Bush, a temporary tax for 5 years \nto reduce the deficit.\n  My friend made the point, Well, it was not George Bush's idea. I do \nnot know whose idea it was. Although I served at that time on the \nBudget Committee of the House, I was not at Andrews Air Force Base. But \nthe President then, President Bush, a Republican President, agreed that \nwe needed to reduce the deficit, and that was part of the plan. So this \nis not the first time gas taxes have been used to reduce the deficit.\n  I have to say that what is so interesting to me is the passion that \nwe see coming from the other side of the aisle on this reduction of the \ngas tax of 4.5 cents, a passion that goes so deeply that they do not \neven have anything in their bill that would make sure it goes back to \nthe drivers. We have experts from all over the country saying that in \nfact it is very probable that the decrease in the tax would go into the \npockets of the oil refiners, and we are going to try on this side--and \nwe hope this comes up; we are all supporting bringing these bills up--\nthat we can amend it in such a way to ensure that the oil companies \nhave to give it back.\n  So I find the passion on the other side about returning $27 a year to \nthe average driver without any guarantee that they will get it--I find \nit interesting since there is a lack of passion when it comes to an \nincrease in minimum wage, which is at a 40-year low in terms of its \nbuying power, an increase in wages for millions of people to the tune \nof $1,800 a year. And it would make a difference because I have met \nsome of those working people. They work hard, and they have a hard time \ngetting health insurance and paying for it. They have a hard time \nmeeting their obligations. Sometimes they have to choose between going \nto a doctor or forgoing that for food on the table. These are real \npeople, and where is the passion on that side? It is not there, and God \nbless the American people. Seventy percent of them agree that we ought \nto have an increase in the minimum wage.\n  And my friend says, ``Where are the Democrats? Why didn't they bring \nit up before?'' We probably should have, you know. We miscalculated. We \nbrought up the health care issue because we wanted to help working \npeople, and we decided that we made an error in that regard to go with \nhealth care first. And we know we overreached, and we all know that we \nmade a mistake. I am not afraid to admit mistakes.\n  Now I hope we can get to the Kennedy bill to start addressing the \nissue of health care. But the fact of the matter is we postponed it, \nand that makes it all the more important to get it done now, Mr. \nPresident, because inflation continues to move. It is at a low level. \nBut still, it moves. The minimum wage is not tied to inflation, as we \nall know. Congress can make it better. It has been my privilege to vote \nfor the increases before--the last one under George Bush, where we came \ntogether as Republicans and Democrats.\n  All we are asking on this side of the aisle is that you are \npassionate about the repeal of the gas tax, most of which is going to \ngo to the oil companies. How about showing a little compassion and \naction for the people who work so hard for a minimum wage?\n  If you have that same commitment with us, let us pass both bills. Let \nus get them to the President's desk. He says he will sign them both. He \nsays he will sign them both. So instead of working at cross purposes, \nlet us work together. It simply is not enough to say, well, we cannot \nguarantee what the House will do. I served over there for a long time, \nand my friend is right. There are different rules over there. But it \nturned out in the budget, in a document that addresses the issues for \nthe next 6, 7 years in our country, there was no problem between the \nmajority here and the majority there. Every issue, every detail was \ntalked out before, and everyone here knows what the budget is going to \nlook like. We are going to debate that tomorrow, and I cannot wait to \ndebate that budget. I cannot wait to point out the differences between \nthe two sides, but I will wait until tomorrow to do that, because we \nsee huge differences in the parties in that document, which is really \nthe vision of the future for this country.\n  The point that the Democratic leader was making, I thought quite \neloquently, is this, simply, that if a budget that is so complicated \nand so large and so encompassing, with so many issues, can be \npreconferenced between the House and Senate Republicans, why can they \nnot come up with a clearly defined way to assure us that a minimum wage \nbill will get to the President's desk. You know on the other side how \nstrongly we feel about that.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield for \na question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. My question is whether or not the Senator is aware that \ntoday the leadership on the House side, the Speaker and the majority \nleader, sent a letter to the Republican leader here--a copy was given \nto the Democratic leader--which says as follows:\n\n       In the next 2 weeks, the House will consider H.R. 2391 to \n     allow low wage earners greater choice and flexibility in \n     their work schedules. At that time, the Rules Committee will \n     make in order an amendment to increase the minimum wage as \n     well as other amendments to create jobs, expand worker \n     training and education opportunities, and increase take-home \n     pay for low wage workers. It complements our belief that a \n     first job is the best training for life-long success in the \n     world of work. We look forward to taking this measure to \n     conference with the Senate and getting legislation to the \n     President's desk.\n\n  Is the Senator aware that that commitment has been made?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. And let me tell the Senator, that is exactly \nthe problem. What we are asking for is a clean minimum wage bill. We \nagreed to a clean, temporary repeal of the gas tax. We want a clean \nbill that increases the minimum wage. That is all we want.\n\n  What my friend read makes the point of why the Democratic leader is \nnot going to go down this road with you. I have been around this place \nfor a while. We do not even know what all those things mean--a \nguarantee of greater take-home pay. We do not know what all these \nthings mean. You could cut Social Security and you might wind up with a \nbigger paycheck, too. We do not know what that means.\n  So the bottom line is, my friend made my point. A vague promise that \nin 2 weeks there will be another bill to which they will attach an \namendment on minimum wage is not the vehicle. The President wants to \nbreak the logjam. He said: Send me a clean repeal of the gas tax and \nsend me a clean increase on the minimum wage.\n  I think the Democratic leader has laid it out. That is what we want, \nand that is not what we are getting. So I think we have a capability of \ncoming together here. We are friends. I think we can come together as \nlegislators. It is pretty easy. Let us make sure we have a package that \nresults in a separate bill going to the President's desk on minimum \nwage and a separate bill on the gas tax.\n  My friend mentioned other issues that are important to his side. We \nare willing to let those go through if we have an opportunity to amend, \nand so on, even though some of us have reservations about them. But \nthat is not what has happened. So I think you are going to see \nDemocrats in the Senate stand pretty firm. We are willing to give and \ngive and give. We want to get a little. And when I say a little, I mean \na little.\n  We are talking about a minimum wage bill. We think it is good for the \ncountry. We know that workers are under stress today. We know there is \ndownward pressure on wages. We know\n\n[[Page S5023]]\n\nthe minimum wage is at a 40-year low. We know that 58 percent of the \npeople on minimum wage are women who are struggling. The majority \nleader says he wants to get hold of that gender gap and make it \nsmaller. He has a shot at doing that, it seems to me, if he would \nembrace this idea. If we could send a clean bill to the President, that \nis going to be good for the country, good for women, good for families.\n  So I think we are really close to an agreement, I say to my friend. \nWe are getting there. And I think if the majority leader would work \nwith the leadership in the House the way he did on the budget, getting \ncertain guarantees, getting agreement on how both Houses would handle \nit and do the same thing on minimum wages, we will be here passing that \nminimum wage, addressing the issue of the gas tax and the other issues \nthat my friend is anxious to address.\n\n  So I look forward to seeing us move together. I think the American \npeople want us to reach across the party aisle. They are really crying \nout for that. And we have an opportunity to do it. I think the \nPresident gave us the way. He said: Send me a clean bill on the gas \ntax; send me a clean bill on minimum wage.\n  I think we can make that happen. And if we do, everyone has fulfilled \nhis or her responsibility, it seems to me, to his or her \nconstituencies.\n  So I am not overly pessimistic at the turn of events because I think \nwe are making some progress, but I think we can really do better. I \nlook forward to the budget debate that is coming tomorrow. I look \nforward to debating my friend again on some of those issues--Medicare, \nMedicaid, education, environment, deficit reduction, earned income tax \ncredit. These are so important to the well-being of the people.\n  With an increase in the minimum wage, I have to say that can do more \nto change the lives of working people for the better than almost \nanything else we can do. And I hope we will see it done. I hope we will \ncross party lines to do it. I might note that we have been blocked from \ndoing it. A majority of the Senate has voted to increase the minimum \nwage. The majority leader has filled the tree to block us from offering \nit on certain bills. I just look forward to the day when the majority \nhere, the majority of Senators here, get to vote on that minimum wage \nand we do the business of the people.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer very much.\n  Mr. President, as I understand it, this has completed the Senate's \nbusiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/14/senate-section/article/S5020-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
