Mr. President, let me just indicate for our colleagues that \nthere will be a period for the transaction of morning business \nthroughout the day, with Senators permitted to speak for not to exceed \n15 minutes each. And I remind Senators and members of their staff that \nunder the unanimous-consent agreement entered last night, there will be \nno rollcall votes today and no rollcall votes on Monday, prior to 4 \np.m.\n  Today Senators may discuss their amendments to S. 1 and have them \nprinted in the Record in order to qualify them under the 3 p.m. Tuesday \ndeadline. I do not know how many Senators wish to speak today, but we \nwill be in for whatever period of time it may take.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the distinguished majority leader \nyield?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished acting minority leader.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I think it might be appropriate, I say to my \nfriend, that we review a little bit your understanding with our leader \nas to the offering of amendments so that we will not get into--it is a \ngentlemen's agreement, and we want to uphold our part of it. But I want \nto be sure everybody understands that, if you do not mind.\n  Mr. DOLE. Right. As I indicated, we entered into the agreement last \nnight and we have listed in the Record all the amendments on both sides \nof the aisle. I think they total around 67 amendments. To offer the \namendment, you simply have to send it to the desk. If there is an \namendment pending, you have to, of course, set that amendment aside.\n  We also agreed that if for some unusual circumstance someone was \nprevented on either side of the aisle from offering their amendment \nbefore the 3 o'clock deadline, the two leaders could agree that one of \nour colleagues, or more, could then offer the amendment, or amendments, \nin any event.\n  The importance of the agreement is to get a finite list of the \namendments. There are no time agreements on any of the amendments. I \nhope not all the amendments are offered. But even if all the amendments \nare offered--that means sent to the desk--they may not be called up. It \nis my hope we can complete action sometime maybe on Wednesday of next \nweek. I suggest to my colleagues who have any other questions that in \nthe Calendar of Business on pages 2 and 3, we have outlined the \nagreement.\n  I think the highlights are that we will start considering S. 1 again \non Monday at 10 a.m., with no votes until 4 o'clock, if any votes are \nordered. There will be no business today, except you can send your \namendments to the desk.\n   [[Page S1252]] Mr. FORD. May I further ask, one of the points the \nmajority leader made last evening is the fact that an amendment may be \nfiled but that is not sufficient to cover the unanimous-consent \nagreement. It must be offered. It can be set aside and that constitutes \nan offering and it can be taken up later but, nevertheless, a Senator \nmust offer his amendment or by unanimous-consent one of the leaders or \nthe floor manager can do that.\n  So there was concern last night, and I want to make that clear again \nthis morning, that if an amendment has been filed for cloture, it is \nnot sufficient to accommodate this unanimous-consent agreement.\n  Mr. DOLE. The Senator is correct. There are a number of amendments, I \nthink 117 amendments were filed when we were getting into cloture. In \norder to qualify under this agreement--Senator Byrd from West Virginia \nmade it clear--the Senator himself must offer the amendment, himself. I \nthink we can accommodate everyone, but hopefully they will be able to \naccommodate us, too, and not offer all these amendments.\n  Mr. FORD. I have three on there that could go away. I thank the \nmajority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/20/senate-section/article/S1251-4", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Stutts-Lyells. Mrs. Lyells was born Rubye \n     Elizabeth to the late Tom and Rossie A. Cowan Stutts in \n     Anding, a crossroad village in Yazoo County, Mississippi. Her \n     parents had two sets of twins; one set of whom Mrs. Lyells \n     was the older. All sisters preceded her in death. Mr. Tom \n     Stutts was a prominent progressive farmer known throughout \n     the deep South.\n       Mrs. Lyells' early education was begun at Utica Institute \n     where in 1923 she completed both the eighth and ninth grades, \n     and in 1924 completed the tenth and the eleventh grades. In \n     1925 she graduated as Valedictorian of her class.\n       During the fall semester of the same year Mrs. Lyells' \n     parents enrolled her in the former Alcorn A College (now \n     Alcorn State University) where she graduated in 1929 as \n     Valedictorian of her class. Following graduation from Alcorn, \n     she matriculated at Hampton Institute as a Julius Rosenwald \n     Fellow and in 1930 was conferred the degree of Bachelor of \n     Science in Library Science. She immediately returned to her \n     Alama Mater as the first professionally trained African \n     American Librarian in the State of Mississippi. Mrs. Lyells \n     worked assiduously to bring the library in compliance with \n     standards of professional accrediting agencies, both on the \n     state and regional levels. Much of her work became a model \n     for collection development in other Black Land Grant \n     Colleges.\n       Mrs. Lyells has been at the forefront of almost every \n     significant educational, social, and political advancement \n     made in Mississippi during the past half century. To be on \n     the cutting edge of advancements in the field of \n     librarianship, she took a leave of absence from Alcorn to \n     enroll in the Masters of Arts Library degree program at the \n     University of Chicago where she graduated with distinction in \n     1942.\n       Mrs. Lyells' services, as the state's only African American \n     librarian, were in great demand throughout the nation. \n     However, her immediate decision was to stay in Mississippi to \n     serve as a catalyst in helping to raise the standards of \n     academic and public libraries. She served with distinction as \n     head librarian at Jackson State University as the first \n     African American Librarian to head a branch of the Jackson \n     Municipal Library System; acting librarian at the Atlanta \n     Public Library System and Special Assistant Librarian at the \n     Iowa State University Library.\n       Mrs. Lyells' persistent pioneering efforts for \n     professionalism among African American librarians and her \n     emphasis on quality, available public library resources and \n     facilities for all people were met with apathy, hostility and \n     out-right resistance by those who viewed her ``call for \n     change'' as threatening to their way of life--as recounted by \n     Clarence Hunter and the editor of the Jackson Advocate, Mr. \n     Tisdale--``Mississippi's Library Heritage--Rubye E. Stutts \n     Lyells--A Woman For All Seasons'' She was adamant in her \n     views that librarians should be treated as professionals; \n     that if historically black colleges are to carry out their \n     mission, they should by statutory mandate be funded at a \n     level to acquire and maintain quality libraries.\n       As a world traveler, noteworthy among her distinguished \n     affiliations were: Executive Director, Mississippi State \n     Council on Human Rights; member of the Mississippi Women \n     League of Voters, President, Mississippi Federated Clubs, \n     President of Terrell Literary Club; a post president of Beta \n     Delta Omega Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.; \n     Alcorn State University National Alumni Association, Inc. and \n     the University of Chicago Alumni Association, Inc. She was \n     the recipient of numerous citations and awards. Mrs. Lyells \n     was a candidate for nomination to the Mississippi Senate in \n     1975; attended the Republican National Convention in 1952 and \n     was invited to the Inauguration of President Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower in 1953. In 1970 she served on the Advisory \n     Committee of the Co-chairman of the Republican National \n     Convention (In 1969 she was a delegate to the Southern \n     Republican Conference in New Orleans). In 1979, Mrs. Lyells \n     was appointed to the Mayor's Advisory Committee in Jackson.\n       She is listed in numerous scholarly publications which \n     include Marquis Who's Who; The World Who's Who of Women, \n     Cambridge, England, 1978, p. 724. She was a prolific writer. \n     Many of her articles appeared in refereed journals.\n       Mrs. Lyells served on the Board of Trustees of Prentiss \n     Institute. The Library is \n     [[Page S1253]] named in her honor. The Doctor of Humanities \n     (L.H.D.) degree was conferred on her from Prentiss Institute.\n       She was married to M. J. Lyells, a long-time professor at \n     Alcorn A College and Lanier High School. She was a member \n     of the Christian Science faith having joined the Mother \n     Church in Boston, Massachusetts with local affiliation in \n     Jackson.\n       Following an extended illness, Mrs. Lyells demise came \n     Friday, December 22, 1994 at Englewood Manor Nursing Home. \n     Survivors include a niece, Mrs. Rose Knowles White, Baton \n     Rouge, LA; grand-nieces: Ms. Angela Denise White, San \n     Francisco, CA, Ms. Ann Rossie White of Chicago, IL; one \n     nephew, Mr. Leon Stutts Knowles, Los Angeles, CA (Dana); \n     brother-in-law, Mr. L. L. Knowles; a special daughter-nieces, \n     Mrs. Alice Stutts Jaynes, Jackson, MS; a special cousin, Mr. \n     Renalda Jaynes of Jackson, MS and additional relatives and \n     friends.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, in conclusion, let me simply say that one \nmark of the courage and interest in the political development of our \nState was illustrated by Mrs. Lyells' active and conspicuous \nparticipation in the development of the modern Republican Party in \nMississippi.\n  As an African-American, she took a stand and defended it with grace \nand with dignity and with intelligence, in a way that reflected credit \non many of us who were actively involved in trying to build a new \npolitical party as a vehicle for political expression for our State and \nthe citizens of our State at the national level. For that, I also will \nbe forever grateful to her and to her family.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/20/senate-section/article/S1252-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell).

Mr. President, in order to properly frame some \nobservations that I made last night and at the risk of being redundant \nin some of the comments I made on this floor yesterday, let me just \nmake some reflections as to my feelings on unfunded mandates that come \nfrom quite a few years back.\n  Back in 1967, one of my closest political allies and friends, who \nlater became Senator David Boren, and I came to Washington from the \nState legislature to protest the mandates that came from Lady Bird's \nHighway Beautification Act of 1965. We made a list of what it would \ncost the private sector in terms of screening. We made a list of the \nviolations, of what we perceived to be violations of the 14th \namendment, property rights, people having their property taken away \nfrom them in such areas as outdoor advertising signs and others. But \nprimarily because it was the cost to the municipalities.\n  The leverage they used at that time was that if you do not comply \nwith the mandates of the Highway Beautification Act of 1965, we will \nwithhold several million dollars of your Federal highway matching \nfunds.\n  Now, keep in mind, these are funds that emanated originally from the \nState of Oklahoma, went to Washington and were coming back. Of course, \nOklahoma, having been a donor State for quite a number of years, does \nnot get as much money back as it sends to Washington. So I guess what \nthey were saying to us from the Federal Government, in its infinite \nwisdom, was we have passed a law that says you in Oklahoma cannot have \nthe money you sent to Washington unless you comply with these mandates.\n  That was my first exposure to mandates. I mentioned yesterday also \nthat there are many fine Members of this honorable body who have \ndifferences of opinion philosophically and ideologically. Certainly the \nvery distinguished Senator from California, [Mrs. Feinstein], and I \ndiffer on many issues, but we have one thing in common in our \nbackground, and that is we were both mayors of major cities.\n  I remember when we were both serving on the U.S. Conference of Mayors \nBoard of Directors our major concern at that time was unfunded \nmandates.\n  Whether it is in the State of Kentucky or the State of Georgia, \nregardless of who you go to, if you talk to your mayors and your county \ncommissioners and your State legislators and the private sector, they \nwill say the major problem we have is not necessarily crime; it is not \nwelfare; it is unfunded mandates. Because while we are facing fiscal \nproblems here in Washington, the problems are even more severe at the \nlocal level.\n  A lot of people do not realize the genesis of the problem that we \nhave in these mandates. I think it goes back to the Great Society days \nwhen we decided Government was going to take on a role that perhaps was \noutside the boundaries of what our Founding Fathers thought the \nGovernment should be doing. At least if I have any understanding of the \n10th amendment to the Constitution, it says that powers will be \nreserved to the States or to the people other than those specifically \ndelegated to the Federal Government; that we have become very greedy at \nthe Federal level, and that this greed emanates from the desire of \npoliticians, an insatiable appetite to give things to people in return \nfor their votes. And realizing that there is not an adequate amount of \nmoney there, they, of course, impose those financial hardships on \npolitical subdivisions below them. And that is where we have found \nourselves today.\n  I hope that all of the American people were watching what was \nhappening last night and what has happened over the past 6 days. I \nasked our staff to advise me as to how many hours have we been debating \nthe unfunded mandates bill. According to their calculation, it is 47 \nhours--47 hours of debate on something that really is not that \ncomplicated.\n  Yes, we can get into the finer details and the amendments that \nperhaps might make it more workable, and I think our distinguished \nmajority leader, Senator Dole, has gone far beyond the expectations of \nthe American people in being fair. Those of us who are freshmen--and I \nthink I can speak in behalf of all 11 of us who are newly elected who \njust came off the campaign trail and listened to the people and were \nthere on November 8 when the mandate came out--do not look at this \nContract With America in the cute reference that many other people try \nto put it, in a demeaning sense. It is a very real thing. People are \nsick and tired of the games we are playing here in Washington, and for \nthe last 6 days we have been playing games. We have not been \nlegislating. We have been playing games.\n  I know that a lot of Americans out there are applauding at a \nstatement like that because that is what is happening, and they are \nsick and tired of it. We have a man who ran for President of the United \nStates, elected in 1992, who used throughout his campaign the word \n``gridlock.'' We are going to come to Washington and we are going to \nchange; we are going to eliminate gridlock.\n  We have created gridlock, Mr. President, in the last 6 days and we \nhave done it willfully. We have created gridlock to stall an issue. And \nI am going to make a prediction in the Chamber of this Senate that is \ngoing to offend a lot of people, I am afraid, Mr. President, but it is \nsomething that I think has to be said. I believe that this issue has \nbeen stalled for a very good reason. First of all, why would they stall \nan issue on unfunded mandates? Who is opposed to unfunded mandates \nexcept for a few liberal people who want to keep the ability to pour \nmoney into social programs or other programs and then let the States \nand the cities and the counties and the people pick up the tab.\n  Now, that is a philosophy that is out there, and there are some of \nthose who want to do that. But this is not a Republican or Democrat \nprogram; it is not a conservative or liberal program, because if you \nlook at the Senator from California, as I mentioned, Mrs. Feinstein, \nshe is very supportive of this because she has sat in a mayor's seat \nand knows what it is like to have to pay for these mandates that come \ndown.\n   [[Page S1254]] Yesterday, in the Chamber, I outlined that in only \nthree cities in Oklahoma the unfunded mandates exceeded $35 million, \nand this is over a period of time. It is just incredible that you could \nhave this. It is not just in Broken Arrow and Tulsa, OK, and in San \nFrancisco. It is throughout America. So it is something that everyone \nnow wants to do something about. The liberals are for it. The \nconservatives are for it. Organizations like the U.S. Conference of \nMayors are for it; the Municipal League is for it; the NFIB is for it. \nAll organizations out there are for this. And yet it has been stalled \nand stalled and stalled and stalled. It is a bill, a resolution that \ncould very well have been deliberated for 2 days and passed as \neverybody wants it.\n  The reason I do not believe it was passed is because there is a \ndeliberate effort to stall the vote on this until after the State of \nthe Union Message that will take place next Tuesday night. And when \nthat happens, I predict in the Chamber of this Senate right now that \nthe President will stand up, even though he may not like the idea of \npassing an unfunded mandates bill, which I personally do not think he \nreally wants but he heard that the American people did want it on \nNovember 8, and he is going to say, ``And I am going to ask this \nCongress, I am going to ask this Senate to go back into session and \npass the unfunded mandates bill.'' And we will. And it is a bill that \nwe should have passed a week before.\n  Is this gridlock? Yes, it is gridlock. I think it is intentional \ngridlock. One time someone put the pencil to how much it costs us to \nkeep this body in. I wish I could recall those figures right now, but \nit is very, very expensive. So there was a tremendous cost to the \nAmerican people. There is a lot of inconvenience to a lot of people. \nThere were late nights. There was a dialog. We talked on this floor \nabout every conceivable subject that you could talk about and finally \ngot around to making a few comments about unfunded mandates.\n  So I am saying, yes, it is going to happen, but it is not going to \nhappen until after the State of the Union Message. I think that is a \nvery sad thing.\n  Do you know where I got the idea of gridlock and where I am coming up \nwith this? It came from someone who talks to a lot of people. It is my \nbarber. A lot of times we have this beltway mentality here where we \ntalk to bureaucrats and we talk to think tank people and we talk to \neach other and we forget that there is a real world out there with real \npeople who are sick and tired of what is going on up here. I think we \nwill all have learned a lesson as a result of this.\n  So, Mr. President, in conclusion, I say I hope the American people \nhave been watching for the last couple of days, because what they saw \nis something we are going to bring to an end. I think I speak in behalf \nof certainly all 11 of the freshmen Members of this organization when I \nmake this statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nKentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/20/senate-section/article/S1253-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1254-S1256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           UNFUNDED MANDATES\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I admire my new-made friend from Oklahoma. \nI, too, was Governor. I came to Washington about the so-called unfunded \nmandates. It was a little easier to take care of then than it is now \nbecause we had 12 years of Republicans who ran us from $900 million to \nover $4 trillion in debt in 12 years. It is a little tough for us now \nto carry that load.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FORD. Not now. I did not disturb the Senator when he was \nspeaking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator declines to yield.\n  Mr. FORD. Then we hear something about gridlock. If the Senator had \nbeen here 2 years ago, you would have been part of gridlock--and I say \n``the Senator'' rather than ``you''; I want to be careful of my \nlanguage for the Record--because the Republican side would not let us \ngo with pieces of legislation we thought were important. Now they have \nbecome part of the Contract With America. The same pieces of \nlegislation, basically, that were filibustered in the last session of \nCongress are now in the Contract With America. Surprising, is it not? \nSurprising.\n  We stand here in the last few days, last couple of weeks, and act \nlike the world has stopped.\n  We forgot aging in the bill that came out of committee. It would have \ngone on and we would have excluded aging in the amendment. And the \nmanager of the bill from the Republican side, the majority side, was a \ncosponsor of that amendment when he found out about it. So we have made \nsome contribution.\n  We had an amendment last night that was defeated, but utilities--and \nyour State ought to be very interested in utilities--wanted that very \nbadly, because the mandates to private enterprise stick and they do not \nstick on public entities under this legislation. So it is the business-\noriented group here, I guess you would say, who have said to business: \nWe are going to stick it to you. Because the mayors and commissioners \nout there are raising Cain, we are going to let them off the hook.\n  So we have incinerators: Private and public. The public does not have \nto take the mandate but private will, regardless of what it costs.\n  Landfills: Public and private. The private will have to get stuck \nwith all that.\n  Schools--think about schools, the mandate on schools. Private will \nhave to be stuck with it; public will not.\n  Hospitals; in my hometown we have two fine hospitals. Those fine \nhospitals want to come together--one is public and one is private--and \ncome with an HMO, to merge and try to give better service at lower \nrates in my community. We better be careful because the private \nhospital might have to carry out some mandates that the public hospital \nwill not have to.\n  Why jam this thing through when all those problems are there that \nshould be worked out? We wake up: Oh, I did not know it was in the \nbill. I will guarantee not a Senator here, with few exceptions, can \ntell you everything that is in the bill. You get up here and talk \nabout, oh, we are just gridlocked. It may be gridlock, but a couple of \nthings--real, I think--have happened. One, the utilities woke up and \nbusiness woke up about what is getting ready to happen to them, for \none. That is one. Then we found we left out the elderly; we exempted \neverybody but the elderly. AARP, I am sure, did not know it. But last \nnight it was 99 to zip when you found it, and that was because we said \nlet us look at the bill. And Senator Levin, from Michigan, was the \nindividual who found it, brought the amendment up, and the Republican \nfloor leader became a cosponsor of that amendment. That was helpful.\n  You can stand here all you want to and say we have to get it through \nbecause the American people want it. But when small business and major \nbusinesses are being hurt, they are not able to be competitive with \npublic--we have local incinerators and private; we have landfills, \npublic and private; we have hospitals, public and private--and you are \nputting a heavier burden on business and taking it off of their \ncompetitor, which is government, I think you ought to take a step back \nand see what you are doing on this.\n  We on this side have given you an opportunity to do that. If you want \nto continue to make the mistake, continue to make the mistake of \nputting horrendous burdens on business and not on the public entities, \nthen go ahead. When this Senator, 8 years ago, introduced unfunded \nmandates legislation--the threshold was $50 million then and it has not \nchanged--I got two Senators, two Senators who would be cosponsors.\n  How times have changed. You said back, I guess in 1967 or 1968, you \nwere here. Where were you when I needed you 8 years ago? Where was all \nthis euphoria for unfunded mandates legislation? I introduced it a year \nlater--nothing happened. So I dropped it. Maybe I should have carried \nit on. I would have been a part of the Contract With America. But I was \nthere 8 years ago. I was there 7 years ago. The threshold is the same. \nNow you want to change some from $50 to $100 million. Things are \nbeginning to change. And there are now some changes being made in the \nbill, I think for the better.\n  You can fuss at me all you want to. You just give me the devil. Devil \ntake the hindmost, you know? But I am doing what I think is right, and \ntwo changes have made this bill better.\n  It does not go into effect until 1996. Why is the urge here to get \nsomething \n[[Page S1255]] done when mistakes are being made in the bill?\n  And one other thing, one other thing. Many of you, the new Members, \nare from the House. Over in the House you could be paid for your travel \nand be a frequent flier and you take those frequent flier miles and use \nthem personally. That is all right on the House side. We have never \ndone it on the Senate side. I am a chairman of the Rules Committee. I \nsaid no, and that is agreeable.\n  So I had a little amendment here, if you recall, about a week or 10 \ndays ago that said the House could not use taxpayers' money for \npersonal use. They get out here on the floor and every Republican voted \nagainst me and said let the House take care of it. If they want to have \nit for personal use, let them do it.\n  What is wrong is wrong and what is right is right. If you listened to \nSam Donaldson the other night, and the House let the bill go through \nwithout making the changes and they are still getting the perk--you are \ngoing to get that amendment again. Because 50 million people watched, \nas they said the House did not take care of that personal perk. So \nthink about it just a little bit.\n  In this bill you are changing the rules of the House. You are \nchanging the rules of the House in this bill. And I am going to ask you \nto stop it because you would not--Let them have the perk. So why should \nyou mandate changes in the rules of the House in this bill? All the \nformer House Members, how mad would you get when the Senate did that \nwhen you were in the House? You got pretty mad, got pretty upset. You \ndid not want it done. That was the reasoning.\n  But now in this bill it is all right. It is in your bill that you \nwant to get through immediately, and you are changing the rules of the \nHouse. Try a look at page 26, (d), lines 1 through 5. Just take that \nlittle section of this bill and see what it does to the House. What is \nfair for the goose is fair for the gander. And you are going to have \nthat amendment. You are going to say no, we just want to let them have \nperks. But in this bill, this is the difference. We are going to find \nout the attitude, and see how you go are going to vote because we are \ngoing to get that amendment. And it is coming pretty quickly. Maybe we \ncan get it early Tuesday. But some changes ought to be made in the \nbill, and they will be offered. We will have a chance. The Senate will \nhave a chance to be for or against this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I do not know about my time. I do not know whether I \ncan reserve it. But some will not use time, and I will be able to get \nmore time later on.\n  But let us be reasonable about this. Talk about having comity. We get \nup and say how bad we are. I can go back and give speeches maybe of \nmonths ago almost identical on this side that the other side made. They \nare almost identical. So as times change, the more they stay the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I come here to join my colleague from Oklahoma in his \ncomments concerning what is happening in the Senate. I have a \nstatement, but I want to yield to him for a few moments to respond to \nthe Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I might say that under the rules of the \nSenate, he can get, by asking unanimous consent, all the time he wants. \nThe Senator does not have to yield to him.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I say to the Senator from Kentucky that we know the \nrules. But I would like to make one short response, if I may.\n  First of all, Mr. President, I have a great deal of respect for this \ninstitution, and I have studied the background and the history of how \nwe got into a bicameral system. I think there is a very useful purpose \nfor that. I served 8 years in the House of Representatives, and things \nrun through there quickly. The train has slowed down here. But there is \na difference between slowing down the train and stopping the train.\n  When a statement is made about why the urgency since it does not take \neffect until 1996, the urgency is that we have many other things in a \ncontract, a so-called Contract With America, things that Americans \nbelieve they were voting for on November 8. We want an opportunity to \npresent those. We cannot do that if we get bogged down day after day \nfor hours and do not get much done with a bill.\n  I will make one other statement that I think is very significant. \nCertainly, I have the utmost respect for the Senator from Kentucky. It \nis true that when the Republicans were the minority here in this body, \nthat there was filibustering going on. I think even though it may not \nhave technically been a filibuster, what we have been experiencing in \nthe last 6 days certainly is very close to that. The difference is \nthis: The difference is when they were filibustering last year in this \nbody, they were filibustering a bill; for example, the Government \ntakeover of the health care system. That was something that 80 percent \nof the people did not want.\n  What we are talking about now is unfunded mandates, which is \nsomething that by survey 80 percent of the American people do want, and \nI draw a major distinction between the two.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for yielding.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, what I want to do is first respond to \nthe Senator from Kentucky and a couple of points that he made, and then \ntalk in general about the problem I think we are confronting here in \nthis debate on unfunded mandates.\n  I would agree with the Senator from Kentucky that amendments have \nbeen offered to improve the bill. I would agree that the amendments he \nreferred to have in fact improved the bill, and have in fact gotten \nbipartisan support, and the legislative process in that respect is \nworking.\n  I also remind the Senator from Kentucky that we are in the first step \nof the process. We are considering the bill here for the first time. \nThe House is yet to bring it up. They are going to be considering \namendments under an open rule which will allow improvement to this \nbill. We will then in all likelihood pass different versions of this \nbill. It will then go to conference where different ideas that have \nbeen percolated through the legislative process get resolved, and \nhopefully even a better product will come out with the best ideas of \nthe House and Senate.\n  I do not think anyone would say that any bill that passes the House \nor the Senate is perfect. There are always things that are going to \ncome up that could have been improved. We would like to see debate. I \nwould like to see debate on germane amendments that deal with the issue \nof unfunded mandates. I would like to see improvements to the bill. I \nwould like to hear the concerns of both Republicans and Democrats as to \nwhat we can do to make this bill a better and more efficient process \nfor reducing the amount of unfunded mandates that we pass on to the \nState and local governments.\n  But that is not what is going on here. What is going on here are \namendments that have absolutely nothing to do with unfunded mandates, \nlike frequent flier amendments, abortion clinic amendments, and going \non and on, that have nothing to do with the substance of the bill that \nare in these riders.\n  I remember when I was running for office, people would come up to me \nand say, ``When you get to the Senate, you get rid of those riders, all \nof those things that they just throw on these bills that have nothing \nto do with the bill, that really clog up the legislative process and \nget all these things thrown in there that we do not like.''\n  What we are seeing here is a classic example of what the American \npublic does not like, which is a bill that has broad public support \nthat is moving through the process, that is continually being derailed \non education issues, on abortion issues, and unfortunately we are not \ngetting back to the subject at hand, which is unfunded mandates, and \nmoving that process through which has overwhelming public support.\n  We are happy to deal with germane amendments and improvements to the \nbill. That is what we have been striving to do--limit the debate with \ncloture petitions that the majority leader has \n[[Page S1256]] sent to the desk. Let us have a full and open debate on \nunfunded mandates. Let us deal with the amendments that are germane to \nthe bill that could improve the quality of legislation. That is what we \nare attempting to do with the cloture petition. Let us just deal with \nthe things that are germane, that are improvements to the bill, and let \nus put all this other stuff--which may be important--let us put it \naside and we can bring it up another day.\n  As many Senators from both sides of the aisle said, we are in early \nJanuary. We have a lot of time in this session to deal with a variety \nof issues.\n  But this is a bill that has the support that has been worked on for \nat least 8 years, and has had bipartisan support for a long period of \ntime.\n  I just got off a conference call 2 days ago with mayors all across my \nState. We did a conference call talking to them. The comments that I \ngot were just overwhelming. I have been getting calls from my county \ncommissioners from both sides of the aisle saying, ``Please move this \nbill forward. We need this help. We need this assurance that you are \nnot going to continue to push more and more costs on local government \nand State government without providing the needed funds to pay for \nthese programs.''\n  So we have the consensus. I agree the details need to be worked out. \nThe Senator from Kentucky is absolutely right. We have improved the \nbill. There will hopefully be other amendments on which we can make \nimprovements, at least that we can discuss, to this bill. But let us do \nthat. Let us focus in on that.\n  I came from the House of Representatives. I have been reminded many, \nmany times that the House and the Senate are different bodies, and they \nare. I appreciate the difference. I understand the Senate is a more \ndeliberative body. That is a wonderful thing.\n  I look back at last year, and look at the bills that were stopped \nhere in the Senate that were rammed through the House because of the \nrules of the House, that were rammed through the House, that came here \nto the Senate and were slowed down and in many cases changed, and in \nsome cases stopped completely. It was a benefit.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma referred to the health care bill. He is \nabsolutely right. That process was slowed down dramatically here in the \nSenate, and I think to the benefit of the American public in the long \nrun.\n  So the Senate does have an important role to play. But when we have \npieces of legislation that have broad support, in fact have broad \nbipartisan support in this body--we have 60-some cosponsors on this \nbill--we have, hopefully, more that will actually vote for the bill. \nWhen you have that kind of support, when you have the support here, the \nsupport in the public, and you have--with this last election--a clear \nmandate to move, then I think it is the obligation of the people who \nsupport this measure, on both sides of the aisle, to stand up and say \nthat it is time to move forward.\n  So I hope that Republicans and Democrats can join together and push \nthis package forward and limit the debate to amendments that are \ngermane to improving the quality of this bill, so we can produce the \nbest product here in the Senate, so we can come up with the best piece \nof legislation that the best minds in the country here in the U.S. \nSenate can work on and craft and send to the House. And maybe if they \nrecognize the great handiwork that we have done here, they will just \naccept what we have done.\n  They did that with the congressional accountability bill--another \nbill that was slowed down for a week with spurious amendments on a \nwhole variety of different topics that had nothing to do with \ncongressional accountability. We did such fine work on the germane \namendments, such good handiwork here in the Senate on the underlying \nbill, that we kept it, in a sense, clean from all these other \namendments. And when it came to the House, the House said: You folks \ndid a pretty good job; we will just pass your bill. In fact, it is now \non the President's desk.\n  That is the kind of action the folks in Pennsylvania want. I think \nthat is the kind of action folks all over the United States of America \nwant from this body. They want us to get down to business. They want us \nto focus in, one by one, on the issues that are important to America. \nThe Senator from Kentucky is absolutely right. The frequent flier issue \nis an important issue. It is a perk that the House should not have. \nWhen I was in the House, I did not accept my frequent flier miles. I \ndid not use them for personal use. It was my office policy. The Senator \nfrom Kentucky is right that that privilege is available and it should \nnot be. It should not be. I hope that we can work together and make \nthat happen. I hope the House acts quickly to do that. But I would not \nbe averse to putting some pressure on the House to do that.\n  Let us focus on what we all now agree should be passed, what needs to \nbe passed to restore to this institution the faith of the American \npublic that we are a body that listens, that we are a body that can \nact, and that we are a body that understands our obligation to serve \nthe American public. I hope that is what we can do when we return for \nvotes Monday and Tuesday--that we can focus the attention back on the \nbill, that we can improve the quality of the bill, that we can move the \nbill forward quickly, that we can get to the other pieces of \nlegislation that are waiting in line behind unfunded mandates, like the \nbalanced budget amendment, that are important pieces of legislation \nwhich, again, the public wants us to take up and move in a timely \nfashion.\n  I do not want to stop debate on any amendment that improves the \nquality of this bill, not one. Offer them, debate them. It is needed. \nThe Senator from West Virginia is absolutely right that there are \nthings in this bill that concern a lot of Members and a lot of people \nin this country, and they should be debated. That is what we want to do \nwith this cloture motion. If we get an agreement to limit the number of \namendments and the time in which they can be offered, that is what we \nwant to do.\n  That is what this side of the aisle is trying to do. We are trying to \nmove the bill forward, trying to be accommodating. We are trying to \nkeep our promise with the American public to move this institution, to \nget bills passed, to get it done in a prompt fashion, and to deliver on \nthe November election.\n  I think we can do that, and I hope that with the support of Members \non both sides of the aisle, we will be able to accomplish that.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Chair, what would be \nthe procedure now since we are limited to 15 minutes and no other \nSenator is seeking recognition? What would be the parliamentary \nprocedure, so that we might understand that for the rest of the day?\n  I felt the Senator from Oklahoma could have gotten the floor in his \nown right without----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair finds that as long as we are in \nmorning business, any Senator can be recognized for 15 minutes at a \ntime.\n  Mr. FORD. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for \nan additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would find that every time the \nSenator is recognized, he would have 15 minutes; it is not necessary to \nask unanimous consent.\n  Mr. FORD. Now, that is clear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/20/senate-section/article/S1254-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1256-S1258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HOW THE SENATE OPERATES\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it is a new day and I am enjoying it. I \nremember when I came from Frankfort, KY, as a former Governor, I had a \nfile cabinet, one of those paper file cabinets, drawer size, with \nprojects in it that I was unable to complete. If you remember--maybe \nyou all are not old enough--but if you remember, we had a pocket veto \nof highway funds and utility funds by President Nixon. A suit was \nfiled, as I recall--do not hold me to every detail, but a suit was \nfiled--and I think Senator Muskie was the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, and the Governor of Missouri filed suit. The courts held \nthat the President of the United States had to release that money.\n  Well, we had been held up for a year and we were into the second year \nof appropriated funds, so we had a lot of money to spend. We were doing \nwell. We got the first and second phases of some projects done--sewer, \nwater, \n[[Page S1257]] things of that nature. So I came with that box of \nprojects that I wanted to get finished. The senior Members here said to \nme--you know, I was gung ho. They said, ``That is all right, son; you \njust relax. We will get to it next week, and if we do not get to it \nthat week, we will get to it the week after that.''\n  It was hard for me to take. That has only been 20 years, and I \nremember it as if it were yesterday. I wanted to move. When I was \nGovernor, I picked up the phone and the highway department would move, \nor I picked up the phone and somebody else would do something for me. \nIt was something that I felt I would be in a position to do here, but I \ncould not. The rules were different; attitudes were different; the \ninstitution was different from the Governor's office.\n  So, as my learned friend from Pennsylvania said, the House and Senate \nare different. The Senator from Pennsylvania talked about the \nnongermane amendments. Well, if you recall, it was on both sides of the \naisle yesterday. It was not just Democrats that put up a nongermane \namendment. A Republican put up a nongermane amendment which took hours. \nEven your majority leader offered a nonbinding amendment, a sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment to that amendment to try to get rid of it. We had \nanother one on our side. It took hours. That proves a point, though, \nabout the Senate.\n  Every Senator has a right on this floor, and his right is not stymied \nby a Rules Committee and a vote of the Senate that limits him to 2 \nminutes or 5 minutes or three amendments, or something of that nature. \nEvery Senator has a right. That makes this body significantly \ndifferent. So the Republican Senator was within his right to offer a \nnongermane amendment here. The Democratic Senator was within his right \nto offer a nongermane amendment, under the rules of the Senate.\n  So maybe you do not like it, but that was his right and he exercised \nthat right. As far as frequent flier miles, I tried to put that on \ncongressional coverage. I argued strenuously that we were not truly \ndoing what we had told the American people we were going to do about \ncongressional coverage. Congress took care of itself. You are immune. \nThe people out there think you are not.\n  We set up a commission to study and see what should apply--about $5 \nmillion a year. I, as former chairman of the Rules Committee, had set \nup the Fair Employment Office. That is about $1 million a year just for \nthat office. You are not paying for it; the taxpayers are paying for \nit. I thought maybe we should lift the veil and let it all apply, \ninstead of being special and Congress taking care of itself again. That \nwas part of my problem.\n  The distinguished majority leader said at that time that this bill \nwould be accepted by the House and sent to the President.\n  So I felt it was more incumbent upon me, then, and other Senators \nhere, incumbent upon us to see that that bill was as good a bill as we \ncould pass. Because it was not going to conference, we would not have a \nsecond shot at it. And so that became the concern of those that felt \nthat congressional coverage was not adequate and that we were not being \nfair with the American people. So I just think you have to get it all \nin the right perspective.\n  And when your leader says it will be accepted on the House side, I \nrespect that statement. So, therefore, when I respect the individual \nand the statement he made, I became more concerned that this bill ought \nto be changed, if it was going to be changed, here, because they were \ngoing to accept it and, just like grease, go to the White House.\n  So that was one of my concerns and one of the reasons I felt that we \nought to debate that bill and try to change it and make it as good as \npossible. Because that was the last chance we were going to have; no \nother shot at it.\n  So now on this piece of legislation, unfunded mandates, sure they \nwant it. Oh, do they want it. I had a mayor from Kentucky, who is the \nretiring president of the National Mayors Association. Oh, do I get \ncalls; do I get fussed at a little bit.\n  But when you sit down and talk to them and say, ``Look, we are \ngetting down to the amendments now that we feel are very important''--\nand they are--``and we left out the elderly.'' We exempted everybody \nelse but the elderly. I want to respect the elderly. I think they ought \nto be given the same kind of respect and coverage as others. So we put \nin the elderly. It is a good amendment. Everybody voted for it. Even \nthose that are fussing at us because they think we are holding the bill \nup.\n  My learned friend from Pennsylvania says we ought to get an agreed \nlist. We have an agreed list. We did it last night. I stayed here until \nalmost 1 o'clock this morning. I do not know where those Senators were \nwhen we made that agreement, but we made that agreement. And those \namendments have to be offered by the individual Senator unless it is by \nunanimous consent. He or she has to be here and offer that amendment. \nWe got that agreement. We have a time certain to shut off amendments, \nand then we go to third reading and that is debatable.\n  We had a gentleman's agreement last night. And if, in the judgment of \none or the other, that gentleman's agreement is breaking down, they \nhave every right, it was said last night, to file a cloture motion.\n  So I think we have done a decent job here, even though everybody \nwants to move it a little bit fast.\n  I am going to vote for the bill. I am very strong for unfunded \nmandates. But I do not want to jeopardize the mother's milk of the \neconomy, and that is business. If you are going to look at this bill \nand say you are going to mandate on business and not the public sector \nwhen they are in competition with each other, I think you ought to take \na step back and look at it. Hopefully, some of these amendments will be \ntaken very seriously. I hope that business will come forward. They are \nvery strongly for the unfunded mandates bill. So I hope that they will \nlook at it a little bit closer. Do they want to take a chance on having \na public entity, government entity, to be in a better position to \ncompete than they are? Maybe they already have. But this is another \naddition.\n  I wish the Senator from Oklahoma were here. He talked about one \nfilibuster that we filed cloture on.\n  There were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, \n18, 19, 20, 21, 22 filibusters. Here they are. You voted on them in the \n103d Congress.\n  And now, when we are trying to correct a bill--and even getting \nRepublican support for our changes in the bill--we are being fussed at \nbecause there is gridlock. There is no gridlock here.\n  As the congressional coverage bill was to leave here and never to be \nconsidered again, we would never have another shot at it, I think it \nwas incumbent upon us to try to correct it. And filibusters--there they \nare. There is the record. I will not put it in the Record. I do not \nwant the cost of $480 a page.\n  So Mr. President, I am overwhelmed by the attendance here this \nmorning and those who want to wax eloquent. As I heard my distinguished \nfriend from Arkansas say last night, he was going to wax eloquent. \nSomeone said he was going to wax. He said ``no,'' it is going to be \neloquent.\n  So I am sure there is nothing waxing or eloquent about me. I am \nenjoying being here this morning and visiting with some of my \ncolleagues and talking about this great institution and how we function \nhere and what is good for the country and how fast we ought to be \nmoving and that sort of thing.\n  I was out here and someone said, ``You're awful nice, Ford.'' I said, \n``Yes, I'm a better human being than I was because I want to be good.''\n  A lot of us got stomped on November 8--real good. I listened. I \nlistened 8 years ago on unfunded mandates. I listened 7 years ago on \nunfunded mandates. I listened in 1991 when we cut off frequent flier \nmiles for personal use. I listened then.\n  The House Members came over here and wanted it. I turned it down. It \nwas the Rules Committee who said ``no.'' I think we made a good \ndecision under the circumstances. So those House Members came over \nhere; and even the Vice President was interested in it when he was a \nSenator.\n  So there are a lot of things. Just remember, it is all down in black \nand white in the history there. Let us be sure what we say, and I want \nto be sure what I say is correct.\n   [[Page S1258]] I see another Senator here who probably would like to \nhave some time.\n  Mr. President, under the ruling of the Chair that when you are \nrecognized each time, you have 15 minutes, I will yield the floor so I \ncan be recognized again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the issue of health \ncare in America and specifically the concept of medical savings \naccounts, sometimes called medical IRA's.\n  I speak today as an elected official, as a U.S. Senator, but also as \na practicing physician having devoted the last 20 years of my life to \ncaring for patients.\n  I have witnessed first hand the unequalled quality of health care in \nthe United States. But I have also witnessed the problems in health \ncare today--the skyrocketing costs and limitations in terms of access.\n  Last year, President Clinton addressed the problems of our health \ncare system, but his proposed solutions were fatally flawed. He favored \nmonopolization, not competition. He sought to empower bureaucrats, not \nindividuals.\n And in the end, he relied on Government, not the private sector.\n\n  Fortunately, once the American people heard the truth about the \nadministration's plan, they rejected it. Nevertheless, the problems \nwith our health care system have not disappeared. Make no mistake. \nThere are problems with our health care system in this country today. \nInstead of scrapping the whole system we must target and fix what is \nbroken.\n  Mr. President, I believe the use of medical savings accounts is an \nimportant first step in that process. A fundamental problem which \ncharacterizes every interaction between patient and health care \nprovider is that the provider is not paid directly by the patient but \nby a third party. On average, every time a patient in America receives \na dollar's worth of medical services, 79 cents is paid for by someone \nelse, usually the Government or an insurance company. The result is \nthat we grossly overconsume medical services in this country today.\n  Imagine if we were all required to pay out of pocket only 20 cents \nout of every dollar of food that we purchased, or transportation, or \nclothing. We would all buy more than we need. That is what happens in \nmedicine every day. Since people do not feel they are paying for it out \nof their own pockets, and everyone does want the very best and the very \nmost at any price. Whether it is the deluxe hospital room, whether it \nis the MRI scan for a headache, whether it is the latest and the newest \nin nuclear medical imaging, we all want the best and we overconsume. We \nmust become more cost-conscious consumers of medical services.\n  Mr. President, there are two methods of doing this. First, as the \nClinton administration urged this past year, we can limit technology. \nWe can ration care thereby ultimately destroying the good quality of \nhealth care that we have today. The American people outright rejected \nthis alternative. And with good reason. It would have reduced the \nquality of care in this country.\n  I saw this happen first hand during a year I spent in England as a \nmedical registrar in heart and lung surgery. I watched over and over \nagain as patients waited months for medical procedures which they would \nhave obtained in a few days or a few weeks in this country. Sadly, in \nsome instances, I watched patients die while they waited.\n  The second choice, and the one I believe we must follow if we are to \nstem the skyrocketing cost of health care in this country, is to \nempower individuals to enable them to purchase their medical services \ndirectly, as they do other services in our society today.\n  Medical savings accounts would encourage patients to become more \nprudent in their decisionmaking in the purchase of health services. \nWhat are medical savings accounts? Medical savings accounts are tax-\nfree personal savings accounts which can be used by an individual to \npay his or her medical bills. Take, for an example, an employee of a \ntypical company. Today, an employer might pay $2,000, $3,000, or even \n$4,000 for a medical insurance policy with a $500 deductible for an \nemployee. But the employee then has no incentive to be cost conscious. \nIn contrast, if medical savings accounts were available, the employer \nwould deposit an amount, say $2,000, in a tax-free personal savings \naccount which would belong to the employee. The employee would turn \naround and buy an inexpensive catastrophic-type policy which would \ncover medical expenses greater than $2,000 if they occurred in any \nsingle year. For medical expenses incurred up to that $2,000 deductible \nlimit, the employee, using his or her own discretion, would use money \nfrom the savings account for these purchases.\n  Any savings account money not spent on health care over the course of \nthat year would roll over into that savings account and grow tax free. \nIt would accumulate, year after year. At retirement that money--the \nmoney not used--could be rolled over into an IRA, into a pension or be \nused to pay for long-term care or other expenses.\n  Thus, the individual would have a strong incentive to become a cost-\nconscious consumer of medical care. He or she will demand quality care \nat competitive prices. The consumer, the individual, the patient, will \nthen drive the market. The system will respond with better outcome \nmeasures, better and lower unit prices for health care broadly. In \nshort, medical savings accounts will give American health care \nconsumers strong incentives to change to modify the way they consume \nhealth care services because they are able to keep any money that they \ndo not spend.\n  We will potentially save billions of dollars in health care costs \nbecause individual patients will modify their purchasing habit \nbehavior. Medical savings accounts will also potentially save billions \nof dollars in administrative costs. In 1992 alone, administrative costs \nfor health insurance exceeded $41 billion. With medical savings \naccounts, patients will deal directly with health care providers and \neliminate many of the third-party intermediaries.\n  Finally and perhaps most importantly, the use of medical savings \naccounts will maintain the high quality of care that Americans have \ncome to know. While the Clinton administration would limit technology \nand force hospitals and doctors to ration care, medical savings \naccounts will put the individual back in charge of his or her own care \nand consumption of medical services.\n  Mr. President, in closing, we in America are fortunate to have the \nabsolute highest quality of health care in the world. When the leaders \nof the world become seriously ill they do not go to Great Britain or \nCanada to seek treatment. They come here, to the United States. While \nthere are those who would like to stifle our technological advances and \nallow bureaucrats to tell people how much and what kind of health care \nwe can receive, the American people have spoken loudly and clearly and \nrejected this notion.\n  No one can predict what will happen in the next 50 years of the 21st \ncentury in the field of medicine; 50 years ago when my dad was a \npracticing physician, making house calls day by day, he would not \nenvision that somebody such as myself would be doing heart transplants \nin the 1990's. The technological advances are simply mind-boggling.\n  Mr. President, the challenge for everyone is to maintain the highest \nquality health care in the world, and to continue to make it available \nto all Americans. This can only be done if we change the basic \nframework through which medical services are consumed and continue with \na market-based system.\n  I believe the use of medical savings accounts will be a major first \nstep in that direction. Individual patients become part of the \nsolution, not just part of the problem. For this reason I hope that my \ncolleagues in the Senate will support my efforts to pass legislation \nlater in this session to create medical savings accounts.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  (Disturbance in the visitors' galleries.)\n   [[Page S1259]] The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the debate we are engaged in, and have been \nfor 8 days now, is important not only because the American people are \ntired of the Federal Government telling them what to do--and, in the \ncase of State and local governments and tribal governments, having the \nadditional burden of then having to pay for those Federal mandates. It \nis important, therefore, not only because the unfunded mandates \nlegislation would put a stop to that in the future and say that from \nnow on the Federal Government is going to have to identify the cost of \nmandates on the private sector and is going to have to pay for the \nmandates it imposes on the public sector--it is important not only for \nthat reason, but it is also important because when we pass the balanced \nbudget amendment and send that to the States for their ratification, \nthe State legislatures and the Governors are going to be considering \nwhether or not to ratify that amendment. One of the concerns that they \nare going to have is that the Federal Government might attempt to \nachieve its requirement of meeting a balanced budget by simply foisting \nthe costs onto the State and local governments and tribal governments.\n  I would add as a footnote that in my State of Arizona the business of \ntribal governments is significant, and they have to bear the burden of \nsome of these mandates. So they are all concerned about this.\n  In the case of the people in the State legislature, they suggested to \nme that if we want the balanced budget amendment to be ratified by the \nState legislatures, we had better make it very clear that the Federal \nGovernment is not going to attempt to achieve that balance by laying \nall of these mandates on State and local governments. We might have \ndone that in the case of the health care legislation that, I think \nfortunately, was killed last year. One of my friends back in Arizona \ncalled it ``justifiable homicide.'' I am delighted we did not pass the \nkind of bill that was originally proposed because it would have created \na huge mandate on the private sector. In fact, it was called employer \nmandates. And employers would have been required to pay substantial \namounts of money. In some cases I believe there were situations where \nthey really could not afford it, which is the reason they do not \nprovide that health care today. So both for the public and private \nsectors it is important that the Government not impose these mandates. \nBut as I said, it is important not only in its own right but because of \nthe connection to the balanced budget amount.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/20/senate-section/article/S1259-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1259-S1261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to turn for a moment to the \nsubject of a balanced budget amendment in this overall context that we \nare debating unfunded mandates, and soon we will be debating the \nbalanced budget amendment because the Joint Economic Committee held a \nhearing this morning and took testimony from both House and Senate \nMembers on their proposals for achieving this goal.\n  When we talk about the Federal Government achieving a balanced budget \nwithout passing the costs on to the State and local governments in the \nform of unfunded mandates, the question of course, arises, how are we \ngoing to do it? In fact, some people, some Members of the Senate, have \nchallenged those of us who support a balanced budget amendment as to \nhow it is going to be done. They say be specific. Of course, we have \nsaid, ``You say we don't need a balanced budget to achieve balance. So \nwhy don't you tell us how you would do it? Why don't you be specific? \nYou have had 40 years in the case of the House of Representatives and \nyou have not gotten the job done. Give us a chance and we will do it.''\n  First, we want to establish the discipline that requires us to do it. \nAssume we had passed the balanced budget amendment in the House and it \nis the version that did not pass but almost passed the House of \nRepresentatives and, we believe, has the votes to pass in the Senate \nnow and will pass the House of Representatives. That merely requires \nthat the Federal Government balance its budget. What then? We know that \nthere are people in both the House and Senate who propose that we also \nlimit taxes. I am for a three-fifths vote to raise taxes. That would \nput an additional constraint on the House and Senate and would make it \nmore difficult for us to try to achieve a balanced budget by raising \ntaxes. The fact is that has never worked.\n  In March of 1993, W. Kirk Hauser wrote an article, an op-ed piece, in \nthe Wall Street Journal in which he noted that over the last 30 or 40 \nyears revenues to the Federal Treasury have been almost static at about \n19 percent of the gross national product or 19.5 percent of the gross \ndomestic product. It has ranged very little, and it does not matter \nwhether we try to raise taxes or lower taxes or whether we have a \nDemocrat President or a Republican President or we were in war or good \ntimes or bad times. None of that mattered. Over a few weeks revenues \nwould fluctuate a little bit. But very soon they would stabilize at \n19.5 percent of the GDP.\n  In fact, when we tried to raise tax rates in order to bring in more \nrevenue, for a very short period of time more revenue came in. Then, as \npeople changed their behavior, it settled right back into 19 percent of \nGNP. When we lowered tax rates momentarily there was a reduction in \nrevenues. But very quickly the increased economic activity that \nresulted from those lower rates resulted in more taxes to the Federal \nTreasury even though at a lower rate.\n  How could that be? It is like a store that has a sale. When you \nreduce the prices you do not necessarily reduce income. You bring more \npeople into the store. You sell more goods, and you can make more money \nthan if you price the goods at a very high price. It is the same thing \nwith revenues to the Treasury.\n  So we reduced tax rates. We have not reduced revenues to the \nTreasury. They have stabilized at 19 percent of the gross national \nproduct.\n  The lesson to be learned from this is this: People change their \nbehavior based upon governmental actions. You cannot expect people to \njust sit there and take it when the Government does things to them. The \nresult is that if we limited spending to 19 percent of the gross \nnational product we would be limiting spending to the historic level \nthat the American people have been willing to pay in the form of \nFederal tax revenues. We would also be balancing the budget because our \nspending would be the same as our revenues. That is what a balanced \nbudget is all about.\n  The other advantages to this kind of approach--and I have to confess \nthat the very first bill that I introduced as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives was a Federal spending limit as the way to balance the \nbudget and it was also the very first bill that I introduced here in \nthe U.S. Senate; a bill that would require a balanced budget and \nachieve that by limiting spending \n[[Page S1260]] as a percent of the gross national product.\n  There are additional advantages to that approach. In addition to \nspending the historic amount that Americans have been willing to pay to \nthe Federal Government, we would also be achieving another \nextraordinarily important objective.\n  Mr. President, I cannot stress this point too much. People who say \nthat all we have to do is have a requirement for a balanced budget are, \nin effect, saying that we could balance the budget at twice what it is \ntoday, or three times as much or four times as much as long as we bring \nin the revenues to pay for that.\n  Would anybody support that? I think not. We have a $6 trillion \neconomy right now. Would anybody suggest that we should have a $6 \ntrillion Government budget and try to raise the money to pay for that \nbudget? We would be in balance if we could do it. But, of course, that \nwould be extraordinarily detrimental to our standard of living, to our \neconomy, and nobody, I think, suggests that there should be an \nunlimited amount of money that could be spent so long as we raise it.\n  So it matters as much where we balance that budget as the fact that \nwe require it be balanced. We need to balance it at a sensible level. I \nsuggest that the level is again a historic amount that Americans have \nbeen willing to pay to the Treasury, 19 percent of the gross national \nproduct. That is where we need to balance the budget.\n  It also matters how we try to balance the budget. Did we raise more \nrevenues by raising tax rates? The answer is no, because people change \ntheir behavior. The luxury tax of a few years ago is a perfect example. \nCongress thought that by raising the rates on yachts and jewelry, \nexpensive cars, we would rake in more money. Of course, rich people are \nnot necessarily dumb. And they just stopped buying the yachts and the \njewelry and the cars. So guess what? The tax revenue did not come in. \nAnd there was another very serious unintended consequence. The people \nwho made the yachts, for example, lost their jobs because people \nstopped buying them. You price yourself out of the market in the \nprivate market. Government can do the same thing in the case of tax \nrates.\n  So it matters how we achieve a balanced budget, and you cannot do it \nby artificially raising tax rates. No. You need to do it the simple, \nstraightforward way by getting at the heart of the problem. What is our \nproblem? The problem is Congress spends too much. Is there any other \nproblem? Why are we out of balance? It is because we spend too much. So \nthe simple and straightforward way to deal with that problem is by \nlimiting Federal spending.\n  There is another very important reason why I believe that a Federal \nbalanced budget amendment and spending limit makes a lot of sense. We \nneed to do things to stimulate economic growth, to provide more jobs in \nthis country. Fortunately, our unemployment rates are low right now. \nBut it is a constant challenge, as the Secretary of Labor would attest, \nit is a constant challenge for us to keep this economy growing, to keep \nproviding jobs so that future generations will have the same kind of \nstandard of living that we have been able to enjoy.\n  You do not do that by sucking all of the money out of the private \nsector for Government revenues. I have never understood how you make \npeople better off by taking more of their hard-earned tax dollars.\n  It is like the old practice of bleeding a patient with leeches in \norder to make the patient healthy. They figured out after a while that \ntaking a patient's blood did not make him more healthy. The same thing \nis true with extracting more tax dollars. If you leave those dollars in \npeople's pockets, they invest them, they spend them on things that are \nimportant in their lives; they will send their kids to college, they \nwill put some money in a savings account.\n  By the way, what happens if they buy a stock or bond? Say they take a \nlittle of that and put it into a money market account --that is a \nstock; it is money that goes to a corporation which needs the money to \nexpand, to build a new plant, let us say. Then they build a new plant. \nPlants are empty, so what do they do? They hire people to work in them. \nPutting money to work in the private sector is capitalism. That is what \nour economy and a free market is all about.\n  If you leave that money in the private sector, we will have a growing \neconomy. Congress too often has pursued policies that are inimical to \neconomic growth and to sound market principles. I believe if we had a \nspending limit requirement on a balanced budget amendment, what we \nwould find is--particularly if we tied it to a percent of the gross \nnational product--that Congress all of a sudden got real smart about \neconomic policy. If we said--as my amendment says--Congress can only \nspend 19 percent of the gross national product, what would Congress' \nincentive be with respect to the gross national product? It would be to \npursue policies to grow the gross national product, because the more \nthe gross national product grew, the more the Congress could spend. If \nthe gross national product grew $100 billion, Congress could spend $19 \nbillion more. What does Congress love to do? It loves to spend money. \nLet us take advantage of a little human nature here. If we want \nCongress to promote sound economic policies, to help the economy grow, \nas measured by the gross national product, we say to the Congress, you \ncan have more money to spend if the economy grows. So why do you not do \nsome things to help it grow?\n  What are things we can do? We can reduce certain tax rates that are \ntoo high to promote economic growth. Studies show that there is $7 \ntrillion locked up in our economy because of our capital gains tax \nrates today. That means if we were able to reduce the capital gains tax \nrates, people would say: Now there is incentive for me to turn this \npiece of property over that I have been holding all these years. I \ninherited this from Grandma Jones, and we have held onto it because if \nwe sold it, we would have to pay a huge tax on it. But we could use the \nmoney and would like to invest it in something.\n  With reducing the capital gains tax rates, that family might make the \ndecision to sell that piece of land, to reap the liquid result, the \nliquid capital from the sale, and invest that into something else.\n  Economists believe that this $7 trillion that is thus locked up could \nbe freed by a reduction of capital gains tax rates in a way that would \ngenerate huge economic growth because of the turnover of this capital \nin our market.\n  So there is additional incentive to balance the budget by limiting \nFederal spending as a percent of the gross national product. I believe \nit would cause Congress to be more responsible in the way we deal with \nour economy.\n  Mr. President, these are just a few thoughts that I have regarding my \nproposal to limit Federal spending as a percent of the gross national \nproduct. I realize that this is too tough and, in a sense, it is too \nsensible, and that it is going to be easier to get the votes to pass a \nbalanced budget amendment if we are not too tight, if we are not too \ntough, because some people have a view that we should be able to raise \ntaxes, for example. And so the only version that probably has a chance \nof passing is one that simply requires us to balance the budget. It \ndoes not set the level or tell us how to do it. It does not provide \nincentives to help the economy grow. But we can achieve those \nobjectives by the way we implement the balanced budget amendment.\n  In conclusion, what I am going to be suggesting here very soon is \nthat as soon as the balanced budget amendment is adopted, we need to \ncome in behind that, in the wake of the passage of the balanced budget \namendment, with implementing legislation. A lot of our friends have \nsaid, ``How are you going to do it? Tell us how.'' Here is how I would \ndo it. I think if we can provide implementing legislation that limits \nFederal spending, we can guarantee that we are going to achieve the \nobjective in the right way. There will have to be enforcement \nprovisions, and we will still have to make the tough, specific \ndecisions as to exactly which programs in which to reduce spending, for \nexample. But in terms of an outline of how we will achieve the \nobjective, I think this spending limitation approach is exactly the \nright approach.\n  So while I would support the balanced budget amendment that does not \nhave the spending limit requirement in it--because that is all I think \nwe can get passed--I think we have to come in right behind that with a \nproposal to \n[[Page S1261]] limit spending as the way to implement the \nconstitutional balanced budget amendment. Of course, as a mere \nstatutory program, Congress can override it. We can always unpass what \nwe just passed. But at least I think it sets forth a blueprint, a \nguideline for achieving the objective.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I think almost all of us agree that if we \npass this balanced budget amendment and send it to the States for \nratification, we have to begin achieving that balanced budget today. We \nhave to go back to last year's budget and see if there is anything in \nthe appropriations we passed last year that we can pull back--money \nthat we can save. We need to look at this year's budget as the first of \nthe budgets that gets us on the glidepath to a balanced budget, and set \nthe outside limit of perhaps 7 years. But we probably ought to try to \ndo it in a shorter period, if we can, so that when the balanced budget \namendment has finally been ratified by all of the States, it will not \nbe an impossible task for us; so that we will have already started the \nprocess and each year intervening will have brought that budget deficit \ndown another ratchet.\n  If we do that, in the last couple of years when we actually have to \ndo it as a constitutional requirement, it will be an achievable \nobjective, and in the last year or two, we will be able to make the \nsavings and limit spending in such a way that we can achieve that \nbalanced budget at the time it is called for in the constitutional \namendment.\n  So these are some of the things we are going to have to think about \nas the balanced budget debate begins to unfold. I think it is important \nto at least begin to think about them in the context of the debate we \nare having on unfunded mandates, because as the Governors and State \nlegislators that have to deal with the balanced budget amendment tell \nus, they know we have to mean business and get on with the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  At this point, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Georgia for up to 15 minutes in \nmorning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/20/senate-section/article/S1259-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1261-S1262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NATIONAL SERVICE\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the national service \nprogram which has been the subject of a good bit of discussion in \nrecent media accounts and which President Clinton addressed this last \nweek.\n  From the outset, I want to make it clear that I join President \nClinton in expressing my continued strong support of the concept of \nnational service. The passage of the national service bill in the last \nCongress was an event that I, along with a number of my colleagues, \nlooked forward to for many years. Since President Clinton signed the \nlegislation into law on September 21, 1993, thousands of Americans have \nserved our country in projects which range from teaching school in \ninner-city neighborhoods to preventing destruction of lands along our \nNation's rivers.\n  The case for this initiative depends on understanding that it is \nuniquely a program that offers a triple investment in the future \nproductive capacity of our people and our communities--first of all, in \nthe service performed; the service experience, No. 2; and the \npostservice benefit for our young people, No. 3. I know that the word \n``investment'' has been much abused in debate on the Senate floor in \nrecent years, and for some it is just a code word for Government \nspending. We must not, however, become so cynical that we cannot see a \nreal investment with a real payoff when it is staring us in the face.\n  The idea for this investment came from recognition that many \nAmericans have, for the first time, perhaps, in our history, forgotten \nthe relationship between rights and responsibilities. We often see \nreports in the news media about various groups proclaiming that this \nGovernment service or that Government service is a right. We are so \noften reminded of the rights all Americans should enjoy that we often \nlose sight of the other side of the same coin, and that is the \nresponsibilities that we must share in order to make these rights \npossible. Just as we have rights to freedom, to life, liberty and the \npursuit of happiness, those sacred rights carry with them equally \nsacred responsibilities. The National Service Program was created to \nprovide young Americans with opportunities to fulfill that obligation \nto give something back to their country and to their communities.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who dedicated his life to the cause of \ncivil rights and whose birthday we celebrated this past Monday, \nunderstood that only through assuming responsibilities that accompany \nour rights can we help ourselves. He said in the last Sunday morning \nsermon before his assassination:\n\n       Human progress never rolls in on the wheels of \n     inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men \n     willing to be co-workers with God, and without this hard \n     work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social \n     stagnation. So we must help time and realize that the time is \n     always ripe to do right.\n\n  National Service provides young people a means to meet the challenge \nto do right while expanding their own horizons and building opportunity \nfor their futures.\n  Critics have tried to attack the National Service Program in a number \nof different ways. During the debate on the authorizing legislation, we \nheard cries of how many more Pell grants we could fund with the money, \nor how many more job training programs we could fund with the money. \nThough these criticisms are valid as far as they go, they almost \ninevitably lose sight of the fact that National Service does not exist \nfor the purpose of simply providing student aid or even job training. \nNational Service exists primarily to provide service. And if the \nprogram is not providing service, then it does not deserve to exist.\n A good analogy is our Nation's Armed Forces. We do not maintain Armed \nForces in order to provide valuable skills and develop good character \nin young men and women. Rather, Armed Forces personnel develop skills \nand character in the military as they carry out their primary mission \nof providing our Nation's security.\n\n  The same is true of national service. Would critics have the Senate \ndisregard the benefits to society of national service participants \nproviding employment counseling and tutoring to homeless people in \nAtlanta? Should we ignore the benefits of the first-time immunization \nof 33,000 children in Fort Worth, TX, in one month which was carried \nout by those serving in the national service program?\n  I could go on and on with the kind of service being provided. That is \nthe true test of national service. Are we really serving people and \nhelping communities? Considering the benefits national service provides \nat the community level, it is difficult to see why there are so many \nobjections to this program. Indeed, given the debates we have heard on \nunfunded mandates and we continue to hear that on legislation in this \nbody, I would think that our colleagues would agree that national \nservice represents the type of program that we ought to support.\n  National service is not a Federal mandate for any specific type of \nservice, nor does it require that communities participate at all. \nNational service gives communities and service organizations and young \npeople the chance, voluntarily, to identify and perform the kind of \nservice which best meets their local needs with the Federal Government \nproviding the funding. So it is almost the opposite of a Government \nmandate.\n  At the same time, it provides meaningful work for young people \naddressing real problems without Federal micromanagement. This real \nwork for real value will ensure a strong payback for the taxpayers' \ndollar. In the process, national service instills in young people the \nstrong traditional values of hard work and responsibility. They learn \nthose values because they are serving. It is not a program to teach \nthose values. It is a program where the values are learned because of \nservice rendered.\n   [[Page S1262]] As for the claim that national service is--quoting \none of the critics--``coerced volunteerism,'' I would suggest that \ncritics ask any of the more than 200,000 people who requested \napplications for last year's AmeriCorps Program or the 20,000 that were \nselected and are now serving, whether they were coerced. National \nservice is not coercion any more than was the Montgomery GI bill which \nprovides educational benefits for hundreds of thousands of young \nAmericans who serve and have served in our Nation's All-Volunteer \nForce.\n  Instead, like the Montgomery GI bill, national service is an \nopportunity, an opportunity that young people all over America have \nsaid they want. Nothing is more evident of that than the overwhelming \nnumber of applications. I think we will see even more of the \napplications in the years to come, assuming this program continues.\n  As for the benefits of service, and to me this must be the way we \njudge the program more than any other judgment, although there are, \nreally, as I said, three parts to the program, service is the No. 1 \npart. In my State alone the excellent works that have been performed by \nthese young people is very impressive. In Georgia, national service \nparticipants are working in Atlanta area schools as teaching \nassistants, tutors, and mentors. They are aiding police in developing a \ncommunity-oriented police program in Albany, GA. They are helping \ncreate an emergency 911 network in Douglas and Coffee County. They are \nidentifying local environmental programs in Decatur, GA, and developing \nplans to engage youth in solving them. They are tutoring hundreds and \nthousands of young people every day in elementary school. They are also \nin some of the rural areas that I visited. They do not have any foreign \nlanguage teachers in the schools there and they have found that with \nthe immigration that is growing in our State and other States, these \nyoung people who are in school that cannot speak English need help. In \nmany cases, in a couple of the rural communities, that help is coming \nfrom national service participants who have a second language and who \nare able to be the only ones in the community that can really \ncommunicate with the newly arrived legal immigrants in our school.\n  All of these efforts are duplicated in national service programs \nnationwide. From aiding the American Red Cross and providing food and \nclothing for California flood victims to building homes for needy \nfamilies in the poorest sections of Miami, with Habitat for Humanity.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, national service provides a triple \npayback in valuable service to the community. Higher skills and lower \ndebts for our young people for attending colleges or getting advanced \neducation after high school and a much stronger sense that we are all \nin the American enterprise together, bound by mutual respect and mutual \nobligation.\n  In the Peace Corps Program in my State the participants begin each \nday with a chant announcing their readiness to serve, to earn, and to \nlearn. That, Mr. President, is the most eloquent summary of the concept \nof national service that I think we can offer: To serve, to earn, and \nto learn.\n  I urge all Senators to listen to our young people, to visit these \nprograms, to make sure that the criticism of the programs--which is \nwelcome--make sure it is constructive, to make sure we look at whether \nwe are really getting service in the communities where they are \nserving, rather than simply oppose this program as another governmental \nprogram.\n  I urge all Senators to particularly talk to our young people, listen \nto them, and see what they say about what they are doing in serving and \nearning and learning and continuing to give them a chance in this \nregard. There is room for improvement in the program. There is room for \nconstructive criticism. There is room, perhaps, to even critique the \nprogram in a way that would affect the budget. In my view, blind \nopposition to this exciting concept is simply not the way to go at this \npoint in time.\n  I think the main measure must be whether we are getting service from \nthese young people and whether they are helping the communities, \nhelping young people, helping those in need. It is my hope that if this \nprogram works and I believe it is working, that it will be viewed in \nthe future as not simply an addition to the way we deliver services to \nthose in need in our country and in our communities but rather in lieu \nof some of the existing programs.\n  I can think of no better way to deliver social services in this \nNation to those in need. We are going to continue to have people in \nneed. We are going to continue to have community demands that cannot be \nmet with nominal funding. I can think of no better way than unleashing \nthe energy, enthusiasm, and idealism of tens of thousands of America's \nyoung people in addressing these critical problems. To me this is the \nway we ought to begin thinking about shaping our social services.\n  At this point in time this program is in addition to the existing \nprograms. We should look at it more and more as a substitute to some of \nthe programs and a supplement to others.\n  I thank the Chair. I know the Senator from New Hampshire would like \nto speak. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the bill that has been before the Senate for 8 days \nnow basically has been delayed and stalled, is very important business \nfor the people of the United States of America and certainly many \ncommunities around the country who suffer from the unfunded mandates \nthat they have to comply with.\n  I want to discuss that legislation today for a few minutes and also \nto say that I sincerely hope that in the very near future, hopefully \nsome time early next week, that we will be able to pass that \nlegislation and get it on through the House and the Senate and get it \nto the President. Hopefully he will sign it. This is a major piece of \nlegislation that the majority, overwhelming majority of the American \npeople support.\n  I do not understand why we are delaying it. Apparently there seems to \nbe, based on those we talk with, a great number of people on the other \nside of the aisle who say they support the bill yet when it came down \nto signing the petition for cloture, we did not get much help at all. \nIndeed, we only had one vote. I find a strange inconsistency here that \nthose who say they support the legislation cannot bring themselves to \nbring the legislation to a vote. I think sometimes we get criticized \nhere for not being able to accomplish anything and the American people \nlook at this and say, why is it that a Senator, perhaps my own Senator, \nwould say, ``I am for this bill but I do not want us to vote on it.''\n  When we get criticized out there in the public, we really should not \nwonder why that happens. There is nothing wrong with debate. All \nSenators have every right to debate this legislation as long as they \nwish. Certainly, I stand here today before one of the most historic \ndesks in the U.S. Senate. This desk belonged to Daniel Webster, one of \nthe few original desks in the Senate.\n  Daniel Webster, of course, at one time represented New Hampshire in \nthe House, was born in New Hampshire, and represented Massachusetts in \nthe U.S. Senate, one of the greatest orators of the pre-Civil War time. \nHe certainly stood on the floor of the U.S. Senate before this desk and \ndebated many of the great issues of the day and, I am sure, frustrated \na lot of people on the other side. That is the way it should be. That \nis what the Senate is. There is nothing wrong with that. I do not \ncriticize that in any way.\n  I will say that this is an issue, the unfunded mandate issue, that is \nso overwhelmingly supported by the people in this country--I hesitate \nto say this, but I think it is true--that the American people, I think, \nare going to exact a price from those who delay it. I think they do it \nunder grave risks.\n  This legislation places, very interestingly, increased and added \nresponsibilities on those who want to create the new mandate. It would \nalso increase the cost of an existing one. In other words, they must \nget an estimate of the cost of the new requirement to both State and \nlocal government and the private sector and provide the \n[[Page S1263]] funds needed for the State and local governments to \ncomply with the change. So it puts the responsibility on those who want \nto produce the mandates.\n  It is a very important piece of legislation that is going to provide \nnot only relief from the unfunded mandates--that is a very general way \nof saying it--but it is also going to provide relief for the taxpayers, \nthe local and State taxpayers who have to pay for this when the Federal \nGovernment puts the mandate in and does not fund it. Those are the \npeople who are going to benefit from this bill. Those are the people \nwho need relief. When we pass a piece of legislation without funding it \nand insist that the local community pay for it, what has to happen? \nMoney does not come from heaven. It has to come from the taxpayers. It \nis extracted involuntarily from those taxpayers in those local \ncommunities.\n  These local communities, Mr. President, all over the country are \nspeaking out to us saying, ``Pass this bill.'' It is enthusiastically \nendorsed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, National League of Cities, \nCouncil of State Governments, National School Boards Association, U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, National Governors Association--and on and on--\nNational Association of Counties.\n  This information has been stated on the floor during the debate, but \nit is interesting, one quote comes from John Motley, the vice president \nof NFIB, who strongly supports S. 1, who said:\n\n       It was not the cities and States who paid roughly $10 \n     billion in unfunded mandates during the 1980's. It was the \n     taxpayers, small business owners as well as everybody else. \n     In June 1994, a poll of all NFIB members resulted in a \n     resounding 90 percent vote against unfunded mandates.\n\n  Even the Democratic Governor, who is the chairman of the National \nGovernors Association, Gov. Howard Dean, said:\n\n       We begin the 104th Congress with S. 1, the Unfunded Mandate \n     Relief Act of 1995, which is a major priority for all State \n     and local officials. We have reviewed the new bill, drafted \n     in full consultation with all our organizations, and strongly \n     support its enactment.\n\n  So it is bipartisan support that we have--support from communities, \nfrom selectmen, from mayors, from Governors, from taxpayers all across \nAmerica in every State and hamlet. It is one of the most overwhelmingly \nsupported pieces of legislation in recent time. Yet, here it is bottled \nup in the U.S. Senate for 8 days. We are essentially doing no business \ntoday, other than debating it and offering amendments. We are in \nmorning business, which means we do not have to debate it. I choose to \ndebate it because I think it is important. That is why I am here. The \nmajority leader, to his credit, sought on the floor last evening to get \nsupport to bring this thing to a head, and I hope that this will happen \nin the next few days and that we will see a vote.\n  In talking about unfunded mandates, it really is an interesting \ndichotomy, just the very fact that we are here to try to repeal \nunfunded mandates or to stop future unfunded mandates, as this bill \nspecifically does, because we always hear experts, if you will, \nconstitutional experts, telling us what the Founding Fathers intended \nor what they did not intend. It is always very interesting. I would be \nfascinated to see people like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and \nGeorge Washington and Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and others come \nhere and listen to the debate that goes on in this Chamber regarding \nwhat they thought these gentlemen really believed and what they were \nsaying in the remarks that they made. It is interesting the way we \ntwist and turn these remarks.\n  If you take them literally, there is not any doubt. Let us listen to \nThomas Jefferson:\n\n       When all government, domestic and foreign, in little as in \n     great things, shall be drawn to Washington as the center of \n     all power, it will render powerless the checks provided of \n     one government on another and will become as venal and \n     oppressive as the government from which we separated.\n\n  It does not get any clearer than that. Jefferson was saying that we \nleft England, we separated from the Government of England for this very \nreason. They created a government here where they did not want all of \nthe power in Washington, and they made it very clear in the 10th \namendment to the Constitution that all power would not be in \nWashington. Yet, here we are debating a bill that we want to pass to \neliminate unfunded mandates which we really should not have in the \nfirst place. That is exactly where we are.\n  The 10th amendment is the constitutional embodiment of Jefferson's \nbelief in a limited Federal Government, respectful of the rights of the \nStates. How are we being respectful to the rights of the States, Mr. \nPresident, when we simply put unfunded mandates on them telling them \nthey must do this without the money? That is not being respectful. With \nall due respect, that is being disrespectful. Of course it is being \ndisrespectful, and we have been doing it to the States and the \ncommunities all across this country for years in education, \nenvironment, you name it, we have done it to them and they know it. \nThat is why we have so much support, so much grassroots support from \nall over America, at the levels that I discussed, coming back and \nsaying to us, ``Get this off our backs, we are sick of it, we are tired \nof it. We want it off our backs.''\n  What does the 10th amendment say? Again, we get all these \ninterpretations. Let us read it. It is very simple:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectfully, or to the people.\n\n  Yet somebody somewhere along the line at some course in our history \nhas come up with this terrible idea, stupid idea that this is wrong and \nthat we ought to be able to provide unfunded mandates to the States and \ncommunities. This is in direct conflict with the 10th amendment. But \nall these great legal scholars and constitutional scholars and probably \nsome of our predecessors on the floor of this body thought otherwise \nand basically took the 10th amendment and tore it up as if it did not \nexist. And there it goes. So here we are now trying to get this \ncorrected.\n  That is what went wrong. When did this start happening? We can go \nback to the New Deal. Ever since then, the Federal Government has \nincreasingly encroached upon fiscal and constitutional prerogatives of \nthe State and local governments. When you put a mandate on a State, on \na community, you force the taxpayers to pay for it. That is where it \ncomes from. The State and local government has no choice but to \nincrease those taxes. So you are mandating a tax increase on a small \ncommunity, whether it is in Indiana or New Hampshire or Georgia or West \nVirginia, or wherever.\n  This is exactly what Jefferson warned us against. Very clearly he \nwarned us against it: Do not draw all the power to Washington, for the \nsame reason they did not want all the power drawn to England or to a \nmonarch or to a tyrant. They were afraid of it. They feared it. That is \nwhy they came here and built this country. That is why they wrote the \nConstitution, because they did fear it. That is why they disseminated \nthe power among the three branches of government as they did, and \nbetween the States and the Federal Government.\n  These States were reluctant to create this country from the \nConstitution. The Federalist papers by Madison and Jay and Hamilton \nwere particularly written to convince the people to write the \nConstitution.\n They had to be persuaded because they were afraid to give up their \nState and community rights. That is why the 10th amendment was put in \nthe Constitution, my colleagues.\n\n  Unfunded Federal mandates impose enormous costs on the States. \nNationwide examples are all over the place. The U.S. Conference of \nMayors recently reported that the Clean Water Act alone mandated costs \non the cities with populations greater than 30,000 more than $3.6 \nbillion in 1993.\n  Now, our opponents will say, ``What's wrong with the Clean Water \nAct?'' I am not opposed to cleaning up the water in the United States. \nI do not think there is a citizen in America who wants to drink dirty \nwater or swim in dirty water. The issue is not that. The issue is \nshould this Congress, this Government, pass laws that mandate that be \ndone without providing the dollars? Did they ever stop to think that \nmaybe a community of a few hundred people cannot raise that kind of \nmoney out of the taxpayers? It is not there.\n  That is what is wrong. That is why the American people voted the way \n[[Page S1264]] they did on November 8, 1994--because they are sick of \nit. They are sick of it. They want it changed. They made it very clear.\n  Now, from 1994 through 1998, the Conference of Mayors reports 10 \nFederal mandates that they studied--10, just 10 Federal mandates, \nunfunded some of them--will cost $54 billion. The Clean Water Act alone \nis $29.3 billion; Safe Drinking Water Act, $8.6 billion, and RCRA, \nResource Conservation and Recovery Act, $5.5 billion--again, well \nintended pieces of legislation, some of which do a good job. But should \nit be mandated without the funds? The answer is no. That is what we are \nhere talking about. That is what is being delayed. That is what the \nother side, our friends on the other side of the aisle are doing. They \nare delaying this bill to stop this stuff so it does not happen in the \nfuture.\n  Now, there was a Price Waterhouse survey that said counties are \nspending $4.8 billion annually--1993, $4.8 billion annually--to comply \nwith just 12 of many unfunded mandates in Federal programs, and that \nthey will spend $33.7 billion over the next 5 years.\n  Let me give you a couple of examples in New Hampshire.\n  The city of Berlin, NH, economically depends on one business really \nfor its livelihood, and that is a big paper mill--11,700 residents and \ndeclining. It is under an EPA order to construct a new $18 million \nwater supply system pursuant to this Safe Drinking Water Act, mandated \n$18 million.\n  Berlin has problems with its water, and it is trying to correct them, \nand it needs the time to do that. Those citizens, many of whom I know \npersonally, do not want to drink polluted water. But they cannot bond \nthis amount of money within the time that is dictated to them by the \nEPA. They simply cannot do it. So they are facing fines of $25,000 a \nday, a depressed community of 11,700 people facing $25,000 a day fines \nfor not complying with the regulations.\n  I might inquire of the Chair, has my time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has. The Senator may seek additional time \nif he wishes to ask unanimous consent.\n  Mr. SMITH. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Here we are facing fines of $25,000 a day, trying to fix \n$18 million worth of problems. Does that make sense? Does it really \nmake sense to fine these people to try to comply?\n  That is what an unfunded mandate does. Not only is it an unfunded \nmandate; it is fining for not complying with an unfunded mandate, which \ncompounds it. It makes it worse. You cannot get $25,000 a day from \npeople who do not have jobs, who are worried about the mill closing. It \njust does not work. Yet, here we go. I have people in those towns tell \nme, ``Senator, why don't you have the Federal Government come up here \nand take over the town because it will be a lot easier. It will give us \nless headaches. You run it. You want to tell us what to do, so go ahead \nand run the town.''\n  Rochester, NH, same thing--mandate under the Clean Water Act. I could \nmention numerous examples all over my State, and of course every \nSenator could mention similar horror stories all over America. Because \nof the enormous costs associated with the removal of these materials, \nfor example, in Rochester, it has been forced to hire lawyers now to \nfight its case.\n  Oh, boy, there is always the opportunity to hire lawyers. Get the \nlawyers involved and stretch it out to cost even more. There is always \na lawyer on either side to get a lot of money out of this thing. So we \ndo not spend any money on cleanup; we spend it on lawyers rather than \non cleanup, which makes it worse.\n  Why? You know why? Do you know why we have the lawyers involved in \nthis? Because somebody back beginning approximately in the New Deal \nera, and built upon since then, has said that the 10th amendment ought \nto be torn up and thrown in the waste basket and ignored, and that we \nought to put mandates on the people of America. That is why lawyers are \nfighting. And it is ironic that these same lawyers are the ones who are \nsworn to uphold the Constitution and to work under the Constitution.\n  I was a local official. I was a school board member for 6 years. I \nwas the chairman of that same school board for 3 years. I know what it \nis like. I have seen what happened to my school district when an \nunfunded mandate came in that said: You will do this. I do not care \nwhat it costs, you will do it. That forces many small communities to go \nout and raise additional taxes on that mandate.\n  But again, we always get the debate off on whether or not what the \nmandate directs is good or bad. That is not the issue. In most cases, \nthey are good. For example, handicapped children, absolutely, educating \nthe handicapped, helping those people to get mainstreamed, absolutely \nsupported by me and others. But should it be an unfunded mandate? If \nyou want to mandate it, if that is what America wants, then fund it. Do \nnot force a community that cannot pay for it to pay for it.\n  Do you really want to cut taxes for the middle class? That is what I \nhear the President say--cut taxes for the middle class. Then, Mr. \nPresident, when you get this bill, if you ever get it, if your party \never will let us get it to you, sign it and you are going to save \nhundreds of millions of dollars--hundreds of millions of dollars on \nmiddle-class Americans who carry the load.\n  Unfunded Federal mandates encroach on the authority of the States in \ncontravention of the 10th amendment.\n  So what is the solution? The solution has been proposed by my most \ndistinguished colleague, the Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne], \nhimself a former mayor, who drafted this legislation, who traveled all \nover the country getting support for it and pulling this thing together \nand managing it so brilliantly in the Chamber. Some say he has only \nbeen here 2 years as a Senator. But he had several years as a mayor on \nthe receiving end of these mandates. He knows what those mandates do to \nhis tax base, as the mayor of Boise, ID, and he knows what it does to \nthe tax base of every community that is impacted by one of those \nmandates.\n  This is a vital step. It will end a deplorable practice of Congress \nimposing unfunded mandates on State and local governments.\n  Now, S. 1, the bill which we are talking about, sets a tough \nstandard. It is stuff. You bet it is. And it ought to be. We are trying \nto get back to the Constitution of the United States, which we have \nignored. It needs to be tough. This bill provides that it shall not be \nin order for the Senate to even consider any bill, joint resolution, \namendment, motion, or conference report that would increase the direct \ncosts of Federal intergovernmental mandates by an amount that causes \nthe $50 million threshold to be exceeded unless the mandate is paid by \nthe Federal Government.\n  That is the way it ought to be. We cannot even consider it, let alone \npass it. That is how tough it is, and that is good. That is why it is \nbeing opposed by some on the other side, because some of our colleagues \non the other side--not all--are responsible for the fact that we have \nthese mandates in the first place, and they do not want them to go \naway. But the American people want them to go away.\n  Any bill that imposes an unfunded mandate above that threshold of $50 \nmillion on State and/or local governments shall be out of order on the \nSenate floor. You cannot even get a chance to vote on it to pass it.\n That is tough. That is the way it should be.\n\n  There is a further step. I am going to support Senator Hatch's \nconstitutional amendment to prohibit unfunded mandates on State and \nlocal governments unless two-thirds of the Houses of Congress decide to \ndo so. And there again is another irony. We have a 10th amendment that \nsays we cannot have unfunded mandates, in my opinion, yet we are now \ngoing to probably have to have a 27th or 28th amendment which says we \nare going to prohibit them.\n  That tells you where we are at in this country. It tells you that \npeople in this country--some in this Congress--are willing to trash the \nConstitution of the United States of America. For what? Political gain? \nI do not know. How do you get political gain out of something the \nmajority of the American people do not want by advocating it? It beats \nme.\n   [[Page S1265]] It is unfortunate, and frankly ironic, that S. 1 has \nbecome necessary. Our Founding Fathers are probably spinning around in \ntheir graves right now. They created a limited Federal Government that \nwould respect the rights of the States and here we are on the floor of \nthe Senate, trying to gain back what the Founding Fathers never wanted \nto lose in the first place. They made that protection very explicit in \nthat 10th amendment. Frankly, not only the Congress, the Supreme Court \nas well--let us not let the Supreme Court off the hook here--all these \nbrilliant judges, scholars, over the years who have allowed this to \nhappen. They are responsible, too. They have not afforded sufficient \nrespect to the 10th amendment.\n  There have been some brilliant people who have served in Government \nsince the Constitution was written, many of them. I stand at the desk \nof one of them, Daniel Webster. Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun--great \norators, great Senators down through the years as well as others in the \nHouse and the Senate. And, frankly, out of politics--on the courts: \nbrilliant people. But I have not yet met the match for Thomas Jefferson \nand James Madison and John Jay and others during that time, our \nforefathers, who wrote this brilliant document.\n  They knew what they were doing. They knew what they were doing. I \nthink we made some terrible mistakes. The Senator from Idaho with this \nlegislation is giving us the opportunity to correct some.\n  The Senator from Tennessee, who is a surgeon, who was talking about \nhealth care a while ago on floor when I was in the Chair--we are going \nto have to perform corrective surgery. And it is about time. It is \nabout time. That is why the American people changed course on November \n8. I hope this Senate will get the message and pass this legislation \nnext week, get it through the House, and get it to the President of the \nUnited States so it will become the law--which it already should be \nunder the 10th amendment.\n  In conclusion, we must never forget--and I think we have--that it was \nthe States, there were only 13 at the time, but it was the States that \ncreated this Government. I used to teach history, so forgive me for a \nmoment. The States created this Government. Without the large State-\nsmall State compromise, the Senate would not be here. The House would \nnot be here. The Federal Government would not be here. They decided to \ngive certain powers to the Federal Government and created that \nGovernment as a result. They never wanted the Federal Government to go \nbeyond the specific powers they were given.\n  Let us get back to the Constitution. If we do the debate, the \nintegrity of the debate is on our side, and we will win. I think we \nwill. It is just going to take a little time. It is a little \nfrustrating that Senators exercise the right that they have to delay \nand debate. If you are going to delay to debate to make your point that \nis fine. If you are going to delay simply to stop the legislation, from \nus getting a chance to vote on it, I think that is wrong. Especially \nwhen you are trying to repeal something that is unconstitutional, in my \nopinion, to begin with.\n  Mr. President, I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I support Senate bill 1 to eliminate \nunfunded mandates to States and local government. There is no doubt \nabout the onerous imposition of very expensive projects on State and \nlocal government which have been decreed out of Washington, DC, and the \nFederal Government. I think as a matter of fundamental fairness, if we \ndecide something ought to be done as a matter of national policy, then \nwe ought to be paying for it.\n  Many have spoken about the principle of federalism, which is the \nconcept that the United States was founded on. It is to leave to the \nStates all that was not specifically delegated to the Federal \nGovernment in the Constitution on the very obvious point of having the \ngovernmental unit closest to the people making the decision. Also, as a \nmatter of federalism and the concept of federalism, the idea is to \nleave to local government as much as possible so the people closest to \nthe problem may decide what they want to spend their money on.\n  We have within the bill presently on the floor the principle of the \nStates leaving to local government the maximum amount possible without \ntelling local government what ought to be done. So I think this is a \nsound bill. I look forward to its early passage as a signal to the \nAmerican people that the mandate from the last election is being \ncomplied with. We have already enacted important legislation which \nimposes on every Member of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives the same obligations that any other American citizen \nbears. That is sound as a matter of basic fairness but also sound as \npart of the regulatory system so we may not overly burden American \nbusiness and the American people when we have to comply with the same \nrules.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that I may make two brief \nstatements as in morning business. There is no one else on the floor to \nspeak to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the Senator from \nPennsylvania is recognized as in morning business.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and I ask unanimous consent my \nfollowing remarks be captioned: ``Silvi Morton Specter.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/20/senate-section/article/S1265-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1265-S1266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SILVI MORTON SPECTER\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, last night I spoke briefly on the one-\nyear anniversary of the birth of the next generation of the Specter \nfamily, on the birth date of my granddaughter, the first grandchild in \nour family, the daughter of my son Shanin Specter, and his wife, Tracey \nPearl Specter. But I could not speak at any length because we were in \nthe midst of working out the unanimous-consent agreement on the \ndisposition of this bill. And as the hour grew late, when we had \nconsecutive back-to-back votes as part of the efforts to reach an \naccommodation on the bill, I did secure the floor for a few minutes, at \n11:25, but spoke only briefly because the managers of the bill were \nabout to present the unanimous-consent agreement and there were many \nSenators on the floor at the time.\n  I now speak to an empty Chamber with the exception of the Presiding \nOfficer. But this is a matter, I think, of importance beyond the birth \ndate of one young woman in America because I speak about all of the \nchildren of America and Silvi Specter's generation.\n  We have a heavy burden, the Congress of the United States, and in the \nU.S. Senate, to see to it that adequate care and protection will be \ngiven to her generation. I focus on the balanced budget amendment which \nhas now been reported out of the Judiciary Committee, which will seek \nto eliminate the deficit Federal spending which now approximates $200 \nbillion a year and a national debt which is climbing toward $5 \ntrillion.\n  We had debated the deficit and the national debt more in the 14 \nyears-plus that I have been in the U.S. Senate than any other subject.\n  So frequently there has been agreement that the Federal Government \nought to live within its means just as every other unit of government \nhas to. The State governments, the city governments, the county \ngovernments, and for that matter any individual has to live within his \nor her means or they face bankruptcy. But at the same time we have \ncontinued to spend. The promise of the balanced budget amendment is to \nput the same discipline on Congress which every other governmental unit \nin the past has had and every private citizen has. I think that is very \nimportant for Silvi Specter's generation. Certainly, I would not think \nof borrowing on her account or using her credit card. But that is \nexactly what we are doing when we run up these deficits.\n  I think, too, about the primary duty of Government to protect its \ncitizens and the strides which are yet to be made on crime control \ndomestically and national defense on the international scene.\n   [[Page S1266]] We have a great deal to do, Mr. President, on the \nbasic issue of crime control. It is something that we have to address \nfor the present generation and succeeding generations.\n  I had the opportunity to serve as district attorney of Philadelphia \nfor some 8 years after having been an assistant district attorney for 4 \nyears where I tried many robbery cases, many rape cases, many burglary \ncases, and then as the district attorney ran an office which prosecuted \n30,000 criminal cases a year including 500 homicide cases.\n  I believe that we have to tackle the problem of violent crime on many \nlevels. I think to start with, this is a major problem in our criminal \njustice system in our failure to utilize capital punishment as an \neffective deterrent against violent crime. It is obvious that the \ncritical aspect of a deterrent is its certainty and its swiftness. But \nthat is not the case with the death penalty. At the present time there \nare more than 2,800 inmates on death row and in the last year only 38 \ncases where the judgment of sentence was carried out. The reason for \nthat is the Federal appeals processes which allow the cases to go on \nvirtually interminably forever; some as long as 20 years, on the \naverage 8 years. We have the power to correct that.\n  My legislation was passed by the Senate in 1990 and has a good chance \nto be passed this year by the House and the Senate and signed into law \nif we would make a few basic changes. First, provide that the \nrequirement ``upon exhaustion of State remedies'' is eliminated because \nthat means the case has to be litigated in the State courts until every \npossible issue has been resolved before going to the Federal courts. \nAnd then there is a ping-pong effect where it goes back and forth.\n  My legislation provides that there would be Federal jurisdiction \nattaching as soon as the State supreme court had upheld the judgment of \nsentence of the death penalty. Then there would be one hearing in the \nFederal courts taking up all the issues without getting involved in \nwhat is a full and fair hearing in the State courts, which leads to \ninterminable litigation, again with the State court taking it up and \nthen coming to the Federal court as to whether there had been a full \nand fair hearing, which is an aspect of exhaustion of State remedies.\n  The Federal court ought to hear it once and once alone. If something \nthen arises at a later time which warrants exceptional circumstances \nand unique Federal review again, that should happen only if the court \nof appeals approves it; that is, submission to Federal judges.\n  There also ought to be a time limit of 120 days in the Federal \ndistrict court, unless the judge is able to put on the record factors \nwhich require a longer period of time, and that should be within the \ndiscretion of the trial judge. But I have handled these cases in the \nFederal court on habeas corpus, and 120 days is long enough, providing \nthe judge puts it at the top of the list. That would not be an undue \nburden where only one of these cases would come before a judge every 18 \nmonths. There should be time limits in the court of appeals so that \nthis appellate proceeding could be concluded within 2 years instead of \n20 years.\n  Then, Mr. President, I think it is necessary to look at realistic \nrehabilitation. It is no surprise when someone leaves jail without a \ntrade or a skill, as a functional illiterate, to go out into society, \nthey are back to a life of crime and a revolving door. What I think we \nneed to do is to have early intervention, especially with juveniles, \nfor literacy and job training to give them a chance. But if they become \ncareer criminals--that is, three major offenses--then I think it is \nfair for society to impose a life sentence and to carry it out with \nadequate prison space.\n  Just the day before yesterday in the city of Philadelphia there was \nan atrocious murder a block and a half from the Philadelphia police \nstation where a car was stopped. Apparently the individual was being \nfollowed on a robbery attempt, and a cold-blooded murder at 5:23 in the \nafternoon a block and a half from the police station at 7th and Vine in \nPhiladelphia. A man was shot down in cold blood.\n  This happens again and again with drive-by shootings, with people \nbeing at risk. Violent crime could be curtailed if we really took the \nsteps necessary to do that. That is something we ought to be looking at \nfor this generation, the next generation, and those which follow.\n  There is also a major problem in international issues with national \nsecurity. From the position that I have just taken on as chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee, there is a real need to do more in the area \nof nuclear nonproliferation. There is grave concern about the agreement \nwhich the administration has just made with North Korea where we will \nnot be inspecting the spent fuel rods for some 5 years; whether this is \nthe best way to protect against whether North Korea is in fact \nproceeding to build nuclear weapons. It has been disclosed recently \nthat North Korea and Iran are working jointly on ballistic missiles and \nthat North Korea currently has the capacity to send a missile as far as \nAlaska. When we asked the director of the Central Intelligence Agency \nin hearings a week ago Tuesday what the prognosis was for reaching the \ncontinental United States, there can be no assurance. A great deal more \nhas to be done in that respect.\n  The issue of nutrition is of enormous importance. I was shocked more \nthan a decade ago on my first occasion to see a 1-pound baby, a human \nbeing about as big as the size of my hand weighing 1 pound. That is a \nhuman tragedy because those children carry scars for a lifetime, and \nfrequently the lifetime is not too long because of the intensity of the \ninjuries carried. And it is a financial disaster with more than \n$150,000 in cost for each child and multibillion dollars in costs.\n  It is a matter which can be corrected with prenatal visits as \noutlined by Dr. Everett Koop, former Surgeon General, in part of a \nhealth care package which I have proposed in Senate bill 18.\n  As I think about the tragedy of low-birthweight babies or the tragedy \nof teenage pregnancies, as I think of my granddaughter, Silvi Morton \nSpecter, who lives surrounded by love with her mother, Tracey Pearl \nSpecter--a professional woman in her own right, but her daughter comes \nfirst--as I see them playing together--in effect, I say that Tracey is \nSilvi's best playmate--it is a sight to behold and really a tragedy \nthat all children do not have the affection that Silvi has from her \ndoting mother and doting father, my son Shanin Specter, and her \ngrandparents, Carol and Alvin Pearl and Joan and myself.\n  So I take a few moments on this Friday afternoon to talk about Silvi \nMorton Specter's generation and the obligations we have here on \npersonal safety from violent crime at home, the problem of nuclear \nattack abroad, and the issue of not spending to burden Silvi's \ngeneration on the problems which children face everywhere. It is a real \nburden that we face and a real obligation that we have to do a better \njob as Senators and Members of Congress as we look forward to the 21st \ncentury. It is my own personal view that America has not seen its best \nand brightest days.\n  I think of my father, who came to this country as an immigrant from \nRussia at the age of 18 in 1911 without any formal education, and my \nmother, who came with her parents from Poland in 1905 at the age of 5, \nand how much better it has been for my brother, my two sisters and me, \nand how much better it has been for my two sons, Shanin and Steve, and \nhow much better it can be for Tracey and for Silvi Specter's generation \nif we do our jobs in the U.S. Congress.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/20/senate-section/article/S1265-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1266-S1267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

I have witnessed first hand the unequalled quality of care \nthat we have in the United States, but also the problems which include \nskyrocketing costs, uneven access, and inadequate emphasis on \nprevention.\n  Last year, President Clinton addressed the problems in our health \ncare system, but his proposed solution was fatally flawed. He favored \nmonopolization, not competition. He sought to empower bureaucrats, not \nindividuals. And, in the end, he relied on Government, not the private \nsector. Fortunately, once the American people heard the truth about the \nadministration's plan, they rejected it.\n  Nevertheless, the problems with our health care system have not \ndisappeared. And make no mistake, there are problems with our health \ncare system. But instead of scrapping the whole system, we must target \nand fix what is broken. Mr. President, I believe the use of medical \nsavings accounts is an important first step in this process.\n  A fundamental problem which characterizes every interaction between \npatient and health care provider is that the provider is paid not by \nthe patient, but by a third party. On average, every time a patient in \nAmerica receives a dollar's worth of medical services, 79 cents is paid \nfor by someone else--usually the Government or an insurance company. \nThe result is that we grossly over-consume medical services. Imagine if \nwe were all required to pay out of our own pockets only 20 cents of \nevery dollar spent on food, clothing, and transportation. We would \nover-consume--we would buy more than we need. And that's what happens \nin medicine. Since they don't feel they are paying for it, everyone \nwants the most and the best--at any price--whether it's the deluxe \nhospital room, the latest in nuclear medical imaging, or the MRI scan \nfor a headache. We must become more cost-conscious consumers of medical \nservices.\n  Mr. President, there are two methods of doing this. First, as the \nClinton administration urged, we can limit medical technology and \nration care, thereby limiting choice of physician and ultimately \naccess. The American people rejected this alternative--and with good \nreason. It would have severely reduced the quality of patient care. I \nsaw this happen first-hand during the year I spent in England as a \nregistrar in heart and lung surgery. I watched over and over again as \npatients waited months for medical procedures which they would have \nobtained in days or weeks in the United States. And sadly, in some \ninstances, I watched patients die while they waited.\n   [[Page S1268]] The second choice, and the one I believe we must \nfollow if we want to stem rising health care costs without decreasing \nthe availability and quality of patient care, is to empower individuals \nand enable them to purchase medical services directly, as they do other \nservices. Medical savings accounts would encourage patients to make \nprudent, cost-conscious decision about purchasing medical services.\n  What are medical savings accounts? Medical savings accounts are tax-\nfree, personal accounts which can be used by an individual to pay \nmedical bills. Take, for example, an employee of a company: today an \nemployer might pay $3,000 or $4,000 for a medical insurance policy with \na $500 deductible. The employee has no incentive to be cost-conscious. \nIn contrast, if medical savings accounts were available, the employer \nwould deposit an amount--say $2,000--tax free in a savings account, \nwhich would belong to the employee. The employee would buy an \ninexpensive, catastrophic-type policy which would cover medical \nexpenses above $2,000 per year. For medical expenses up to the $2,000\n deductible limit, the employee using his own discretion would use \nmoney from the savings account. Any savings account money not spent on \nhealth care that year would grow tax free in the employee's account and \nwould accumulate year to year. At retirement, the money could be rolled \nover into an IRA or a pension, or could be used to pay for long-term \ncare or other expenses. Thus, the individual has a strong incentive to \nbecome a cost-conscious consumer of medical care. He will demand \nquality care at competitive prices. The consumer will drive the market. \nThe system will respond with better outcome measures and lower unit \nprices for health care.\n\n  In short, medical savings accounts will give American health care \nconsumers strong incentives to change the way they consume health care \nservices because they keep any money they don't spend.\n  We will potentially save billions of dollars in health care costs \nbecause individual patients will modify their health care purchasing \nhabits to consume health care services prudently.\n  Medical savings accounts will potentially also save billions of \ndollars in administrative costs. In 1992 alone, administrative costs \nfor health insurance exceeded $41 billion. With medical savings \naccounts, patients will deal directly with health care providers and \neliminate many third parties.\n  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the use of medical savings \naccounts will help maintain the high quality of care that Americans \nhave come to know. While the Clinton administration would limit \ntechnology and force hospitals and doctors to ration care, medical \nsavings accounts will put the individual back in charge of his or her \nown consumption of medical services.\n  Mr. President, in closing, we in America are fortunate to have the \nabsolute highest quality health care in the world. When the leaders of \nthe world become seriously ill, they don't go to Great Britain or \nCanada to seek treatment, they come to the United States. And while \nthere are those who would like to stifle our technological advances and \nallow bureaucrats to tell us how much and what kind of health care we \ncan receive, the American people have loudly and clearly rejected this \nnotion.\n  No one can predict what will happen in medicine in the first 50 years \nof the 21st century. Fifty years ago, when my father was a young doctor \nin Tennessee making house calls, he could not have envisioned what \nmedical practice today would be like. The technological advances are \nsimply mind-boggling. Mr. President, the challenge for us is to \nmaintain the highest quality health care in the world and to continue \nto make it available to all Americans. But this can only be done if we \nfirst change the basic framework through which medical services are \nconsumed, and continue with a market-based system. I believe the use of \nmedical savings accounts will be a major step in that direction. \nIndividual patients will become part of the solution, instead of \nremaining part of the problem. For this reason, I hope that you and my \nother colleagues in the Senate will support my efforts to pass \nlegislation later in this session to create medical savings accounts.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/20/senate-section/article/S1267-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO DR. ARCHIE HILL CARMICHAEL III\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I spoke earlier this month about the \nuntimely death of Dr. Archie H. Carmichael III, a distinguished \nphysician from the shoals area of Alabama, which includes Muscle \nShoals, Sheffield, Florence, and my hometown of Tuscumbia.\n  Dr. Carmichael truly epitomized the high ideals which constitute the \nmedical profession. He was a dear friend to many, including his \npatients, who he served so diligently for over 30 years. He had a \nremarkable bedside manner and his patients highly respected him. In \nshort, he was the type of rare individual who can never really be \nreplaced. He had patients from all over northwest Alabama, northeast \nMississippi, and southern Tennessee and will be genuinely missed.\n  Upon learning of his death, Tuscumbia mayor Ray Cahoon remarked that \n``Archie Hill had done a really great job of serving his community as a \nphysician. He was really well-loved. He was already missed by many \nbecause he had to cease his practice due to his illness.''\n  One of his medical colleagues said that he had always treasured his \nprofessional and personal association with Dr. Carmichael, and noted \nthat he had loved his work and his patients and had always put them \nbefore his personal concerns. He was known as a very pleasant person to \nwork with and a dedicated professional.\n  Archie Hill Carmichael was an all-state football player from Deshler \nHigh School who received a football scholarship to attend the Georgia \nInstitute of Technology. Later, however, the young athlete gave up his \nfootball career due to his mother's urging, and finally his own \ndecision, to pursue a career in the field of medicine. He subsequently \ntook his bachelor of science and medical degrees from Vanderbilt \nUniversity, to which he had transferred from Georgia Tech, and \ncompleted his residency in internal medicine at Bowman-Gray Medical \nSchool at Wake Forest University. He served in the U.S. Naval Medical \nCorps for several years. He practiced medicine in Sheffield, AL for 31 \nyears and served as an adjunct professor of medicine at the University \nof Alabama Medical School for a while.\n  Dr. Carmichael married Ann Cothran, and they had two children, \nLawrence Carmichael, M.D., and Beth Carmichael Riley. Ann Cothran \nCarmichael predeceased her husband by several years, and he then \nmarried Jean Pigford Cleveland. They had a son, Archie Hill Carmichael \nIV. He was a great family man, a dedicated father, and devoted husband\n  From a very distinguished family including his grandfather, former \nMember of Congress Archie H. Carmichael--Archie Hill III, added much to \nhis family's legacy. His Congressman grandfather was succeeded in the \nHouse by my own predecessor in the Senate, the legendary John J. \nSparkman.\n  Dr. Carmichael had retired due to a serious illness, and passed away \non January 4, 1995. At the time of his retirement, he practiced as a \nspecialist in internal medicine with his longtime partner, Dr. R. \nWinston Williams. He was a member of First United Methodist Church in \nTuscumbia; the Colbert County Medical Society; the Medical Society of \nthe State of Alabama, and the American College of Physicians.\n  I extend my sincerest condolences to Jean Carmichael and his entire \nfamily as they lament this tremendous loss.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/20/senate-section/article/S1268-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1268-S1269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JAMES T.

Mr. President, Alabama and the nation lost a prized \ncitizen when Dr. Luther Foster, former president of Tuskegee \nUniversity, passed away last November.\n  Luther was known for being intellectual, involved, and achievement-\noriented. His hard work and dedication to his studies earned him \nseveral degrees and honors from several institutions. He was known by \nmany through the numerous organizations with which he affiliated \nhimself. His qualities led to the type of career and accomplishments \nmany only dream of.\n  Dr. Foster received his bachelor's degree from Virginia State \nCollege, now known as Hampton Institute, his MBA from Harvard \nUniversity, and his doctoral degree from the University of Chicago.\n  His honorary degrees include doctorates of civil law, humane letters, \nand public service.\n  Dr. Foster was a member of the American Revolution Bicentennial \nCommission; the Commission on Critical Choices for America; the Council \non Financial Aid to Education; the National Advisory Committee on Black \nHigher Education and Black Colleges and Universities; the President's \nAdvisory Commission on International Educational and Cultural Exchange; \nthe President's General Advisory Committee on Foreign Assistance \nPrograms; the President's Task Force on Priorities in Higher Education; \nResources for the Future, and the U.S. Air Force Academy Advisory \nCouncil.\n  In addition, he directed the Center for Creative Learning; the March \nof Dimes; Norton Simon, Inc.; the Overseas Development Committee; \nPolitical and Economic Studies; the Retirement Equities Fund; the \nUnited Negro College Fund, and Sears, Roebuck and Co.\n  He also chaired the Association of American Colleges and the Race \nRelations Information center.\n  Dr. Foster served as the budget officer of Howard University from \n1937-41. He later relocated to the Tuskegee Institute where he served \nas business manager from 1941-53. He was then named president of \nTuskegee in 1953 and held this position for the next 28 years. At the \ntime of his death, he was chairman and CEO of Robert R.

A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \neliminate the earnings test for individuals who have attained \nretirement age; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                the older americans' freedom to work act\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Older Americans \nFreedom to Work Act of 1995 to eliminate the Social Security earnings \ntest for individuals who have attained retirement age.\n  As the Social Security Act is designed, the Government seems to give \nlittle thought to older Americans' ability to make an important \ncontribution to our work force. Senior citizens are subject to taxes \nsuch as the Federal Contributions Act [FICA], even in situations where \nthey are receiving Social Security benefits. They are also subject to \nvarious Federal, State, and local taxes.\n  This brings me to the biggest outrage: the Social Security retirement \nearnings limit. Presently, this limit reduces benefits to persons \nbetween ages 65 and 69 who earn more than $11,280 yearly. These \nreductions amount to $1 in reduced benefits for every $3 in earnings \nabove the aforementioned limit--$1 for $3 withholding rate.\n  The earnings test is very unfair, but it also poses a serious threat \nto the labor work force. Demographers tell us that between the years \n2000 and 2010 the baby boom generation will be in their retirement \nyears. With fewer babies being born to replace them, this Nation is \nlooking at a severe labor shortage. The skills and expertise of older \nworkers is desperately needed.\n  An earnings limit for Social Security beneficiaries is an ill \nconceived idea and an administrative nightmare for the Social Security \nAdministration [SSA]. SSA spends a great deal of money and devotes a \nfull 8 percent of its employees to police the income levels of \nretirees. For beneficiaries, the income limit is a frustrating \nexperience of estimating and reporting income levels to SSA.\n  In the 1930's, when the earned income limit was devised, encouraging \nthe elderly to leave the workplace was seen as a positive act, designed \nto increase job opportunities for younger workers. Today, with our \nshrinking labor force, such a policy is absurd. We need the skills, \nwisdom, and experience of our older workers, and my proposal will \nencourage them to remain in the labor force.\n  In the 102d Congress, the Senate adopted an amendment to the older \nAmericans reauthorization amendments to repeal the earnings test. While \nit was dropped from final passage, this legislation has perennial \nbipartisan interest and support.\n  It is a pleasure to again sponsor legislation in the Senate to \nabolish the onerous retirement earnings test. This begins the process \nof providing employment opportunities for older Americans without \npunishing them for their efforts. It is my understanding that the \nPresident supports lifting the earnings test for retirees, and I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this \n[[Page S1272]] vitally important legislation. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 252\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in \n     Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall apply only with \n     respect to taxable years ending after December 31, 1995.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LOTT:\n  S. 253. A bill to repeal certain prohibitions against political \nrecommendations relating to Federal employment, to reenact certain \nprovisions relating to recommendations by Member of Congress, and for \nother purpose; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                 POLITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to allow \nMember of Congress to once again make political recommendations on \nbehalf of constituents who have applied for Federal civil service \nemployment. We have all been asked or wished to support constituents \nand friends who seek Federal positions. My bill would simply restore \nthe basic right to make recommendations that Members held previously \nand would repeal this unnecessary prohibition.\n  The Hatch Act reform bill passed during the 103d Congress, but it \nincluded an onerous amendment that keeps Senators and Representatives \nfrom making suggestions. This provision went into effect in February \n1994 and has probably caused difficulties for virtually every Member as \nconstituents often ask us for recommendations when they have applied \nfor Federal jobs.\n  Contacting a Federal agency in the interest of a citizen is the most \nbasic of constituent services. My bill would restore us the ability to \nrecommend those constituents who we feel will do an outstanding job \nwith the Federal civil service. The bureaucracy needs applicants from \noutside the beltway to effect a change in how the U.S. Government works \ntoday. Exceptional candidates recommended by Senators and \nRepresentatives can help make these changes.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 253\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in \n     Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITIONS AGAINST POLITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS \n                   RELATING TO FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT.\n\n       (a) In General--Section 3303 of title 5, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 3303. Competitive service; recommendations of Senators \n       or Representatives\n\n       ``An individual concerned in examining an applicant for or \n     appointing him in the competitive service may not receive or \n     consider a recommendation of the applicant by a Senator or \n     Representative, except as to the character or residence of \n     the applicant.''.\n       (b) Technical and Conforming Amendments.--(1) The table of \n     sections for chapter 33 of title 5, United States Code, is \n     amended by amending the item relating to section 3303 to read \n     as follows:\n\n``3303. Competitive service; recommendations of Senators or \n              Representatives.''.\n\n       (2) Section 2302(b)(2) of title 5, United States Code, is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(2) solicit or consider any recommendation or statement, \n     oral or written, with respect to any individual who requests \n     or is under consideration for any personnel action unless \n     such recommendation or statement is based on the personal \n     knowledge or records of the person furnishing it and consists \n     of--\n       ``(A) an evaluation of the work performance, ability, \n     aptitude, or general qualifications of such individual; or\n       ``(B) an evaluation of the character, loyalty, or \n     suitability of such individual;''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--This Act shall take effect 30 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LOTT:\n  S. 254. A bill to extend eligibility for veterans' burial benefits, \nfuneral benefits, and related benefits for veterans of certain service \nin the United States merchant marine during World War II; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                   the merchant mariners fairness act\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, it is my pleasure to reintroduce the \nMerchant Mariners Fairness Act.\n  My bill would grant veterans status to American merchant mariners who \nhave been denied this status a well as veterans benefits. Similar \nlegislation passed the House last year and related provisions were \nincluded in the Coast Guard authorization bill; however, these \nprovisions were not included in the final conference report of that \nbill.\n  In 1988, the Secretary of the Air Force decided, for the purposes of \ngranting veterans benefits to merchant seamen, that the cut-off date \nfor service would be August, 15, 1945, V-J Day, rather than December \n31, 1946, when hostilities were declared officially ended. My bill \nwould correct the 1988 decision and extend veterans benefits to those \nmerchant mariners who served from August 15, 1945 to December 31, 1946. \nIt would extend eligibility for veterans burial benefits, funeral \nbenefits, and related benefits for certain members of the U.S. merchant \nmarine during World War II.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  [[Page S1273]] There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 254\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Army to carry out such \nactivities as are necessary to stabilize the bluffs along the \nMississippi River in the vicinity of Natchez, MS, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                NATCHEZ BLUFFS STABILIZATION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nauthorize the Corps of Engineers to stabilize sections of the Natchez \nBluffs. The deterioration of these bluffs has created a profound danger \nto both life and property.\n  These bluffs overlook the Mississippi River and are formed by loess \nsoil, a very fine powdery substance that practically liquefies when it \ngets wet. Water has infiltrated this soil causing numerous and \nunexpected mudslides and sloughing. This has put the historic homes on \nthe bluffs and at their base in jeopardy.\n  Natchez has a long and distinguished history. Not only was this area \nthe ancestral home for the Natchez Indians; it is the oldest settlement \nin my State. In fact, it is the oldest settlement on the Mississippi \nRiver, even older than New Orleans or St. Louis. When my State was a \nterritory, Natchez was our capital, and during the antebellum times it \nwas a major center for cotton trading. Natchez has been designated as a \nnational historical park. The Natchez Trace, which was a major inland \ntrade route during colonial days, historically started at these bluffs.\n  Last year the National Trust for Historic Preservation put Natchez on \nits list of America's ``Eleven Most Endangered Historic Places.'' To \nquote Richard Moe, president of the National Trust:\n\n       The National Trust strongly supports the authorization for \n     the Army Corps of Engineers to stabilize the bluffs. These \n     historic resources are some of the most outstanding in the \n     United States, and they must not be lost when there is an \n     available remedy to the threat.\n\n  In March 1980, there was a very serious slide at the Natchez Bluffs \nthat killed two people and injured many more. Last year there was \nanother slide which carried away a significant portion of the bluffs. \nClearly, the bluffs are now past the point of makeshift repair measures \nwhich the State and the municipality have attempted. Now is the time to \nhave the Government Federal engineer step in. The Corps of Engineers \nexamined the current situation, and their most recent draft report \ncharacterizes the deteriorating condition as an emergency.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to support this bill and the idea \nbehind it. Not just due to the imminent danger posed to life by the \nreal possibility for additional slides, but also for preserving \nnationally recognized historic property. I introduced similar \nlegislation last year as Senate bill 1492, that would do essentially \nthe same thing.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senator Thad Cochran, the senior Senator \nfrom my State, in cosponsoring this legislation to protect these \nhistorically significant properties and to prevent potential loss of \nlives.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Lott, in cosponsoring legislation which would authorize funds \nto stabilize the river bluffs at Natchez.\n  Two years ago, at my request, the Energy and Water Appropriations \nSubcommittee, in its fiscal year 1994 appropriations bill, asked the \nCorps of Engineers to undertake a technical study of the condition and \npossible stabilizing actions that could be taken. Last year, we asked \nthe corps to prepare a second report focusing on updated cost estimates \nand, in light of more recent bad weather and deterioration, on the \ncurrent severity of the situation. We have seen the corps' second \nreport. In that report, the Corps of Engineers states what the Governor \nof Mississippi, the mayor of Natchez, and the people of Natchez have \nknown and have been saying for some time: That the Natchez Bluff \nsituation is an emergency.\n  Last October, the Natchez Democrat editorialized, ``Each day that \npasses without a remedy, sections of the bluffs become more precarious, \nthreatening homes and businesses.'' Natchez Bluffs is like a \ndeteriorating health problem. Every day that goes by without action \nmeans that corrective action will be more complex and more expensive. \nAnd so, in this day when budget constraints are the watchword, it is \neven more imperative to move on truly important projects like this one \nwithout delay. More delay will mean more money. More delay will mean \nmore hardship for the people of Natchez.\n  Therefore, I urge the Senate to approve this authorization for Corps \nof Engineers work in Natchez. Individuals homes, businesses, and \nimportant, historic sections of a grand old American city are at stake.\n\n[[Page S1274]]\n\n      By Mr. DOLE (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. \n        Simpson):\n  S. 256. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to establish \nprocedures for determining the status of certain missing members of the \nArmed Forces and certain civilians, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                     missing service personnel act\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, today I rise, with my colleagues, Senator \nSimpson, Senator Lautenberg, and Senator Lieberman, to introduce the \nMissing Service Personnel Act of 1995. This legislation is similar to \nthat which was introduced last year but which the Congress was unable \nto consider before adjournment. The legislation would reform the \nDepartment of Defense's procedures for determining whether members of \nthe Armed Forces should be listed as missing or presumed dead. \nLegislation pertaining to those missing in action has not changed in \nthe past 50 years. Since the Vietnam war, the Department of Defense and \nthe U.S. Government have been criticized for their handling of the POW/\nMIA issue. Some of that criticism is legitimate. Some of it has been \nbrought upon the Government by its own actions or inactions. This bill \nattempts to correct most of those problems and establish a fair and \nequitable procedure for determining the exact status of such personnel. \nAt the same time, it is my hope that we might restore some of the \nDepartment's credibility on this issue and rebuild faith and trust \nbetween the public and our Federal Government.\n  This bill attempts to ensure that missing members of the Armed Forces \nor civilian employees accompanying them are fully accounted for by the \nGovernment and that they are not declared dead solely because of the \npassage of time. The legislation would establish new procedures for \ndetermining the whereabouts and status of missing persons. \nAdditionally, the bill provides for the appointment of counsel for the \nmissing persons, ensuring that the Government does not disregard their \ninterests and affording them due process of law. The proposal also \nattempts to remove the curtains of secrecy which often seem to surround \nthese cases by ensuring access to Government information and by making \nall information available to the hearing officers. Additionally, the \nmissing person's complete personnel file would be made available for \nreview by the family members. Moreover, the\n legislation attempts to protect the interests of the missing person's \nimmediate family, dependents, and next of kin, allowing them to be \nrepresented by counsel and to participate with the boards of inquiry. \nIt is our hope that by allowing more participation by the family, \nrequiring legal representation of the missing persons, and permitting \nFederal court review of all determinations, we will establish \nfundamental fairness for all concerned.\n\n  We recognize that the Department of Defense has concerns about this \nlegislation. At the same time, we also realize that families of missing \npersonnel raise legitimate issues. However, in my view, we need to look \nat this issue from the perspective of those brave men and women \ncurrently serving in our Armed Forces. As this bill moves through the \nlegislative process, it is our hope that all of these issues and \nconcerns will be addressed.\n  Mr. President, the men and women in uniform must know that this \nNation will do everything possible to return them safely home in the \nevent they become missing while serving in armed conflict. \nAdditionally, we must assure them that a more open and fair procedure \nwill be established to determine their exact status.\n  In closing, let me note the support that this legislation has already \nreceived. I have received letters encouraging the introduction of this \nbill from the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, the \nNational Vietnam Veterans Coalition, and Vietnow.\n  Additionally, in just the short time between its introduction last \nyear and our adjournment, this legislation gained a total of 23 \ncosponsors. I am pleased to again sponsor this important legislation \nwith the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, and urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters from each of these organizations be printed in the Record \nfollowing my statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 256\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Missing Service Personnel \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to ensure that any member of the \n     Armed Forces and any civilian employee of the Federal \n     Government or contractor of the Federal Government who serves \n     with or accompanies an Armed Force in the field under orders \n     is fully accounted for by the Federal Government and, as a \n     general rule, is not declared dead solely because of the \n     passage of time.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Robert J.

The American Legion is especially appreciative of your \n     personal efforts and concern for the plight of American POW/\n     MIAs. Your introduction of the Dole-Lautenberg bill, The \n     Missing Service Personnel Act of 1955, is both timely and \n     welcome. It directly and substantially supports on-going \n     Legion efforts to seek information about missing Americans \n     from previous wars.\n       Your sponsorship of this bill is especially significant \n     since it comes at a time when American contacts with foreign \n     governments are more interested in making lucrative business \n     arrangements than in obtaining a full and complete accounting \n     of missing service personnel. With the lifting of the embargo \n     against Vietnam early last year the U.S. lost its last major \n     bargaining lever for POWs and MIAs from the war in Southeast \n     Asia. Your bill, supported by the Senate in the 104th \n     Congress will serve to provide a more equitable basis for \n     making status determinations on missing service personnel \n     from wars past and conflicts yet to be fought.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              John F.

I understand \n     that you intend to reintroduce a similar bill in the near \n     future, and I therefore also write to express the DAV's full \n     support for your efforts.\n       Your actions are a recognition of this nation's most \n     important obligation to resolve questions about the fate of \n     those missing-in-action. As a nation, we must do everything \n     possible to account for those who have not returned, those \n     that were captured or killed in the service of their country. \n     Anything less would be an abandonment of our solemn \n     responsibilities to these courageous defenders and would be a \n     concession of defeat in the struggle to recover those who \n     sacrificed so much for our benefit.\n       The members of DAV are deeply concerned for the nearly \n     100,000 of our fellow servicemen and women still unaccounted \n     for in the aftermath of World War II, the Korean War, the \n     Vietnam War, and subsequent military engagements, and we hope \n     for a means to better account for our service members in any \n     future conflicts. The delegates to our 1994 annual National \n     Convention adopted a resolution supporting legislation to \n     establish new procedures for determining the status of \n     missing service members. We are confident that our nation's \n     citizens share the DAV's concern and will also fully support \n     any measures designed to improve our ability to account for \n     our missing-in-action.\n       The DAV commends you and offers its support for your \n     efforts. Please let us know if we can be of assistance to you \n     in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Donald A.

In the proposed ``Missing Service \n     Personnel Act'', ``conclusive proof of death'' is required to \n     be established and based upon evidence that death is the only \n     plausible explanation for the absence of the missing person.\n       Important provisions of this legislation, are the inclusion \n     of family members in the review process, their access to \n     information gained during the investigation and a set time \n     frame for the review process.\n       Passage of the ``Missing Service Personnel Act'' is vital \n     and will restore a sense of confidence not only to those \n     effected by previous wars, but to those who may become \n     Prisoner Of War or listed as Missing In Action as a result of \n     future wars.\n       Senator Dole, we thank you for your past efforts and \n     strongly support and encourage you to reintroduce the \n     ``Missing Service Personnel Act'' as one of the first items \n     to be introduced before the 104th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Rich Teague,\n     VietNow National POW/MIA Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                          National Vietnam Veterans Coalition,\n\n                                 Washington, D.C, January 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Re: Missing Service Personnel Act.\n       Dear Senators Dole and Lautenberg: The National Vietnam \n     Veterans Coalition, a federation of seventy-eight (78) \n     Vietnam veterans organizations and veterans issue groups, is \n     pleased to support your efforts for long overdue reform of \n     the Missing Persons Act.\n       The history of the law, as previously administered, has \n     been one of arbitrary decisions based on incomplete \n     information. The administration of the law has produced \n     untold grief among the family members of the missing in \n     action and has angered the Vietnam veteran community. The \n     rote presumptive findings of death have contributed \n     substantially to the ongoing failure of the POW/MIA \n     bureaucracy to meaningfully resolve the issue.\n       The bill you are introducing provides considerable \n     procedural protections to future MIAs. the provisions for \n     appointment of counsel for the MIAs interests, the counsel's \n     access to classified information, procedures for dealing with \n     classified information, centralization of case information in \n     the MIAs personnel file, the ability to reopen hearings for a \n     period of time and effective reversal of the current de facto \n     presumption of death reflexively applied in hearings mark \n     tremendous progress. The encouragement to combine hearings in \n     group disappearance cases would force hearing panels to weigh \n     the evidence in a broader context.\n       The opening up of the process to include the right of \n     participation of secondary next of kin is a welcome \n     recognition of the fact that there is more than one person in \n     each family who cares about the fate of a missing relative.\n       We are proud to endorse this much needed piece of \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              J. Thomas Burch, Jr.\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to again join Senator Dole \nin an effort to improve the way our government treats military service \nmembers and their families by reintroducing the Missing Service \nPersonnel Act of 1995. It is perhaps fitting that two veterans of World \nWar II join together to sponsor this legislation. Senator Dole and I \ncollaborated in writing this bill in a spirit of bipartisanship. We \nbelieve there is no room for politics when it comes to how the \nGovernment treats its missing personnel.\n  Mr. President, The Missing Service Personnel Act of 1995 updates \nexisting law, last written by Congress in 1942. It focuses on how the \nU.S. Government deals with military personnel and Federal employees who \nare classified as ``missing in action.'' Our bill also makes some \nimprovements in the way the Federal Government deals with the families \nof missing persons. They suffer when a loved one is missing and they \ndeserve to have their interests protected and their needs met by their \ngovernment.\n  Congressional interest in the issue is extensive, Mr. President. When \nthe Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs--ably led by Senator \nKerry and Senator Smith--reported its findings to this body, it \nconcluded there has been serious U.S. Government neglect and \nmismanagement in dealing with missing servicemembers. That's why we're \nhere today--we want to rid the government of neglect and mismanagement \nin its treatment of Americans who are missing in action.\n  Having served in World War II, both Senator Dole and I know first-\nhand the tremendous sacrifice service men and women make when they face \ncombat. We know the terror soldiers face when they consider the \nprospect of being captured. We also know the anguish our loved ones \nsuffer when a soldier goes into harm's way.\n  Over the past 25 years, the credibility of the Department of Defense \non MIA/POW issues has been seriously questioned. Without substantial \nreform of its procedures, the American people \n[[Page S1280]] will continue to question the credibility of DOD in \nfuture military operations. Americans expect Pentagon officials to care \nfor our soldiers and their families. They expect DOD officials to do \nthe right thing when a servicemember is reported missing. There should \nbe no curtain of secrecy. There should be no perception of \nincompetence. There should be no unfair treatment of families.\n  Our uniformed men and women serve proudly in the Armed Forces on \nbehalf of all Americans. In return for their sacrifice, American \nservicemembers should be able to expect fairness, honesty, and support \nfrom the Department of Defense.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, when we look at recent history \nconcerning the treatment of families of those missing in action, we see \na troubling picture. No one in Congress should be content with what has \nhappened in the past. We have seen families become outraged by the \ntreatment they receive from the Government. We have witnessed their \ndisgust toward elected officials. And, we have heard their calls for \nmore information, more interest, and more action to recover their loved \nones.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to respond, to provide better \ntreatment. I believe the time is right to correct the Pentagon's flawed \nmanagement practices. The cold war is over. The United States is not \nengaged in a major war, although we still have American men and women \nserving faithfully around the globe. They are ready for conflict if \nnecessary. And, I suggest to my colleagues that the Pentagon must be \nready as well.\n  Let's take a look at the problems we face now.\n  Mr. President, existing U.S. law concerning how the Government deals \nwith missing persons is over 50 years old. That law is inadequate--it \ndeals primarily with financial aspects of missing personnel and their \ndependents. That law is outdated--it doesn't address new issues that \nhave emerged over the past 25 years. And that law is incomplete--it \ndoesn't protect missing servicemembers from bureaucratic inaction.\n  Perhaps most troubling is the fact that existing law does not protect \nthe rights of missing persons. Right now, missing persons do not have \ncounsel in Government hearings. No one represents their interests. In \naddition, missing persons lose due process after 1 year. They just go \ninto administrative limbo. They stay there until someone says they're \ndead. No wonder so many families think Government decisions are \narbitrary and capricious.\n  Another problem deals with access to information. Right now, hearing \nofficers can be denied information about missing persons. In addition, \nhearing officers can be excluded from reviewing classified information. \nAnd further, Government officials can willfully withhold relevant \ninformation without penalty. I believe these practices are the root \ncause for the curtain of secrecy that surrounds Government decisions.\n  The lack of specified rights for families is another problem with \nexisting law. The Americans with the greatest stake in Government \naction have the least involvement in those decisions. Moreover, \nfamilies have no right to appeal. No wonder many families make charges \nof ``cover-up'' and ``smokescreen.'' I believe we should have \nprocedures that guarantee families of missing servicemembers honest, \nfair, and just treatment.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the old law doesn't create the opportunity \nfor good, just decisions. Right now, officials assigned to conduct \nhearings may not be qualified. Further, they may have no guidance about \nmaking determinations of death. So today, what we have are poor \ndecisions: Missing persons are pronounced dead . . . merely with the \npassage of time. I believe such determinations constitute disloyalty to \nour service men and women.\n  Mr. President, when you look at the problems with existing law in the \naggregate, you can see why we've had so many problems over the years. \nFamilies are mad. Service men and women are wary. Government officials \nare frustrated. Senator Dole and I wrote this bill to correct, once and \nfor all, all these problems.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, when the Pentagon looks at these \nproblems they see a rosy picture. Over the last 5 years, Pentagon \nofficials have reported to Congress that everything is just fine. They \nhave dragged their feet in upgrading government procedures. And despite \nour efforts to reform existing law, the Pentagon has not come forward \nwith a reform proposal. Mr. President, there seems to be a general lack \nof will within the Pentagon to update its management procedures \nregarding missing persons.\n  In Congress today, there are several POW/MIA legislative initiative \nthat address problems of past wars and conflicts. These initiatives \nattempt to resolve problems for World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. These \nare all worthy and should be pursued by both the Congress and the \nadministration.\n  However, Mr. President, we have only one initiative that looks to the \nfuture--to the wars and conflicts not yet fought by Americans. In \npassing the fiscal year 1995 National Defense Authorization Act, the \nSenate took the first step in establishing new procedures for the \nfuture. In that legislation, we required the Department of Defense to \nreview its procedures and recommend changes to Congress.\n  I remain skeptical about the Pentagon's response. I haven't seen any \nenthusiasm to update their procedures. Those in Congress who have dealt \nwith these problems have seen little Pentagon interest in reform. \nIndeed, last year, an Assistant Secretary of Defense wrote to us with \nregard to the Pentagon's procedures . . . and I quote:\n\n       I believe that the existing legislation provides adequate \n     protections and venues for participation of all parties with \n     legitimate interest.\n\n  Now Mr. President, I ask my colleagues: What should we expect from a \nPentagon review of existing legislation? Does anyone in this body \nbelieve the Pentagon will come forward with reform legislation? I will \ntell you I am very skeptical.\n  This is why we are reintroducing this bill today. I want to lay on \nthe table a proposal with real reform. I want the Pentagon to know that \nthis Senator does not believe existing procedures are adequate. And I \nsuggest the Senate needs to take the lead on this critical issue.\n  Mr. President, when we wrote this legislation, Senator Dole and I \ntook a new approach. We asked a simple question: How would a missing \nsoldier want the U.S. Government to respond to his or her situation? \nWhat would a missing person want from his government? We wrote this \nbill from the point of view of American service men and women. When we \nfinished, we had created wholly new procedures--procedures that, for \nthe first time, are designed to serve those who are missing in action.\n  This legislation accomplishes four goals. First, it corrects \nmanagement deficiencies for dealing with missing service members. \nSecond, the bill safeguards the rights of missing personnel. Third, our \nlegislation reestablishes a sense of trust between the U.S. Government \nand the families of missing personnel by raising what many people \nconsider to be a ``curtain of secrecy'' surrounding Government \ndecisions. And finally, Mr. President, our bill assures fundamental \nfairness to missing servicemembers by requiring timely Government \naction and specifying the rights of families and the Government's \nobligations to them. We hope that families of missing persons are \ntreated fairly in all proceedings.\n  Let me discuss some of the provisions we are proposing in more \ndetail.\n  First, the Act will establish new procedures for determining the \nwhereabouts and status of missing persons. These procedures accelerate \nofficial action in order to recover the missing. They may even lead to \nthe recovery of some servicemembers.\n  Moreover, the new procedures will afford missing persons due process \nwell after the first year of their disappearance. Our service men and \nwomen should never believe that our Government will abandon them if \ncaptured. This legislation guarantees that the Government won't write \nthem off merely with the passage of time.\n  The second important provision of the Act is that qualified counsel \nwill be appointed for missing persons. This is new. Never before have \nmissing persons been represented by counsel. Our service personnel \nshould not have to worry about their rights, even if they are \n[[Page S1281]] missing in action. This legislation assures that the \nGovernment does not ignore issues and evidence. It assures that the \nGovernment affords the missing in action due process of the law.\n  Third, the act will assure access to Government information. It \nremoves the ``curtain of secrecy.'' It makes all information available \nto hearing officers. Also, the bill carefully provides access to \nclassified information. And, it makes complete personnel files \navailable for review. These measures guarantee that the Government \ndoesn't make ill-formed decisions about the statute of missing \npersonnel.\n  The act also specifies the rights of the missing person's immediate \nfamily, dependents and next of kin. It ensures that our field \ncommanders will give families updated, accurate information concerning \nthe incident in which their loved one disappeared. The bill assures \nfamily participation in Government hearings. They will have access to \nthe personnel file of the missing. They can be represented by private \ncounsel. They can object in writing to a board's recommendations. And \nlast, but not least, they can appeal a Government ruling. These are the \nbasic rights of families--and no one can argue with putting them into \nlaw.\n  The last major provision of the act states criteria for making just \ndecisions about the status of missing servicemembers. It gives guidance \nto officials about that factors they must consider before making a \ndetermination of death. The bill specifically prohibits declaring \nsomeone to be dead merely by virtue of the passage of time. I believe \nthese provisions are important as an expression of Government loyalty \nto all persons who serve in the Armed Forces.\n  Mr. President, let me close by saying that there remains a strong \nbipartisan consensus across America in support of this bill. It has \nbeen building over the last 3 years. It started partly as a grassroots \ninitiative from New Jersey and elsewhere. And it continues to enjoy the \nsupport of several major veterans organizations across the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, the good intentions of many Americans, who truly care \nabout the welfare of the men and women in the Armed Services, have been \ncombined into this initiative. They believe it is the right thing to \ndo.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Dole and me in supporting this \nreform legislation when it is considered by the Senate.\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nto the Missing Service Personnel Act of 1995 as I was when this \nlegislation was first introduced in the 103d Congress. I commend the \ndistinguished majority leader for his leadership on this issue and am \nproud to join him, Senator Simpson, and Senator Lautenberg in this \nimportant effort. This legislation is long overdue and is an important \nstep toward providing the men and women who have served and will serve \nin our Armed Forces in conflict the protection and rights they and \ntheir families deserve, and we as a country owe them.\n  The current law which governs personnel who became missing in action \nwas written in 1942 in the midst of World War II. We have now had over \n50 years of experience with that law and the procedures it established \nto determine the status of people who became missing, captured, or \npresumed killed in a conflict. The experiences of MIA's and their \nfamilies during and long after the Vietnam war provides clear evidence \nthat the existing law is inadequate and revisions are sorely needed.\n  American citizens in uniform and in civilian clothes are serving our \nnational interests in hostile places around the world even as we speak \ntoday. The end of the cold war has not brought an end to the valid need \nfor Americans to serve abroad and sometimes to be placed in harm's way. \nThe legislation we introduce today is an effort to address the \nlegitimate concerns and needs of the men and women and their families \nwho may one day find themselves missing in action because of their \nservice to their country.\n  This legislation recognizes that a man who becomes missing in action \ndoes not surrender their legitimate rights as an American and that we \nmust do everything we can to determine their true status. They will not \nbreak faith with America and America must not break faith with them or \ntheir families. Thus, the legislation prevents presuming that a missing \nservice man or woman is dead simply because of the passage of time. It \nplaces a greater burden on the Government which commits our sons and \ndaughters to conflict to persist in determining the truth about every \none of those who became missing. Some may argue that this burden is too \ngreat. The mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters \nof those who are missing will reply that this is not too great a burden \nto bear for those who have answered the call of their country.\n  I hope and expect that this legislation will be given a thorough and \nfair examination both in committee and when it comes to the floor for \npassage. It is already supported by many veterans groups and \norganizations of families of the missing in action from the Vietnam \nwar. Those in the Department of Defense who will have to implement this \nlegislation should provide us their counsel on ways to improve it and \nto make it more effective. We welcome such constructive efforts. But \nlet there be no mistake about out intentions or goals--the clock cannot \nbe turned back. We cannot just tinker at the margins with policies and \nprocedures which have failed in the past to live up to the covenant \nwhich must exist between the Government and those it sends off to \ndefend its national interest.\n  We must never forget those who have served, are serving, or will \nserve their country. We owe it to them and their loved ones to commit \nourselves to a full accounting of all who become missing in action. \nThis legislation is an important step in the direction of returning \nfaith and trust in this important covenant. I invite my colleagues to \njoin us in cosponsoring this legislation and to work for its speedy \nenactment.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DOLE (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Warner, \n        Mr. McCain, and Mr. Campbell):\n  S. 257. A bill to amend the charter of the Veterans of Foreign Wars \nto make eligible for membership those veterans that have served within \nthe territorial limits of South Korea; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                      the vfw charter legislation\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as a life member of the Veterans of Foreign \nWars of the United States, I am particularly honored today to introduce \nlegislation which will amend the congressional charter of the VFW to \nmake those veterans who have served in South Korea eligible for \nmembership.\n  Since the 1953 armistice, the 170-mile demilitarized zone [DMZ] which \nseparates North and South Korea has been the source of extreme and \nserious tension. According to the VFW, 89 Americans have been killed \nand 132 wounded in clashes with North Korea since the armistice was \nsigned.\n  Across this no-mans-land, North Korea has maintained 70 percent of \nits 1.2-million-man armed forces. Those forces are in forward deployed \nattack positions along the entire DMZ, only 30 miles from the South \nKorean capital of Seoul.\n  Since the end of the Korean war, the United States has pledged to the \nRepublic of Korea to deter any renewal of the conflict. To fulfill our \ncommitment, we have positioned a 37,000-man force consisting of the \nU.S. 8th Army, including the 2d Infantry Division and the Air Force's \n314th Air Division. The record and performance of our military men and \nwomen during the past four decades in meeting that commitment, and in \nspite of constant danger, has been exemplary.\n  I wish to commend the leadership of this great veterans service \norganization, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, for their recognition of \nthose members of our Armed Forces who have served in Korea since 1949. \nI am honored to introduce this legislation and provide my full support \nfor its consideration and quick passage by my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 257\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     section 5 of the Act \n     [[Page S1282]] of May 28, 1936 (36 U.S.C. 115), is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``Sec. 5.

Mr. President and fellow Senators, I think the American \npublic and even we here in the Congress recognize that the November \nelections was a profound statement on the part of this country to speak \nto change.\n  Since that time, all eyes have been focused on Washington, as we saw \nthe changing of the guard in the House after 40 years of single-party \nrule, and certainly the change that has occurred here that has resulted \nwith Republicans being in the majority, leading the Senate and chairing \nthe committees. That has also resulted in a very aggressive legislative \nagenda that has focused most of the attention of the American people on \nwhat is going on in Washington. Whether it was the rule changes in the \nHouse or the debate on the unfunded mandates bill that still is before \nthis Senate, directed by my colleague from Idaho, Dirk Kempthorne, or \nwhether it is the growing debate that will soon come to the floor on a \nbalanced budget amendment, all eyes remain focused on Washington.\n  But while that is going on, something very tragic is still happening \nacross America. And that is that there still remains business as usual \non the part of the Federal Government and our Federal agencies and our \nFederal regulators--as was going on and has been going on long before \nthe elections of last November-- the treading on the private citizen, \nthe taking away of rights, a Federal Government that is unconcerned, or \ndemonstrating at least little concern, about the impact of their \ndecisions and their activities on the economies of local communities.\n  So for just a moment this afternoon, I thought I would once again \nfocus on something that is now occurring in my State of Idaho and try \nto once again impress upon the Congress, and certainly those who might \nbe watching, the magnitude of the job we have before us and the tragedy \nof this administration failing to be responsive and allowing their \nagencies to run amok in an unwillingness to be concerned about the \nhuman being--the citizen, the taxpayer--but to be all concerned about \nthe Federal regulations and to make sure that every letter of the law \nis complied with, even laws that no longer work for the American people \nor \n[[Page S1290]] demonstrate their fairness or their equity.\n  Last Thursday, in Boise, ID, Judge David Ezra, with a sweep of his \npen, Mr. President, shut down 14 million acres in the State of Idaho. \nWhat does that mean? That means that in an area the size of \nMassachusetts and Connecticut and Maryland combined, this judge said, \n``Under the auspices of the Endangered Species Act, there will be no \nlogging, no mining, no grazing, no road building or any human activity \nuntil the Forest Service can convince me and convince national marine \nfisheries that all of their activities fit within the confines of the \nEndangered Species Act,'' even if not one of those activities can \nscientifically be proven to harm a species of fish that is now listed \nas endangered within the watersheds of that region of the State of \nIdaho.\n  As a result of that, 56 timber stations, 82 mining operations, 3 road \nconstruction projects, and 395 livestock grazing operations--better \nknown as ranches--have been told to cease and desist. Thousands of \nminers will be out of work as of Monday morning, next Monday morning, \nnot because the mine played out, not because the market for minerals \ndropped, but because the Federal Government said you can no longer \nmine, and a Federal judge, again, said last Thursday, with the sweep of \nhis pen, ``Walk away. Pull your paycheck. We are not worried about your \nchildren and your homes and your families and your communities. We are \nworried that the law which is now clearly in question be complied \nwith.''\n  Well, Mr. President, you can well imagine, chaos reigns supreme in my \nState of Idaho at this moment; that in six of the eight Federal forests \nin my State, amassing over 14 million acres, all human activity, which \nis a major part of the economic base of that region of my State, has \njust been told to shut down, awaiting the action of a Federal \nbureaucracy that is now days behind in what it should have been doing \ndays ago.\n  That is why it is so imperative that the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee look at the reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act \nnow--not next year, not 3 years from now, but now--to make sure that \nthese kinds of silly bureaucratic activities can no longer go on and \nput the average man and woman and small business people in my State or \nany other State arbitrarily out of business.\n  We saw it go on in Oregon, with the spotted owl--30,000 loggers in \nthe State of Oregon. Now, in my State of Idaho, thousands--yes, \nthousands--of people, small businesses that have existed in one family \nfor over 100 years, are being threatened with their very existence.\n  It is clearly a call to arms. And I think the people of my State \nrecognize that. It is clearly the responsibility of this Congress to \nchange the law, to make it more compatible, to make it more sensitive, \nto put the human species back into the blend of the Endangered Species \nAct so that we at least give some credence to the human species, that \nis the steward of the land, instead of arbitrarily saying to that human \nbeing--that mother, that father, that worker, that logger, that miner, \nthat rancher, that small business person--``Step aside. You are no \nlonger important. Step aside to a plant or an animal.''\n  Since when did this Government become so insensitive to the rights of \nthe human being? Since we have ignored our responsibilities to \nreauthorize the Endangered Species Act, and do these kinds of things \nthat the American people finally in November of last year rose up and \nsaid to the Congress of the United States: ``Become responsive to our \nneeds or step aside and we will find somebody who will.''\n  Well, I certainly hope this Senate recognizes that call and will \nbecome increasingly sensitive to their responsibility to the taxpayer, \nto the citizens, the law-abiding citizens, of our country.\n  Let us start with reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act, so \nthat what is going on in Idaho today and next week and throughout this \ncoming year, and what has gone on in the State of Oregon and other \nplaces around our country will not be repeated again; that we, as \nSenators, who agree to take an oath to uphold the Constitution of the \nUnited States, will do that constitutional duty to put people back into \nthe equation of being responsible for the stewards of our land.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/20/senate-section/article/S1289-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1995\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.
