Madam President, last week, I was very honored to be \nable to attend the funeral in my State of former Congressman Jamie \nWhitten. Congressman Whitten was my good friend and colleague in the \nHouse. I served in the House 6 years before coming to the Senate. \nDuring that time, I got to know him and be with him frequently. Even \nthough I was not on the Appropriations Committee at that time when I \nwas elected to the Senate, I soon became a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, and as irony caused it, I was immediately the chairman of \nthe Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  The day I went on the Agriculture Subcommittee, the Republicans had \nbecome the majority in the Senate and that was my first assignment. \nInterestingly enough, on the House side, Congressman Whitten had been \nthe chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations \n\n[[Page S 13884]]\nSubcommittee since about 1949. He had been in the House only 8 years \nwhen he became chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee for \nAgriculture.\n  So that first year, I recall having the opportunity of going to \nconference with Congressman Whitten chairing the subcommittee on the \nHouse side and I chairing it on the Senate side, both being from the \nsame State. I was very new to the job, and I remember he said to me \nthat day as we began our negotiation on the House-passed and Senate-\npassed appropriations bills funding the Department of Agriculture and \nrelated agencies, ``Thad, you had better be careful what you ask for \nnow; you might get it.''\n  I have never forgotten that. It was an interesting lesson and a good \nthing to tell me because in that position you have to defend what you \nhave recommended; you have to understand that there are going to be \nthose who will look critically at the contents of the bill. And we \nworked very cordially together during those 6 years when I chaired that \nsubcommittee.\n  As I was handling the bill in this Chamber for the last couple of \ndays we have been considering the Agriculture appropriations bill, I \nthought several times about my good friend and former colleague in the \nHouse and the lessons that I learned, which have certainly been good \nlessons to learn.\n  He was a man who was very courteous, very knowledgeable about the \nsubject. In his dealings with other Members of the House and Senate, he \nwas always a gentleman. I respected that and appreciated that in Jamie \nWhitten.\n  When he retired from the House, we truly saw come to an end a \nlegendary career in many ways, not because of length of service, which \nwas longer than anyone had ever served in the House of Representatives, \nbut because of the kind of person he was and the way he did his job. He \ntook it seriously. He was conscientious, he did it well, and he did it \nwell for a long period of time.\n  I was reading editorials just over the last few weeks in our State, \nand there have been many written talking about Congressman Whitten. \nThere were two that I particularly appreciated, and I will put them in \nthe Record. One is from the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal in \nTupelo, and the other was written by Bill Minor, who has a syndicated \npolitical column in Mississippi, and this was printed in the Clarion-\nLedger in Jackson, MS.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that both of these \neditorials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n [From the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, Tupelo, MS, Sept. 12, \n                                 1995]\n\n                    Former Congressman Jamie Whitten\n\n       Jamie Whitten started his public service career when some \n     Mississippians still had eye-witness memories of the Civil \n     War and only dreamed of one day having electricity in their \n     houses. He concluded his public service after a 53-year \n     tenure in the U.S. Congress when many Americans routinely \n     communicate from their homes via computers with people \n     halfway around the world.\n       His journey ends in Charleston, the same small town that \n     nurtured his early political career and always sustained him \n     as the place he called home. It was the place where almost \n     everyone knew him and called him Jamie, not Mr. Chairman or \n     Congressman or any of the other honorifics by which he was \n     addressed in his official capacities. He was, in the words of \n     longtime staff leader Buddy Bishop, ``just one of the guys'' \n     in Charleston. His town, the state, and the nation bid \n     Whitten farewell in a service at Charleston Presbyterian \n     Church, where he had been an active member for almost 70 \n     years.\n       Whitten, 85, died Saturday in an Oxford hospital less than \n     a year after retiring from the U.S. House of Representatives. \n     His 53 years in the House is the record for longevity in that \n     chamber. He is second only to the late Sen. Carl Hayden of \n     Arizona, whose 56 years in the House and Senate combined is \n     Capitol Hill's longest tenure.\n       Whitten was a low-profile giant who thrived on the serious \n     and demanding business of making public policy. His \n     legislative gifts were no place more evident than in federal \n     policy, laws and programs related to improving and enhancing \n     life in rural America. The depth and breadth of his influence \n     and interest inevitably grew as he moved up the ladder of \n     power and responsibility in Washington. The ladder finally \n     took him to the pinnacle chairmanship of the Appropriations \n     Committee.\n       Mississippi's senior senator, Republican Thad Cochran, \n     considered Whitten a congressional mentor and close friend. \n     Cochran said Monday that Whitten possessed the invaluable \n     gift of remaining unhurried and courteous in a political \n     atmosphere that was more often frenetic and sometimes \n     discourteous.\n       Whitten believed in federal investment in America, a \n     practice some people derisively and mistakenly call pork-\n     barrel spending. Whitten often stated his belief in spending \n     federal dollars to generate a return from the productivity of \n     American citizens. That idea always is unpopular with \n     congressmen who don't have the intelligence or the influence \n     to steer a share of the investment to their states and \n     districts. Whitten understood, as he networked with \n     colleagues from coast to coast, that a good investment \n     provides a good return, no matter where it's made.\n       He also understood that the vast resources of the federal \n     government, as a moral imperative, must be applied to people \n     in crisis and people in need.\n       Many other members of Congress in this century have been \n     more widely known, more colorful and more ambitious. A bare \n     handful stand in company with Whitten's impact and influence \n     because, for him, effectiveness was vastly more important \n     than fame.\n       Winston Churchill said that ``singleness of purpose and \n     simplicity of conduct'' are powerful attributes of public \n     servanthood.\n       Those same qualities distinguish Congressman Jamie L. \n     Whitten's long record as the people's representative in \n     Washington.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Clarion-Ledger, Sept. 17, 1995]\n\n         Jamie Whitten Knew Real Power Was in the Purse Strings\n\n                            (By Bill Minor)\n\n       Mississippi's 53-year congressional veteran served his \n     state well.\n       What Jamie Whitten's half-century in the House of \n     Representatives did for the state of Mississippi is \n     incalculable, because it is beyond comparison to any other \n     person who has represented this state or almost any state in \n     the Congress of the United States.\n       Certainly Whitten gave this relatively small state in the \n     whole scheme of things for greater influence--you can call it \n     clout--than it had reason to expect. He made the strongest \n     case for longevity as opposed to the current demand for term \n     limits.\n       In his incredible 53-year service in the U.S. House, \n     Whitten wisely concentrated on the area where the real power \n     lies in Congress, the power of the purse. He long ago staked \n     out a seat on Appropriations, working his way up to the \n     chairmanship in 1980. But for many years before that, he \n     headed the agriculture subcommittee of Appropriations, the \n     spot that earned him the sobriquet as ``the permanent \n     Secretary of Agriculture.'' It was true that Whitten held the \n     purse strings for farm programs as well as a broad spectrum \n     of other programs that were tucked under his wing and the \n     huge agricultural industry of this country knew it. His first \n     concern always was to see that the farm interests of \n     Mississippi were well-served.\n       Whitten, said his onetime Mississippi colleague, former \n     U.S. Rep. David Bowen, ``could digest an appropriation bill \n     faster than anyone'' in Congress. His legendary reading of \n     the fine print in an appropriation bill is what rescued the \n     Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway from the public works graveyard \n     in 1967.\n       Whitten's reputation as the ``mumbler'' when he was \n     handling amendments to complicated appropriations bills, was \n     actually strategy and was done intentionally, says Bowen. \n     ``His speaking style may have seemed obfuscating, says Bowen, \n     ``but he was a very bright man.'' Perhaps he was not \n     outwardly articulate as an orator in comparison to some of \n     his colleagues, but Whitten got the job done.\n       One important thing in light of what has recently come out \n     of the Bob Packwood diaries about the inordinate influence of \n     Washington lobbyists, is that Whitten, with all his power in \n     spending, never had much time for lobbyists.\n       The career of Jamie Whitten is a remarkable story of a \n     small-town Mississippian who started out in Congress as a New \n     Dealer with Franklin Roosevelt a half-century ago. Then be \n     became a Dixiecrat in the 1950s when the Citizens' Council \n     and Ross Barnett were in their heyday. In fact, he was one of \n     the leaders in the anti-civil rights Southern Manifesto in \n     Congress.\n       Back in those days he hardly let it be known back in \n     Mississippi that he was a member of the Democratic Party. But \n     by the late 1960s, Whitten began his transformation to a \n     loyal team player for Democratic programs and eventually \n     became a key cog in pushing liberal programs of the \n     Democratic leadership.\n       While most political figures become more conservative as \n     they grow older, Whitten on the other hand, grew more \n     liberal, or as some close observers believe, he returned to \n     his New Deal populist roots.\n       Yes, Jamie Whitten could be said to have been a pragmatic \n     politician. However, he used the political system to not for \n     his own glory, but in a very real sense for his own state. \n     Essentially, Whitten believed in the fundamental value of the \n     federal government as an instrument for the good of the \n     people.\n       Fortunately, Whitten's best years were in the days before \n     the austerity era became vogue in Congress, and when there \n     was more money available to fund projects such as the Tenn-\n     Tom.\n       It was never his style to dabble in someone else's politics \n     or build a political organization beyond his own small, \n     loose-knit cadre \n\n[[Page S 13885]]\n     of followers. The furthest he ever ventured into statewide politics was \n     once, in 1976, when came down to Jackson to endorse Jimmy \n     Carter for president. That occasion was also his rare (maybe \n     only) exposure to sharp questioning by the state press of \n     Mississippi in a full-fledged news conference. I recall that \n     it was quite an unsettling experience for him.\n       Jamie probably overstayed his time in Congress when his \n     failing health made him no longer productive. Yet, with his \n     passing last week at age 85, everyone in this state must be \n     grateful that he served them so long and so well. It's \n     unthinkable we'll ever see another like him.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/20/senate-section/article/S13883-6", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             WELFARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate concluded several weeks \nof debate on welfare reform legislation. The changes that were \nincorporated in the legislation are profound, marking a great departure \nfrom the system that has been in place for 60 years. As one who has \nserved my State of Rhode Island and this Nation as a U.S. Senator from \n35 of those 60 years, I did not take lightly the vote that I cast \nyesterday. I thought long and hard about the desire for change, for \nreform, and for a better welfare system, and I share all of those \ngoals.\n  As I look at the bill, I remain concerned. It does not provide nearly \nenough of what I think is necessary for quality welfare reform. And it \ndoes not sufficiently protect our children or provide adults with the \ntools they need to move off of welfare and into work.\n  But the final bill was also a drastic improvement over the House \nwelfare legislation, and, with the addition of the Dole-Daschle \ncompromise, moves us more in the direction that I think is best for our \nNation. So while it was with some reluctance, I decided to cast my vote \nin favor of the legislation that was before us yesterday. I did so with \nthe understanding that the American people want and demand action, and \nare seeking a new way of accomplishing what the existing system has not \nbeen able to accomplish. I am willing to try a new way, but acknowledge \nfreely that without the minimal protections put into place by the Dole-\nDaschle agreement with respect to child care and other important \nprovisions, I would not have voted ``yea.''\n  I cannot help but hope that the conference committee will see fit to \nincorporate more of the provisions contained in the Work First proposal \nintroduced by Senator Daschle, which I cosponsored. I still support and \nstrongly prefer its provisions--its emphasis on transitioning welfare \nrecipients to work, its understanding that providing child care is a \nlinchpin of successful reform, and its premise that--despite very real \nabuses of the current system by some welfare recipients--most people \nwant to get off welfare and work at a job that provides a living wage. \nBut I realize that the conference committee is more likely to move this \nbill in a direction that I cannot support, by being more punitive to \nparents and, in the process, harming children who have not chosen their \nparents or their circumstances.\n  Mr. President, it would be my intention, should the bill return from \nthe conference committee stripped of these moderating provisions, or \nincluding any of the more draconian provisions we defeated during the \nSenate debate, to cast my vote against the conference report. I hope \nthat this will not be necessary and that we will be able to pass a \nconference report that really does move the Nation in the direction \nthat we all want to see--toward workable reform that moves this \ngeneration off of dependency while ensuring that the next generation \ndoes not suffer for its parents' failures or misfortunes.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/20/senate-section/article/S13885-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO AMERICAN LEGION AUXILIARY, UNIT 230, PIKE-HUSKA POST\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to certain members \nof the American Legion Auxiliary, Unit 230, Pike-Huska Post in Aurora, \nSD. Governor William Janklow designated the first day of the recent \nSouth Dakota State Fair as ``Victory Day Golden Anniversary \nCelebration'' in honor of South Dakota veterans who served in the \nSecond World War. Ten special women in the American Legion Auxiliary in \nAurora provided South Dakota World War II veterans attending the \ncelebration with tokens of their appreciation and gratitude in memory \nof our veterans' dedicated service.\n  Mr. President, I had the opportunity to join my fellow South Dakotans \nat the State fair in expressing appreciation to the outstanding men and \nwomen who served their country during the Second World War. I am proud \nof the contributions made by South Dakotans during the war years. More \nthan 2,200 South Dakota National Guardsmen served on active duty. More \nthan 41,000 South Dakotans were called into military service through \nthe draft and 23,192 South Dakotans enlisted. More than 1,500 South \nDakotans stood face to face against Hitler's war machine and gave their \nlives to turn back Nazi aggression. At home, South Dakotans dug deep \ninto their pockets to keep American troops armed, fed, and clothed. \nDuring eight national fund-raising campaigns, South Dakota consistently \nranked first or second in the per capita sale of series ``E'' war \nbonds. In fact, South Dakotans raised $111.5 million from the sale of \nseries ``E'' war bonds to help the war effort.\n  Mr. President, as a war veteran myself, having served in the United \nStates Army as a lieutenant in Vietnam, I extend my sincere respect, \nadmiration, and appreciation for the dedicated service and selfless \nsacrifice of South Dakota's Second World War veterans. I especially \nappreciate the 10 members of the American Legion Auxiliary in Aurora, \nSD, who provided on behalf of themselves and all South Dakotans, a \nsmall token of our boundless gratitude for those courageous veterans \nwho answered the call to duty more than 50 years ago.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/20/senate-section/article/S13885-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

The Congress finds that progress on the peace \n     process in the Middle East is vitally important to United \n     States security interests in the region.

Furthermore, the Congress \n     recognizes that an economically and militarily secure Israel \n     serves the security interests of the United States, for a \n     secure Israel is an Israel which has the incentive and \n     confidence to continue pursuing the peace process. Therefore, \n     the Congress declares that, subject to the availability of \n     appropriations, it is the policy and the intention of the \n     United States that the funds provided in annual \n     appropriations for [the Economic Support Fund] economic \n     assistance which are allocated to Israel shall not be less \n     than the annual debt repayment (interest and principal) from \n     Israel to the United States Government in recognition that \n     such a principle serves United States interests in the \n     region.\n    prohibition [concerning abortions] on funding for abortions and \n                       involuntary sterilization\n\n       Sec. 518.

The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Palestine Liberation Organization (hereafter the \n     ``P.L.O.'') has recognized the State of Israel's right to \n     exist in peace and security; accepted United Nations Security \n     Council Resolutions 242 and 338; committed itself to the \n     peace process and peaceful coexistence with Israel, free from \n     violence and all other acts which endanger peace and \n     stability; and assumed responsibility over all P.L.O. \n     elements and personnel in order to assure their compliance, \n     prevent violations, and discipline violators;\n       (2) Israel has recognized the P.L.O. as the representative \n     of the Palestinian people;\n       (3) Israel and the P.L.O. signed a Declaration of \n     Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements (hereafter \n     the ``Declaration of Principles'') on September 13, 1993 at \n     the White House;\n       (4) Israel and the P.L.O. signed an Agreement on the Gaza \n     Strip and the Jericho Area (hereafter the ``Gaza-Jericho \n     Agreement'') on May 4, 1994 which established a Palestinian \n     Authority for the Gaza and Jericho areas;\n       (5) Israel and the P.L.O. signed an Agreement on \n     Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities \n     (hereafter the ``Early Empowerment Agreement'') on August 29, \n     1994 which provided for the transfer to the Palestinian \n     Authority of certain powers and responsibilities in the West \n     Bank outside of the Jericho Area;\n       (6) under the terms of the Declaration of Principles, the \n     Gaza-Jericho Agreement and the Early Empowerment Agreement, \n     the powers and responsibilities of the Palestinian Authority \n     are to be assumed by an elected Palestinian Council with \n     jurisdiction in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in accordance \n     with the Interim Agreement to be concluded between Israel and \n     the P.L.O.;\n       (7) permanent status negotiations relating to the West Bank \n     and Gaza Strip are scheduled to begin by May 1996;\n       (8) the Congress has, since the conclusion of the \n     Declaration of Principles and the P.L.O.'s renunciation of \n     terrorism, provided authorities to the President to suspend \n     certain statutory restrictions relating to the P.L.O., \n     subject to Presidential certifications that the P.L.O. has \n     continued to abide by commitments made in and in connection \n     with or resulting from the good faith implementation of, the \n     Declaration of Principles;\n       (9) the P.L.O. commitments relevant to Presidential \n     certifications have included commitments to renounce and \n     condemn terrorism, to submit to the Palestinian National \n     Council for formal approval the necessary changes to those \n     articles of the Palestinian Covenant which call for Israel's \n     destruction, and to prevent acts of terrorism and hostilities \n     against Israel; and\n       (10) the President, in exercising the aforementioned \n     authorities, has certified to the Congress on four occasions \n     that the P.L.O. was abiding by its relevant commitments.\n\n\n                           sense of congress\n\n       Sec. 603. It is the sense of the Congress that although the \n     P.L.O. has recently shown improvement in its efforts to \n     fulfill its commitments, it must do far more to demonstrate \n     an irrevocable denunciation of terrorism and ensure a \n     peaceful settlement of the Middle East dispute, and in \n     particular it must--\n       (1) submit to the Palestine National Council for formal \n     approval the necessary changes to those articles of the \n     Palestinian National Covenant which call for Israel's \n     destruction;\n       (2) make greater efforts to pre-empt acts of terror, to \n     discipline violators and to contribute to stemming the \n     violence that has resulted in the deaths of 123 Israeli \n     citizens since the signing of the Declaration of Principles;\n       (3) prohibit participation in its activities and in the \n     Palestinian Authority and its successors by any groups or \n     individuals which continue to promote and commit acts of \n     terrorism;\n       (4) cease all anti-Israel rhetoric, which potentially \n     undermines the peace process;\n       (5) confiscate all unlicensed weapons and restrict the \n     issuance of licenses to those with legitimate need;\n       (6) transfer and cooperate in transfer proceedings relating \n     to any person accused by Israel to acts of terrorism; and\n       (7) respect civil liberties, human rights and democratic \n     norms.\n\n\n                authority to suspend certain provisions\n\n       Sec. 604.

and\n       (6) the P.L.O. has exercised its authority resolutely to \n     enact and implement laws requiring the disarming of civilians \n     not specifically licensed to possess or carry weapons.\n       (d) Provisions That May Be Suspended.--The provisions that \n     may be suspended under the authority of subsection (a) are \n     the following:\n       (1) Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2227) as it applies with respect to the P.L.O. or \n     entities associated with it.\n       (2) Section 114 of the Department of State Authorization \n     Act, fiscal years 1984 and 1985 (22 U.S.C. 287e note) as it \n     applies with respect to the P.L.O. or entities associated \n     with it.\n       (3) Section 1003 of the Foreign Relations Authorization \n     Act, fiscal years 1988 and 1989 (22 U.S.C. 5202).\n       (4) Section 37 of the Bretton Woods Agreement Act (22 \n     U.S.C. 286W) as it applies on the granting to the P.L.O. of \n     observer status or other official status at any meeting \n     sponsored by or associated with the International Monetary \n     Fund. As used in this paragraph, the term ``other official \n     status'' does not include membership in the International \n     Monetary Fund.\n       (e) Relevant Congressional Committees Defined.--As used in \n     this title, the term ``relevant congressional committees'' \n     means--\n       (1) the Committee on International Relations, the Committee \n     on Banking and Financial Services, and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives; and\n       (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Foreign Operations, Export \n     Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1996''.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me just say at the outset of our \ndiscussion on the foreign operations bill this year, it appears at \nleast to this point, based on information we have prior to taking up \nthe bill, that this may be the least contentious foreign operations \nbill we have had in recent years. Obviously, that could change as the \nfloor debate unfolds, but I think there is certainly clear potential to \nfinish up this bill either late tonight or tomorrow in accordance with \nwhat the Republican leader hopes which, of course, would give us a \ngreater chance of being out of here for a week the week after next.\n  In 1964, Henry Kissinger commented:\n\n       To rely on the efficacy of diplomacy may lead to disaster \n     but to rely on power with insufficient means is suicide.\n\n  Madam President, today we take up consideration of the appropriations \nbill for foreign operations, export financing, and related programs, a \nbill that provides the means to maintain our role as the sole remaining \nsuperpower. Despite Dr. Kissinger's caution, it is also the bill \neveryone loves to hate.\n  Foreign operations, like every other subcommittee, has struggled to \napportion the substantial reductions in discretionary spending imposed \nby the budget resolution process. Obviously, this is not an easy task, \nand foreign assistance should obviously not be spared the \nresponsibility of making a contribution to balancing the budget.\n  However, unlike other appropriations bills, foreign assistance has \nsteadily declined over the past decade, at a time when both new threats \nand opportunities have emerged. To address these needs has been a \nchallenge for, unlike other accounts, the administration of foreign \nassistance is the exclusive responsibility of the Federal Government. \nThis is not something that can be handed off to the States through a \nblock grant. In fact, I think it could safely be said that this is the \ndiplomacy account, the nonmilitary way to engage with other countries \naround the world, and that is uniquely a responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The bill unanimously reported by the Appropriations Committee \nreflects a $2 billion reduction and is more than 16 percent below the \nPresident's request. The administration asked for $14.7 billion and the \nbill provides $12.3 billion. That is $2.3 billion out of roughly a $1.5 \ntrillion budget. We have tried to balance the distribution of the \nreduction as fairly and evenly as we possibly could while protecting \nand promoting priorities I think most of us share.\n  It is clear foreign aid must be better connected to American \ninterests or we will lose all public support and risk complete \nelimination of resources. Accordingly, we have emphasized those \nprograms which directly serve our economic, security, political, and \nhumanitarian interests. These range from continuing to support the \npeaceful transition to free market democracies in Central Europe and \nthe NIS to expanding our international effort to combat crime and \nnarcotics trafficking.\n  Madam President, let me briefly summarize each of the titles of the \nbill to give everyone a sense of how aid can serve our interests.\n  Title I funds export promotion activities. These programs have a \ndirect--I repeat direct--impact on creating jobs and expanding export \nopportunities. They enjoy bipartisan support as well as the endorsement \nof a wide range of commercial and manufacturing interests including \nlabor unions, Fortune 500 companies, and small businesses.\n  It is no wonder since estimates provided from the private sector as \nwell as the administration suggest that 300,000 jobs and 40 percent of \nour economic growth are linked to export activities.\n  The committee has provided $795 million to the Export-Import Bank, \nslightly over the House and last year's level, but well below the needs \nas reflected in the request.\n  We have fully funded the OPIC request. Credit reforms laws require \nthe bill to indicate the amount of basic subsidy which funds OPIC \nactivities. However, it is worth pointing out that while we subsidize \nOPIC, the corporation is completely self-sufficient. While we provide \n$79 million in subsidy, OPIC is expected to generate over $200 million \nthis year which is returned to the Treasury.\n  The third agency involved in export promotion is the Trade \nDevelopment Agency which is funded at the House level of $40 million, a \nsizable cut from the request of $67 million. TDA's principal \nresponsibility is conducting feasibility studies and while important, \nthere is not as immediate and direct an impact on jobs and exports as \nwith the sister agencies.\n  One of the most important initiatives the subcommittee included in \nthe treatment of economic assistance is the construction of title II. \nWe have consolidated a number of development and economic accounts into \na $2.1 billion account with very few earmarks. Traditional earmarks for \nthe following programs have been eliminated: the Economic Support Fund, \ndevelopment assistance, the Development Fund for Africa, child \nsurvival, basic education, the Africa Development Foundation, the \nInter-American Foundation, and the Ireland Fund.\n  I am not suggesting that these activities will not be funded. All the \nnecessary statutory authorities to conduct these programs are \npreserved. But, the bill gives the President the flexibility to make \nthe decision on the levels and the administration of programs.\n  My preference would have been to simply provide a sum for the \nPresident to allocate in accordance with emerging priorities. However, \nthe ranking member, along with other members, expressed the concern \nthat one account might bear the entire burden of the overall reduction.\n  To accommodate this concern, we have included language that requires \na proportional distribution of the reduction. This means that accounts \nsuch as development assistance and the Development Fund for Africa will \nbe smaller than last year, but they will each have approximately the \nsame share of overall resources available this year as they have in the \npast.\n  Since this is not an absolute mathematical formula, some flexibility \nis maintained. And, so far, we have avoided the detailed \nmicromanagement of specific activities which must be carried out within \nthe broader accounts. We have avoided the inclination of past years to \ndirect funding levels for community colleges, museums and other special \ninterest projects.\n  Obviously, the Senate can decide to divide up the economic assistance \naccount affording no flexibility at all to the President. I am not \nopposed to considering earmarks or recommendations on spending \npriorities, but I would urge each Member to carefully consider the \nimpact of beginning to further carve up this small pie.\n  In addition to this broad category of economic aid, we have funded \nprograms in the Middle East, Central Europe, and the NIS--regions I \nthink most view as central to our security interests. We have fully \nfunded the Camp David countries and included, once again, an earmark \nfor resettling refugees in Israel.\n  The bill provides $335 million to support programs in Central Europe \nand $705 million for the New Independent States. Within the NIS account \nI have \n\n[[Page S 13901]]\nearmarked the following: $17.1 million for the FBI for law enforcement \ntraining and investigations.\n With 5,000 organized criminal enterprises expanding their activities \ninto nuclear smuggling and areas of operations to our shores, our \nsecurity interests compel an active role for the FBI in the region.\n\n  Thirty million dollars is earmarked for Georgia, where democracy is \ntruly under siege.\n  Eighty-five million dollars is earmarked for Armenia to mitigate the \nseverity of the economic consequences of the war and the blockade. \nArmenia has carried out important political and economic reforms in the \npast year but continues to need assistance to complete the transition.\n  Another country that I have had a longstanding interest in, going \nback to the dissolution of the Soviet Union: $225 million is earmarked \nfor Ukraine with subearmarks to address the urgent priorities of \nstrengthening the private sector and developing energy self-\nsufficiency. Although the administration has come around to the view \nthat Ukraine has a uniquely important role to play in regional \nstability, levels of aid and the kinds of activities AID have been \nwilling to undertake lag far behind requirements.\n  The sum of $15 million is set aside for a Trans-caucasus Enterprise \nFund, which will complete congressional plans to have each region \nbenefit from this innovative aid approach.\n  The NIS section also preserves the option of transferring resources \nto the Peace Corps to sustain their very successful efforts. Overall, \nthe Peace Corps is spared the 16 percent reduction imposed on other \nprograms and is cut roughly 8.5 percent to $200 million.\n  I might say that the occupant of the chair is, of course, a former \ndirector of the Peace Corps and has been an aggressive advocate for the \nPeace Corps and its programs. He has certainly made his views known to \nme as I worked to put together the chairman's mark.\n  Although this is a popular program I cannot understand why we need \n149 volunteers in the Dominican Republic. In Africa, we saw an 18 \npercent increase from 1994 to 1995, bringing the number of volunteers \nup to 2,442. Unfortunately, the days of expanding programs are over.\n  Title II also funds our international efforts to combat crime, \nterrorism and narcotics trafficking. As I mentioned earlier, I think \nthese are issues which every American understands has a direct impact \non our Nation's interests. In restoring public confidence that our aid \nserves our interests, the committee has increased support for these \nactivities.\n  Finally title II provides $490 million in operating expenses for AID. \nEach committee which has reported legislation on AID has recommended \ndifferent levels of support. My recommendation is based on a recent GAO \nstudy which indicated the House authorization and appropriations levels \nwould not be adequate to cover the cost associated with RIF's, closing \nmissions and other measures to streamline AID's programs.\n  According to the GAO, $490 million will require significant actions \non AID's\n part to eliminate program duplication, close overseas missions, cut \npersonnel and otherwise accelerate streamlining and consolidation. But, \nlet me be clear. This level will not compel consolidation.\n\n  Although I have supported the two attempts to pass legislation to \ncarry out consolidation of AID and the State Department, the \nAdministration has indicated it will veto any legislation which forces \nthe reorganization of the executive branch without its consent. Given \nthis unresolved situation, it did not seem appropriate for the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee to move ahead of the authorization committee \nand include in a spending bill reorganization or activities not \ndirected by law in legislation.\n  The rest of the news about the bill is bleak. Title III, security \nassistance is below the House level and the request. I think this is \nunfortunate, but a direct function of the budget reality.\n  Title III does provide authority to transfer funds from the European \nand NIS accounts to support the Warsaw Initiative. I think there is \nstrong bipartisan support for accelerating the integration of former \nWarsaw Pact members into NATO through joint exercises and training and \nimproving military interoperability. The transfer authority provided \nshould relieve some of the pressure on the security assistance account.\n  Finally, title IV, the multilateral programs, are the hardest hit of \nall accounts. With three exceptions, the World Bank, International \nFinance Corporation, and the Inter-American Development Bank, we have \nnot been able to fund existing commitments. Just one example tells the \nstory. The request for IDA is $1.3 billion of which we only funded $775 \nmillion.\n  International organizations and programs were also drastically \nreduced from the request of $425 million to $260 million. Frankly, this \nis an account which has as many strong supporters as it does vocal \ndetractors. There are some clear examples of international agencies \nwhich have effectively served international interests, such as the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. But, there are just as many with \nsloppy management, guilty of waste, fraud, and abuses. The committee \nhas not earmarked levels of support for programs within IO and P with \nthe view that contributions will offer the administration the \nopportunity to leverage management reforms. No agency is exempt from \nthe urgency of reform and I include one of our collective favorites, \nUNICEF, in that category.\n  Let me now turn to Senator Leahy for his comments. I would like to \npoint out that the report takes note of the ranking member's dedicated \nservice to victims of landmines by establishing the Patrick J. Leahy \nWar Victims Fund. This was a program established several years ago to \naid the recovery and rehabilitation of the thousands of people injured \nby antipersonnel mines. Senator Leahy deserves special recognition for \nhis effort in this area which the committee acknowledged by renaming \nthe program in his honor.\n  Let me also say it has been a pleasure to work with my colleague from \nVermont. Before I turn to him, let me mention one other item.\n  I think, Mr. President, Members of the Senate would be interested \nthat earlier today the Central and East European Coalition held a press \nconference urging quick passage of this legislation. This coalition, \ncomprising 18 grassroots organizations representing 22 million \nAmericans, strongly support this legislation.\n  I want to emphasize that because I think it is frequently thought by \nmany that nobody in America gives a hoot about foreign assistance. In \nfact, there are many Americans who came from somewhere else, or their \nancestors did, who care deeply about this part of the Federal budget.\n  The Central and Eastern European Coalition represents 18 of those \ngroups. They are very active in promoting better relations, \nstrengthened relations between the United States and the various \ncountries from which they come.\n  Mr. President, before turning the floor over to Senator Leahy for his \nopening comments, I ask unanimous consent that the statements of the \ncoalition be printed in the Record at this point and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Coalition Urges Greater U.S. Focus on Central and East Europe\n\n  (Statement by Eugene Iwanciw, Washington Office Director; Ukrainian \n                           Association, Inc.)\n\n       The Central and East European Coalition (CEEC), comprising \n     18 national grassroots organizations representing 22 million \n     Americans who trace their heritage to that part of the world, \n     applauds Chairman Mitch McConnell (R-KY) for his leadership \n     in drafting a foreign assistance bill which provides much \n     needed support for the countries of Central and East Europe. \n     We are particularly pleased that the Senator and the \n     Committee have focused additional attention on the non-\n     Russian nations of the former Soviet Union, particularly \n     Ukraine and Armenia.\n       The Coalition strongly believes that the long-term national \n     security and budget interests of the United States require a \n     strong commitment to the transition of Central and East \n     European countries to fully democratic and free market \n     nations. That commitment requires an active U.S. engagement \n     in that part of the world.\n       The Central and East European Coalition believes that \n     peace, stability, and democracy throughout Europe serve the \n     national security interests of the United States. In this \n     century, the United States was called upon to fight two world \n     wars and a 45-year cold war--conflicts which emanated from \n     the heart of Europe--in the furtherance of those vital \n     geopolitical interests. The institutionalization of democracy \n     and market \n\n[[Page S 13902]]\n     economies in Central and East Europe is the best means of guaranteeing \n     that there will be no further European conflicts which will \n     entangle the United States. We believe that with the collapse \n     of communism and the Soviet Union, the objectives of peace, \n     stability, and democracy in Europe are achievable. For those \n     objectives to be achieved, however, requires the continued \n     engagement, support, and assistance of the United States and \n     the West.\n       Since the signing of the Camp David Accords, the United \n     States has wisely supported the peace process in the Middle \n     East. That long-term commitment is now paying dividends with \n     increased stability throughout that region of the world. \n     Similarly, the strengthening of democracy and market \n     economies in the countries of Central and East Europe will \n     require a long-term commitment by the United States. Forty-\n     five to seventy-five years of communist oppression and \n     tyranny cannot be eradicated overnight.\n       Continued United States engagement in Central and East \n     Europe must take various forms. The most visible is our \n     foreign assistance. While we had hoped that the \n     Administration's overall funding levels would be accepted by \n     the Congress, we were particularly distressed by the severe \n     cuts that\n      House of Representatives made in the programs for Central \n     and East Europe, particularly in the Freedom Support Act \n     (FSA). We commend the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign \n     Operations, under Chairman McConnell's leadership, for \n     restoring many of those cuts and we urge the Senate to \n     adopt the levels of funding for FSA and SEED contained in \n     the bill as reported from the Appropriations Committee. We \n     especially applaud the attention which Senator McConnell \n     and the Committee have given to the non-Russian nations \n     considered part of the New Independent States (NIS). For \n     the past three years, the bulk of assistance to the NIS \n     went to Russia. This bill provides U.S. policy with the \n     balance it should have in our dealings with the nations of \n     Central and East Europe.\n       Secondly, our engagement demands involvement in the \n     security issues of the region. We believe that the general \n     stability and security of the region can best be accomplished \n     through the expansion of NATO to include all the nations of \n     the region who desire to join the alliance and meet the \n     criteria for membership. For that reason, we strongly support \n     the funding for the Warsaw Initiative and the NATO \n     Participation amendment which Senator Hank Brown (R-CO) will \n     offer during floor consideration of the Foreign Assistance \n     Appropriations Act.\n       Thirdly, we believe that the U.S. assistance should focus \n     on those countries which have demonstrated progress in the \n     establishment of democratic institutions and market reforms \n     as well as respect for basic human rights. That criteria must \n     also include a commitment not to hinder international \n     humanitarian relief efforts. For that reason, we endorse the \n     Humanitarian Corridor Act which Senate Majority Leader Robert \n     Dole (R-KS) will offer as an amendment to the Appropriations \n     Act during Senate floor consideration. This amendment would \n     suspend assistance to any country which hinders U.S. \n     humanitarian relief efforts to a third country.\n       Fourthly, as U.S. assistance to this important part of the \n     world is unfortunately reduced, it is vital that the U.S. \n     Agency for International Development (USAID) maximize the \n     impact of every dollar of assistance. For far too long we \n     have heard about waste, inefficiencies, and fraud in these \n     programs. It is time to take the Beltway Bandits off the \n     public dole and to work through organizations with both an \n     understanding of the region and a demonstrated, long-term \n     commitment to the establishment of democratic and free market \n     institutions in the countries of Central and East Europe. In \n     the six years since the Berlin Wall came down, USAID has been \n     unable to institute these reforms so we call upon the \n     Congress to take the initiative in reforming the delivery of \n     U.S. foreign assistance.\n       Finally, an aspect of our engagement in Central and East \n     Europe involves the flow of information and ideas to the \n     peoples of Central and East Europe. For five decades, the \n     United States has provided the peoples of this region with \n     timely and accurate information through the Voice of America \n     (VOA) and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). These \n     programs are as vital today as they were during the communist \n     period. Democracy is still in its infancy in most, if not \n     all, of the nations of Central and East Europe. Few, if any, \n     of these countries have a firmly-established independent \n     media, particularly electronic media. Today, VOA and RFE/RL \n     are playing critical roles in the establishment of democracy \n     throughout the region. Last year the Congress enacted \n     legislation which brings better coordination to the work of \n     the two broadcasting services. This has resulted in \n     substantial savings in the FY 1996 budget. It would, however, \n     be a major mistake to reduce the budget of the broadcasting \n     services below the levels currently in the Commerce, Justice, \n     State, and Judiciary Appropriations Act and the Coalition \n     strongly opposes any such effort.\n       The United States spent hundreds of billions of dollars to \n     win the Cold War. It would be tragic were the United States \n     to lose the peace through short-sighted policies and \n     illusionary budgetary savings. An investment in democracy \n     building today will pay dividends through long-term security \n     and reduced military expenditures for the United States.\n       In conclusion, the Central and East European Coalition \n     urges the Senate to approve the Foreign Assistance \n     Appropriations Act with the Committee approved spending \n     levels for FSA and SEED, to adopt the NATO Participation and \n     Humanitarian Corridors amendments, to oppose any efforts to \n     reduce funding for VOA and RFE/RL in the Commerce-Justice \n     Appropriations Act, and to begin reforming USAID to insure \n     that our foreign assistance is used effectively and \n     efficiently. We especially urge the House conferees to accept \n     these provisions during the House-Senate conference on the \n     bills.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                Coalition Urges Rapid Expansion of NATO\n\n (Statement by Frank Koszorus, Jr., Member of the Executive Committee; \n                     Hungarian American Coalition)\n\n       The Central and East European Coalition applauds the \n     leadership of Senator Hank Brown (R-Col.) who, along with \n     strong bipartisan support, will offer the NATO Participation \n     amendment to the Foreign Assistance Appropriations Act. \n     Senator Brown's Amendment will establish a process to \n     facilitate the expansion of NATO in a manner that will \n     advance vital U.S. geopolitical interests in Europe and \n     preserve its leadership role in the world.\n       The Coalition is concerned with the glacial pace of NATO's \n     expansion. The collapse of the Soviet Union has left a \n     dangerous security vacuum in Central and Eastern Europe. That \n     region must be rapidly reintegrated with the West to provide \n     it with a sense of security and to shore up the new \n     democracies. Rapid expansion of NATO to include countries \n     which are committed to the concepts of democracy, market \n     economies, civilian control of the military and human and \n     minority rights would serve this objective as well as the \n     foreign policy interests of the United States by ensuring \n     Europe's overall stability.\n       The United States cannot afford to turn its attention away \n     from the Central and Eastern European countries. Success in \n     their transition to pluralism and democracy will validate the \n     many sacrifices we made to win the Cold War. Failure will \n     ensure a new world order far less congenial to our interests.\n       The adverse consequences of our withdrawal from Europe at \n     critical times in the past fill history books. Had we reacted \n     firmly to the turmoil threatening peace in Europe prior to \n     the First and Second World Wars, many American lives and \n     resources would have been spared. Similarly, the Cold War \n     would have been far less expensive and dangerous had we not \n     pulled back from the heart of Europe and had we resisted \n     domestic pressure to ``bring the boys home'' before the \n     European political order had been settled. As George F. \n     Kennan wrote in 1950, ``history does not forgive us our \n     national mistakes because they are explicable in terms of \n     domestic policies.''\n       Today, we must not permit Central and East Europe to \n     languish in a security vacuum. Russian interests are not \n     threatened by the expansion of a defensive alliance. \n     Moreover, stability and economic growth on the Western \n     borders of Russia can only benefit Moscow.\n       Russia should not be isolated and mechanisms, such as a \n     treaty between NATO and Russia, would dispel any lingering \n     concerns Moscow may entertain about an enlarged NATO. Russia, \n     however, should under no circumstances be permitted to veto \n     NATO's enlargement. Western appeasement and indecisiveness \n     will encourage Russian nationalists to assert expansionist \n     tendencies and cause the U.S. and the West to lose \n     credibility. Russia itself is in a fluid state with voices of \n     nascent imperialism being heard with greater frequency. \n     Yeltsin's harsh outburst in Budapest last year and his even \n     more disquieting threats following NATO's bombing missions in \n     Bosnia, vividly demonstrate the perils of procrastination.\n       Continued Western hesitation in expanding NATO would redraw \n     the lines imposed by Stalin and signal Russian imperialists \n     that they, in fact, enjoy a ``sphere of influence'' in \n     Central and Eastern Europe. This ill-advised policy would be \n     contrary to U.S. geopolitical interests in a stable, secure, \n     unified, and democratic Europe.\n       Having won the Cold War, the United States should not \n     prematurely retreat from the challenges posed by Central and \n     Eastern Europe, if only to avoid being drawn back into \n     exacerbated controversies. Expansion of NATO to include \n     countries which desire to join the alliance and meet the \n     criteria of NATO membership is an inexpensive yet vital \n     insurance policy for the United States.\n       Senator Brown's amendment is a welcome first step in this \n     direction. It must be followed by concrete steps, eligibility \n     lists, criteria, and unambiguous timetables in 1996. As we \n     approach the 21st Century, we simply cannot afford to \n     squander a historic opportunity to safeguard peace and \n     democracy.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Coalition Urges Senate Passage of the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act\n\n   (Statement by Timothy Jemal, Director of Congressional Relations, \n                     Armenian Assembly of America)\n\n       First, we want to compliment Chairman McConnell for his \n     leadership in drafting a bill that gives prominent support to \n     the states of Central and Eastern Europe. We are particularly \n     pleased that Senator McConnell and the committee are \n     strengthening U.S. support for the non-Russian New \n     Independent States (NIS), in spite of an overall reduction in \n     funding. This redirection in resources \n\n[[Page S 13903]]\n     will make a tangible and permanent contribution to the bold reforms \n     taking place in such countries as Armenia and Ukraine. In \n     spite of this overall shift, U.S. aid to the states of \n     Central and Eastern Europe continues to be reduced, requiring \n     maximum efficiency in the use of U.S. foreign assistance. It \n     is this objective that is embraced in legislation supported \n     by our Coalition and rapidly moving towards enactment.\n       Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-KS), Senator Paul Simon \n     (D-IL), along with a bipartisan group of Senators including \n     Chairman McConnell, will offer the humanitarian Aid Corridor \n     Act (S. 230) on the Senate floor as a amendment to the \n     Foreign Operations Appropriations bill (H.R. 1868). The 18 \n     member organizations of the Central and East European \n     Coalition strongly urge the Senate to take quick, decisive \n     action--in support of the Dole/Simon amendment. This \n     legislation espouses the fundamental principle that the \n     United States should not provide assistance to any country \n     which deliberately prevents the transport of American \n     humanitarian assistance through its borders. The U.S. cannot \n     expect to meet the need for budget austerity and achieve \n     important foreign policy goals without the cooperation of our \n     allies.\n       The relevant committees in the Senate and the House have \n     fully debated the bill and expressed clear, bipartisan \n     support. On May 12, the House International Relations \n     Committee approved the Corridor Act by a 27-7 vote. On June \n     7, the same bill was again approved by the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee in a convincing 14-4 vote. To illustrate \n     the genuine bipartisan nature of the bill, it was California \n     Senator Dianne Feinstein who successfully offered Senator \n     Dole's bill as an amendment before the Foreign Relations \n     Committee. In addition, the Democrats on the Foreign \n     Relations Committee voted unanimously for the Corridor Act. \n     For the third time, the provision was approved by the House \n     Foreign Operations Subcommittee on June 8, and retained in \n     H.R. 1868 when it passed the House by a 333-89 vote.\n       Currently, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are \n     undergoing radical political and economic reforms to \n     institutionalize democracy and free markets. The success of \n     these reform programs will bring peace, security and \n     stability to the region. The Coalition will continue to work \n     toward securing the integration of our ancestral homelands \n     into the western political, economic and defense structures. \n     We oppose any obstacle or impediment to furthering this \n     integration process and especially deplore the use of \n     inhumane methods to prevent any nation of Central and Eastern \n     Europe from having access to U.S. humanitarian aid. It simply \n     does not make sense that the United States should provide aid \n     to one nation which in turn denies U.S. humanitarian \n     assistance to another state. We are firmly united in our view \n     that U.S. assistance should be delivered in the most humane, \n     cost-effective, fiscally responsible manner. This cannot be \n     achieved when borders are closed to thwart U.S. assistance to \n     people in need.\n       Senator Dole's amendment does not single out or exempt any \n     country. All recipients of U.S. assistance will be held to \n     the same standard, including such countries as Turkey, which \n     has imposed an illegal and immoral blockade on Armenia since \n     April of 1993. This blockade has resulted in slowing delivery \n     of U.S. aid shipments while skyrocketing the transportation \n     costs. Most importantly, the blockade has often precluded the \n     safe delivery of vitally needed U.S. humanitarian assistance.\n       The Coalition believes that it is unconscionable for any \n     recipient of U.S. aid to use the denial of food, medicines \n     and other essential humanitarian needs as a political weapon. \n     The United States should demand that its allies maintain a \n     simple, humane policy that allows U.S. assistance to flow \n     through open corridors. As taxpayers, we are rightfully \n     indignant that the U.S. government would provide hundreds of \n     millions of dollars to a country denying aid to suffering \n     people. There is no more cruel and cynical policy than a \n     government directive to block humanitarian assistance to the \n     most vulnerable people for political or strategic ends. That \n     any recipient of U.S. aid would do so is unacceptable to this \n     Coalition.\n       We applaud Senators Dole and Simon for their leadership on \n     this issue. The amendment is truly bipartisan, and a \n     necessary element in strengthening American credibility \n     abroad.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                  Coalition Urges Reform of U.S.A.I.D.\n\n (Statement by Avo E. Ora, Director of Public Relations, Joint Baltic \n                      American National Committee)\n\n       Today, the Central and East European Coalition is united \n     not only in our support for increasing foreign aid funding, \n     we are also united in our demands for the effective use of \n     these resources. Increased funding will not advance our \n     national security interests nor Central and East European \n     development if the funds continue to be wasted on short-term, \n     less-than-efficient programs.\n       The end of the Cold War provided the US with the \n     opportunity to reshape Europe as the Marshall plan reshaped \n     war-ravaged Europe in 1947. America's present policy goals \n     are similar to the goals outlined under the plan--we seek to \n     facilitate and secure democratic and economic gains in post-\n     Soviet nations, resulting in a stable and secure Europe.\n       Unfortunately, the US Agency for International Development \n     did not seize this opportunity and conducted business as \n     usual. Grants have generally shifted from Central America to \n     Central Europe but continued to be implemented by generic \n     developmental, fee-for-service contractors who generally lack \n     interest, knowledge and long-term commitment to the region. \n     Although some long-term, goal-specific USAID programs were \n     successfully implemented, they were more an exception than \n     the norm. The result is a characterization of US assistance \n     as wasteful by Congress, the targeted states, and most \n     damaging of all, by the American people.\n       How can we increase the sustainable development and \n     effectiveness of foreign aid? The answer lies in our \n     recommendations for the use of Region Specific Organizations \n     in aid implementation and a more open and accountable grant \n     procedure. These suggestions evolved from our efforts to \n     guarantee the efficient and wise use of US taxypayer dollars.\n       Our first recommendation is the use of organizations that \n     have historic ties and long-term commitments to the countries \n     of Central Europe and the New Independent States. These \n     Region Specific Organizations, including many in our ethnic \n     communities, have high standards of professionalism, an \n     intimate knowledge of the political, economic and social \n     conditions in a given country, and language capabilities \n     which others lack.\n       Our second recommendation calls for the public disclosure \n     of specific tasks, goals, and funding levels of USAID \n     contracts, insuring an open and fair process for awarding \n     contracts and grants, and simplifying the contracting process \n     to facilitate smaller Region Specific organizations. \n     Recently, USAID's lack of planning and commitment became \n     apparent when USAID attempted to unilaterally reduce funding \n     for Armenia in fiscal year 1996. In addition, USAID failed to \n     submit a strategy paper for public comment. We strongly \n     recommend that USAID country strategy papers be subject to \n     comment by the NGO and PVO community.\n       The Coalition contrasts the wasteful, region-wide spending \n     practices of USAID, with the country specific contracting \n     processes of the National Endowment for Democracy and the US \n     Information Agency which result in much greater, quicker and \n     more effective assistance to these countries. Moreover, these \n     smaller agencies which have had and will continue to have a \n     long-term commitment to democracy and free market reform in \n     the region, have contracting processes which are ``user \n     friendly'' to RSO's, such as those represented by the \n     coalition.\n       Aid for Central Europe and the New Independent States were \n     designed to be temporary. This finite time frame for \n     assistance only increases our desire for effective programs. \n     Estonia is already slated for USAID ``graduation'' in 1996--\n     other nations are on the chopping bloc for 1997. While we \n     agree that US assistance should promote self-sufficiency and \n     not dependency, this goal is not being pursued by government \n     programs before or after ``graduation''. Estonia, for \n     example, called for ``trade, not aid'' but now finds itself \n     locked out of scientific and technical exchanges that would \n     facilitate economic development.\n       The United States has long-term strategic interests and \n     needs in the region of Central and East Europe. Thus, it is \n     vitally important that all US assistance programs be designed \n     and implemented in such a fashion as to further those \n     strategic interests and needs. We echo the calls to reform \n     foreign aid made by Chairman McConnell and his Committee. \n     After three years of the Administration's failure to address \n     these problems, the Coalition calls on Congress to take the \n     lead in a top-to-bottom reform of USAID.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I compliment Senator McConnell for the job \nhe has done in putting this bill together. Having served for 6 years as \nchairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, and maybe for a dozen \nor more years before that as a member of the committee, I know how \ndifficult it is to put this bill together. He and I, and our staffs, \nhave worked closely on this. I think we have the makings of a bill the \nPresident can sign.\n  We have a time, as we know, when many of our fellow Senators, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, favor cutting foreign aid even further than \nit has already been cut in recent years. Senator McConnell has defended \nthe need for foreign aid to protect U.S. interests around the world. I \njoined him in that. But, despite efforts by both of us to obtain a \nhigher budget allocation for foreign operations, foreign operations \nwhich, like defense, is uniquely the responsibility of a Federal \nGovernment, our budget has been slashed. Today we see the consequences.\n  This bill represents nearly a $1.2 billion cut below the fiscal 1995 \nlevel; a $2.4 billion cut below the President's fiscal year 1996 \nrequest.\n  Had I written this bill this year I might have done some things \ndifferently. But neither Senator McConnell nor I could have avoided \nserious damage because the money simply is not there. We ought to stop, \nand think, as a country. If we continue down this path in a very few \nyears the United States, which today is the only superpower in the \nworld, will have no money to carry out foreign policy other than to \nfight wars. We do not have the kind of money to stop a problem from \nhappening. Yet we can come in with billions after the problem occurs, \nto fight a war.\n  There is not going to be money for peacekeeping, none for supporting \neconomic development in countries that hold great promise for American \nexports. The jobs that we create here in the United States, preparing \nitems for exports--those exports are going more to the developing world \nthan to the developed world. Our increase in exports is to the \ndeveloping world but we are not going to have money to support economic \ndevelopment of those parts of the world.\n  We will end up abandoning the World Bank, the United Nations. Then we \nwill stand back and watch Japan and our other allies fill the void. And \nthey will, because they are anxious to do so, because they know the \nlong-term economic and political benefits are enormous.\n  We would be terribly shortsighted now, at the end of the cold war, \nwhen the United States stands as the economic and military giant of the \nworld, if we just gave away our preeminence by nickel and diming the \nprograms that might sustain it.\n  I do want to mention a couple of provisions of the bill which I \nbelieve stand between us and the President's signature. I have heard \nfrom several Senators about these provisions, including the ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, who mentioned \nthem at the committee markup.\n  One is the provision relating to Korea. I am sympathetic to the \nchairman's goals, but I am told by the administration as a practical \nmatter this would prevent the United States from contributing to KEDO. \nIf we want this bill to get signed, we are going to have to \nsubstantially modify this provision. I am told our staffs are already \nmaking progress on them.\n  Another is the provision which would cut off all aid to Russia if it \nproceeds to the sale of nuclear equipment to Iran. On the merits, I am \nin complete agreement with this. I think of Iran as a pariah nation \nfostering terrorism, showing complete disregard for human rights, and \ncertainly unwilling to carry out its obligations as a member of the \nworld community. But I also want to be sure that either here or in \nconference we modify this provision so we do not jeopardize a program \nvery much in our national interest.\n  And, finally, I note that the subcommittee voted 8 to 5 for my \namendment to strike restrictive House language on funding for \ninternational population programs. I have to assume there is going to \nbe an amendment to restore that language here on the floor, but I \nemphasize this bill continues the prohibition of funding for abortion \nthat we have had for years. It also prohibits the use of any United \nStates funds in China. Further restrictions along the lines of what the \nHouse has proposed could invite a veto.\n  Now, this bill should not take a lot of the Senate's time unless \npeople want to make debating points rather than policy points. We have \nalready had an opportunity to debate the State Department authorization \nbill when many of the foreign policy issues were discussed. There is no \nreason to repeat that episode in this bill. I hope that we will dispose \nof any amendments and dispose of them quickly if amendments come up \nthat basically just ask us to retrod the ground we have already walked \non in this session.\n  As I said, I will put a longer statement in the Record, but I do want \nto say how much I appreciate the bipartisan way Senator McConnell and \nhis staff approached this process. I think it bodes well to get this on \nto the President's desk.\n  Mr. President, despite Senator McConnell's and my best efforts, this \nbill poses major challenges for the United States as the world's only \nsuperpower. At a time when the global threats to our security are too \nnumerous to mention, funding to combat those threats is increased in \nonly one area, export assistance, and even there it falls short of the \nPresident's request.\n  In other areas it makes unprecedented cuts in programs that seek to \nfight poverty, promote economic growth, reduce population growth rates, \nstop the spread of infectious diseases, care for growing numbers of \ndestitute refugees, combat ocean pollution, the destruction of \nbiodiversity and other environmental degradation, deter the \nproliferation of conventional and nuclear weapons, and countless other \nproblems that directly threaten every American.\n  Again, this is despite the considerable efforts Senator McConnell and \nI have made to spread the pain that the cuts in our allocation \nrequired.\n  Let me mention some specific programs, and what we have done.\n  For the first time, the bill consolidates all development assistance \nand non-Middle East economic support funds. This means, for example, \nthat the Development Fund for Africa no longer exists in this bill as a \nseparate account, and neither does population. There are no longer \nseparate appropriations for the Inter-American Foundation or the \nAfrican Development Foundation.\n  Frankly, this concerns me. The Development Fund for Africa has \nexisted for almost a decade, and a population account since 1967. The \nDFA was created, in large part, to protect this extraordinarily \nvulnerable, poorest region in the world, and it has served its purpose \nwell. We need to be sure that whatever we end up with in conference \nadequately protects Africa in the future.\n  Having said that, in order to minimize the possibility that any of \nthese accounts or programs are disproportionately hurt when cuts are \nmade, at my request Senator McConnell agreed to include a provision \nthat requires that the cuts be made on a proportional basis, reflecting \neach program's current percentage of the fiscal year \n\n[[Page S 13905]]\n1995 level of funding for these combined accounts. Therefore, if in \nfiscal year 1995 the Development Fund for Africa received 15 percent of \nthe total appropriation for these combined accounts, then Africa will \nreceive 15 percent of the total appropriation for these accounts in \nfiscal year 1996. Again, I know some people have concerns that we \nshould preserve the DFA intact, and we will revisit this issue in \nconference.\n  I know the same is said of the population account, and there are \nstrong desires in both the House and Senate to maintain current levels \nof funding for child survival and microenterprise lending programs. As \na longtime supporter of these programs I completely sympathize, but \npeople need to recognize that we cannot do everything we once did and \nat the same time cut $1.2 billion from this bill. I believe our first \naim should be to ensure that each program is treated as fairly as \npossible when cuts are made.\n  I want to note my concern about two other aspects of the \nconsolidation approach. First, I do not believe it is wise to include \nESF in the new economic assistance account. Interestingly, neither the \nState Department nor AID is happy with this approach. The danger I see \nis that funds that have been traditionally used for development \nprograms will be increasingly tapped for ESF-type activities. I think \nit is predictable that, particularly in emergency situations, the State \nDepartment's concern for addressing short-term political crises will \ntake precedence over long-term development goals.\n  I am also concerned about the fate of the IAF and ADF. While I \nrecognize that budget constraints force us to make difficult choices, I \nwant to know what the practical effect will be of leaving it up to AID \nto channel fund to these organizations.\n  There is a somewhat similar proportionality provision with respect to \nthe international organizations and programs account, which is cut \nseverely in this bill from $374 million in fiscal year 1995 to $260 \nmillion in fiscal year 1996. The provision requires that funding for \nseveral named organizations shall not be reduced below their \nproportional share of the current level of funding for the IOP account. \nMy strong hope is that in the conference we can increase funding for \nthese programs so we can maintain our leadership in them, especially \nthose that are headed by Americans.\n  The multilateral development banks were also cut deeply. Although our \ncontributions to these institutions reflect pledges we made in the \ncontext of international negotiations, we have not lived up to those \ncommitments. I am very concerned that this year we add hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in arrears to the hundreds of millions of dollars \nin arrears we have already accumulated. My amendment in the \nsubcommittee markup to add another $200 million for the International \nDevelopment Association, $20 million for the Global Environment \nFacility, and $20 million for the Inter-American Development Bank's \nFund for Special Operations, was accepted by Senator McConnell. \nHowever, this still falls far short of our commitments to the first two \nof these institutions, which directly support U.S. economic and \nenvironmental interests.\n  I was disappointed that we were unable to provide a contribution to \nthe North American Development Bank which will provide funding to \naddress acute environmental problems along the Mexico-United States \nborder. However, I am hopeful that some of the funding in this bill for \nthe Multilateral Investment Fund, which has a large pipeline and at the \ncurrent rate of disbursement is projected to have reserves in excess of \n$150 million by the end of fiscal year 1996, can be transferred to the \nNAD Bank.\n  I was disappointed that we were not able to match the House level for \ninternational disaster assistance, but I do want to credit Senator \nMcConnell for providing a modest increase above the current level. \nNevertheless, I am informed that the House level is needed in order to \navoid serious damage to the humanitarian program in northern Iraq, so \nthis will be an issue for the conference.\n  Senator McConnell has substantially increased funding for \ninternational narcotics programs. This is one area where I would have \npreferred the House level. I am not convinced that these programs are \ncost-effective, and there are too many other programs in this bill that \ndesperately need these additional funds.\n  I want to mention several policy issues, besides the three I \nmentioned earlier, that concern me.\n  One is the conspicuous lack of any reference to Indonesia in this \nbill. This concerns me because of the continuing human rights problems \nin Indonesia and East Timor. The Congress had included restrictions on \nfunding for Indonesia on human rights grounds in the past several \nyears, and I do not believe the situation there warrants a relaxation \nof those restrictions.\n  Another policy issue that concerns me is assistance to Turkey. The \nHouse imposed a ceiling on ESF for Turkey, due to concerns about the \nTurkish Government's treatment of the Kurdish minority in that country. \nDespite my own concerns about the rights of the Kurds, I do not believe \nthis is a wise approach. I believe we have a strong interest in \nsupporting economic development in turkey, which is an important and \nvalued member of NATO. However, I may offer an amendment which I \nbelieve would more directly address concerns about human rights and the \nsituation facing the Kurds. I also included language in the committee \nreport which requests the administration to submit a report on the \nefforts of the Turkish and United States Governments to monitor the use \nof United States-origin military equipment by the Turkish Armed Forces. \nSpecifically, this report should address the use of U.S. military \naircraft which, according to the State Department's own reports, has \nbeen used to strafe and destroy Kurdish villages. I and others want to \nknow what efforts are being made to reduce the use of these aircraft \nagainst civilians or targets occupied by civilians.\n  Another provision I support is the prohibition on assistance to any \ngovernment or organization which cooperates commercially with the Khmer \nRouge. The reasons for this provision are discussed in the committee \nreport, but very briefly, it was included on account of the \nconsiderable evidence that Thai military personnel are routinely \nengaged in facilitating the export from Cambodia of valuable timber by \nthe Khmer Rouge. These sales have provided the Khmer Rouge with a \nsteady source of income to continue their murderous campaign against \nthe Cambodian Government and the Cambodian people. This provision is \nintended to encourage the Thai Government to take steps to deter this \ncooperation.\n  Several other provisions deserve mention. The bill includes an 18 \nmonth extension of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act, which \nenables funding to continue for the Palestinians. It also includes \nauthority requested by the administration for the drawdown of up to \n$100 million in military equipment for Jordan. As in the past, there \nare earmarks for the Camp David countries, as well as Cyprus.\n  Last but not least, I want to mention Ireland. For the past decade, \nthe United States has generously contributed to the International Fund \nfor Ireland. August 31 was the one year anniversary of the IRA \nceasefire, and the House bill provides $19.6 million for the IFI. \nAlthough the Senate bill does not contain an earmark for the IFI, I \nbelieve it is very important that the Congress support this program \nduring this pivotal year. While trade and investment will be the engine \nthat propels the economies of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the IFI \nremains an important source of funding during this critical transition \nperiod.\n  Mr. President, again, there are aspects of this bill that I do not \nagree with. There are programs that I would prefer to see receive a \nlarger portion of the funds. However, I believe that on the whole it \nreflects a reasonable balance between Senator McConnell's and my \npriorities. Funding for foreign assistance has been falling since the \nmid-1980's and future budget projections do not bode well for these \nprograms. The Congress needs to recognize that the reality is that this \nis not simply foreign assistance. The funds in this bill directly \npromote the interests of the American people. That becomes clearer the \nfarther into the future one looks.\n  You know, Mr. President, there are a lot of things where we can \ndisagree in \n\n[[Page S 13906]]\nthis country. There are a lot of political issues we can disagree on. \nBut I hope that most Americans can be proud of the fact that we have \ncreated the strongest democracy that history has ever known and we \nshould be proud of our position in the world. But we should also \nunderstand our responsibilities in the world. We are a quarter of a \nbillion people. We are the largest economy in the world. But even \nthough we are only a small percentage of the world's population, we use \nclose to half of the world's resources.\n  We have great opportunities but great obligations. The opportunities \nare to foster the kind of democracy that the United States has known \nand to encourage countries that want to become democratic nations.\n  But we also have a certain humanitarian responsibility to the rest of \nthe world. God has blessed this country with great resources and great \nadvantages. But at the same time I think you can say there is a moral \nresponsibility to help those less fortunate. It is not the idea of \nhaving some massive giveaways. We do not. Our foreign aid budget is \nless than 1 percent of our overall budget. Much of it reflects our own \nsecurity interests. A lot of it is designed to create jobs for \nAmericans and our export markets, and a tiny part reflects the \nhumanitarian concerns of the greatest nation history has known. We may \nwant to look at just how tiny that percentage is.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2707\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for the streamlining and consolidation of the \nforeign affairs agencies of the United States, including the abolition \n of at least two of the following agencies: the U.S. Arms Control and \n  Disarmament Agency, the U.S. Information Agency, and the Agency for \n                       International Development)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], for Mr. Dole, \n     for himself and Mr. Helms, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2707.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this pending amendment will save the \ntaxpayers of America $3 billion, if and when the Senate approves it.\n  This amendment will mandate the abolition of three outdated, \nanachronistic Federal agencies--the Arms Control and Disarmament \nAgency; the Agency for International Development, which is the foreign \naid giveaway agency, Mr. President; and the U.S. Information Agency. \nReorganization of U.S. foreign affairs institutions puts the interests \nof the American people first, for a change, and prepares the United \nStates for the 21st century. The American people voted for a change \nlast November, if my understanding of what the people wanted is \nanywhere on target. It is now the Senate's duty to follow through.\n  Before I proceed, I must acknowledge that I have never, in my nearly \n23 years in the Senate, seen such furious lobbying by the executive \nbranch, and by the State Department, to resist cutting spending and \nresisting reorganization. They have made all sorts of charges, none of \nwhich is true; they have circulated all sorts of threats. They may have \nalmost intimidated some Senators, but I do not think it will last--\ncertainly not in all cases. But we must proceed, so that the Senate can \ndecide whether it will join the House of Representatives in saving the \nAmerican taxpayers billions of dollars by discarding outmoded, \nanachronistic Federal agencies that ought not to exist anyway.\n  I will tell you one thing, Mr. President. There is nothing so near \neternal life as ``temporary'' Federal agencies. They go on and on and \non like Tennyson's brook, and they cost the American taxpayers billions \nof dollars.\n  Now, I confess a reservation about my own amendment, Mr. President, \nthe reservation that my own amendment does not go far enough in \nchanging the situation. It does, however, go a long way toward \naccomplishing the objectives that I laid out in Senate Bill 908, the \nForeign Relations Revitalization Act.\n  Just as importantly, this amendment is consistent with legislation \nintroduced months ago--on February 15, to be precise--a bill numbered \nS. 422, offered by the distinguished Senator from Kentucky [Mr. \nMcConnell]. Now, the McConnell proposal proposed to abolish the Agency \nfor International Development--that foreign aid giveaway crowd--and \ntransfer its function into the State Department. A similar provision is \nincorporated into the Foreign Relations Committee's bill, S. 908. \nAmerican taxpayers would be saved millions of dollars by cutting AID's \noverextended operating costs.\n  On May 11, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] \nappeared before the Foreign Relations Committee, of which I happen to \nbe chairman, and he said at that time that his bill, S. 422, includes \n``abolishing AID and consolidating the agency's functions under the \nSecretary of State * * *.''\n  He proceeded to say it would also ``move assistance programs into the \nState Department, reflecting my own view that the U.S. foreign aid must \nbetter serve the U.S. foreign policy interests. The connection between \nU.S. aid and U.S. interests has been lost with agencies acting wholly \nindependent of our collective interests and good.''\n  That was Senator McConnell on May 11 in his appearance before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  With all due respect, having praised Senator McConnell, as I have on \nmany occasions for his courage and his foresight, I must say that the \npending legislation, H.R. 1868, is a far cry from what he said when S. \n422 was offered this past February to the Senate and about which \nSenator McConnell was speaking when he testified.\n  The pending amendment now at the desk will get us back on track by \neliminating two of the three anachronistic, wornout Federal agencies. \nIn fact, if Senator McConnell would like to direct that AID--the Agency \nfor International Development--be one of the two, I will be happy to \naccommodate him. I do not think he is going to want to do that because \na great deal of pressure has been applied by certain Federal \nbureaucrats. They have confused the issue and muddied the water, and we \nmay have to straighten out the situation by careful evaluation of the \ntrue facts of the situation involving all of this legislation.\n  The congressional budget levels mandate that Congress deflate bloated \nbureaucracies in the Federal Government by eliminating vast \nduplications and by eliminating incredible waste across the board. \nEvery Member of this Senate knows that duplication and waste has been \ngoing on. It is going on right now, and it will continue to go on, \nunless we have the guts to do something about it.\n  The amendment pending at the desk meets the Budget Committee target \nlevels for international affairs required to balance the Federal budget \nby the year 2002. The savings thereby generated do not derive from \nexcessive cuts in international programs. The savings derive entirely \nfrom reductions in the sprawling foreign affairs bureaucracy.\n  Let me say this with all of the sincerity that I possess, Mr. \nPresident. If the Senate and the House of Representatives, composing \nthis Congress, fail to seize this opportunity to consolidate, the \nAmerican taxpayers will be stuck with a massive international affairs \nbudget which feeds a huge, enormous bureaucracy.\n  So the Senate, it seems to me, has two choices: One, it can save \nintelligently through consolidation; or two, it can cannibalize Federal \nprograms.\n  As I said earlier, there is nothing so close to eternal life as a \ntemporary Federal agency. The idea of eliminating these worn out \nbureaucracies--that \n\n[[Page S 13907]]\nwere temporarily designated, and specified as temporary, when they were \ncreated--is just as old as the agencies themselves. During the past \ndecades, at least 89 studies have been made on the subject of \nconsolidating our foreign affairs institutions. These have been \nconducted by a series of administrations, Democrat and Republican. I \nthink, as just one Senator, Mr. President, that we should stop talking \nand do something to benefit the American taxpayers.\n  In many respects, as I have said earlier, the pending amendment \nmirrors S. 908, the bill reported by the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. The State Department reorganization bill thus reported by \nthe Foreign Relations Committee has been endorsed by five--count them, \nfive--former Secretaries of State. Every one of them, without \nexception, supported the abolition of the Arms Control and Disarmament \nAgency, the Agency for International Development, and the U.S. \nInformation Agency.\n  All five former Secretaries of State advocated publicly, in \ntestimony, that all three agencies be eliminated and the money be \nsaved. Now, the functions of these agencies will be transferred into \nthe State Department, which in the process will be reorganized and \nrevitalized.\n  I have to say that our good friend, Warren Christopher, the present \nSecretary of State, whom I respect and for whom I have affection, \nconcluded that just such a plan makes sense. In November of last year, \nSecretary of State Christopher submitted to Vice President Gore a \nreorganization plan, the Christopher reorganization plan, a plan \nsimilar to our reorganization plan. But that plan, sad to say, lost out \nto the bureaucratic lobbyists in the administration--including the \nWhite House--who care more about protecting their fiefdoms than they do \nabout streamlining the Federal Government for the post-cold-war world. \nIndeed, it is an irony, it seems to me, that Secretary Warren \nChristopher's reorganization proposal was rejected, rejected by the \nvery same office that had been created with great fanfare--to do what? \nTo reinvent Government. Some reinvention.\n  Let me say, Vice President Gore--and I liked him very much personally \nwhen he was a Senator and now as Vice President--but I feel obliged to \nmention the fact that Al Gore promised the American taxpayers that he \nwould cut $5 billion out of the foreign affairs budget in the next 5 \nyears while keeping the bureaucracy in place.\n  I wanted to see how he could do that. That promise reminded me of the \nfellow who applied for a job at a circus, saying he could jump off a \n90-foot tower into a wet washcloth, which he did. The only problem, he \nbroke his neck. You cannot cut down on the bureaucracy without cutting \ndown on the bureaucracy.\n  In any case, our friend, Al Gore, Vice President of the United \nStates, has not to this good day, this hour, submitted the first \nsyllable of a plan for his proposal. Nothing. Zilch.\n  The Vice President has said simply that he has no plan. But he does \nhave an opinion about others, including Secretary of State Christopher, \nwho have tried their best to get this country embarked on the \nproposition that we have to cut down on the Federal bureaucracy. The \nState Department itself has not submitted even one syllable of a formal \nauthorization request for fiscal year 1996, this fiscal year coming up.\n  Instead, what have we heard from the State Department? What have we \nheard from the Agency for International Development and others? We did \nhave one pretty clear message which somebody slipped to us over the \ntransom, a copy of an internal memorandum in which they outlined, Mr. \nPresident, exactly how they were going to oppose Senator Helms in my \neffort to cut down on the Federal budget. They said the plan is to \n``delay, postpone, obfuscate, derail'' the congressional debate on \nreorganization.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have consulted the highest levels of the \nadministration on Foreign Relations Committee bill S. 908. In fact, \ninasmuch as the media has mentioned my visit with the President on \nAugust 11, I suppose it is common knowledge. I have never said publicly \nheretofore anything in detail about my meeting with President Clinton.\n  He was very gracious and generous with his time, and if I am able to \nread the expressions on anybody's face, I perceived that the President \nwas much impressed at the detailed outline that was presented that \nafternoon.\n  In any case, the pending amendment provides enormous flexibility to \nthe President. I think that is why Mr. Clinton appeared so receptive to \nproposals contained in S. 908 to consolidate those anachronistic \nforeign affairs bureaucracies.\n  The President understands that this is an issue about good government \nand about saving the American taxpayers billions of dollars.\n  It allows the executive branch even greater latitude than exists in \ncurrent law. It requires the abolishment of only two or three outdated \nagencies. As a matter of fact, I am willing to settle for abolishing \ntwo of them--and I will let them decide which two. But let us do away \nwith two of them, two out of the three.\n  This legislation, this amendment at the desk, does not--and I \nreiterate for emphasis--it does not legislate every position and office \nin the Department of State. But it does provide an organized framework \nfor consolidation and it does provide necessary extraordinary authority \nfor a smooth transition to a smaller, more efficient, far less \nexpensive foreign affairs apparatus. As the President of the United \nStates said on the afternoon of August 11, ``Who can be against that?'' \n``Who can be against that?''\n  I am not implying, nor should anybody infer, that the President has \nendorsed any plan. I do not know. He said he was going to get back to \nme, but he never did. I suspect that he was subjected to some rather \nsevere lobbying from within the official family, but I do not know \nthat. But I do know that consolidation of U.S. foreign affairs and all \nof its institutions is obviously the right thing to do. It is a wise \nproposal on which unanimous agreement should result. We ought not to be \nhere prepared to debate it. We should not be here quibbling over $23 \nmillion or whatever. We should be standing in a phalanx, and: Yes, sir, \nwe are going to cut down the size of this Government and especially the \nforeign aid giveaway programs. Because, by doing so we can save the \nAmerican taxpayers, as I said at the outset, billions--not millions--\nbillions of dollars. And in the process we will be strengthening the \nhand of the Secretary of State in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy.\n  That is why five former Secretaries of State appeared before the \nForeign Relations Committee and endorsed our proposal that emerged from \nthe committee.\n  Abraham Lincoln said it well, I think. He said, ``The dogmas of the \nquiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled \nhigh with difficulty, and we must rise to the occasion. As our case is \nnew,'' Mr. Lincoln said, ``so we must think anew and act anew.'' Abe \nLincoln said so many smart things, but he did not say one that was any \nsmarter than that one. I agree with it and I think 99 percent of the \nAmerican people, at least those who are not on the Federal payroll, \nwill agree with what Abraham Lincoln said.\n  The need for innovative thinking is not tomorrow, next week, next \nmonth or next year. It is now. It is time to shed ourselves of these \narchaic, burdensome, anachronistic institutions so that we may enter a \nturbulent 21st century--and it is going to be turbulent--so we can go \ninto that century with a more effective State Department and a more \ncoherent foreign policy and one that does not, as now is the case, \nbleed the American taxpayer white.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Helms \namendment. I would like to make this point to Members. This is a \ncontroversial amendment. It does involve dramatic changes in the State \nDepartment and the way we organize that function. The choice we have is \nto spend $3 billion extra on overhead, or to save that money for real \nprograms that help real people.\n  The fact is, America is in transition. We face tough competition from \nabroad. We face tough competition and problems in solving our own \nbudget dilemma. That is going to be resolved in \n\n[[Page S 13908]]\na happy way, only if we set priorities and eliminate those things least \nefficient, least productive, least creative in Government and \nconcentrate the limited resources we all recognize we have on those \nthings most productive. In short, the choice we have is to spend $3 \nbillion in foreign affairs that experts tell us we can save through \nreducing unnecessary overhead and salaries and inefficiencies, and \ntransfer that money to programs that are vital, that are important.\n  Everyone concerned about Social Security ought to be in favor of this \namendment because this frees up $3 billion that can be spent to save \nSocial Security.\n  Everyone concerned about Medicare and Medicaid ought to be for this \namendment because it frees up money that can be reserved and used for \nthose programs.\n  It is not enough to pretend we have the resources for everything in \nthe world. We do not. The distinguished Senator from North Carolina, \nthrough his innovations, has found us $3 billion that we can reprogram \nfor much higher priorities. I hope, while this is a tough decision, \nwhile it involves change, while it involves sacrifice, it does involve \nchanging our priorities to move away from overhead and offices and \nunneeded supervision and unneeded duplication to a program that \ntransfers that money over to our most efficient, effective and helpful \nprograms.\n  I believe that is the essence of what good Government is about on the \nnational level, taking a look at our budget and making sure it is spent \nin the most logical, thoughtful, productive ways.\n  The fact is that Democrats and Republicans who served as Secretary of \nState, who have served in that office in supervisory capacities, have \ncome before the committee and have testified this is a wise and \nefficient and productive and efficient thing to do. We ought to get on \nwith it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment is an amendment that deals \nwith the subject of Pakistan and the longstanding sale of military \nequipment to that country and our further domestic relations with that \ncountry. It is a compromise amendment. It has been considered on the \nfloor prior to this, with extended debate.\n  I offer it in hopes that those who feel strongly--and I recognize \nthere are Members who feel strongly on both sides--will not only have \nan additional opportunity to share their views with the Senate, but \nallow us an opportunity to proceed and dispose of the issue one way or \nanother.\n  Mr. President, with this background, I might mention that much of \nthis issue started back in 1979 which started with an event which \nshocked America and shocked the world. It started with the Soviet \ninvasion of Afghanistan, Pakistan's neighbor to the north.\n  President Carter responded strongly to this, and violated his \nunderstanding and agreements with the Soviet Government. It spoiled a \nperiod that might have developed into detente under his leadership, and \nit particularly affected our relationships with Pakistan and to some \nextent India. It affected those relationships because Pakistan was the \nneighbor immediately south of Afghanistan and faced great danger. The \nSoviet Union had made direct threats against Pakistan for their \nassistance and cooperation with the United States prior to that and, \nagain, the threat of further Soviet retaliation against Pakistan was \nhighlighted when they invaded their neighbor to the north.\n  It also aggravated the disagreement between the Indians and \nPakistanis. The Pakistanis strongly condemned \n\n[[Page S 13909]]\nthe invasion of Afghanistan but, tragically, the leader of India rose \nand in a speech supported and defended the Soviet invasion of \nAfghanistan. It further aggravated then strained relationships between \nIndia and Pakistan as well. It affected this country's relationship \nbecause the United States saw a need and an importance to work with \nPakistan to thwart that Soviet occupation and subjugation of \nAfghanistan. It saw renewed and unique cooperation between our two \ncountries. It resulted in a series of additional sales of military \nequipment to Pakistan as well.\n  Faced with the potential of the further Soviet activity on the \nnorthern border, we saw an interest in building up Pakistan's military \nstrength. And, thus, in a period between 1986 and 1989, a series of \nsales of military equipment were made to Pakistan. Specifically, during \nthat period, 1986 to 1989, we sold them a total of 60 aircraft, a total \npotentially then of 71, including 11 additional aircraft as part of the \ndeal--a total of 71 aircraft that were considered. These were F-16 \naircraft. It was not only a sale for United States industries, but it \nwas a way to help strengthen and support Pakistan's military defense \nthat they faced: the Russian invasion of Afghanistan on its northern \nborder.\n  In addition, there were $368 million of other military equipment \nincluded in this sale. That equipment was a sale; that is, the \nPakistanis paid for it with their own money. But what happened was, \nafter that, two things occurred. First, finally the Soviets understood \nthe folly of having invaded Afghanistan and began a withdrawal and \nbegan a settlement. Second, in 1990, the Pressler amendment kicked in. \nThe Pressler amendment I think was well-intentioned, and it was \ndesigned to prevent nuclear proliferation. It was designed in a way, \nthough, where it was country specific; that is, it applied to Pakistan \nbut did not apply to India.\n  India had developed--or at least we believe they had developed--their \nown nuclear weapons. But--this is important--it did not violate the \nPressler amendment because the Pressler amendment was not geared to the \nkind of activity India was involved in; that is, domestic development \nor primarily domestic development of their own weapons. But it did \napply country specific to Pakistan. In other words, we established in \nthe Pressler effort a rule that applied and was limited to Pakistan but \nnot to India as it developed out.\n  So two things occurred. The Pressler amendment resulted in the \nnoncertification of Pakistan under that amendment, and, according to \nthe Pressler amendment, the sale of this equipment was cut off; that \nis, we were prevented by law from delivering it.\n  So here is the controversy in 1990. The United States has sold \nequipment to a good ally and a good friend, Pakistan, a total sale of \n1.4 billion dollars' worth of equipment of which they have paid for and \nwe have ordered the equipment to be built and are unable to give the \nequipment to Pakistan because of the Pressler amendment, and we are \nalso unable to give them their money back. We are unable to give them \ntheir money back even though we cannot give the product because the \nGovernment has turned around and contracted for the production of the \nequipment.\n  So we are set in a controversy in 1990. We have the Pakistani money \nor the obligation. We are unable to deliver the equipment, and we are \nunable to give them their money back because we have already spent it \nfor the equipment. Thus, for 5 years we have sat in a controversy with \none of our best friends holding their money and their equipment and not \nwilling to give either one of them, or not able to give either one of \nthem, to them.\n  The next thing that happened was in 1993 when Pakistan was faced with \nthe nondelivery, decided and agreed with the United States reluctantly \nto cut back their order of F-16 aircraft, which is by far the most \ncontroversial part of the package, from a total of 71, or the 60 they \nhad purchased plus the 11, back to a total of 28. So the total has \ndropped from 71 back to 28. We are still faced, though, with the \npackage of $1.4 billion in military equipment combined, which we have \ntheir money for and which we are unable to deliver.\n  Mr. President, I should point out also that there is a further \nproblem here. Not only does this nondelivered, nonaccomplished contract \naggravate our relations with Pakistan, but each year Pakistan has been \ncharged with and is required to pay storage costs on the equipment they \nhave paid for but which we refuse to deliver. It adds insult to injury \nto some extent.\n  In addition, the equipment each year of these last 5 years has become \nmore and more obsolescent. Each year we fail to resolve this crisis, \nthe equipment drops in value, the storage costs and maintenance costs \ncontinue on, and relations become more and more strained between our \ntwo countries. It is clearly in this Nation's interest to work out an \narrangement to resolve this longstanding dispute.\n  Mr. President, I also think it is important for us to keep in mind \nwhat was behind the Pressler amendment; that is, a genuine and a \nsincere interest in stopping proliferation. So, in thinking about \nsettling this dispute, it seems to me that we, as Americans, ought to \nbe thinking about a couple of things. First, how do we resolve the \ndispute without sending the message that we are going to give up on \nstopping proliferation? Clearly, as we come out of this, we have to \nhave in place something that is a discouragement for people from \ndeveloping nuclear weapons.\n  So it is important I think that the solution come out. First, so that \nit is fair to both India, Pakistan, and the United States; and, second, \nso that there is still significant deterrence for people violating the \nstructures, and the disincentives, against proliferation.\n  Mr. President, that is what this amendment is meant to do, a \nresolution of that longstanding controversy. What does it do?\n  The amendment is very clear, and for Members let me divide it into a \ncouple of parts. First, simply a clarification of the Pressler \namendment. That is, in the cutoff of certain relationships between the \nUnited States and Pakistan, we want to clarify some areas where we \nthink it is in our interest to not have cutoff. What are they? For \nexample, is it in the interest of the United States to cooperate with \nPakistan in the suppression of terrorism?\n  I think most Members would think it is reasonable to say, of course, \nit is; that in cutting off relationships between the United States and \nPakistan because of the Pressler amendment, one of the things we should \nnot cut off is cooperation between our two countries with regard to \nsuppressing terrorism. An example occurred earlier this year. Within \nPakistan, we were able to apprehend, with the assistance of the \nPakistani authorities, a suspected terrorist who was thought to be \ninvolved in the bombing within this country of the New York World Trade \nCenter. We asked the Pakistanis to arrest him and extradite him to the \nUnited States.\n  Was that in our interest? Yes. Mr. President, incidentally, the \nPakistanis did cooperate. Even though they faced pressure from Islamic \nfundamentalist countries that surround them, they arrested this \nsuspected terrorist and they extradited him to the United States. I \nmight mention that that kind of cooperation has not been seen by all \ncountries in the world and Pakistan took particular risks in doing so. \nSo I think it is in our interest to have an arrangement that allows us \nto cooperate with them in suppressing terrorism. I think it is also in \nour interest to have an arrangement that allows us to cooperate with \nthem in suppressing drug traffic and arresting drug traffickers.\n  Why is it important to amend the Pressler amendment? The Pressler \namendment--and it is not as clear as it might be--appears to cut off \neven assistance that, for example, would help them set up a lab, which \nis what we have done with a lot of countries, which would identify \nchemicals. So what we have done in a number of countries around the \nworld is help them with technical expertise to identify what is \ncocaine, what is heroin, what these different chemicals and drugs are, \nand convict the people who are trafficking in them.\n  So the first part of the amendment is reasonably noncontroversial. It \npassed out of committee 16 to 2. What it says, in the so-called \neconomic areas, we are going to clarify what Pressler means and we are \ngoing to allow cooperation in the areas of suppressing terrorism, \ncounternarcotics control, peacekeeping, and multilateral nation \nbuilding. I \n\n[[Page S 13910]]\nthink there are a lot of examples. We have gone to the Pakistanis in \nrecent years and asked them to help by sending troops to Haiti, by \nsending troops to Somalia. We want to make it clear that there is \ncooperation allowed. In other words, if we provide transportation, for \nexample, for their troops to go to Somalia to help us with a mission, \nwe want to clarify the Pressler amendment to make it clear that is \nallowed.\n  So the first piece of it we believe is fairly noncontroversial. It is \nclarifying that the Pressler amendment in the economic areas does not \ncut off areas where I think most every American would think it is to \nour advantage to cooperate with Pakistan.\n  The second aspect should be fairly noncontroversial as well, and that \nis it makes it clear by law that we will not deliver the F-16 aircraft, \nexactly what the Pressler amendment allows right now or provides right \nnow, and it indicates that the President is authorized to sell the \nplanes and return what money of the Pakistanis that he can through a \nsale of those aircraft to other people.\n  Now, Mr. President, the only thing new in that is making it clear \nthat he is authorized to sell them and return the money such as he can. \nIt does not appropriate money for this purpose, and that is an \nimportant difference. We are not, as I hope we would eventually and I \nthink is important, by this amendment returning the Pakistani money. We \nare authorizing the President to sell those aircraft and authorizing \nthe return of the proceeds from what he sells, but it does not \nappropriate money. It merely authorizes a resolution of that.\n  So what we have done is left in place the major penalty for Pakistan \nin this. The aircraft, the F-16's, are clearly things that the Indians \nare most concerned about. They have indicated it is their top priority. \nThey have indicated it is the thing that is most important to them, to \nsee that they are not delivered in the way of equipment to the \nPakistanis. The aircraft amount to almost three-fourths of the entire \nmilitary package.\n  So the way it deals with the second area is it makes it clear that \nthose aircraft, none of them are to be delivered to Pakistan, and if \nthere is money derived from selling them, that can be returned to \nPakistan.\n  Third, Mr. President, it does authorize the delivery of about a \nfourth of the package, and that fourth is other equipment that is \ndescribed as insignificant.\n  We have held extensive hearings on this question. Every witness that \nwe had--we had a large number of witnesses, experts from academia, \nmilitary experts, and a variety of other experts from the \nadministration--every expert that came in who talked about this other \npackage--that is, about a fourth of the military sale--described to us \nthat these were militarily insignificant packages. Both Democrat and \nRepublican, both liberal and conservative, both academic and military \nexperts, all of them came in and described this part of the package--\nand it is $368 million of military equipment that they have contracted \nand paid for--as militarily insignificant.\n  Now, some critics have said, ``Goodness, if you allow the delivery of \nthis equipment that is 5 years old or older, it will upset the \nremainder of power between India and Pakistan.''\n  I am happy to respond to that if it is made in the Chamber, and I \nwish to be very clear about it because the experts we have asked, all \nof them have come in and said, First, it is militarily insignificant \nand, second, it will have no effect whatsoever on the remainder of \npower between India and Pakistan. India is clearly the dominant power. \nIt is 2 to 1 over Pakistan in almost every military aspect and, of \ncourse, in population has an advantage much greater than that. So while \nthat is a point of contention in this, it is a controversial piece of \nit I hope Members will put in place. First, the experts say it is not \nmilitarily significant and will do nothing to change the major balance \nof power between India and Pakistan, which is clearly in India's favor \nand continues in a very significant way to be in India's favor.\n  Mr. President, let me deal specifically with what the amendment does \nnot do because I think that is important. It does not repeal the \nPressler amendment. It leaves it in place. It leaves in place a cutoff \nof military sales to Pakistan. Even though they have been our ally, \neven though they have been our friend, they cannot look to us even in \ndifficult circumstances to buy military equipment.\n  The military equipment that here is involved is a sale that is 8 or 9 \nyears old and that they have paid for and for which we are unable to \nreturn their money. So what we are doing is not delivering three-\nfourths of the material and delivering a quarter of it. But it leaves \nin place the Pressler amendment and the cutoff of sanctions. Second, it \ndoes not create instability with India. It leaves them with a 2-to-1 \nadvantage in military hardware. Third, it does not--and this is very \nimportant, I think--undermine the nonproliferation efforts of the \nUnited States. It leaves in place tough sanctions against Pakistan.\n  Some may feel this amendment does not go far enough, that we ought to \nreconsider those tough sanctions. But this amendment does not do that. \nI must say personally, Mr. President, I think it is very important for \nus to keep in mind that we have to have credibility in terms of our \nstrong stand against proliferation. As some Members may note, I have \nbeen one who has been concerned about our negotiations and discussions \nwith North Korea. I think we jeopardize the credibility of our \nnonproliferation effort by what we have done there. So I think it is \nimportant to note this amendment leaves in place tough sanctions.\n  Mr. President, I wish to suggest to Members that there are three \nthings I hope they will keep in mind as they consider this amendment. \nNo. 1, Members from my side of the aisle have been critical at times of \nthe President in his conducting of foreign policy, but here is an \nexample where the President faced a tough problem. He faced a tough \nproblem because it deals with relationships with Pakistan and India. He \nfaced a tough problem because for 5 years we have had this equipment \nand we have refused to either deliver it or give the Pakistanis their \nmoney back.\n Previous administrations had not been able to deal with this problem, \nas difficult as it was.\n\n  Mr. President, here is a situation where the President of the United \nStates faced a tough foreign policy problem and found a solution. He \nnegotiated for this Nation and he developed a good compromise. The \ncompromise he developed did not deliver the F-16's, which were the most \ncontroversial piece of the package, and did deliver a portion of the \npackage, about a fourth of it, that is not thought to be militarily \nsignificant.\n  He negotiated a strong compromise that while it does not satisfy \neveryone, it gets this problem behind it. No one, I think, can look at \nthis problem and think it makes sense to delay further in trying to \nresolve it. Every day that passes the equipment gets older and of less \nvalue. Every day that passes, there is storage costs that impose a \ngreater and greater burden on the parties involved.\n  The question Members have to ask themselves is this: If they fail to \npass the President's compromise, what do they do to his negotiating \nposition in foreign policy? I think it is very clear they undercut it. \nI think it is very clear what happens. If you fail to pass the \nPresident's compromise in this area, we send a message to the world \nthat they cannot negotiate in good faith with the President of the \nUnited States, that we will not back him when he steps forward to \nsettle difficult problems. I think we undercut his position and his \ncredibility and his ability to negotiate on behalf of the United States \nin the future.\n  It would be a tragic mistake to take an area where the President has \nshown real leadership and real courage in solving a tough problem, and \nto undercut him.\n  Second, Mr. President, I think there is a very important thing we \nought to consider as we look at this package, and that is how people \naround the world will respond to the United States when we come and ask \nfor help, when we come and ask for cooperation. They will look at how \nwe have treated Pakistan and they will make a decision of whether or \nnot they want to be our friend and whether or not they want to work for \nus. \n\n[[Page S 13911]]\n\n  Mr. President, there is a simple guideline for this solution as to \nhow Pakistan has responded. When we have needed help and we have gone \nto Pakistan and asked for help, the Pakistanis were there for us. Let \nme review the record quickly.\n  In 1950, when North Korea invaded South Korea, the United States went \nto Pakistan and asked for their help in the United Nations to vote \nagainst that invasion and to authorize U.N. forces to go to war to save \nfreedom and democracy in South Korea. Pakistan said yes when we asked \nthem for help.\n  In 1954, when we organized the Central Treaty Organization, CENTO--it \nwas designed to stop the spread of communism around the world--we went \nto Pakistan even though they were in a vulnerable position, close to \nthe Soviet Union, and we asked them to join this military alliance to \nprotect freedom and democracy around the world. Pakistan said yes when \nwe asked them to join.\n  In 1955, when we helped organize the Southeast Asian Treaty \nOrganization, SEATO, and asked Pakistan to join that organization, \nPakistan said yes, and stood shoulder to shoulder with us to stop the \nspread of Marxism and communism around the world.\n  In 1959, when we went to Pakistan and asked them to sign a mutual \ndefense treaty, Pakistan once again said yes to the United States. In \naccordance with that defense treaty Pakistan allowed the United States \nto set up military air bases within Pakistan designed to perform \nreconnaissance flights over the Soviet Union.\n  Now, Mr. President, keep in mind what this was. We asked Pakistan to \nallow us to set up a base in their own country that would fly our spy \nplanes, our reconnaissance planes, over the Soviet Union, providing \nvital military intelligence to the United States. Pakistan, close to \nthe Soviet Union, was at great risk and great danger. And once again, \neven at their own risk, Pakistan said yes to the United States.\n  Francis Gary Powers, incidentally, was involved in one of those \nflights, which Americans will remember.\n  Incidentally Khrushchev himself threatened to wipe this airbase off \nthe face of the Earth. Pakistan took an enormous risk by letting us on \ntheir territory, and said yes to helping us.\n  In 1970, when we wanted to open up relationships with China, Pakistan \nsaid yes to our request to allow Henry Kissinger to enter China through \nPakistan, cooperating and setting up that relationship with China. Even \nthough the Soviets were very upset by Pakistan, and in less than a year \nsigned a friendship treaty with India partly in relationship to their \nanger, Pakistan went ahead and said yes to the United States offers for \nhelp.\n  Americans should note that it was within a year after that \ncooperation with the United States that resulted in a friendship treaty \nbetween the Soviet Union and India that India then felt free to send \ntheir troops into east Pakistan which saw the Pakistanis lose that war \nand lose a significant portion of their country.\n  From 1979 to 1989 the United States went to Pakistan and asked them \nto cooperate with us in and help us fight the Soviet invasion of \nAfghanistan through infiltration of military equipment and other \ndevices. Once again Pakistan said yes to the United States even though \nthey faced great danger.\n  In the gulf war against Iraq in 1990 we asked Pakistan to send \ntroops. They did. They stood side by side and fought with us to repel \nthe Iraqi invasion.\n  Since 1992 and 1993, Pakistan has been at the forefront of \npeacekeeping operations. We went to them and asked them to supply \ntroops for Somalia, and they said yes. And we went to them and asked \nthem to supply troops for the Haiti operation, and they said yes. And \nin 1995 we went to them and asked them to return a suspected terrorist, \nand they helped arrest him and return him to the United States, a \nterrorist who was involved in the World Trade Center bombing.\n  Mr. President, when we have asked Pakistan for help, they have been \nthere. They have stood side by side for America with America. They have \nstood side by side with us in resisting Soviet aggression. They have \nstood side by side with us to stop and reverse the Russian invasion of \nAfghanistan. And, Mr. President, they stood side by side to help us \nstop or reverse terrorism around the world.\n  Now, Mr. President, they are asking us, asking us to treat them \nfairly with regard to this sale that started almost 9 years ago.\n  Mr. President, at this time I would like to ask that Senator Harkin \nand Senator Moseley-Braun be added as cosponsors to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Finally, Mr. President, let me suggest this: The reason we \nought to pass this amendment is not for Pakistan, although that ought \nto be a consideration, it is not for anyone else in the world except \nfor the United States.\n  If there is one thing important to Americans, it is that our word be \ngood, that our commitments be strong, that people place credibility in \nwhat America does. Is there anyone in this Chamber that is comfortable \nwith us having taken the Pakistani money and refused either the \nequipment that we contracted for or their money back? I do not think \nso. Americans do not deal that way with people. We do not take their \nmoney on a contract and then refuse to deliver on the contract or \nrefuse to return their money. We ought to adopt this amendment because \nof America and what we stand for and who we are, because our word is \ngood, and our commitment is good, because we do not cheat people.\n  We ought to adopt this amendment because it is a fair compromise of a \ntough problem that treats people fairly and reasonably. Mr. President, \nI believe it would be wrong for us to both keep the money and the \nmilitary equipment and to refuse to resolve that problem. And that \nstands as a cloud over the integrity of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of this country. I think we deal fairly \nwith people. And I think we want people to know that. We ought to pass \nthis amendment more than anything because it says a lot about the kind \nof people we are and the kind of integrity we have and the validity and \nthe integrity of the word of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/20/senate-section/article/S13904-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13911-S13919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, under the order, there are 4 minutes \nequally divided on the Feingold amendment, the first amendment to be \nvoted on.\n  In connection with the Conrad amendment, there has been a \nmodification submitted. In connection with the Conrad amendment, I ask \nthe following: I ask unanimous consent that following the first of the \nordered votes, there be 6 minutes of debate for the Conrad amendment \nNo. 2698, with 4 minutes under the control of Senator Conrad and 2 \nminutes under the control of Senator Cochran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the pending question \nis amendment No. 2697, offered by the Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. \nFeingold]. As indicated, debate on this amendment is limited to 4 \nminutes equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  \n[[Page S 13912]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment does not cut a dime from \nthe Special Research Grants Program. I want to make that absolutely \nclear. It just subjects the proposals for funding under this program to \nnew scientific peer review and competition.\n  Second, this amendment does not negate the committee's \nrecommendations in the report. It just ensures that those \nrecommendations, if they are funded, have to pass a competitive test to \nbe sure they are merited.\n  Third, this amendment replaces the political competition for these \nresearch dollars, which I think is inappropriate for an ever-shrinking \nagriculture research budget, and what it replaces it with is science-\nbased competition.\n  Currently, the defining criteria for which institutions are awarded \nresearch grants I am afraid is which Members have the most political \nmuscle to get their projects approved by the committee, and I think \nthat is wrong. I think it is unfair to U.S. farmers for Members of the \nSenate and the House to be spendthrift with these limited research \ndollars which continue to shrink each year.\n  Last night, my colleague, the senior Senator from Mississippi, said \nmy amendment would delegate this authority to a ``fancy group of \nscientists on peer review panels.'' Under our peer review, $50 million \nis done by peer review, rather than $100 million, which is already done \nby peer review. Why the difference?\n  I think it is appropriate to a have peer review panel. I think there \nstill will be an opportunity for committee members to identify projects \nthey believe in and to put them in the committee report, but they would \nhave to go through, also, a peer review, and I am sure most of them \nwould do well on this basis.\n  The point here is, if my amendment is adopted, the projects would \nhave to be approved on their merit. We would replace a political \ncompetition with a fair competition.\n  Mr. President, I think it is irresponsible of Congress to continue \nfunding these projects based on politics rather than merit. I would say \nthat the scientists that are experts in their field are far better \nqualified to determine which projects are sound and which are not than \nare the Members of Congress.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this item which I think is not \nonly reform in the agriculture area but a reform in our entire \nbudgeting process. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me say in response, last night we \ndebated this fully. We had the opportunity to talk about all the \ndifferent kinds of agricultural research--applied research, basic \nresearch, research that is targeted to specific problems of a region or \na State. There is a very carefully balanced mix of research dollars in \nthis legislation. Some of it--most of it, as a matter of fact--is done \nby the Agricultural Research Service at Federal laboratories, by \nscientists employed by the Government. Some of it is done through a \nNational Research Initiative which is a competitive, peer-review \nprogram as the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin said.\n  Other dollars are allocated by formula, or under the supervision of \nthe Department of Agriculture, which very closely monitors the use of \nall funds to determine that the research being done has merit and will \nbenefit American agriculture. That is the important part of this.\n  I am not so much concerned with how we divide these funds, but we \nthink the bill before the Senate provides a proper balance. Members of \nCongress have had a say-so in how these dollars are allocated, and that \nis how it should be. They are accountable to the taxpayers. If you turn \nthis all over to a group of scientists somewhere, they are going to \nhave their own buddy system, in effect, and you may see States and \nregions that will get left out, and I think it might be my region that \nmay get left out.\n  You may have the large, more wealthy and well-entrenched hierarchy of \nacademia in the Northeast and the Midwest dividing up all the money \namong themselves, and I am against that.\n  The system we have now that is reflected in this bill and the \nappropriations that we have made here and recommended to the Senate, I \nthink, are very thoughtful. They are well crafted to make sure we serve \nagriculture broadly.\n  I hope the Senate will support our efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). All time has expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to table the Feingold amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion \nto lay on the table the amendment No. 2697, offered by the Senator from \nWisconsin [Mr. Feingold]. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

I ask unanimous consent that the rollcall on this Conrad \namendment be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2698, as Modified\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent to modify my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify in \naccordance with a previous order.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered, and the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 2698), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 82, line 15, strike ``$795,556,000'' and insert \n     ``$717,778,000''.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . REPAYMENT OF ADVANCE DEFICIENCY PAYMENTS FOR 1995 \n                   DISASTER LOSSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subparagraphs (G) and (H) \n     of section 114(a)(2) of the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 \n     U.S.C. 1445j(a)(2)), if the producers on a farm received an \n     advance deficiency payment for the 1995 crop of a commodity \n     and suffered a loss in the production of the crop due to \n     weather or related condition in excess of 35 percent, the \n     producers shall not be required to repay the amount of the \n     payment on lost production \n\n[[Page S 13913]]\n     that does not exceed the percent of production on which crop insurance \n     coverage was not available, as determined by the Secretary of \n     Agriculture.\n       (b) Limitations.--The payments not required to be repaid \n     under subsection (a) shall not exceed--\n       (1) $2,500 for the producers on a farm; and\n       (2) $35,000,000 for all producers.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is to deal with what I think is clearly \nan unintended consequence. In many parts of the country this year we \nhave crop failure, most of it weather related.\n  Whether it is wheat in North Dakota or Kansas, whether it is cotton \nin Mississippi, or corn in Iowa and Illinois, we have a series of \ncircumstances in which unusual crop losses have occurred. That has led \nto a perverse result.\n  Farmers across the country are being presented with a bill to repay \ntheir advance deficiency payments and in many cases they have no crop \nwith which to pay it back. What has happened is producers were paid an \nadvance deficiency payment, prices rose because of these crop shortages \nand shortfalls and, as a result, farmers are expected to repay their \nadvance deficiency payments. But those who have suffered a catastrophic \nloss have no crop with which to make these repayments.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may we have order, please? The Senator \ndeserves respect while we listen to this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will proceed.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is no giveaway program. A farmer must \nhave a loss of at least 35 percent. It is only on that part of farmers' \nproduction that is not eligible for crop insurance that would be \nallowed any forgiveness. There is a $2,500 cap per farmer. On a \nnational basis, there is a $35 million limit. And it is all paid for. \nIt is paid for by reducing the authorization for the Export Enhancement \nProgram from $795 million to $717 million.\n  I just say to my colleagues, this year we had an $800 million \nauthorization. We are going to spend less than $400 million of that. So \nI believe these funds are available for this purpose. It will allow \nfarmers to get forgiveness on part of their advance deficiency payment \nin those circumstances where they have faced massive losses; in those \ncircumstances where they have part of their crop that could not be \ncovered by crop insurance. Where they could have gotten it covered by \ncrop insurance, they are expected to have done so.\n  It is paid for. It is fair. It will relieve suffering as a result of \nthe transition from previous disaster programs to no disaster program. \nI urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota last night \noffered this amendment. We talked about it a good bit. I was determined \nto come to the floor and move to table it and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  But he modified the amendment. He sent a modification to the desk \nand, by so doing, this amendment applies nationwide to farmers who have \nhad weather-related disasters. I am confident that there are some \nsituations where there ought to be an opportunity for some disaster \nassistance.\n  You may remember, I was on the floor arguing strongly for a cotton \ndisaster program and the Senate did not approve it. I think one reason \nwhy they did not is that it was crop specific. This amendment does \napply to all crops. It takes money from the Export Enhancement Program \nto do this. The payments are going to be capped at a $2,500 per farmer \nlimit. It may even go less, because only $35 million is available \nnationwide. Depending upon the needs out there and the justifications \nfor these payments to reimburse for advance deficiency payments where a \nfarmer has not made a crop because of disaster, it may exceed $35 \nmillion. If it does, there will be a proration of that available money \nso each disaster victim may get less than $2,500.\n  I am going to vote for the amendment but I hope this has explained it \nto the extent Senators will know what they are voting on and understand \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think it is a bad amendment. I like \nfarmers, but it is a little early for Christmas. We just did welfare \nyesterday, welfare reform, where we are dealing with low-income \nAmericans. My view is, it is a great idea to give farmers $2,500. I \nthink in my State they will understand if I vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I might just conclude, I would like to say this is \ncompletely paid for. It is paid for out of farm accounts to another \nfarm account where there is, I think, a clear need across the country, \nwhere producers have suffered a catastrophic loss, and where there was \nnot the availability of crop insurance to cover that loss. To the \nextent there is crop insurance available, no payment is available.\n  Again, it is paid for completely out of other agricultural accounts.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina. Does the \nSenator yield time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think all time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I am opposed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will need consent to address this \nissue.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds \nto address the issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I am opposed to the amendment. The Senator says the \nmoney is there. It came from the taxpayers. We are simply putting $35 \nmillion more into another program that we should not be putting money \ninto. The fact we might have put it into some agricultural bill and we \nare now shifting it to another one makes no difference. We are simply \nspending $35 million of the taxpayers' money.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question now occurs \non amendment No. 2698, as modified.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

There will be 4 minutes for debate equally divided prior to \nthe vote.\n\n[[Page S 13914]]\n\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2699, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for permission to \nsend a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2699), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 65, line 18, before the period at the end, insert \n     the following: ``: Provided further, That funds made \n     available under this Act to carry out non-generic activities \n     of the market promotion program established under section 203 \n     (e)(4) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 5623) \n     may be used to provide cost-share assistance only to \n     organizations that are non-Foreign entities recognized as \n     small business concerns under section 3(a) of the Small \n     Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(a)) or to associations described \n     in the first section of the Act entitled `An Act to authorize \n     association of producers of agricultural products', approved \n     February 22, 1922 (7 U.S.C. 291). Provided further, That none \n     of the funds made available under this Act may be used to pay \n     the salaries of personnel who who carry out the market \n     promotion program established under section 203 of the \n     Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 5623) if the \n     aggregate amount of funds and/or commodities under the \n     program exceeds $70,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLeahy be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I would like to have the attention of my \ncolleagues because this will take just about 1 minute to explain to you \nwhat I have done on the Market Promotion Program.\n  I do not believe that it is defensible for the U.S. Congress to be \ngiving money out to the biggest corporations in the world. I have no \nquarrel with the thrust of the Market Promotion Program.\n  So here is what I have done to that program. Four things: First, \neliminate foreign corporations from eligibility; second, leave all the \nagricultural cooperatives as they are regardless of size eligible for \nthe program; third, we cut the amount from $110 million to $70 million; \nand the coup de grace is make it a small-business program. Small \nbusinesses are the ones who have the most difficulty in exporting. It \nis not Gallo Wine. It is not Pillsbury. It is the small-business \ncommunity.\n  So I make it small business, other than agriculture cooperatives. I \nmake it a small-business program as defined by the Small Business \nAdministration. While that varies, it is essentially a company that \ndoes $50 million a year or has 500 or fewer employees.\n  Here is a chance to make the program defensible. You can go home and \ntalk to anybody you want to. Your farmers will love it because they \nstay eligible. Your small-business people love it because they will be \neligible to export. Everybody else will love it because you are \neliminating foreign corporations. And, finally, everybody will love it \nbecause we are cutting from $110 million to $70 million in the full \nknowledge that we are very likely to have to do some compromise with \nthe House.\n  I thank the President.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Kohl be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Let me just make this point. I have brought to the floor a chart \nshowing the dollar value of agricultural exports by State. We are \ntrying to aggressively go after market share with our agriculture \ncommodities. We are trying to promote and expand the business that we \nare able to do in overseas markets, and we are making good progress. \nOne of the reasons why we are is because of this program.\n  Senator Bumpers and Senator Bryan have tried to kill this program. \nThey tried it back on April 6 when we had the supplemental \nappropriations and rescissions bill on the floor. The Senate rejected \ntheir amendment. Yesterday, it rejected an effort. Here is another \namendment. This is an effort to rewrite the whole program that is under \nthe purview of the Agriculture Committee. We should not be asked to do \nthat on the floor of the Senate. The Senators are not that familiar \nwith the details of the program, the eligibility, the restrictions, and \nthe safeguards that are written in there already. In addition, this \namendment reduces the mandatory spending level for this program. That \nis a decision for the Agriculture Committee to make. They are under a \nreconciliation instruction. I understand the Agriculture Committee is \nconsidering this change.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator from \nWashington [Mr. Gorton].\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this amendment does not do what and exempt \nwhat the Senator from Arkansas says it does. He exempts co-ops from his \nprohibition, but he does not exempt the associations, which is the way \nmost of your farmers will operate. There is not any apple grower in the \nState of Washington, I do not believe, who is not small enough to be a \nsmall business, but when he operates through an association, as he does \nand as they always do, he will not be exempted from the cuts that the \nSenator is imposing on him, nor will our asparagus growers, nor will \nany of your farmers who operate in that fashion.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The modification I just sent to the desk took care of \nthe very thing that the Senator from Washington was complaining about.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this \nrollcall vote be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Mississippi to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Arkansas. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] is \nabsent due to illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nOregon [Mr. Hatfield] would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] is \nabsent because of attending a funeral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell).

Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2699) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table. \n\n[[Page S 13915]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n                        rural tourism in alaska\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to engage my distinguished \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Mississippi, in a colloquy \nconcerning rural tourism in Alaska.\n  There are precious few opportunities for economic development \nthroughout Alaska's 210 rural villages and communities, reflected by \nthe fact that unemployment rates remain as high as 80 percent. Coupled \nwith the geographical separation of these remote villages from other \npopulation centers, many Alaskans are denied access to the basic goods \nand services that stimulate local economic development.\n  The single bright spot on the horizon relates to growing interest in \na rural Alaska tourism industry. In response, Alaska Village Initiative \nhas, for several years, sought to offset the decline of traditional \neconomic sectors with effective support to the rural tourism industry. \nI am told that approximately $300,000 would be required to establish \nand operate a Rural Tourism Development Center, RTDC, the next critical \nstep to assisting these Native Alaskan villages along the road to self-\nsufficiency.\n  The RTDC will provide a range of technical assistance services to \nrural communities and individuals interested in developing tourism \nprojects in Alaska. It will be a ``one-stop shop'' to assist \nentrepreneurs in developing their ideas from start to finish. It will \nalso coordinate a wide variety of existing Government programs engaged \nin some aspect of rural tourism development.\n  The Department of Agriculture funds rural enterprise grants to \naddress just this sort of need nationwide. Since such a grant would \nappear to be highly justified, I ask the chairman of the subcommittee \nwhether the necessary funds could be provided to establish and operate \na Rural Tourism Development Center in Alaska?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. As the Senator from Alaska noted, the subcommittee did \naddress rural development grants, but was unaware of the problem in \nAlaska. I appreciate the Senator bringing this problem to my attention. \nI urge the Department to give equal consideration to an application to \naddress this problem as those included in the committee report.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, the aquaculture industry is of vital \nimportance to the economy of west Alabama. In some west Alabama \ncounties, for example, over 20 percent of the total population is \nemployed directly in the production or processing of fish. The \nSoutheastern Fish Cultural Laboratory in Marion, AL has played a major \nrole in this process. It's my understanding that there are similar \nfacilities in Arkansas and Mississippi.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. It is true that aquaculture is of great importance to \nthe States of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama. In Arkansas, the \naquaculture industry is growing by leaps and bounds and the Stuttgart \nAquaculture Center has been vital to that growth.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The same can be said about the National Warm Water \nAquaculture Research Center in Stoneville, MS. The expansion of the \naquaculture industry in Mississippi, and the Nation has been \nresponsible for sustaining rural economies that were recently in dire \nsituations.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. We now have an annual trade deficit in fisheries products \nranging from $4.5 to $7 billion. This trade imbalance is the largest of \nall agricultural commodities and ranks second only to petroleum among \nnatural products. Our domestic aquaculture industry has the potential \nof turning this trade deficit into a trade surplus with only modest \nsupport and encouragement.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. While it is true that overall, agriculture has a \npositive balance of trade, the aquaculture sector does not. At the \npresent time, the United States does not have the production \ncapabilities to meet domestic demand for fish and fish products and \ntherefore we are placed in the position that we are forced to import to \nmeet the domestic demand. The aquaculture industry has the opportunity \nto turn this situation around and we should facilitate this process.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Not only do we have the opportunity to turn our trade \nsituation around relative to aquaculture, there is also a real human \nfactor to be considered as well. Nearly 300,000 Americans are employed \nin aquaculture related work. The catfish industry alone accounts for \n121,000 domestic jobs and nearly $2.5 billion in income. If we are able \nto facilitate the growth of this industry, the economic impact \npotential is overwhelming.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. As my colleagues from Mississippi and Arkansas are well \naware, the U.S. aquaculture industry has grown more than 15 percent \nannually since 1980. As a result, aquaculture has emerged as a solid \nalternative agricultural opportunity and has allowed farmers to \ndiversify. The research and extension infrastructure has been a major \nresource for aquaculture. Without this research it is doubtful that the \naquaculture industry would have gotten off the ground.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I could not agree more with my distinguished colleague \nand Alabama. The research that has supported the growth of this \nindustry has been essential.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Aquaculture is primed to take the next step forward and \nestablish itself as an integral and vital form of agriculture. What \naquaculture needs now is to be consolidated and coordinated under one \ndepartment--the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Currently jurisdiction \nfor aquaculture is spread out among the USDA, the Department of \nInterior, and the Department of Commerce. The Agriculture Research \nService could truly assert itself in this regard if the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture is allowed to assume a leadership role in aquaculture.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. In an effort to facilitate the continued growth of the \naquaculture industry and provide the necessary resource tools, it is \nhighly desirable that all relevant departments and agencies of the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, including Agricultural Research Service, \ntake steps necessary to support research in the field of aquaculture \nand particularly to exercise its authority to assist and help the \nindustry and related fields of aquaculture including the cooperation \nwith and/or the assumption of fish culture laboratories including the \nSoutheastern Fish Culture Lab at Marion, AL.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I agree that the suggestion by Senator Heflin is \ndesirable and should be carried out as long as it does not result in \nduplication of ongoing research activities at other research \nfacilities.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I concur in what Senator Cochran has just said.\n                      certified mediation programs\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I note the chairman and ranking member of \nthe subcommittee are on the floor. H.R. 1976 provides funding of \n$3,000,000 for grants to certified State mediation programs. Mediation \nis a proven effective tool in resolving disputes between the Department \nof Agriculture and America's farmers and ranchers. And as you know, \nmediation has been used for quite some time with regard to loans.\n  However, current law [7 U.S.C. sections 5101 through 5106] also \ndirects certified State mediation programs to offer mediation in other \nareas of dispute with the Department of Agriculture. These areas \ninclude wetlands determinations, compliance with farm programs, \nincluding conservation programs, agricultural credit, rural water loan \nprograms, grazing on National Forest System lands, pesticides, and \nother issues as the Secretary of Agriculture considers appropriate.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator is correct. The statute provides that \ncertified State mediation programs are to be used for a wide variety of \ndisputes with the Department of Agriculture. And as the law provides, \nin States with certified mediation programs, the Secretary of \nAgriculture is required to participate in ``good faith'' with certified \nState mediation programs.\n  Mr. CONRAD. While the legislation is clear, there is a question \nregarding the Senate Committee's report language of H.R. 1976. The \nreport language states: ``Grants will be solely for operation and \nadministration of the State's agricultural loan mediation program.'' Is \nit the committee's intent that federal funding not be used for other \nissues covered by the certified State mediation program?\n\n[[Page S 13916]]\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. No. It was not the committee's intent to limit the \nactivities of the certified State mediation programs as currently \nallowed by statute.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Therefore, it is my understanding that the report \nlanguage should not be read to limit or exclude activities of the \ncertified State mediation programs that are currently described in the \nstatute. The grants shall be used by certified State mediation programs \nin a manner which is consistent with 7 U.S.C. sections 5101 through \n5106.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator is correct. The report language should not \nbe read to limit the activities of the certified State mediation \nprograms which receive grants from the Federal Government.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senators for clarifying the report language \nwith regard to certified State mediation programs.\n                           tourism amendment\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last night an amendment I had proposed \nto H.R. 1976 was adopted unanimously by the Senate. I thank the \nmanagers of this bill, the Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] and \nthe Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] for their assistance and \ncooperation in this matter. I also wish to thank the chairman and \nranking member of the Agriculture Committee for their help and guidance \non this very important rural development issue intended to clarify that \ntourist and other recreational-type businesses located in rural \ncommunities are eligible for loans under the Rural Business and \nCooperative Development Service's [RBCDS] Business and Industry [B] \nLoan Guarantee Program, funded in this bill in the Rural Community \nAdvancement Program.\n  This is an issue that I first became aware of, and especially \ninterested in, after a constituent approached me late last summer at \nthe Rusk County listening session I held at Mount Senario College in \nLadysmith, WI. The constituent owns a tourist lodge in northern \nWisconsin and expressed his deep frustration at a problem Wisconsin \ntourist resort owners were having in attempting to obtain financing for \nrural development. Specifically, this constituent was interested in \nobtaining funding from the B Program to build an 18-hole golf course \nnext to his lodge, but was told that recreational facilities were \nprohibited from receiving funding under the program. Concerned by this \ninformation, I decided to contact the Agency about the program. What I \nsince learned is a clear illustration of why so many Americans are \nfrustrated with the Federal Government.\n  The B Program was established by the Rural Development Act of 1972 \nwith the aim of improving America's rural economy by creating, \ndeveloping, or financing business, industry and employment in rural \nAmerica. When the B Program was first established, no restrictions \nwere placed on guaranteeing loans to tourist or other recreational-type \nbusinesses located in rural communities. However, on July 6, 1983, the \nRural Development Administration revised its internal lending policy \nrelative to the B Program and placed restrictions on the program's \nregulations by prohibiting such funding to tourist or recreation \nfacilities. As a result, currently these loan guarantees are not made \navailable to tourist or other recreational-type businesses.\n  This policy does not make too much sense to me especially since \ntourism can definitely play a major role in the development of rural \nareas. In fact, nationally tourism is a $400 billion industry, and is a \n$5.6 billion industry in Wisconsin alone. After initially contacting \nthe RBCDS in September of last year, I was advised that the Agency was \ncurrently undergoing a review of its loan guarantee policy. I urged the \nAgency to consider changing its internal lending policy to allow \nguaranteed business and industry assistance to be made to recreational-\ntype businesses located in rural areas. I want to make it clear that \nthis policy is not the result of any restriction in the authorizing \nstatutes, but rather an agency decision to restrict such funds.\n  In fact, a General Accounting Office [GAO] report released in July \n1992 on the patterns of use in the B Program came to the same \nconclusion. It suggests that the B Program is underutilized, which is \ndue in part to the Agency's current restrictions on using B funds for \nactivities related to tourism. Furthermore, the GAO recommends revising \nthe B program regulations to allow the selective use of loan \nguarantees for these activities.\n  All indications are that the Agency seems to be leaning in favor of \nadopting these changes. I ask unanimous consent that two letters I have \nreceived from the RBCDS indicating they ``intend'' to remove these \nrestrictions, one dated October 14, 1994 and the other dated July 14, \n1995, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   U.S. Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                             Rural Development Administration,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 14, 1994.\n     Hon. Russell D. Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: Thank you for your letter concerning \n     the availability of Rural Development Administration (RDA) \n     loan guarantees for tourist resorts located in rural \n     communities. RDA programs are administered at the local level \n     by the Farmers Home Administration.\n       On July 6, 1983, the RDA Business and Industry (B) loan \n     guarantee program regulations were revised and restrictions \n     were placed on guaranteeing loans for tourist, recreation, \n     and amusement facilities. A recent study by the General \n     Accounting Office recommended that the agency revisit this \n     issue. As a result, RDA is considering developing regulations \n     that would allow loan guarantees in connection with certain \n     types of tourist and recreation enterprises.\n       The purpose of the B program is to create jobs which will \n     improve the economic climate in rural communities and provide \n     lasting community benefits. You may be assured that your \n     comments in support of this purpose will be taken into \n     consideration.\n       We appreciate your support for this program and hope that \n     you find this information helpful.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Wilbur T. Peer,\n     Acting Administrator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                   U.S. Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                             Rural Development Administration,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Russell D. Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     the proposed changes to the Business and Industry (B) loan \n     guarantee program. As you know, under the Department of \n     Agriculture reorganization, this program is administered by \n     the Rural Business and Cooperative Development Service \n     (RBCDS). We appreciate learning of your concern and regret \n     the delay in responding to your inquiry.\n       We appreciate your interest in our programs and are pleased \n     to have the opportunity to respond to your concerns. As you \n     note, tourist, recreation, and amusement facilities are \n     currently ineligible loan purposes under the B program. \n     However, a study by the General Accounting Office recommended \n     that the Agency revisit the issue of making loans for these \n     purposes and, as a result, RBCDS is developing regulations \n     that would allow loan guarantees in connection with certain \n     types of tourist and recreation enterprises.\n       The proposed draft regulation would remove restrictions \n     placed on guaranteeing loans to hotels, motels, tourist \n     resorts, beds-and-breakfasts, convention centers and other \n     business involved in recreational services that meet certain \n     standards. However, the regulation will continue to prohibit \n     loan guarantees for golf courses, race tracks and other \n     gambling facilities.\n       Currently, the regulations changes are being reviewed by \n     our Office of the General Counsel. Unfortunately, we cannot \n     predict with any certainty when the final regulations will be \n     published in the Federal Register.\n       Again, we appreciate your continued interest in our \n     programs and hope that this information is helpful to you. If \n     we can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to \n     contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Dayton J. Watkins,\n\n                          Acting Administrator, Rural Business and\n                                  Cooperative Development Service.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it has been over 3 years since the GAO \nmade its recommendations and over a year since I first contacted the \nRBCDS about this matter. However, rural America and, in particular, \nrural Wisconsin communities simply do not have the luxury to wait until \nFederal agencies finally decide to act.\n  Mr. President, rural America is indeed at a crossroads in terms of \nconverting from traditional resource-based economies which are becoming \nless economically viable, to other types of activities which also make \na substantial contribution to better living in these areas. Tourism can \ncertainly play a major role in improving the qualify of life in many \nrural communities and, in fact, rural tourism \n\n[[Page S 13917]]\nshould be recognized for what it truly is--a legitimate means to \nenhance economic development in, and the copmetitiveness of, rural \nAmerica.\n  Tourism can, and does, create jobs which help to improve the economic \nclimate in rural communities and provide lasting community benefits. \nHowever, without economic assistance to help stimulate growth in rural \ndevelopment, any such successful transition to tourism may prove \ndifficult. That is why the Government must act, and act in a timely \nfashion, to assist the economies of rural America.\n  Mr. President, this matter is of importance to rural America. This \namendment is not controversial, and will have no budgetary impact. It \nsimply clarifies that tourist and other recreational-type businesses \nlocated in rural communities are eligible for loans under the B \nprogram. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and move for \nits immediate consideration. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to address the Department of \nAgriculture and Related Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year \n1996.\n  The Senate-reported bill provides $63.1 billion in new budget \nauthority [BA] and $45.6 billion in new outlays to fund most of the \nprograms of the Department of Agriculture and other related agencies.\n  All of the funding in this bill is nondefense spending. This \nsubcommittee received no allocation under the crime reduction trust \nfund.\n  When outlays for prior-year appropriations and other adjustments are \ntaken into account, the Senate-reported bill totals $63.2 billion in BA \nand $52.8 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1996.\n  The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee 602(b) allocation \ntotals $63.2 billion in budget authority [BA] and $52.8 billion in \noutlays. Within this amount, $13.3 billion in BA and $13.6 billion in \noutlays is for discretionary spending.\n  Mr. President, there are two issues that I would like to highlight. \nOne deals with a scoring issue and reconciliation, and the other \nrelates to disaster assistance.\n\n\n                             scoring issue\n\n  Mr. President, this bill includes mandatory savings to offset \ndiscretionary spending. I would caution the committee against including \nsuch savings in this bill.\n  As you know, this is an historic year in which we have set forth a \nplan to balance the budget in 7 years. The budget resolution contained \nreconciliation instructions that would cut mandatory spending by more \nthan $600 billion over the next 7 years.\n  The authorizing committees already have a very difficult job to meet \nthis target. These committees need the maximum flexibility to achieve \nthese very significant deficit reduction savings.\n  When mandatory savings are included in appropriations bills, it is \ngenerally to offset discretionary spending, rather than to achieve \nsavings for deficit reduction.\n  There are six provisions in this bill which result in mandatory \nsavings totaling $521 million in BA and $381 million in outlays--some \nof which will be used in reconciliation.\n  One example is the freeze on the food stamp standard deduction at the \n1995 level, which is also in the welfare reform bill now before the \nSenate. This provision saves $190 million in both BA and outlays in \nfiscal year 1996.\n  Because welfare reform is likely to be included in reconciliation, \nthis provision will count toward the reconciliation instruction of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee.\n  We made a commitment this year to deficit reduction. We cannot \naccomplish this goal by double-counting savings in both appropriations \nand reconciliation bills.\n  The House struck most of the provisions from its bill at the \ninsistence of the leadership and on behalf of the authorizing committee \nbecause the House fully intends most of these savings to be included in \nthe reconciliation bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nchairman of the House Agriculture Committee outlining the need for the \nauthorizing committees and appropriations committees to respect the \njurisdictional parameters on mandatory and discretionary spending be \ninserted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                     Committee on Agriculture,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 18, 1995.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Budget, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: During consideration of its 1996 \n     Agriculture Appropriations bill, House Appropriators and \n     Authorizers went through a very difficult and exhausting \n     round of talks on the issue of mandatory and discretionary \n     spending authority. Accordingly, in an agreement worked out \n     by the House Leadership, the agriculture authorizing \n     committee was directed to stay within the bounds of mandatory \n     spending accounts and the agriculture appropriations \n     subcommittee within the parameters of discretionary spending \n     accounts.\n       It is my understanding that you are faced with a similar \n     situation in several of the FY 96 appropriation bills coming \n     before the Senate. I would have to agree with you that in \n     addition to the leadership generated accord on this issue in \n     this body, it has indeed been a gentleman's agreement that \n     the appropriators do not steal from the authorizers and the \n     authorizers do not steal from the appropriators. At a time \n     when funds are diminishing rapidly in both the discretionary \n     and mandatory side of the agriculture equation, each \n     committee is being required to reform and drastically reduce \n     its funding. Thus, intrusions by the various committees into \n     accounts not under their purview are particularly harmful to \n     the budgetary and policy reform process.\n       With this in mind, I was disappointed to learn that not \n     only has the Senate Appropriations Committee chosen to \n     disregard the will of the House on the issue of mandatory and \n     discretionary spending, they have done so to the tune of over \n     $800 million. This not only disregards sound fiscal and \n     budgetary policy, but it also threatens real reform of \n     agriculture programs and the efforts of this committee to \n     reform mandatory entitlement spending.\n       I appreciate your tireless efforts to reduce the budget \n     deficit and bring sanity to the federal budget. I want to \n     pledge to you the full support of my committee and our \n     colleagues in the House who represent rural districts and \n     enlist your support in opposing any agriculture \n     appropriations bill that contains spending cuts by the \n     appropriations committees to mandatory programs.\n       With best regards.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Pat Roberts,\n                                                         Chairman.\n       Enclosure.\n\n                        AGRICULTURE SUBCOMMITTEE                        \n  [Spending totals--House-passed bill (fiscal year 1996, in millions of \n                                dollars)]                               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       Budget           \n                                                     authority   Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed.....................................  .........     3,751\n    H.R. 1976, as passed by the House..............     13,310     9,841\n    Scorekeeping adjustment........................  .........  ........\n                                                    --------------------\n        Subtotal nondefense discretionary..........     13,310    13,592\n                                                    ====================\nMandatory:                                                              \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed.....................................        501     3,337\n    H.R. 1976, as passed by the House..............     48,721    35,750\n    Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                       \n     Budget........................................                     \n    Resolution assumptions.........................        620        90\n                                                    --------------------\n    Subtotal mandatory.............................     49,842    39,177\n                                                    ====================\n        Adjusted bill total........................     63,152    52,769\n                                                    ====================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n    Defense discretionary..........................  .........  ........\n    Nondefense discretionary.......................     13,310    13,608\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund.............  .........  ........\n    Mandatory......................................     49,842    39,177\n                                                    --------------------\n        Total allocation...........................     63,152    52,785\n                                                    ====================\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate Subcommittee                     \n 602(b) allocation:                                                     \n    Defense discretionary..........................  .........  ........\n    Nondefense discretionary.......................          0       -16\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund.............  .........  ........\n    Mandatory......................................  .........  ........\n                                                    --------------------\n        Total allocation...........................          0       -16\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I am concerned that the authorizing \ncommittees will not have full flexibility if appropriation bills \ncontinue to use mandatory savings to offset discretionary spending.\n  I would hope that the authorizing and Appropriations Committee would \nresolve this issue in conference.\n\n\n                             crop insurance\n\n  The Senate-reported bill includes $41 million in an hoc disaster \nassistance for the 1995 crop of cotton that was adversely affected by \ninsect damage.\n  I would like to remind everyone that a $5 billion baseline adjustment \nwas made last year to accommodate crop insurance reform, which was \nenacted into law.\n  The crop insurance reform was supposed to replace the system of \nproviding assistance through ad hoc disaster legislation.\n  On August 25, 1994, I stated on the Senate floor that the crop \ninsurance \n\n[[Page S 13918]]\nreform will only work if Congress restrains itself from providing \nfuture ad hoc disaster assistance.\n  I also said this will be difficult based on past experiences. What I \nhave said has come true, and I believe that this is the beginning of \nthe end of the newly reformed crop insurance program if we continue \nalong the path that the Senate-reported bill has taken.\n  The administration strongly objects to this provision in the bill \nstating that it is in direct conflict with one of the major tenets of \nlast year's crop insurance reform, namely, that farmers would be \ndiscouraged from risk-management through crop insurance as long as \nFederal crop disaster payments were continually provided on an ad hoc \nbasis.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to indicate that I intend \nto vote for H.R.1976, the Agriculture Appropriations Act of 1995.\n  I believe that H.R.1976 is a reasonable piece of legislation that \nestablishes adequate funding levels for one of the most important \nsegments of our Nation s economy, the American farm and farmer.\n  While I intend to vote for this legislation, I remain very concerned \nby the actions of the Senate last night in approving the amendment \noffered by our colleague from Alaska, Senator Stevens, to direct the \nSecretary of Agriculture to take away from the Under Secretary for \nNatural Resources and Environment any responsibility in the areas he \nnow administers relating to forest management.\n  As many of my colleagues who opposed this amendment have noted, we \nhere in the Senate often disagree vehemently on matters of policy. I \nhave disagreed with my Republican colleagues in the Senate, and I have \ndisagreed with my Democratic colleagues in the Senate. I have disagreed \nwith both Democratic and Republican administrations. However, Mr. \nPresident, I am concerned that, in adopting the amendment by the \nSenator from Alaska, we have crossed the boundary of reasonable policy \ndifferences. I am afraid that we have strayed into an area where when \nwe disagree with someone in the Administration, we can simply come to \nthe floor and in essence fire that person. Mr. President, that is a \ndangerous and, I think, wrong precedent to be setting. Congress should \nlet the executive branch direct the internal, personnel affairs of the \nexecutive branch. That is the system that the Constitution establishes \nand we should not try to undermine that by legislative fiat.\n  Again, Mr. President, I will vote for the agriculture appropriations \nbill, however, it is my sincere hope that the conference committee will \nremove the language added by the Senator from Alaska s amendment. If \nnot, I will have serious concerns about being able to support the \nconference report.\n                 land grant funding for tribal colleges\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my strong support \nfor the amendment offered by my colleague from New Mexico. This \namendment would provide $8.15 million in funding for extension, \neducation and capacity-building programs for the 29 tribal colleges in \nthis country.\n  The programs authorized under the Equity in Education Land-Grant Act \nof 1994 for fiscal year 1996 include a $4.6 million endowment payment \nfor tribal colleges, which currently serve nearly 25,000 students. \nHowever, the law also authorized $1.45 million for curriculum \nstrengthening grants, the $1.7 million for competitive capacity \nbuilding grants, and the $5 million for extension programs--and these \ncritical areas remain unfunded.\n  Land grant status has created new opportunities for tribal colleges \nand for the people served by them. To date, billions of dollars in \nland-grant programs for rural America have produced tremendous \neducational and economic benefits, but Indian lands have received very \nlittle. This makes no sense. Large amounts of Indian agricultural land \nis idle or underdeveloped, largely due to a lack of adequate \nagricultural training on reservations. And since 75 percent of 54.5 \nmillion acres of Indian land in this country is agricultural, a \ncritical component of long-term economic self-sufficiency of tribes is \nhelping people on reservations receive the training they need to use \nthis land to its potential.\n  Tribal colleges, such as Turtle Mountain Community College in \nBelcourt, ND, can provide this training. Even though they are located \nin areas where unemployment ranges from 45 to 86 percent, tribal \ncollege graduates are employed at rates of 74 to 85 percent--which \nmeans these graduates have contributed millions of dollars in Federal \ntaxes and provided leadership in their communities.\n  The need for agriculture training is extremely high on reservations, \nbut it has not been met to date. And if tribes are to develop their \nnatural resources and become more economically self-sufficient, we must \nmeet that need. That is why I am pleased to support the Bingaman \namendment, and I hope my colleagues will do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nthe engrossment of the amendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am going to ask unanimous consent--we \nare probably not going to take any time for debate before the vote on \nfinal passage. I ask unanimous consent there be 10 minutes available \nfor concluding remarks before the vote on final passage. I do not \nexpect that to be used, but I put that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of the time on \nthis side.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays, and I ask unanimous consent that this \nvote be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the remaining time yielded back?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield back such time as I may have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass? The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

I will make available an \nintelligence briefing to Senators in the near period.\n  I will not object to this, but I do want the Senate to know that I \nbelieve Senator Levin from Michigan and others will arrange for an \nintelligence briefing related to this, and those interested should \ncontact Senator Levin for that briefing. I think that may speed it up.\n  I do not object.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? I inquire of \nthe Senator from Colorado whether he objects to our temporarily laying \naside his amendment and taking up other amendments?\n  Mr. BROWN. The concerns expressed by Senator Levin and Senator Glenn \ndo request some additional time for this briefing. I think it would be \nonly due courtesy to them to allow some additional time, so I will not \nobject to moving ahead with the D'Amato amendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, it \nis a little premature to say we have this set up or to imply we do \nbecause we do not have it set up. We do not know whether we can get the \nproper official to do the briefing. We will arrange that as fast as we \ncan and let everybody know about that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the request of the \nSenator from New Jersey for 7 minutes under morning business?\n  Hearing no objection, the Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/20/senate-section/article/S13919-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13919-S13920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FDA SHOULD REGULATE TOBACCO\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wanted to take a little time to \ncomment on some legislation that was introduced this morning by my \ncolleague, friend, and distinguished Senator from Kentucky earlier this \nday, having to do with tobacco.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by commending the Senator from Kentucky \nfor his acknowledgment that smoking is a serious public health problem \namong our young people.\n  Senator Ford's legislation seeks to curb advertising directed at \nyoung people and to limit children's access to tobacco. These are \nimportant goals. However, I strongly oppose the provision in the \nSenator's legislation that would seek to strip the FDA from asserting \nits authority to regulate tobacco products.\n  Mr. President, nicotine is an addictive drug. This has not only been \nproven by a number of scientific studies, but was also revealed in \nconfidential industry documents in the past year.\n  Consider the following statement contained in an industry document by \nan official with the Brown and Williamson tobacco company. It said, \n``Moreover, nicotine is addictive. We are then,'' he goes on to say \n``in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug.'' Mr. \nPresident, this is directly from the tobacco industry.\n  Now, last month President Clinton took a bold step to fight teenage \nsmoking. He stood up to the industry, the tobacco industry, and he did \nthe right thing. He deserves a lot of credit. President Clinton took \nthe side of parents, American parents. They do not want their children \nsmoking. Neither do I and neither do most here.\n  The President is targeting smoking by teenagers, and I agree with \nthis approach. It goes right to the source of the problem, especially \nif you consider the following: 3,000 children start smoking every day. \nMore than 80 percent of all smokers had their first cigarette before \nthe age of 18. If a child does not smoke before age 18, it is very \nunlikely that they will become a smoker in their adult life.\n  More than half of all adult smokers had already become addicted \nregular smokers before they were 18 years of age.\n  It is clear that smoking is a pediatric disease that ultimately \ncontributes to over 400,000 deaths a year, enormous financial costs, \nterrific family dislocation and puts a burden on us that continues to \nadd problems to our deficit.\n  Unfortunately, it is getting worse. Between 1991 and 1994, the \npercentage of eighth graders who smoked increased by 30 percent. The \npercentage of 10th graders who smoke increased by 22 percent.\n  Mr. President, we need the FDA to help us fight this major public \nhealth problem. Nicotine is an addictive drug, and the FDA is supposed \nto regulate addictive drugs. There is no reason to make a special \nexception for the tobacco industry.\n  Mr. President, it would be a terrible mistake to tie the agency's \nhands in this critical area. We need a strong watchdog to ensure \ncompliance with the President's initiatives. We also have to be \nprepared to take additional steps to reduce teenage smoking. The FDA \nhas a critical role to play.\n  Mr. President, ensuring compliance with President Clinton's new \ninitiative is not going to be easy. In fact, I now have seen firsthand \nhow easy it is for children to purchase tobacco products. In New \nJersey, we have fairly strict rules on the ability to purchase tobacco \nby those underage. I went on a New Jersey Health Department compliance \ncheck in a couple of towns in New Jersey with two 17-year-olds. We went \nto 10 places to purchase cigarettes. These minors were able to purchase \ncigarettes at all 10 locations without a question, whether it was a \nmachine which was supposed to be controlled by the management of the \nstore of the location or whether it was directly over the counter.\n  This is outrageous, Mr. President. The products they were able to \nbuy--and this is not to single out a particular brand because that is \nirrelevant--but the products are the ones that we commonly see, the \nbetter advertised, the more popular. They just happen to be there; some \nof them had room on the counter. You did not even have to look at the \nclerk to buy them--just get up and pay for them, no questions asked.\n  Mr. President, I think it is obvious keeping tobacco away from young \npeople is going to be very difficult. We need the FDA to help lead that \nbattle.\n  Now, unfortunately, the legislation of our distinguished colleague \nfrom Kentucky will strip them of the power needed to respond to this \npublic health crisis. I intend to strongly oppose the proposal and to \nfight as hard as I can to protect the health and well-being and the \nfutures of our young people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I might proceed as \nin morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n[[Page S 13920]]\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from New Jersey \nand I are friends, and we disagree in some respects on this one \nparticular item. One point I would like to make to the distinguished \nSenator is that I have made an extra effort to put forward legislation \nthat would do what he wants to do. He does not have any penalty in what \nhe is talking about. Under my bill, if it was law, those clerks would \nhave a penalty. It would be a double penalty. And I think we would stop \nthem. At least they would think before they would sell to possible \nunderage people, or teenagers.\n  So, what we have attempted to do here is not move in and tell an \nadult--make a decision for him. As I said earlier, one of the things we \npride ourselves in is to try to keep Big Brother out of our business. \nSenator after Senator after Senator has stood on this floor and fussed \nabout FDA. They are not completing their business. They are not getting \nthe job done. They are not approving drugs for the elderly. They are \nnot doing all this. I can go back and give you page after page after \npage.\n  Now they want to take on this huge responsibility, additional \nresponsibility. And we already have the mechanism to do it: The Federal \nTrade Commission and Health and Human Services. We already have the \nvehicle. Why create another bureaucracy? And why should I tax you, \nindirectly, and say, ``You give me money so I can put you out of \nbusiness.'' They want $150 million a year.\n  My distinguished friend from New Jersey is proud of the fact that he \ntook a small business and built it into a very large business. But if \nGovernment had said to him, ``Give me money so we can put you out of \nbusiness,'' I do not believe the Senator would have liked that a bit.\n  He will say there is a difference between his product and the one we \nare discussing here today. That is fine. But the principle is still the \nsame. So we take the vending machine law, the strongest one in the \ncountry, and say that if you break this law then the States and the \nprincipals are fined; they are double. And we have the mechanism to do \nit right now. So the constitutional question that we have is another \nproblem, as to the content of the advertisement.\n  I am not going to be voting for an additional tax. I do not believe \nmy friend from New Jersey will vote for an additional tax either. I \nhope we listen to him as he talks about the additional smokers per day. \nEvery day we delay here, every day we say we are not going to help Ford \npass his legislation, means that it is another day's delay. We could do \nit today rather than tomorrow. I think I have tried my best. But best \nis, apparently, not good enough.\n  So the FDA is just adding another layer of bureaucracy. They are \nasking for money, under their regulations. Lord knows how they are \ngoing to get it without an act of Congress. The constitutional question \non first amendment rights--they have sent the lawyers from the \nmanufacturers and advertising groups all to the courts the same day. So \nthat will be in the courts for years and years and years.\n  So what is happening here, if we can pass my legislation we can get \nto the root of the problem. We banned advertising around schools. We \nbanned the use of tobacco in movies. We banned the use of tobacco of \nany form in videos or amusement areas. But we do not say that an adult \ndoes not have a choice.\n  So what we are getting ready to do here, in the guise of protecting \nteenagers, is to go to prohibition. That is my problem. I am trying to \nbe helpful. I am trying my best to be helpful. If he was in my place, I \nthink he would be doing the same thing. But he says he is not and I \nunderstand that.\n  But rights are rights. When you become of age you have a right to \nmake a choice in this country. Let us stop them under 18. I am for \nthat, and my legislation will do that. If we just get a little help, \ninstead of delaying the implementation of this law--I think we ought to \ngo ahead and pass it so we can stop, sooner than later, teenage smoking \nin this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in just a couple of minutes, one of \nthe things that happens to us occasionally on this floor is that we \nhave to argue with friends for whom we have respect and admiration \nbecause we disagree. I must give the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky credit because he has worked cooperatively to try to reduce \nthe exposure for young people to tobacco, recognizing along the way, \nobviously, the possibility exists that it could be--I do not want to \nput words in his mouth, but his legislative proposal suggests it could \nbe addictive. So it is a long step along the way. I thank him and I \nrespect the Senator from Kentucky's legislative perspective here.\n  I would say that I believe the FDA involvement is essential to the \nsuccess of the program of curbing teenage smoking. I do appreciate and \nunderstand the position that the Senator from Kentucky is in. He is \nconcerned about the farmers in Kentucky who grow tobacco, those who \nprocess the product, and I know he has long been an advocate of trying \nto make a sensible approach to the marketing of tobacco products \nwithout curtailing people's decisionmaking. I respect that.\n  But, Mr. President, I really do think the only way to make this an \neffective battle against teenage smoking is to include the FDA, to give \nthem the responsibility as they would have for any other addictive \ndrug, and to pursue the course of action proposed by the President of \nthe United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato], is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/20/senate-section/article/S13919-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13920-S13971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato], for himself, Mr. \n     Pressler, Mr. Sarbanes, and Ms. Snowe, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2709.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n\n                   limitation on assistance to turkey\n\n       Sec.   . Not more than $21,000,000 of the funds \n     appropriated in this Act under the heading ``Economic Support \n     Fund'' may be made available to the Government of Turkey.\n       On page 11, line 10, before the period at the end of the \n     line, insert the following: ``: Provided further, That \n     $10,000,000 of the funds made available under this heading \n     shall be transferred to, and merged with, the following \n     accounts in the following amounts: $5,000,000 for the \n     Department of the Treasury, and $5,000,000 for the Department \n     of Justice, to support law enforcement training activities in \n     foreign countries for the purpose of improving the \n     effectiveness of the United States in investigating and \n     prosecuting transnational offenses''.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nSenator Pressler, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Snowe and myself. I rise to \npropose an amendment to the foreign operations bill, which will help \nrestore credibility to our foreign assistance program by ensuring that \none of the largest recipients of United States aid, the Republic of \nTurkey, adheres to internationally accepted standards for human rights \nand humanitarian practices.\n  My amendment will cap at $21 million the amount of economic support \nfunds that the United States gives to Turkey. Ten million dollars in \nsavings by capping these funds would then be appropriated by $5 million \neach to the Treasury and the Justice Departments to support law \nenforcement training \n\n[[Page S 13921]]\nactivities in foreign countries for the purpose of improving the \neffectiveness of the United States in investigating and prosecuting \ntransnational offenses.\n  I am very pleased, and I want to commend the subcommittee, which has \nappropriated funds for the FBI with the same purpose. I want to make \nsure that there are enough funds to support the Treasury Department and \nother Justice Department activities in this area as well.\n  Mr. President, let me make it clear that this amendment does not \nrestrict United States military aid to Turkey. It does not restrict. \nBut what I am attempting to do is send a message that the United States \nwill no longer tolerate the human rights abuses in violation of \ninternational law that Turkey has and is conducting.\n  This year the Turkish Government will receive $320 million in \nmilitary aid from American taxpayers to address its security needs. In \ntotal, Turkey will receive $366 million. My amendment will bring this \ntotal to $341 million.\n  The time has come after years of fruitless so-called quiet diplomacy \nfor the Congress to take the lead in addressing a broad range of issues \ndealing with Turkey. Let me go over some of them.\n  One, worsening human rights records; two, its continued blockade of \nhumanitarian supplies to Armenia. It is incredible in this day and age \nthat humanitarian supplies are being blocked to Armenia. Three, its \nrefusal to work toward a lasting and equitable settlement in Cyprus, a \nsituation that has been permitted to exist year after year after year; \nfour, its denial of basic rights to its Kurdish minority.\n  In each of these areas, Turkey has consistently violated \ninternational treaties and agreements to which it is a signatory. Among \nthese are the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Final Act \nof the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the \nEuropean Convention on Human Rights.\n  Mr. President, the Congress in the fiscal year 1995 foreign aid bill \nwithheld 10 percent of the principal amount of direct loans for Turkey \nbased on its human rights record and the situation in Cyprus. The \nTurkish Government has spoken clearly on that issue. It will reject any \nU.S. aid tied to its human rights record. It is clear, given the \nTurkish Government's response, that we must deal differently with \nTurkey on this subject.\n  On the question of human rights we need only to look at the State \nDepartment's recently released 1995 Country Reports on Human Rights. \nWhat does it say? We see that years--and even decades--of behind-the-\nscenes efforts by the State Department have not produced any \nimprovement in the human rights situation in Turkey. This report \nconcludes in fact that ``the human rights situation in Turkey has \nworsened in 1994.''\n  Mr. President, this is our Government's report, the State \nDepartment's report. This is not a report of the Senator from New York, \nor a conclusion that I have come up with. It is our Government's \nreport. Again, the human rights situation in Turkey has worsened \nsignificantly in 1994.\n  Mr. President, do we reward them with aid? The full spectrum of human \nrights monitoring organizations have condemned Turkey for its \nsystematic and widespread abuse of human rights, including the use of \ntorture. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the U.N. Committee \nAgainst Torture, the European Parliament, and others go on and on in \ntheir condemnation of their systematic deprivation of basic human \nrights.\n  Let us talk about Kurdish rights and the Kurdish problem. Nowhere is \nthe case for cutting off aid to Turkey more compelling than the \nquestion of the Turks. To this day, Turkey continues to deny the very \nexistence of its 15 million Kurdish citizens. Their military has \nsystematically emptied over 2,000 Kurdish villages and uprooted over 1 \nmillion Kurdish citizens from their homes. This is not to mention the \nrecent incursion into northern Iraq against the Kurds.\n  The Turkish Government's systematic and deliberate campaign to \neradicate the Kurdish identity within its borders is in many ways the \nhigh-technology murder, massacres, and deportations of Armenian \ngenocide earlier this century.\n  The question of Cyprus remains unresolved. Twenty-one years after \nTurkey illegally, in 1974, invaded the island nation, despite countless \nU.N. resolutions and international agreements, Turkey continues its \nillegal military occupation and obstructive efforts toward a peaceful \nsettlement. The division of the island and the massive uprooting of the \nGreek Cypriots caused by the 1974 invasion remains a constant reminder \nof the failure of the international community to enforce a lasting and \nequitable resolution to the conflict. Turkey still must demonstrate its \nsupport for a settlement recognizing the sovereignty, independence, and \nterritorial integrity of Cyprus with a constitutional democracy based \non majority rule, the rule of law, and the protection of minority \nrights.\n  Mr. President, nowhere is the case more compelling for our stopping \nassistance--this does not relieve some assistance, but I believe it is \na very reasonable course--than the case of what Turkey is doing today \nto Armenia. The failure of quiet diplomacy--that is what the State \nDepartment talks about--is no more evident than in the case of the \nTurkish blockade of humanitarian aid to Armenia. How in this day and \nage, in 1995, can we countenance Turkey refusing to permit humanitarian \naid to a nation and to its people? It is in violation of all \ninternational law. It is in defiance of the United Nations. Yet they \ncontinue to blockade the borders with Armenia.\n  How long has this taken place and gone on? For 2 years. For 2 years \nthe Turkish Government has refused to allow desperately needed United \nStates and other international assistance to reach the people of \nArmenia. Even the United States of America--even planes from the United \nStates delivering aid to Armenia have been refused. It is wrong. We \nshould not reward nations with our money when they conduct that kind of \npolicy.\n  Unable to cross Turkish territory or transit its airspace, relief \nsupplies--we are not talking about equipment, war-making equipment. We \nare not talking about munitions. We are not talking about tanks. We are \nnot talking about armaments. We are talking about basic relief \nsupplies--food, clothing, and medicine--have had to be rerouted through \nGeorgia where, due to instability widespread, large portions of that \naid have sometimes been lost, along with the cost and the time \nnecessary to get basic aid to a people whose suffering mounts and the \ntoll of the devastation increases.\n  We should not be rewarding with taxpayers' money that kind of \nconduct. And the business of saying they are our allies has long played \nout. It is not right that American taxpayers continue this kind of \nprogram. I hope that this sends a message that we say to the Turkish \nGovernment, fine, you are an ally, but basic human rights must be \nobserved.\n  It is for those reasons that I have offered this amendment, not just \nfor the American taxpayer but for the defense of American values and \nideals. If we are to make a difference, certainly there is no more \ncompelling case than here and now. This is a small step in signaling \nthat we mean what we say, that we are for democracy and we are for \nhuman rights. I do not understand how we can be sending millions of \ndollars in America taxpayer moneys encouraging the kinds of activities \nthat the Turkish Government is engaged in.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the D'Amato amendment, I \nwould like to express my strong support for his proposal to reduce our \neconomic assistance to Turkey. The D'Amato amendment would cut economic \naid to Turkey by $25 million, capping aid to Turkey next year at $21 \nmillion. A similar amendment passed overwhelmingly in the House earlier \nthis year.\n   Mr. President, this bill represents cuts of $1.2 billion from the \nfiscal year 1995 appropriated level. It is $2.4 billion less than the \nadministration's $14.8 billion request. I support the fiscal \nresponsibility of this bill, and I believe that this amendment will \nhelp to bring the Turkish account into line with other reductions \ncontained in this bill.\n\n[[Page S 13922]]\n\n  But there are more important reasons to make this cut than just \nachieving budgetary savings. For decades, Turkey has had a consistent \nrecord of human rights abuses against its own people and against its \nneighbors.\n  I would like to emphasize that this cut will only affect economic \nassistance, not military assistance.\n  There are a great number of reasons to support this amendment, but I \nwould like to list just a few:\n  Turkey has illegally occupied 40 percent of the territory of \nneighboring Cyprus for 21 years. Turkey has consistently refused to \nwithdraw its 35,000 occupation troops, and has impeded efforts to \nreunify the island.\n  The Turkish army has forcibly evacuated or destroyed nearly 2,000 \nKurdish villages. More than 2 million of Turkey's Kurdish citizens have \nbeen made refugees in their own country.\n  Over 10,000 Turkish Kurds have been killed by Turkish Government \nforces. More than 5,000 of these deaths have come in just the past 5 \nyears.\n  American weapons and equipment have been used repeatedly by Turkey in \ntheir internal and external atrocities, including the 1974 invasion of \nCyprus and the attacks against Kurds in U.N. protected areas of \nnorthern Iraq earlier this year.\n  Torture, extrajudicial execution, and unlawful detention continue to \nbe common in Turkey. This has been confirmed by State Department human \nrights reports and all credible private human rights organizations such \nas Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.\n  Turkey persists in blocking the delivery of desperately-needed \nhumanitarian assistance to Armenia, a land-locked neighboring country. \nThis is particularly egregious because of Turkey's own past atrocities \ntoward the Armenian people during World War I. This is commonly \nreferred to the Armenian Genocide, in which 1.5 million Armenians--or \nhalf of all the Armenian people at that time--died.\n  Seven European countries have cut off all arms sales to Turkey, and \nthe European Union has refused to even consider a free trade agreement \nwith Turkey because of the treatment of the Kurdish people.\n  Against its own international agreements, in 1971 Turkey shuttered \nthe seminary school of the Eastern Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate. \nThis was done in an effort to undermine and eventually destroy this \nmost hallowed institution revered by over 200 million Eastern Orthodox \nfaithful around the world.\n   Mr. President, I frankly do not understand why we continue to \nprovide such high levels of economic assistance to Turkey. But the \npurpose of this amendment is not to totally cut off all aid to Turkey, \nonly to send a strong message that Turkey must reform its human rights \nrecord both with its neighbors and with its own people.\n  I urge passage of the D'Amato amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the pending \namendment of the Senator from New York, pertaining to assistance for \nTurkey. I will support the motion to table this amendment, and I urge \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I have very firmly held beliefs regarding the \nimportance of the United States-Turkish relationship, and these beliefs \nhave only been strengthened, not diminished, by recent events. Turkey \nhas long been considered of great strategic importance to the United \nStates, most notably since the height of the cold war, when Turkey's \nparticipation in NATO gave this important alliance a steady anchor in \nthe Middle East. It was a tremendous advantage to have a stalwart ally \nof the West sitting in between the Soviet Union and the oil fields and \ntensions of the Middle East.\n  Let us remember also how Turkey frequently provided more troops to \nNATO than any nation other than the United States. We are increasingly \ncognizant that the peace in Europe was kept throughout those years not \nby the procedures of the United Nations, but by the resolve of NATO--\nand Turkey played an indispensable role in that alliance.\n  During the cold war, we came to view the alliance with Turkey as \nbeing critically important largely for geographic reasons, and reasons \nof military strategy. However, since the demise of the Soviet Union, we \nhave found our relationship with Turkey to be of even greater \nimportance.\n  If one lists the principal international developments in the post-\ncold war world, one repeatedly comes across unmistakable trends which \nunderscore the importance of Turkey. To name but a few: The \nexpansionism of Turkey's neighbor Saddam Hussein, the disintegration of \nYugoslavia along ethnic lines, renewed nationalism and anti-Western \nfeeling on the part of many Moslem states, the breakaway of the central \nAsian republics from Russia, and on, and on.\n  I earnestly hope that my colleagues have noted the opposition of our \nmost notable military leaders to any reductions in assistance to \nTurkey. Gen. John Shalikashvili has written to commend Turkey's \nparticipation in the Korean war, as well as Turkey's defense of 37 \npercent of the frontier between NATO and the Warsaw Pact during the \ncold war. During the gulf war, strike missions against Iraq were \ninitiated from Turkish soil--nearly 2,700 sorties, according to the \ngeneral.\n  Perhaps Turkey's biggest contribution to that effort was the closing \nof the Turkish-Iraqi oil pipeline, which clamped down solidly on \nHussein's strength and surely cost Turkey and its economy dearly. Few \nAmericans know that Turkey contributed troops to the Somalian effort, \nas\n well as 1,500 troops in Bosnia.\n\n  Secretary of Defense William Perry has also testified to the value of \ncontinued assistance for Turkey.\n  The great ideological contest in the world is no longer between \ncommunism and democracy--capitalist democracy has clearly been the \nvictor of that battle for the allegiance of the greater part of \nhumankind. But there are still contests taking place all over the \nglobe, between competing visions such as secular democracies, \nnationalist autocracies, and military-religious states. Too much of the \nMoslem world has chosen the latter route, choosing to devote the \nresources of the state to military confrontation with their neighbors, \nand at home, enforcement of religious scruples by the state.\n  Not only did Turkey cast its lot with the West when it was in a \nlonely military position, surrounded by Soviet-leaning neighbors, but \nit chooses still to cast its lot with us even when in close contact \nwith many anti-Western Moslem regimes. The majority of Turks believe \nthis is the right thing to do, but there are also voices within Turkey \nwho wonder why it chooses to ally itself with the West, only to receive \ncriticism and suspicion in return from too many quarters.\n  It is greatly and unquestionably in the United States' interest that \nTurkey's decision to remain a friendly, secular republic be seen as \nfruitful for a Moslem nation. We do not have a good track record in our \nrelations with Islamic countries. If Turkey is rebuffed in its \ncontinued allegiance to us, this will only provide fodder for those who \nbelieve that the West cannot be trusted to remain truly friendly toward \na Moslem country.\n  None of us would claim that the human rights situation in Turkey is \nwhat we would like to see. But we should remember as well that Turkey \nhas been the recipient of thousands upon thousands of uninvited guests, \nin many cases Kurdish refugees from northern Iraq. Most Kurdish people \nare not terrorists. They are poor refugees struggling to cope with the \ntragic reality of living under unfriendly, repressive regimes such as \nthat of Saddam Hussein. But United States protection of the safe havens \nin northern Iraq also served to shelter those Kurds in the PKK, who \nwere indeed engaged in terrorist attacks against Turkey. Thus we have \nmade our own inadvertent contribution to the conflict Turkey is \nexperiencing in the eastern part of the country. We would do well to \nconfine our sermons about human rights to those situations to which we \nourselves have not contributed.\n  Mr. President, I believe that it is strongly in the interest of the \nUnited States that we maintain a strong relationship with Turkey, both \nan economic and military relationship, and that the Turkish commitment \nto its status as a secular republic be proved again and again to be a \nmost successful one which will assist our friends the Turks to continue \nthe course and the \n\n[[Page S 13923]]\ncause of peace and prosperity in their country. We have a tremendous \nstake in this question, thus I strongly urge the defeat of the D'Amato \namendment.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by the able \nSenator from New York. It removes the discretion and the flexibility \nnow in the bill for the President to provide economic assistance \naccording to his best judgment as to the need of the recipient country.\n  Mr. President, Turkey is a member of NATO. It has been consistently \nof great assistance, great assistance to the United States--by the way, \nmay I say also assistance to Israel--as we pursue our goals in the \nMiddle East and southern Europe. Turkey has been of assistance as a \nNATO ally in supporting NATO's actions in Bosnia. She has provided \nsupport to the Bosnian Moslems, helping to right the balance in Bosnia \nvis-a-vis the Bosnian Serb forces.\n  Turkey was of crucial early assistance to us in the gulf war, as we \nall know. And she is still paying for that. She is still paying for \nhaving helped us. She was of crucial heroic assistance to the United \nStates in Korea. Her economic needs are substantial. As I say, she is \nstill paying a heavy price for cutting off the oil pipeline with Iraq. \nAnd she still loses revenue heavily on a daily basis. I cannot \nunderstand why anyone wants to remove the President's flexibility in \nthis area, and I do not think that Turkey should be singled out.\n  I oppose the amendment, and I hope that the managers will move to \ntable it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I do not mean to have a protracted debate on this, but I \nwill take the time to read several excerpts from the State Department \ncountries report, our State Department's report this year on Turkey as \nit relates to human rights. This comes from the report directly.\n\n       The human rights situation in Turkey worsened significantly \n     in 1994.\n\n  Worsened significantly in 1994.\n\n       The police and security forces often employed torture \n     during periods of incommunicado detention and interrogation, \n     and the security forces continued to use excessive force \n     against noncombatants.\n\n  Let me go on a little further.\n\n       Various agencies of the Government continued to harass, \n     intimidate, indict, and imprison human rights monitors, \n     journalists, lawyers, and professors for ideas which they \n     expressed in public forums. Disappearances and mystery murder \n     cases continued at a high rate in the southeast.\n\n  Let me go to page 3. I have another excerpt.\n\n       Political murders and extrajudicial killings attributed to \n     Government authorities and terrorist groups continued at the \n     relatively high 1993 rates. Government authorities were \n     responsible for the deaths of detainees in official custody; \n     suspects in houses raided by security forces; and other types \n     of civilian deaths in the southeast.\n       Disappearances continued in 1994, while most of those \n     reported in 1993 and earlier remained unsolved.\n\n  This is a pattern. This has not just evolved. And it is not getting \nbetter. It is getting worse.\n  Mr. President, again, it is not good enough to say that while one has \njoined us in an effort to investigate aggressions against the United \nStates, to be helpful as it were, and more than helpful in our battle \nto liberate Kuwait, it is not sufficient to say that because one has \nloaned itself militarily to our defense, we look the other way when it \ncontinues these kinds of basic human rights violations not only of its \ncitizens but of other citizens. It is inexcusable and intolerable for \nthem to be permitted and for us to countenance by way of our actions, \nby way of making aid available, the continued blockade of the 2 million \npeople in Armenia. It is wrong. And quiet diplomacy has not reduced \nthat situation or resolved that situation. It continues. And on and on \nit goes.\n  One might talk about the situation in Cypress and what the Government \nof Turkey has done is simply by way of armed force taken and occupied \nthat country illegally, and it thumbs its nose at the United Nations \nand those attempting to bring about a peaceful resolve. I believe until \nwe do what we are supposed to do--and I say it pays dividends because \nwe did not win the cold war with the Soviets because we decided to look \nthe other way on human rights abuses. It is because we stood up to them \nand we said we are not going to treat you the way we would the other \nnations that follow the normal patterns of conduct, conduct that is \nexpected.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will accept this \namendment. I think this amendment will be a very powerful impact in \nsending the right signal and maybe seeing that someday there are basic \nfreedoms that are guaranteed, that nations will not be suppressed by \nthe use of Turkish military might, that food and aid to people who are \nneedy and starving will be permitted. That seems to me to be something \nthat is so easy, but when a nation is so intolerant and so indifferent \nto the rights of others, then I think we have to send a clear message \nand that is why the Senator offers this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I understand the message the distinguished \nSenator is trying to send, but we are also going to send a message to a \nvaluable ally, a valuable ally, an ally that is struggling to continue \nto orient itself toward the West, an ally that sits within a sea of \npotential enemies, surrounded by Moslem countries. Turkey is a Moslem \ncountry itself. It is a representative democracy. There are forces in \nTurkey that would like very much to see that country become another \nIran, and there is a very real danger it could become another Iran. \nLook at the map. Note the geopolitical position of Turkey, the old \ngreat crossroads of the world in the days of Constantinople and \nByzantium. We can send a message, but we can also cut off our nose to \nspite our face, and we will not change anything except to drive a very \nvaluable and dependable ally away from the West.\n  Turkey was very important to us in the Persian Gulf war, very \nimportant. We all wanted Turkey's help. We wanted Turkey to cut off the \nflow of oil. She cut it off.\n  Mr. President, I have an amendment in my pocket and I have the floor. \nI have a second-degree amendment to cut aid to Israel by $1 billion.\n  Now, we are getting ready to cut programs that are important to the \nAmerican people. We talk about cutting Medicare, cutting Medicaid, \ncutting moneys for the Park Service, Fish and Wildlife, health \nprograms, education programs. But not a word about cutting aid to \nIsrael, not a word; $3 billion to Israel, $2 billion to Egypt.\n  Now, if anyone wants to talk about entitlements, those are looked \nupon as entitlement programs by the recipient countries. I am not anti-\nIsrael nor am I anti-Egypt. But when we talk about cutting \nentitlements, cutting programs that benefit the American people, the \nold, the young--but not a word said about cutting that $5 billion for \nIsrael and Egypt--why not offer an amendment that will cut that \nlargesse and see how many brave souls there are in this Senate?\n  Senators would run like turkeys and head for the doors as if they \nwere fire escapes. I know, because I have tried such an amendment on \ntwo occasions. I got one vote on each occasion. Perhaps these brave \nsouls should be put to the test every now and then.\n  I will not offer my amendment to this amendment at this time. It \nwould be an attractive idea to offer it to this amendment and then have \nsomeone move to table the underlying amendment; and with my amendment \nas the second-degree amendment, watch Senators head for the doors.\n  Where are all these brave souls? How about cutting aid to Israel? I \nwill not offer the amendment at this time. I hope that the managers \nwill move to table the pending amendment. I hope that it will be tabled \nby an overwhelming vote. Let us send a message to Turkey that we are \nstill her friend, and we want her to be our friend.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  \n[[Page S 13924]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me say with regard to the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, that the internal human rights \npractices of a number of America's close friends in that section of the \nworld probably could not meet our test. And it seems to me the \nsituation in Turkey is largely indistinguishable from the situation \ninside the borders of a number of other, not only good friends of the \nUnited States, but aid recipients of the United States in that part of \nthe world.\n  I share the concern that many people have about the human rights \nsituation in Turkey and in a lot of other places. The question is \nwhether or not the amendment by the Senator from New York to cap, cut \noff assistance will generate any improvements. I am concerned, as the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia is concerned, that it might \nhave just the opposite effect.\n  First, let me point out that the administration is planning $100 \nmillion for ESF for Turkey whether or not we pass an amendment. Now I \ndo not see how this level can be achieved given the overall reduction \nin the foreign operations budget.\n  It seems to me that before we engage in the kind of debate we are \nhaving, calling attention to Turkey's internal problems, we ought to \nthink a little bit about the neighborhood. Iraq, Iran, Syria all \npresent unique security challenges, complicated by the crisis in \nGeorgia and ongoing conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n  In the middle of this, Turkey has preserved at least basic principles \nof democracy, including free and fair elections, the orderly transition \nof power, an independent legislature, and enacted a free press. Do they \nhave some problems? Yes. But compared to other countries in the area, \nyou would have to say they have done rather well. It is far from a \nperfect picture. But then many of our traditional friends and allies \nhave not achieved the freedom and success that we enjoy here in this \ncountry.\n  Let us remember that Turkey has 62 million people, 99 percent of whom \nare Moslem, a factor which could easily influence closer ties with \nIran. Yet Turkey remains the only secular democracy with a free market \nthat has a majority Moslem population. Turkey has also maintained its \nstrong link with NATO providing peacekeepers in Bosnia and \nparticipating in F-16 patrol of the no-fly zone. As the Senator from \nWest Virginia mentioned, at the end of the Persian Gulf war, Operation \nProvide Comfort was established in northern Iraq to protect the Kurdish \npopulation, in addition to providing humanitarian aid. The Turkish \nParliament voted to continue the operation for 6 more months.\n  Prime Minister Ciller takes the issue of human rights seriously, and \ncommitted her nation to a course of reform. In July, under her \nleadership, 16 amendments were passed to their Constitution, expanding \npolitical participation and democracy. When Parliament reconvenes in \nOctober, it is my understanding that there will be several more pieces \nof reform legislation considered.\n  So the point is, Turkey certainly is not perfect, but it has made a \nlot of progress. When you compare it to the others in the neighborhood, \nit does rather well.\n  Mr. President, I do not know what more needs to be said on this. It \nwas my plan to offer a motion to table, which I will now do.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] \nand the Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] is absent \ndue to illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nOregon [Mr. Hatfield] would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] is \nabsent because of attending a funeral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 60, nays 36, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 451 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--60\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Daschle\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kyl\n     Leahy\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n\n                                NAYS--36\n\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Bryan\n     Coats\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Helms\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Hatfield\n     Kassebaum\n     Pryor\n     Warner\n  So, the motion to table the amendment (No. 2709) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.  Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that Eugene D. Schmiel, a \nrecent addition to my staff, be extended the privilege of the floor. He \nis a State Department Fellow who will be fulfilling legislative duties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Colorado is seeking \nrecognition. I will not hold the floor, but I urge Senators who have, \non our side--and I suspect the distinguished Senator from Kentucky will \nmake the same request on his side--I urge Senators on our side, who \nhave amendments that they intend to offer to this bill, to come and let \nus know. There may well be amendments that could be accepted. At least \nlet us know that. We will start working toward that situation so at \nsome point the distinguished manager and myself could work at accepting \nthose, and others that might not be accepted, may require rollcall \nvotes, that we might set some time certain or at least get some time \nagreements on them.\n  I commend the distinguished Senator from New York and the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia in their debate. They kept it \nto a very short time. We were able to move on. But this is a bill I \nknow the distinguished Republican leader and the distinguished \nDemocratic leader want to get moved forward, so I urge those who are \nlistening to come let us know. At least on my side, I have a more \naccepting mood when it is early on in the game than I might toward the \nend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2708\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the amendment No. \n2708, offered by the Senator from Colorado to the committee amendment \non page 15.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, one of the things the opponents have \nbrought up in the series of extended debates preceding the offering of \nthe amendment this time has been the question of how significant the \none-fourth of the arms package is that would be delivered under the \nPresident's compromise.\n  We have held extensive hearings on this question. I wanted to share \nwith the Members some quotes from the experts who testified. We made an \neffort to invite both Democrats and Republicans, both liberals and \nconservatives, experts from the military and academia as well as \nexperts that had shown a greater degree of experience \n\n[[Page S 13925]]\nwith India than Pakistan. Here are some brief quotes I think are \nhelpful in describing that package.\n  It is $368 million of military equipment that was contracted for 9 \nyears ago, whose delivery was withheld 5 years ago, even though in \nsubstance it had been paid for, committed for by the Pakistanis.\n\n       In terms of the regional military balance, I don't think \n     that the release of this military equipment . . . really will \n     have no significant impact on the balance one way or the \n     other.\n\n  That is from Stephen Cohen, who is the director of Program in Arms \nControl, from the University of Illinois.\n  From George Tanham, vice president of Rand Corp:\n\n     . . . I agree with Steve that the package won't change the \n     balance at all. In fact, there is no balance now. India \n     dominates so strongly. They have twice as large an army as \n     Pakistan, twice as large an air force, twice as large a navy, \n     and twice as many tanks, twice as many airplanes. So there \n     isn't a balance at the moment. And India has overwhelming \n     strength.\n\n  This one is from the Honorable William Clark, Jr. He was the \nambassador to India from 1989 to 1992. ``We have got F-16's that have \nbeen sitting in the desert and being maintained. The P-3 and the \nHarpoon, three of them are marginally useful, if at all, and they have \nalready been--the requirement has been met in other ways--from the \npolitics of it, it is terribly important. The military utility of \nit''--he is referring to this settlement and those weapons--``they \nwould rather buy more modern equipment with the money.''\n  The focus of his remarks was simply to point out that actually if the \nPakistanis had their choice, they could buy better equipment and more \nmodern equipment with their money rather than the old equipment. Again, \nrelating to the significance of the package that would be delivered \nunder the President's compromise.\n  This is from James Clad. He is a professor at Georgetown University. \nThey offer for Pakistan ``exactly as Mr. Tanham pointed out, an \nequalizing hand in trying to somehow correct the subcontinental \nmismatch of conventional weaponry capability and geographical reality * \n* * I think another turn on a dime on this issue is going to I think do \nfurther damage to American diplomacy.'' The turn on the dime would be \nfailure to follow up on the President's commitment.\n  This last one is from Bruce Fein. He is a constitutional and \ninternational law specialist and syndicated columnist. ``It is true \nthat they''--referring here to India--``they are searching at present \nfor substantial additional arms purchases, hundreds of millions that I \nthink would dwarf anything that would follow any relaxation of the \nPressler amendment: (Incidentally) very high technology MiG aircraft.'' \nHe is referring to what India already is doing.\n  What we have here is an effort to deny the President of the United \nStates a vote on an arrangement, a negotiation that he himself \ninstigated. The President took on a tough problem. For 5 years we have \nrefused to return the Pakistanis' money, and for 5 years we have \nrefused to deliver the planes, and for 5 years, because it has been a \ntough problem, we failed to act.\n  I think it is to the President's credit that he has been willing to \nstep forward, he has been willing to negotiate out a compromise. Some \nmay disagree with the compromise. Some may think it is too tough on \nPakistan. Some may think it is too tough on India. But the President \nhad the courage to step forward and negotiate that compromise and put a \npackage and a recommendation before this Congress. The question is \nwhether or not the President is allowed to have a vote on his package.\n  We considered this whole question in the drafting of the State \nDepartment authorization bill. But when that bill got to the floor, it \nwas filibustered and the President was denied an opportunity to have \nhis proposal which would have added to that as part of that which was \nvoted on. We then offered this package as an amendment to the Defense \nauthorization bill. But the opponents fought that, threatened to \nfilibuster all night, and denied us a vote. Finally, in an effort to \nmake sure that important Defense authorization bill passed without the \ndelay that that threat brought about, I was willing to withdraw the \namendment upon assurances that we would have an opportunity to offer it \nlater and be voted on. That bill has moved ahead.\n  We bring it up today after notice and discussion. This amendment was \noffered shortly after 11 o'clock this morning. It was one of the first \namendments offered to this bill. And the opponents again sought to \ndelay. The first thing they said is, ``We want a secret briefing for \neveryone.'' Mr. President, we have had secret briefings. We have had \nsecret briefings covering the exact subjects that they want to talk \nabout. First of all, the Intelligence Committee conducted a briefing on \nthis very subject, exactly the same subject, at the end of July and \nearly August. Members were invited. Those who did not attend could have \ncome to a Members' briefing that I arranged with the subcommittee on \nlast Tuesday.\n  Incidentally, Senator Glenn's staff attended that briefing. We \ninvited every Member of the Senate to be present at that briefing. So \nthe briefing that they talked about delaying this consideration for has \nnot only already taken place, but it has already taken place twice. \nIncidentally, I might say transcripts of those are available for \nMembers who want to see them.\n  So to suggest that we have to delay consideration of this proposal \nonce again for a briefing is simply another tactic, in this Member's \nopinion, to delay consideration of an important amendment.\n  Mr. President, we have had hearing after hearing after hearing on \nthis subject. We had a hearing on March 7. We had a hearing on March 9. \nWe had a hearing and discussion--at least for comment--when we had \ncommittee markup. Incidentally, Senator Pressler was invited and \nappeared at that committee markup and gave comments. We had a hearing \non this last Thursday in which Senator Pressler came and discussed it \nspecifically.\n  So, Mr. President, what we have seen here is a concerted effort to \navoid a vote on this question. I believe the President at least \ndeserves a vote on the package, the compromise, that he has negotiated \nout. One may disagree with it. One may think it is right to keep both \nthe military aircraft and Pakistanis' money. But, Mr. President, I do \nnot. I think we deserve an answer one way or another.\n  What I find is an effort now to delay this important bill, an effort \nby filibustering this amendment to delay the consideration of this \nvital bill that has such a major impact on our foreign policy \nconsiderations around the world.\n  Once again, I do not want to delay the important business of the \nSenate. It is why I brought this amendment up early and brought it up \nfor consideration. But what I find is a concerted plan and effort to \nsimply filibuster this, to delay consideration and to deny the \nPresident of the United States a vote on his carefully negotiated \ncompromise.\n  When I was asked to grant more time to opponents, we agreed to set \naside this amendment for Senator Lautenberg to speak, which, of course, \nhe did. Then once again, because the opponents wanted more time, we \nagreed to another delay and agreed to set aside the amendment for \nconsideration of Senator D'Amato's amendment, which has been fully \ndebated and voted on, as the Senators will recall from just a few \nmoments ago. But, Mr. President, further delay, further filibustering \nof this important legislation and delay of this important bill will be \na mistake for the Senate. I believe it is important to move ahead on \nit.\n  I am saddened by the fact that the opponents have not come to speak \nup and to offer debate. Mr. President, most important of all, when the \nState Department authorization bill was here, they refused to join in a \ntime agreement. When the Defense authorization bill was here, they \nrefused to join in a time agreement. Now, in spite of my request and \nothers' requests to have a time agreement, basically carte blanche \nwhatever they want, they refused to join in a time agreement.\n  So, my proposal is this: I think the President deserves a vote. This \nis an important matter that does not get better by delay. The longer we \ndelay, the more storage costs there are on the airplanes. The longer \nthey filibuster, the more the quality of the material deteriorates. The \nlonger they refuse to give the President a vote, the more \n\n[[Page S 13926]]\ncost is added to this proposal and the more difficult it is to work out \na settlement.\n  Mr. President, my suggestion is this: Let us get a vote. If I do not \nhave 60 votes, I am not going to stop this bill or have others \nfilibuster this important piece of legislation just for this amendment. \nBut if we can get 60 votes, then I want this considered, and we will \nsee if we cannot bring closure on this issue. But I believe the \nPresident of the United States deserves an answer and deserves a vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Brown \namendment. This amendment will further United States relations with \nPakistan--by allowing for cooperative programs on counternarcotics and \ncounterterror- \nism--and by resolving a longstanding dispute over the delivery of \nmilitary hardware.\n  I understand the concerns of opponents of this amendment--and I share \nsome of them. There is no more important issue in South Asia than \nnuclear proliferation.\n  But I believe that this issue is hindering our efforts to build \nstrong ties with Pakistan--and that strong relations with Pakistan are \ncrucial to improving our security and furthering our interests in South \nAsia.\n  I also believe that we need to show support for the current \nGovernment of Pakistan. Prime Minister Bhutto is a woman of great \ncourage. She has endured arrest, imprisonment, and exile. She has \nworked to transform Pakistan from a military dictatorship to a \nparliamentary democracy.\n  The Prime Minister has been courageous in her efforts to build close \nties to the West. Under her leadership, Pakistan has proven to be a \nvaluable ally in combatting terrorism and in stemming international \nflow of illegal drugs. She has been liberalizing the economy and \nopening it up to foreign trade and investment.\n  It has come to the point where this issue is clouding all others. \nImproved human rights, nonproliferation and greater trade and \ninvestment are held hostage to this largely symbolic issue.\n  So I will support the Brown amendment. The Pressler amendment will \nstill stand--and it should. Pakistan will not receive the F-16's. But \nby passing the Brown amendment, we will remove an impediment to our \nrelations with Pakistan--and we will be able to focus on improving \nsecurity in South Asia.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I move to table the Brown amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is to determine if there is \na sufficient second.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. GLENN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant legislation clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nKassebaum and Senator Pell be allowed to address the Senate and, at the \nend of their comments, the status quo be resumed.\n  Mr. BROWN. Does that include a limitation on the amount of time? I \nreserve the right to object.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time does the Senator from Kansas have in \nmind? I say to my friend from Colorado, I am trying to just process \nsomething here while we are waiting.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I came to speak because there was a \nquorum call on, so I could tailor my remarks to the time I would be \nallowed. I would say about 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWN. I take it the unanimous-consent request is for a maximum \nof 5 minutes?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. With 5 minutes for Senator Pell as well.\n  Mr. BROWN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I first want to commend the chairman \nof the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, Senator McConnell, and the \nranking member, Senator Leahy, for their leadership on this bill. \nGetting a foreign operations appropriations bill through the Senate is \nnever an easy process. I think they have done an extraordinary job. \nThis legislation is a reasonable approach that meets the stringent \nreality of the Federal budget but also recognizes that our national \ninterest requires America to be a leader in world affairs.\n  For years, we have been engaged in a debate about how best to reform \nour foreign aid programs. I have long been an advocate of reform, and I \ncontinue to believe it is necessary. The debate has taken on new vigor \nthis year with the chairmanship of Senator Helms in the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and it is ongoing.\n  The legislation before us today walks a fine line and, in my view, \ndoes so appropriately. On the one hand, it recognizes the substantial \nreform of our foreign aid programs is properly carried out through the \nauthorizing legislation, not through this appropriations bill. On the \nother hand, this bill undertakes important reforms necessary to ensure \nthat the shrinking resources it provides can be used to the greatest \neffect.\n  The foreign affairs budget, which, unlike other accounts in the \nFederal budget, had already been cut dramatically before this year, has \nbeen cut even further. I regret that decision, but that die was cast \nlast spring during the budget resolution debate. Given the limited \nresources available, it will become increasingly important that the \nPresident have more flexibility to target our resources toward the \nareas of greatest importance.\n  This is not easy to do. We always feel that we want to have some \nhand--and we should have--in shaping those priorities. On the other \nhand, I think flexibility is needed for administrative decisions and it \nis important that legislative and administrative bodies work as closely \ntogether as possible.\n  While some of the accounts retain their traditional protection, this \nlegislation on the whole has very few earmarks. Again, I want to \ncommend the committee for that. It is not an easy task. At the same \ntime, the bill seeks to promote fairness by preventing any single \naccount or region of the world from bearing a disproportionate share of \nbudget reduction.\n  As a long observer of United States policy toward Africa, I believe \nthis legislation treats Africa fairly and recognizes that continent's \nimportance in the overall reach of United States foreign policy. I am \nparticularly pleased with the sincere effort to address the difficult \nproblem of African debt relief.\n  However, important African issues will remain for the conference \ncommittee--in particular, this legislation's consolidation of the \nDevelopment Fund for Africa into a larger economic assistance account \ndiverges from the path Congress has followed since 1987. The House has \nretained the Development Fund for Africa regional account. The Congress \ncreated the DFA in 1987, with bipartisan support, to ensure that \nconsistent long-term funding for African development would be there if \nit were necessary. I hope that as we debate funding the mechanisms and \naccounts this year, we will not lose sight of, or compromise, this \nimportant goal.\n  I am particularly concerned about the effect on our foreign policy \nand the sharp cuts in two programs in this bill. One is the \nInternational Development Association, funded at $775 million, well \nbelow the $1.3 billion request. While it has detractors, I believe this \nprogram is an effective means of leveraging U.S. foreign aid and \neffecting change in the economic policies of countries abroad. I worry \nthat low-balling this funding--and the House is lower still--will cause \nother donors to do the same and threaten the viability of this \nimportant program.\n  I also worry about cuts in our contributions to international \norganizations and programs. Last year, we \n\n[[Page S 13927]]\nspent $374 million on this account, but this bill includes only $260 \nmillion--again, better than the House bill. Mr. President, \ninternational organizations and programs is never a popular part of the \nbudget. Again, I share the view that we should critically reevaluate \nour participation in many low-priority international organizations. But \nit seems to me we should conduct that review as a matter of policy and \ntake steps to reform or withdraw from organizations in accordance with \nthe obligations we have made to them. We should not just stop paying \nour bills.\n  These cuts in important programs are, to me, made more frustrating by \nanother item in the bill. This legislation would appropriate $150 \nmillion for international narcotics control--$45 million more than last \nyear and $37 million more than was approved by the House. This account \nmay be politically popular, but, in my view, it is a poor candidate for \nadded funding. I doubted the effectiveness of this program in both the \nReagan and Bush administrations--not that we do not want to direct our \nattention to getting narcotics abuse and use under control--even \nthough, however, we had programs over the years in narcotics control \ninitiatives, and they keep requesting more money. In 1995, we will \nspend nearly $13.3 billion on antidrug measures, of which $1.6 billion \nwill go for international and interdiction efforts. I can only hope it \nwill be successful. But I do question whether we are monitoring closely \nthe successes of these efforts.\n  I care just as deeply as everybody else about getting the \ninternational narcotics problem under control, but I am not convinced \nthat increased funding for this program will make any real difference \nin reducing the flow of drugs into this country. Frankly, I would \nprefer we consider reducing funding from fiscal year 1995 levels, but, \nat the very least, I think we should not increase funding. I suggest \nthat the $45 million added beyond current-year levels will be better \nused elsewhere within this bill, or for deficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, I think I am beyond my time.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes to speak to an \namendment I would like to offer as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. First, I conclude my statement by saying that despite \nthe concerns I have raised I believe this bill on the whole represents \nvery responsible leadership in the field of foreign affairs. I intend \nto support it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2710\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today to submit an amendment on \nLiberia.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think we need to lay aside the \npending amendments.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I send that amendment to the desk. I understand it \nwill be a noncontroversial amendment and it is just to express strong \nsupport for the latest Liberia peace agreement and facilitate the \nprovision of limited United States assistance to Liberia.\n  It will be considered at another time.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor a unanimous-consent agreement.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2708\n\n  Mr. PELL.\n   Mr. President, I wish to speak in connection with the Brown \namendment on Pakistan. As many of us know, deliveries of United States \nmilitary equipment purchased by Pakistan have been suspended since 1990 \nunder the terms of the Pressler amendment. This amendment would lift \nthe suspension temporarily to allow the delivery of much of the \nmilitary equipment--including naval aircraft, missiles, and spare \nparts. While it would not permit the delivery of the F-16's purchased \nby Pakistan but still undelivered, the amendment would allow for a plan \nto sell the F-16's to a third country and to provide those proceeds to \nPakistan.\n\n  The sponsors of this amendment argue that it will help to improve \nUnited States relations with Pakistan. I want to say at the outset that \nI well understand the importance of good relations with Pakistan. Not \nonly was Pakistan an important ally in the Afghan resistance to the \nSoviet Union, but Pakistan also continues to be a key player in the \nSouth Asia region.\n  I also wish to be supportive of the current Prime Minister, Benazir \nBhutto. When Pakistan was ruled by an oppressive military dictatorship, \nI tried to be helpful in securing Mrs. Bhutto's release from house \narrest, and in promoting a return to democracy in Pakistan. I have long \nconsidered Prime Minister Bhutto a friend, and have promised her to do \nwhat I can to ensure strong United States-Pakistani relations. That \nbeing said, I must balance my support and affection for Pakistan \nagainst what I believe to be right for United States nonproliferation \npolicy. And I believe that this amendment goes too far. I support \nresuming economic assistance, but oppose the delivery of the military \nequipment. I will vote accordingly when the time comes.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is on the Brown motion to \ntable the Brown amendment.

FEDERAL PROHIBITION OF FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION.\n\n       (a) Title 18 Amendment.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 7 of title 18, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 116. Female genital mutilation\n\n       ``(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), whoever \n     knowingly circumcises, excises, or infibulates the whole or \n     any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of \n     another person who has not attained the age of 18 years shall \n     be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 \n     years, or both.\n       ``(b) A surgical operation is not a violation of this \n     section if the operation is--\n       ``(1) necessary to the health of the person on whom it is \n     performed, and is performed by a person licensed in the place \n     of its performance as a medical practitioner; or\n       ``(2) performed on a person in labor or who has just given \n     birth and is performed for medical purposes connected with \n     that labor or birth by a person licensed in the place it is \n     performed as a medical practitioner, midwife, or person in \n     training to become such a practitioner or midwife.\n       ``(c) In applying subsection (b)(1), no account shall be \n     taken of the effect on the person on whom the operation is to \n     be performed of any belief on the part of that or any other \n     person that the operation is required as a matter of custom \n     or ritual.\n       ``(d) Whoever knowingly denies to any person medical care \n     or services or otherwise discriminates against any person in \n     the provision of medical care or services, because--\n       ``(1) that person has undergone female circumcision, \n     excision, or infibulation; or\n       ``(2) that person has requested that female circumcision, \n     excision, or infibulation be performed on any person;\n\n     shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than \n     one year, or both.''.\n       (2) Clerical amendment.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of chapter 7 of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new item:\n\n``116. Female genital mutilation.''.\n\n       (b) Information and Education Regarding Female Genital \n     Mutilation.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall carry out the following activities:\n       (A) Compile data on the number of females living in the \n     United States who have been subjected to female genital \n     mutilation (whether in the United States or in their \n     countries of origin), including a specification of the number \n     of girls under the age of 18 who have been subjected to such \n     mutilation.\n       (B) Identify communities in the United States that practice \n     female genital mutilation, and design and carry out outreach \n     activities to educate individuals in the communities on the \n     physical and psychological health effects of such practice. \n     Such outreach activities shall be designed and implemented in \n     collaboration with representatives of the ethnic groups \n     practicing such mutilation and with representatives of \n     organizations with expertise in preventing such practice.\n       (C) Develop recommendations for the education of students \n     of schools of medicine and osteopathic medicine regarding \n     female genital mutilation and complications arising from such \n     mutilation.

Mr. President, last September, about a year ago, I \nintroduced a resolution condemning the practice of female genital \nmutilation.\n  At that time, there was talk on the Senate floor that perhaps the \nUnited Nations would do something, perhaps some States would do \nsomething. The fact of the matter is, a year has gone by and this \npractice continues.\n  Mr. President, it is very difficult for me to stand and talk about \nsomething as repulsive and as cruel and as unusual as this practice is. \nBut I feel that we have an obligation to speak about the unspeakable, \nand that is what I am on the floor to talk about today.\n  What is female genital mutilation? I will be as brief in the \ndescription as I can be, but I feel that it is important to my \ncolleagues for me to explain in some detail what this practice is.\n  There are many countries around the world that allow this practice to \ntake place. Some call it female circumcision.\n  There are a number of countries around the world that this is, in \neffect, a rite of passage for little girls. Little girls between the \nages of 6 and 11 are forced into this gruesome ritual of female \ncircumcision by their parents most of the time.\n  The procedure is something that has been written about at great \nlength, and for purposes of this debate, we will refer to this as FGM, \nfemale genital mutilation. I will not refer to those terms anymore.\n  Mr. President, in its most extreme forms, a little girl's external \nsexual organs are scraped away entirely, and then the procedure--most \nof the time very crudely, this is rarely, rarely done by physicians--\nthe vulva is sewn together with some type of stitching. Many times, Mr. \nPresident, the little girl's legs are bound together for weeks while a \npermanent scar forms.\n  The reasons for this are historical in nature. No one really knows. \nIn that this takes place in many Moslem countries, I think this is fair \nto say this is not in the Koran, this is nothing that is taught by the \nKoran, but it is practiced in 20 African countries, in Oman, South \nYemen, United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, India, Pakistan.\n  So, I think we have the general idea of what this procedure is.\n  Why should we be talking about this on the floor of the U.S. Senate? \nWe talk about it because it is important to focus attention on what is \ngoing on around the world, of course. It is important because these \ngirls who go through this process die on occasion, but they are \npermanently scarred, not only physically but emotionally, because the \nimmediate effect is bleeding, shock, infections, and even death because \nof hemorrhage and unhygienic conditions. \n\n[[Page S 13929]]\n\n  The reason I am involved in this is because I received a call from a \nclose personal friend of mine in Las Vegas, NV, a mother of six \nchildren who called me to say that she had watched the night before the \nmost repulsive thing that she had ever seen on television, and this was \na picture which I saw on video later of a little girl having this \nprocess performed on her in Egypt.\n  As a result of that, I felt it was important that I learn more about \nit, as I have done. I have learned that some 15 percent of all these \nfemales die of bleeding or infections. As I have already stated, the \nrest of their lives the women are afflicted with scarring, physically \nand emotionally. They also have recurring infections, some suffer \ncomplicated and sometimes even fatal childbirths.\n  I realize the significance of this ritual in the cultural and \nsocietal systems in communities of Asia, Africa and the Middle East \nwhere it is done often. This procedure has been performed on not \nhundreds of women, not thousands of women, but we are now into the \nmillions of women.\n  I repeat, this is a cruel and tortuous procedure performed on young \ngirls against their will. The United States must make all efforts to \ncondemn and to curb this practice.\n  Some might say that FGM is not a concern of the United States. Mr. \nPresident, it is a concern of the United States, because it does occur \nin the United States. Because of immigration patterns and for other \nreasons, this ritual comes to the United States with people coming from \nother parts of the world. The same procedure has been outlawed in the \nUnited Kingdom, Sweden, Switzerland, to name just a few. They have all \npassed legislation prohibiting FGM. France and Canada maintain that FGM \nviolates already established laws.\n  So we in the United States also must speak out against this torture \nto women in the United States. Hopefully by speaking out, it will focus \nattention on this practice that is going on in other parts of the \nworld.\n  I am really surprised that the United Nations takes up all the human \nrights things that they do, and I can appreciate that. We as a country \ntake up human rights concerns. People who go to prison may spend too \nmuch time in prison. Why should we not speak out on the torture taking \nplace on a daily basis to women throughout the world? This seems much \nmore egregious than some of the other things we throw up our arms about \ndealing with human rights violations.\n  What this amendment does is make it illegal to perform the procedures \nof FGM on girls younger than 18. The legislation defines the following \nmeasures: That we compile data on the number of females in the United \nStates who have already been subjected to this; that we identify \ncommunities in the United States in which FGM is practiced; that we \ndesign and implement outreach activities to inform people of the \nphysical and psychological effects of FGM; and that we develop \nrecommendations for educating students in our medical schools on \ntreating women who have been subject to this torture.\n  As I have stated, this is difficult to talk about, but ignoring the \nissue perpetuates the silent acquiescence to this barbarous practice.\n  I was very happy to hear that at the conference in Beijing, China, \nwhich was just completed last weekend, that FGM was a topic at the U.N. \nConference on Women. I say through this legislation, the United States \ncan acknowledge the importance of this issue to all women.\n  I further say, Mr. President, that I appreciate the support of my \nefforts in this matter by Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator Wellstone, and \nSenator Simon. I hope, Mr. President, that this matter will be \nresoundingly accepted. I think it is important for us as a body, as a \nCongress, and as a Nation to speak out against this. The very least we \ncan do is have a law on the books that makes this illegal in our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the issue of female genital mutilation \n[FGM] was first brought before the Senate last September when Senator \nReid introduced a sense-of-the-Senate resolution condemning this cruel \nritual practice and commending the Government of Egypt for taking quick \naction against two men who performed this deed on a 10-year-old girl in \nfront of CNN television cameras.\n  This amendment would make it illegal to perform the procedures of FGM \non girls younger than 18. In addition, it proscribes the following \nmeasures as necessary to the eradication of this procedure: compiling \ndata on the number of females in the U.S. who have been subjected to \nFGM, identifying communities in the United States in which it is \npracticed, designing and implementing outreach activities to inform \npeople of its physical and psychological effects, and developing \nrecommendations for educating students in medical schools on treating \nwomen and girls who have undergone mutilations. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of this amendment that addresses an issue so crucial to the \nmental and physical health of women and girls.\n  The ritual practice of female genital mutilation currently affects an \nestimated 80 million women in over 30 countries. Although FGM is most \nwidespread in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and the Far East, \nimmigrants from practicing groups have brought the custom to wherever \nthey have settled.\n  In the countries and cultures of its origin, FGM is most commonly \nperformed with crude instruments such as dull razor blades, glass, and \nkitchen knives while the girl is tied or held down by other women. In \nmost cases, anesthesia is not used. Afterwards, herb mixtures, cow \ndung, or ashes are often rubbed on the wound to stop the bleeding.\n  Aside from the obvious emotional and physical trauma which are caused \nby this procedure, it has been estimated that 15 percent of all \ncircumcised females die as a result of the ritual. The long term \neffects dealt with by American doctors who treat mutilated women and \ngirls are listed by the New England Journal of Medicine as including \nchronic pelvic infections, infertility, chronic urinary tract \ninfections, dermoid cysts (which may grow to the size of a grapefruit), \nand chronic anxiety or depression.\n  Although female genital mutilation has sometimes been viewed as a \npurely cultural phenomena, it is clear that no ethical justification \ncan be made for this inhumane practice in any country.\n  Additionally, FGM has already been banned in many Western nations. In \n1982, Sweden passed a law making all forms of female circumcision \nillegal, and the United Kingdom passed a similar law in 1985. France, \nthe Netherlands, Canada, and Belgium have each set a precedent for the \nillegality of female circumcision by holding that it violates laws \nprohibiting bodily mutilation and child abuse. Action has been taken to \nenforce the statutes banning this practice in all the countries I've \njust mentioned.\n  However, due to complex cultural factors, dealing with this issue in \nthe United States requires more than making the ritual practice of FGM \nillegal. Immigrant parents in the United States who import a \ncircumciser from their home country or find an American doctor willing \nto perform the procedure claim to do so out of a desire to do the best \nthing for their daughters. In the societies and cultures that practice \nit, FGM is said to be an integral part of the socialization of girls \ninto acceptable womanhood. Often, the mutilations are perceived by a \ngirl's parents as her passport to social acceptance or the required \nphysical marking of her marriageability. In spite of its obvious \ncruelty therefore, FGM is a part of cultural identity. Clearly, female \ngenital mutilation must be dealt with in a manner which takes into \naccount its complex causes and meanings.\n  Because of the complexity of this issue and the lack of available \ninformation regarding FGM in the United States, this amendment includes \na provision ensuring that research be carried out to determine the \nnumber of females in the U.S. who have undergone mutilations. This \nresearch would also \n\n[[Page S 13930]]\ndocument the types of physical and psychological damage dealt with by \nAmerican medical professionals who treat mutilated woman.\n  Finally, this amendment would ensure that medical students are \neducated in how to treat women and girls who have undergone FGM. In \n1994, the New England Journal of Medicine reported that pregnant women \nwho have undergone infibulation--in which the labia majora are stitched \nto cover the urethra and entrance to the vagina--are at serious risk, \nas are their unborn babies, if treated by physicians who have not been \ntrained in dealing with infibulated women. In fact, untreated \ninfibulated women have double the risk of maternal death and several \ntimes increased risk of stillbirth when compared with women who have \nnot undergone mutilation.\n  Passage of this amendment would also send a clear message to American \nmedical professionals, some of whom reportedly have been offered as \nmuch as $3,000 to perform mutilations on young girls. It would see to \nit that the names of Western doctors who mutilate girls would no longer \nbe passed around in immigrant communities.\n  Female genital mutilation is the world's most widespread form of \ntorture, yet no other mass dilation of humanity has received so \ncomparatively little journalistic or governmental attention. We in the \nUnited States should make it clear that it is a serious crime if it \noccurs here. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment as an \nessential tool in the straggle against the perpetuation of this heinous \npractice.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am not aware of any opposition to the \nReid amendment. We are prepared to accept it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Nevada. I \nhave heard him discuss this in Appropriations Committee. I know this is \nsomething he feels passionately about. We have no objection to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2711) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska is here.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending committee amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent to offer a freestanding \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, I still have no idea what \nis in the amendment. I wonder if I might have a chance at least to see \nit before I agree.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to provide the Senator from Vermont with a \ncopy of the amendment. It would be a freestanding amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. May I suggest the Senator from Alaska explain the \namendment before he sends it up.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I advise my friend from Alaska, I do not \nwant to block him from getting the amendment up, but I want some idea \nof what it is. Maybe he might try explaining it and then remake the \nmotion.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my colleagues from Kentucky and Vermont.\n  My amendment adds specificity to the timing as well as the sequencing \nof aspects that are key to the agreed framework on nuclear issues, \nwhich the administration signed with North Korea last October. This \nwould ensure that everyone, including the North Koreans, knows exactly \nhow and when--and if--the funding will be provided by the Congress or \nadditional diplomatic or economic steps will be taken toward North \nKorea.\n  The amendment parallels much of House Joint Resolution 83 passed \nSeptember 18 by the House of Representatives. The Senate, I think, \nshould go on record in similar detail.\n  I am pleased that the amendment is cosponsored by the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, as well as Senator McCain, \none of the Senate's most respected voices on North Korean matters, and \nthe Senate Republican Policy chairman, Senator Nickles.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2712\n\n  (Purpose: To provide authorization for implementation of the Agreed \n          Framework between the United States and North Korea)\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, with permission of the floor managers, \nI propose a freestanding amendment and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2712.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n\n Authorization for Implementation of the Agreed Framework between the \n                     United States and North Korea\n\n       Sec. 575. (a) This section may be cited as the \n     ``Authorization for Implementation of the Agreed Framework \n     Between the United States and North Korea Act''.\n       (b)(1) The purpose of this section is to set forth \n     requirements, consistent with the Agreed Framework, for the \n     United States implementation of the Agreed Framework.\n       (2) Nothing in this section requires the United States to \n     take any action which would be inconsistent with any \n     provision of the Agreed Framework.\n       (c)(1) The United States may not exercise any action under \n     the Agreed Framework that would require the obligation or \n     expenditure of funds except to the extent and in the amounts \n     provided in an Act authorizing appropriations and in an \n     appropriations Act.\n       (2) No funds may be made available under any provision of \n     law to carry out activities described in the Agreed Framework \n     unless the President determines and certifies to Congress \n     that North Korea is in full compliance with the terms of the \n     Agreed Framework.\n       (d) None of the funds made available to carry out any \n     program, project, or activity funded under any provision of \n     law may be used to maintain relations with North Korea at the \n     ambassadorial level unless North Korea has satisfied the IAEA \n     safeguards requirement described in subsection (g), the \n     additional requirements set forth in subsection (h), and the \n     nuclear nonproliferation requirements of subsection (i).\n       (e)(1) The President shall not terminate the economic \n     embargo of North Korea until North Korea has satisfied the \n     IAEA safeguards requirement described in subsection (g), the \n     additional requirements set forth in subsection (h), and the \n     nuclear nonproliferation requirements of subsection (i).\n       (2) As used in this subsection, the term ``economic embargo \n     of North Korea'' means the regulations of the Department of \n     the Treasury restricting trade with North Korea under section \n     5(b) of the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 5(b)).\n       (f)(1) If North Korea does not maintain the freeze of its \n     graphite-moderated nuclear program as defined in the Agreed \n     Framework, or if North Korea diverts heavy oil for purposes \n     not specified in the Agreed Framework, then--\n       (A) no additional heavy oil may be exported to North Korea \n     if such oil is subject to the jurisdiction of the United \n     States, or is exported by a person subject to the \n     jurisdiction of the United States;\n       (B) the United States shall immediately cease any direct or \n     indirect support for any exports of heavy oil to North Korea; \n     and\n       (C) the President shall oppose steps to export heavy oil to \n     North Korea by all other countries in the Korean Peninsula \n     Energy Development Organization.\n       (2) Whoever violates paragraph (1)(A) having the requisite \n     knowledge described in section 11 of the Export \n     Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2410) shall be \n     subject to the same penalties as are provided in that section \n     for violations of that Act.\n       (g) The requirement of this section is satisfied when the \n     President determines and certifies to the appropriate \n     congressional committees that North Korea is in full \n     compliance with its safeguards agreement with the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency (INFCIRC/403), in \n     accordance with part IV (3) of the Agreed Framework under the \n     timetable set forth therein, as determined by the Agency \n     after--\n       (1) conducting inspections of the two suspected nuclear \n     waste sites at the Yongbyon nuclear complex; and\n\n[[Page S 13931]]\n\n       (2) conducting such other inspections in North Korea as may \n     be deemed necessary by the Agency.\n       (h) The additional requirements referred to in subsections \n     (d) and (e) are the following, as determined and certified by \n     the President to the appropriate congressional committees:\n       (1) That progress has been made in talks between North \n     Korea and the Republic of Korea, including implementation of \n     confidence-building measures by North Korea as well as other \n     concrete steps to reduce tensions.\n       (2) That the United States and North Korea have established \n     a process for returning the remains of United States military \n     personnel who are listed as missing in action (MIAs) during \n     the Korean conflict between 1950 and 1953, including field \n     activities conducted jointly by the United States and North \n     Korea.\n       (3) That North Korea no longer meets the criteria for \n     inclusion on the list maintained by the Secretary of State \n     under section 6(j)(1)(A) of the Export Administration Act of \n     1979 of countries the governments of which repeatedly provide \n     support for acts of international terrorism.\n       (4) That North Korea has taken positive steps to \n     demonstrate a greater respect for internationally recognized \n     human rights.\n       (5) That North Korea has agreed to control equipment and \n     technology in accordance with the criteria and standards set \n     forth in the Missile Technology Control Regime, as defined in \n     section 74(2) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. \n     2797c).\n       (i) The nuclear nonproliferation requirements referred to \n     in subsections (d) and (e) are the following, as determined \n     and certified by the President to the appropriate \n     congressional committees and the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources of the Senate:\n       (1) All spent fuel from the graphite-moderated nuclear \n     reactors of North Korea have been removed from the territory \n     of North Korea as is consistent with the Agreed Framework.\n       (2) The International Atomic Energy Agency has conducted \n     any and all inspections that it deems necessary to account \n     fully for the stocks of plutonium and other nuclear materials \n     in North Korea, including special inspections of suspected \n     nuclear waste sites, before any nuclear components controlled \n     by the Nuclear Supplier Group Guidelines are delivered for a \n     light water reactor for North Korea.\n       (3) The dismantlement of all graphite-based nuclear \n     reactors in North Korea, including reprocessing facilities, \n     has been completed in accordance with the Agreed Framework \n     and in a manner that effectively bars in perpetuity any \n     reactivation of such reactors and facilities.\n       (j) The United States shall suspend actions described in \n     the Agreed Framework if North Korea reloads its existing 5 \n     megawatt nuclear reactor or resumes construction of nuclear \n     facilities other than those permitted to be built under the \n     Agreed Framework.\n       (k) The President may waive the application of subsection \n     (g), (h), (i), or (j) if the President determines, and so \n     notifies in writing the appropriate congressional committees, \n     that to do so is vital to the security interests of the \n     United States.\n       (k)(1) Beginning 6 months after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, and every 12 months thereafter, the President shall \n     transmit to the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     setting forth--\n       (A) an assessment of the extent of compliance by North \n     Korea with all the provisions of the Agreed Framework and \n     this subtitle;\n       (B) a statement of the progress made on construction of \n     light-water reactors, including a statement of all \n     contributions, direct and indirect, made by any country to \n     the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization from the \n     date of signature of the Agreed Framework to the date of the \n     report;\n       (C) a statement of all contributions, direct or indirect, \n     by any country which is not a member of the Korean Peninsula \n     Energy Development Organization for implementation of the \n     Agreed Framework;\n       (D) a statement of all expenditures made by the Korean \n     Peninsula Energy Development Organization, either directly or \n     indirectly, for implementation of the Agreed Framework;\n       (E) an estimate of the date by which North Korea is \n     expected to satisfy the IAEA safeguards requirement described \n     in subsection (g);\n       (F) a statement whether North Korea is transferring \n     missiles or missile technology to other countries, including \n     those countries that are state sponsors of international \n     terrorism;\n       (G) a description of any new developments or advances in \n     North Korea's nuclear weapons program;\n       (H) a statement of the progress made by the United States \n     in fulfilling its actions under the Agreed Framework, \n     including any steps taken toward normalization of relations \n     with North Korea;\n       (I) a statement of any progress made on dismantlement and \n     destruction of the graphite-moderated nuclear reactors of \n     North Korea and related facilities;\n       (J) a description of the steps being taken to implement the \n     North-South Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the \n     Korean Peninsula;\n       (K) an assessment of the participation by North Korea in \n     talks between North Korea and the Republic of Korea; and\n       (L) a description of any action taken by the President \n     under subsection (f)(1)(B).\n       (2) To the maximum extent possible, the President should \n     submit the report in unclassified form.\n       (l) As used in this section:\n       (1) Agreed framework.--The term ``Agreed Framework'' means \n     the document entitled ``Agreed Framework Between the United \n     States of America and the Democratic People's Republic of \n     Korea'', signed October 21, 1994, at Geneva, and the attached \n     Confidential Minute.\n       (2) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committees \n     on Foreign Relations and Armed Services of the Senate and the \n     Committees on International Relations and National Security \n     of the House of Representatives.\n       (3) IAEA safeguards.--The term ``IAEA safeguards'' means \n     the safeguards set forth in an agreement between a country \n     and the International Atomic Energy Agency, as authorized by \n     Article III(A)(5) of the Statute of the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency.\n       (4) North korea.--The term ``North Korea'' means the \n     Democratic People's Republic of Korea, including any agency \n     or instrumentality thereof.\n       (5) Inspections.--The term ``inspections'' means \n     inspections conducted by the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency pursuant to an IAEA safeguards agreement, including \n     special inspection of undeclared information or locations if \n     the IAEA cannot account for nuclear material and is therefore \n     unable to verify that there has been no diversion of nuclear \n     materials.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in view of the fact that much of the \nopening description of the amendment has already been read, I am going \nto dispense with that. I am sure the reporter has it.\n  Let me take a moment and review for my colleagues what was in the \nOctober framework agreement that I think deserves a little reflection. \nYou will all recall that North Korea gets two 1000-megawatt light water \nreactors at a cost of at least $4 billion. We do not know exactly what \nthat cost might be. It might be more than that right now. North Korea \ngets free oil, $500 million worth, until the new reactors can be \nbrought on line. And North Korea gets normalized relations and relaxed \ntrade restrictions with the United States, which they have sought for a \nnumber of decades. North Korea gets freedom from the IAEA special \ninspections for some years into the future.\n  I might add that North Korean is the only country which has been \nexempted from immediate special inspections by the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency, to exempt from the mandatory inspections. South Africa, \nfor example, opened up its entire program for inspection. So, clearly, \nwhat we have done in North Korea is without precedent.\n  Furthermore, we were led to believe that the United States would not \nbe responsible for any significant funding. I am told unofficially that \nafter we get a little further along the line with the commitments to \nprovide the light water reactors, we are going to be asked to \ncontribute a significant amount of aid for switch gear. The switch gear \nis the mechanical capability to dispense power once the power is \ngenerated, and the North Koreans do not have that capability, nor do \nthey have anywhere near the capacity in their current switching gear. \nThey will be requesting assistance in the amount of roughly $1 billion. \nWe should see that as a likely reality.\n  I have told you what was in the October deal and what the North \nKoreans get. Let us review what we get. We get North Korea's promise to \nfreeze the current nuclear program, including their graphite-moderated \nreactors and reprocessing facilities; we get North Korea's promise for \nthe IAEA special inspections--only we get it some 5 years in the \nfuture, something they previously agreed to in January of 1992 but have \nrefused to allow.\n  Finally, we get North Korea's promise that its some 8,000 spent \nnuclear rods filled with weapons-grade plutonium will not be \nreprocessed in North Korea. In the interim, we have won the right to \nstabilize these rods, at, apparently, our expense. The question of \nwhere these rods are going to be stored is still open--we have an issue \nin our own country, a significant issue, on the unacceptability of \nstoring high-level nuclear waste rods at our power sites. That is what \nwe get--promises, but nothing else yet.\n  So I remain a critic of several aspects of the deal, although, as \nthey say, hindsight is cheap. I also recognize \n\n[[Page S 13932]]\nthat the administration, of course, had the authority to negotiate the \ndeal. I have always been critical of the deal because I think we gave \naway our leverage when we allowed the North Koreans to simply dictate \nthe terms of the agreement. When you negotiate a deal, there are \ncertain things that are on the table and certain things that are not on \nthe table. The fact that we allowed the North Koreans to be exempt from \nspecial inspections, I think, was a very, very poor decision on behalf \nof the administration. Nevertheless, it is a decision that was made by \nthe administration.\n  But I do believe that Congress has a role as well, and that role has \nthus far been somewhat ignored. It has been piqued when we had \ndiscussions or floor statements on the subject. But I do not think we \ncan ignore it any longer, now that the administration has turned to us \nfor funding. I will have, in a future speech, some specific references \nwhere the administration assured us there will be very little \nlikelihood of significant funding.\n  However, today we are told the administration has sought funding from \nCongress for all aspects of the deal--all aspects: delivering heavy \noil, dealing with spent fuel, the light water reactor project, and even \nthe setup costs of KEDO. That is the international consortium that is \nattempting to put this together.\n  For fiscal year 1995, the administration spent $4.7 million in \nemergency Department of Defense funds. I have heard members of the \nArmed Services Committee on this floor question how in the world \nDepartment of Defense emergency funds could ever be utilized for this \npurpose. But that is where the administration saw fit to expend the \nfunds. The administration took $4.7 million in emergency DOD funds and \nbought heavy oil for North Korea.\n  What did North Korea do with the heavy oil? They were supposed to use \nit for power generation. We know for a fact some of it was funneled off \ninto industrial complexes, and it was interesting to note there was an \nincrease in military activity shortly after that oil flowed in, which I \nfind rather confounding. Mr. President, $10 million in reprogrammed \nDepartment of Energy funds have been used and $4 million from \nreprogrammed Department of State funds.\n  So when the administration suggests it is not going to cost much, we \nhave already expended approximately $20 million.\n  For this fiscal year, the administration has requested $22 million in \nDepartment of State funds and $5 million of Department of Energy \nfunds--about $27 million.\n  If U.S. taxpayers' funds are going to be used, then I think Congress \nmust play a monitoring role. My legislation outlines that role for the \nCongress.\n  The proposed amendment is consistent with the agreed framework. It is \nnot an attempt to sabotage the agreement, but the amendment does \nattempt to hold North Korea to its promises before the United States \nsimply gives it everything it wants. So far we have been doing all the \ngiving and North Korea has been doing all the taking. Eventually North \nKorea, too, has to do some giving, including giving up entirely its \nnuclear ambitions as well as the sale of arms to other nations.\n  Specifically, before the United States fully normalizes political and \neconomic relations with North Korea, my amendment would require the \nfull implementation of the IAEA safeguards requirements, including \nallowing inspections of the two suspected nuclear waste sites; allowing \nthe removal of all spent fuel to a third country--any third country, of \ncourse, other than the United States, by preference; and making \nprogress in North-South dialog.\n  In addition, North Korea must address other areas of U.S. concern:\n  First, they must agree to go beyond the current and very ineffective \nprocess for returning remains of United States missing in action from \nthe North Korean war. Mr. President, currently we have 8,177--8,177--\nstill listed as missing in action in North Korea. We have reason to \nbelieve we know where many of those remains might be, as we have \nidentified crash sites and other areas of high-intensity activity.\n  It is interesting to do a comparison: 8,177 MIA's in North Korea, \n1,621 in Vietnam. Yet the entire focus of the Nation has been \ntraditionally on those missing in action in the Vietnam conflict. As a \nconsequence of the success of the joint field activities in Vietnam, we \npropose that same type of joint field activities in North Korea.\n  Finally, North Korea must cease the export of ballistic missiles and \nrelated military technology. There is evidence that North Korea is \nexporting missiles to Iran, among other terrorist nations, from time to \ntime.\n  The amendment would also condition future funding on North Korea \nfulfilling the terms of the agreed framework and the confidential \nminute in accordance with the schedule set forth on the agreed \nframework.\n  On the particular issue of the supply of heavy oil, the amendment \nwould restrict U.S. support for exports of heavy oil if North Korea \ndiverts heavy oil to purposes not specified in the agreed framework or \notherwise is not in compliance with the agreed framework. We have \nalready seen violations of this section of the agreement, as I have \noutlined for my colleagues.\n  Finally, the amendment makes clear that the United States will \nsuspend its participation in the agreed framework if North Korea \nreloads its existing 5 megawatt reactor or resumes construction of \nnuclear facilities.\n  In concluding, let me reiterate that this amendment should not be \nseen as a rejection of the committee's original language but as a \nnecessary enhancement. It contains a reasonable and detailed road map \nfor progress in the United States-Democratic Republic of North Korea \nrelations, while providing an appropriate monitoring role for Congress, \nbecause after all it is our money.\n  The House has also taken similar action. I think we should take steps \nto ensure that North Korea keeps its promises. I urge my colleagues and \nthe administration to support this approach in the national interest \nand in the interest of continuity.\n  I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that further proceedings under \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Murkowski \namendment No. 2712.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nMurkowski amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Florida, \nSenator Mack, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Not to be considered, just to be filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be submitted and numbered.\n\n\n            Amendments Nos. 2710, 2714 through 2722, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have seven amendments that are \nroutine, and as far as I know there are no objections to them. Let me \nlist them: an amendment by Senator Specter on section 660, which has to \ndo with police training; amendments for myself regarding competitive \nfinancing; an amendment by Senator Stevens of Alaska dealing with the \nissue of mapping; an amendment by Senator Kassebaum already at the desk \nregarding Liberia; an amendment by Senator Bingaman concerning energy; \ntwo amendments by Senator Mack, one relating to the World Bank and one \nrelating to the index of economic freedom; and an amendment by my \ncolleague from Vermont on Honduras.\n  Mr. President, I send those amendments to the desk en bloc and I ask \nfor their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n                           Amendment no. 2710\n\n  (Purpose: Expressing the sense of the Congress with respect to the \n                       peace process in Liberia)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n\n                                liberia\n\n       Sec.   . (a) The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the war in Liberia begun in 1989 has devastated that \n     country, with more than 150,000 people killed, 800,000 people \n     forced to flee to other countries, and thousands of children \n     conscripted into the rebel armies;\n       (2) after nearly six years of conflict, on August 19, 1995, \n     the Liberia factions signed a peace agreement in Abuja, \n     Nigeria; and\n       (3) the Liberian faction leaders and regional powers appear \n     to be committed to the most recent peace accord, including \n     the installation of the new ruling council.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Congress that the United States \n     should strongly support the peace process in Liberia, \n     including diplomatic engagement, support for the west African \n     peacekeeping force, humanitarian assistance, and assistance \n     for demobilizing troops and for the resettlement of refugees.\n       (c) Section 1(b)(2) of Public Law 102-270 is amended by \n     striking ``to implement the Yamoussoukro accord''.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment on \nLiberia. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Simon, former chairman of \nthe Africa Subcommittee, and Senator Feingold, ranking member of the \nSubcommittee.\n  This amendment expresses strong support for the latest Liberia peace \nagreement and facilitates the provision of limited United States \nassistance to Liberia.\n  Begun on Christmas day 1989, the civil war in Liberia has devastated \nthat country. More than 150,000 people have been killed, mostly \ninnocent women and children. Upward of three-quarters of a million \npeople have been forced to flee to neighboring countries. Most heart-\nwrenching is the disastrous effect of the war on the children of \nLiberia. Many young boys--probably tens of thousands--have been \nconscripted by the warring factions, handed weapons sometimes bigger \nthan they are, and sent into battle.\n  Mr. President, in August 1990, the Economic Community of West African \nStates sent a peacekeeping force led by Nigeria. The force, called \nECOMOG, did stop the rebel advance--but over time became one of the \ncombatants and did little to bring peace to Liberia.\n  And, the situation has only become more confused the last couple of \nyears. The number of factions multiplied. Some of these groups have \nsplit and others connected with a rebel movement in Sierra Leone. \nECOMOG formed alliances with certain factions. Arms flows continued. \nClearly the warlords appeared much more interested in their personal \npower and wealth than in the future of their country.\n  After more than 5 years of brutal and inhuman conflict, many in the \noutside world had simply given up on Liberia. I must say that I was one \nwho had become increasingly frustrated with the situation and \npessimistic about the future of Liberia.\n  Yet, in the midst of the cynicism, we have seen a dramatic and very \npositive breakthrough in Liberia. Last month, the major faction \nleaders--under intense pressure from Ghanaian President Jerry \nRawlings--signed a peace agreement in Abuja, Nigeria. Unlike the \nprevious 11 accords, many believe and hope that this is a peace accord \nwith a difference. For once, the Nigerians--the leaders of ECOWAS--and \nrebel leader Charles Taylor appear to have reached an understanding. \nAll the major faction leaders are part of the transition.\n  Mr. President, I believe that now is the time for the international \ncommunity, including the United States, to respond positively to this \nlatest development. Liberia is a country founded by a group of freed \nAmerican slaves. We have a long history of involvement in Liberia and, \nI believe, a special responsibility for its future.\n  This amendment expresses the sense of Congress that the United States \nshould strongly support the recent peace accord. We should assist with \nthe ECOMOG peacekeeping force. We should help demobilize the troops, \nmany of which are children. We should support efforts to resettle the \nrefugees.\n  This amendment also facilitates the delivery of United States relief \nby waiving the Brooke amendment for Liberia for these types of aid. \nBecause of the irresponsible fiscal policies of former President Doe \nand the war, Liberia is prevented from receiving any nonemergency \nUnited States assistance under the Brooke amendment.\n  In 1992, I sponsored a bill--signed into law by President Bush--which \nwaives the Brooke amendment for limited types of assistance to Liberia. \nThat action followed an earlier peace accord that many hoped would end \nthe fighting. But, as we know, the war resumed, and the current \nauthority does not apply because the law refers only to the \nYamoussoukro accord. This amendment simply deletes the reference to \n``Yamoussoukro'' in the current law. It does not appropriate any new \nmoney or affect direct spending. It only gives the President the \nlimited authority to support the latest peace agreement in Liberia from \nexisting accounts.\n  Mr. President, I would urge support for this amendment. I believe it \nis a limited, but important, step in facilitating United States \nassistance for Liberia at this critical time. It is my hope that this \nlatest peace agreement will hold and the devastating and brutal \nconflict in Liberia will finally end.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, before I begin speaking about Liberia, I \nwould like to congratulate the managers of this bill for the good work \nthey have done on behalf of Africa in this bill. The Chairman's mark \nreflects cuts to the accounts that affect development in sub-Saharan \nAfrica, but they do not paralyze our program or signal a United States \nwithdrawal from the region. I think the Chairman acted very \nresponsibly, and I would urge him and the other Senate conferees to \nprotect this mark, at a minimum, in conference. The case for continued \nsupport for Africa is strong, and, I believe, that the United States \nhas serious national security interests in the region, which make our \ninvestment there an imperative.\n  Today I want to talk about Liberia specifically, though, and to speak \nas a cosponsor of the Kassebaum amendment on Liberia, which I expect is \nnon-controversial. The amendment will make what a technical fix in \nexisting law, and permit the United States to provide assistance to \nLiberia to implement the Abuja peace accords reached last month.\n  Since 1989, Liberia has suffered some of the most wretched and \nvengeful warfare in Africa. More than 180,000 people have been killed; \napproximately half the country's population has been displaced; and the \ncapital city of Monrovia is bursting with three times its prewar \npopulation. The country has been shattered by senseless ethnic and \nindividual rivalries, and has been on the verge of total collapse and \nanarchy. The conflict has contributed to instability throughout West \nAfrica, and serious violence--mirroring Liberia's factional divides--\nhas recently erupted in Sierra Leone.\n  I had the opportunity last year to visit Liberia with the past \nchairman of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, Senator Simon, and \nlistened to first-hand accounts about the war. Children were fighting \nchildren to seek revenge for relatives' deaths, or just simply to earn \na day's food; arms flow from state to state, available to anyone \nseeking anything explosive; and violence marks the life of every \nLiberian citizen.\n  Since 1989 the United States has provided over $380 million for \nhumanitarian relief in Liberia, and $60 million for efforts aimed at \nconflict resolution. The United Nations has maintained a small \npeacekeeping mission in Liberia, and the Economic Community of West \nAfrican States [ECOWAS] has deployed thousands of peacekeepers in an \neffort to quell some of the violence. It has been a difficult \nassignment, to say the least.\n  There have been a dozen peace accords in Liberia in the past 6 years. \nThey have failed for a variety of reasons, but most of them were doomed \nbecause they were not negotiated with the concept of powersharing for \nall the factional leaders; rather they sought to isolate some parties, \nin a war which nobody has won, and in fact everybody has lost. \nConsequently, there has not \n\n[[Page S 13934]]\nbeen a unified national will to stop the fighting.\n  The Abuja accord signed last month, though, represents a new way of \ndoing business in Liberia: for the first time, all seven factions are \nrepresented and invested in the agreement; and for the first time, \nthere is a concept of power-sharing in Liberia. It also comes at a time \nwhen the people of Liberia have actively demonstrated their yearning \nfor an end to the war. Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings deserves a \ngreat deal of credit for his tenacity and creativity in facilitating \nthe Abuja accord. I also commend the Nigerians for the role they have \nplayed in these groundbreaking negotiations.\n  For that reason, it is with a cautious sense of relief that I \ncongratulate the people of Liberia on the peace agreement, and join \nSenator Kassebaum in urging support for the Abuja accord. Given the \ndiscouraging history of this war, success is, quite frankly, a \nlongshot, but this agreement is Liberia's best hope at this time for \npeace.\n  The task of reconciliation in Liberia is daunting, so the Abuja \naccord must be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism. But if the \nparties take the first steps and demonstrate their commitment to the \nprocess, then the United States will finally have an opportunity--after \nspending years of investing in humanitarian relief for Liberia--to \nbolster a peace.\n  The first signs have been promising. A ceasefire has been in place, \nand holding more or less, since August 26; the new transitional \ngovernment, the Council of State, was inaugurated on September 1; an \nambitious timeline for disarmament and demobilization has been set; and \ndemocratic elections have been scheduled for August 1996. But there is \na long and difficult road ahead, with many obstacles to overcome.\n  For most of the problems, the answers will be hard to come by. For \ninstance, when I was in Monrovia last year, Liberia was in the process \nof trying to disarm soldiers, pursuant to the Cotonou accords. Yet all \nthey could offer a demobilized soldier was a bag of rice, a jug of \ncooking oil, and a pair of tennis shoes--just enough to feed a family \nfor a few weeks, and hardly enough to substitute for a job as a \nsoldier. Similarly, to reintegrate a child soldier requires a school \nand other constructive programs. Clearly, this will be a tremendously \ncomplicated and long-term process--one which involves not only national \nreconciliation, but also the development of alternative economic \nopportunities.\n  The United States has a moral interest in the fate of Liberia, and we \nhave responded significantly to the humanitarian disaster of the past 6 \nyears. We now must seize the opportunity to invest in peace. While we \nhave limited funds to allocate to foreign aid at all this year, we can \nuse our unique historical relationship with Liberia and the weight of \ncreative diplomacy to advance the process of reconciliation in Liberia.\n  First, we must continue to offer support to the Council of State and, \nwhere appropriate and possible, facilitate attempts at reconciliation. \nWe should be available to President Rawlings in his efforts through \nECOWAS to forge peace in the region as well. Second, we should redouble \nefforts to work with other West African States--namely Burkina Faso, \nCote D'Ivoire, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria--to stop the flagrant arms \ntransfers to Liberia. Third, Liberia should be designated as a priority \nwithin our aid budget to Africa, and resources should be allocated \naccordingly to support the peace process. If the Abuja accords prove \nsuccessful, then the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, \nthe Honorable George Moose, or other high-ranking Administration \nofficials should consider visiting Monrovia. These are all issues we \nwill explore when the subcommittee holds its hearings on the prospects \nfor peace in Liberia next week.\n  Over the years, the United States has proven itself willing to \ncontribute in disaster assistance to Liberia. With the Abuja accord, we \nhave a long overdue opportunity to help support a peace. After 6 harsh \nyears of sadistic violence and dislocation, Liberia needs this \nagreement to succeed. This amendment will clarify that that can happen.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n                           amendment no. 2714\n\n (Purpose: To Allow Training of Foreign Police Forces During and After \n                       U.S. Military Operations)\n\n       On page 81, line 21, strike ``paragraph'' and insert \n     ``paragraphs.'' On page 81, line 23, after ``enforcement.'' \n     insert the following:\n       ``(6) with respect to assistance provided to reconstitute \n     civilian police authority and capability in the post-conflict \n     restoration of host nation infrastructure for the purposes of \n     supporting a nation emerging from instability, and the \n     provision of professional public safety training, to include \n     training in internationally recognized standards of human \n     rights, the rule of law, anti-corruption, and the promotion \n     of civilian police roles that support democracy.''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, for two decades, section 660 of the \nForeign Assistance Act of 1961 has prohibited the U.S. Government from \ntraining foreign police forces.\n  There are a number of exemptions, however: For example, antiterrorism \nand counterdrug training have been permitted. The foreign operations \nbill contains a new exemption; namely, for training foreign police to \nmonitor and enforce sanctions.\n  The 1996 foreign operations report contains an additional exemption; \nthat is, training for monitoring and enforcing embargoes.\n  Deputy Secretary John White and other officials believe that another \nexemption is needed.\n  In their view, the U.S. Government should be allowed to carry out \npolice training during and after U.S. military operations.\n  During military operations in Grenada, Panama, Somalia, and Haiti, \npublic order broke down. Creating new public safety forces in these \ncountries was essential: U.S. forces were unable to leave until there \nwas a new police force in place to protect the public.\n  But section 660 prohibitions technically prevented the Defense \nDepartment--the most effective organization in hostile environments--\nfrom performing this training; as the report of the congressionally \nmandated, bipartisan Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed \nForces stated, ``there are no civilian agencies capable of short notice \ntraining in hostile, demanding environment. We expect DOD will continue \nto be called upon to carry out law enforcement operations in the \nfuture.''\n  The Commission recommended that legislation that restricts the \nability of the Federal Government to conduct constabulary training, for \nexample, section 660, should be amended to allow greater DOD \nparticipation.\n  The Pentagon is prepared to accept its responsibility for short-term \ntraining in hostile environments, for example, Somalia. Before they do \nso, however, they wish to see section 660 amended.\n  The amendment would not require the Defense Department to do the \ntraining. Rather, it would allow the President to use whatever \nGovernment agency he felt was appropriate. In a lsss hostile \nenvironment, for example, Panama after Noreiga's capture, the FBI or \nother agency might do the training.\n                           amendment no. 2715\n\n       On page 67, line 11, add the following section:\n       (b) Direct costs associated with meeting a foreign \n     customer's additional or unique requirements will continue to \n     be allowable under such contracts. Loadings applicable to \n     such direct costs shall be permitted at the same rates \n     applicable to procurement of like items purchased by the \n     Department of Defense for its own use.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2716\n\n   (Purpose: To require a report providing a concise overview of the \n prospects for economic growth on a broad, equitable, and sustainable \nbasis in the countries receiving economic assistance under title II of \n                               this act)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   .

For \n     each country, the report shall discuss the laws, policies and \n     practices of that country that most contribute to or detract \n     from the achievement of this kind of growth.

Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment which will \nrequire AID to contract out mapping and surveying work to qualified \nU.S. companies when such work can be accomplished by the private \nsector.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply concerned that while the Agency for \nInternational Development requires surveying and mapping in countries \nthat receive development assistance, this mapping work is most often \ncontracted out by AID to other government agencies. In many instances \nFederal agencies are aggressively marketing their mapping capabilities \nto foreign governments in direct competition with qualified United \nStates companies. Despite language in previous committee reports, the \namount of contracting for such services has not increased.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n                           amendment no. 2718\n\n (Purpose: To reduce the energy costs of Federal facilities for which \n                funds are made available under this Act)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

During the 1980's Battalion 316 \n     engaged in a campaign of systematically kidnapping, torturing \n     and murdering suspected subversives. Victims included \n     Honduran students, teachers, labor leaders and journalists. \n     In 1993 there were reportedly 184 unsolved cases of persons \n     who were allegedly ``disappeared.'' They are presumed dead.\n       (2) At the time, Administration officials were aware of the \n     activities of Battalion 316, but in its 1983 human rights \n     report the State Department stated that ``There are no \n     political prisoners in Honduras.''\n       (b) Declassification of Documents.--It is the sense of the \n     Congress that the President should order the expedited \n     declassification of any documents in the possession of the \n     United States Government pertaining to persons who allegedly \n     ``disappeared'' in Honduras, and promptly make such documents \n     available to Honduran authorities who are seeking to \n     determine the fate of these individuals.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, amendment that I am sponsoring on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Dodd and Senator Sarbanes, calls on the administration \nto declassify documents relating to individuals who were disappeared in \nHonduras during the 1980's.\n  There is considerable evidence that in 1981, a secret Honduran army \ndeath squad was created with the knowledge and assistance of the \nAmerican Government. It was known as Battalion 316, and during the \n1980's it engaged in a campaign of systematically kidnapping, torturing \nand murdering suspected subversives. These were labor organizers, human \nrights activists, journalists, lawyers, students and teachers. The \nmajority of them were engaged in activities that would be lawful in any \ndemocracy.\n  At that time, the American Embassy, which had ample reason to know \nabout these activities, denied them. Even today, U.S. officials who \nwere stationed there claim not to know.\n  But the fact is that as many as 184 people remain unaccounted for who \nmay have been disappeared, and the Honduran Government, to its credit, \nhas undertaken to determine their fate.\n  Regrettably, the U.S. Government has not done all it could to assist \nin this effort. In fact, it has been unhelpful. For that reason, \nconsistent with a letter sent this week to the President by Senator \nHarkin, myself, and several other Senators, this amendment calls on the \nadministration to promptly make documents in its possession which \npertain to these allegedly disappeared individuals available to \nHonduran authorities.\n  I understand this amendment is acceptable to the other side.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as I indicated, I am unaware of any \nproblems with the amendments that have just been submitted to the desk \non this side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I advise my friend from Kentucky that there \nare no objections on this side. They have been cleared for adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n  So the amendments (Nos. 2710 and 2714 through 2722) were agreed to en \nbloc.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent that tonight when \nwe have the debate under the previous unanimous-consent request \nregarding the Brown amendment, the time on this side under my control \nbe under the control of the distinguished senior Senator from Ohio, \nSenator Glenn, or his designee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me just say that we are hoping to \nhandle an amendment or two before 7. And I remind everyone that \nbeginning at 7, as Senator Leahy indicated, there is a period of 5 \nhours of debate on the Brown amendment which will kick in. But we would \nlike to handle some more amendments before then.\n  Already I think we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. There \nis no reason why we cannot finish this bill sometime tomorrow. The \nnumber of contentious amendments is relatively small already. So I am \noptimistic we will be able to finish. Obviously we will be able to \nfinish tomorrow much more easily if we can get some more amendments \nprocessed between now and 7. So I would invite anyone to come over. I \nknow that Senator Smith has an amendment and may well be willing to \noffer it sometime before 7. But we would welcome anyone to come over.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, in keeping with the earlier \ndesignation by Senator Leahy, I ask unanimous consent that all time in \nopposition to the Brown amendment be under the control of Senator \nGlenn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. For the information of all Senators, I see Senator \nSmith is here and it is my understanding we will be able to have a vote \non or in relation to the Smith amendment before 7 o'clock, so all \nSenators should be alert to the fact that there will be, in all \nlikelihood, one more rollcall tonight before we go into debate, the \nlengthy debate on the Brown amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to offer an amendment to the committee amendment on page 11, \nlines 9 and 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Amendment No. 2723 to Committee Amendment on Page 11, Lines 8 through \n                                   10\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit financial assistance to Vietnam unless certain \n conditions relating to Americans unaccounted for from the Vietnam war \n                                are met)\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I send this amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith], for himself, \n     Mr. Thomas, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Helms, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2723 to committee amendment on page 11, lines 8 \n     through 10.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the Committee amendment, add the following:\n\n\n   prohibition on financial assistance to the socialist republic of \n                                vietnam\n\n       Sec. ____. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used to establish most-favored-\n     nation trading status with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, \n     or to extend financing or other financial assistance to the \n     Socialist Republic of Vietnam from the Export-Import Bank of \n     the United States, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, \n     or Trade and Development Agency unless the President--\n       (1) provides Congress with the original case-by-case \n     analytical assessments on unaccounted for American servicemen \n     from the Vietnam Conflict which were completed by the Defense \n     POW/MIA Office in July, 1995; and\n       (2) certifies to Congress that the Socialist Republic of \n     Vietnam is being fully cooperative and fully forthcoming, on \n     the basis of information available to the United States \n     Government, in the four areas stipulated by the President, \n     namely--\n       (A) concrete results from efforts by Vietnam to recover and \n     repatriate American remains;\n       (B) continued resolution of discrepancy cases, live-\n     sightings, and field activities,\n       (C) further assistance in implementing trilateral \n     investigations with the Lao; and\n       (D) accelerated efforts to provide all documents that will \n     help lead to the fullest possible accounting of POW/MIAs; and\n\n[[Page S 13937]]\n\n       (3) certifies to Congress, after consultation with the \n     Director of Central Intelligence, that the Socialist Republic \n     of Vietnam is being fully forthcoming in providing the United \n     States with access to those portions of wartime Central \n     Committee-level records and reports that pertain to the \n     subject of Americans captured or held during the Vietnam War \n     by North Vietnamese, Pathet Lao, or Vietcong forces in \n     Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia; and\n       (4) certifies to Congress that the Government of the \n     Socialist Republic of Vietnam is making substantial progress \n     to address United States concerns about the continued \n     suppression of the nonviolent pursuit of democratic freedoms \n     by the people of Vietnam, including freedom of expression and \n     association, and the continued imprisonment of political and \n     religious leaders, including American citizens.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I do not choose to take too much of the \nSenate's time. I will be very brief. I know that Senator Thomas and \nSenator McCain are going to be speaking for and against the amendment.\n  I am very pleased in offering this amendment to join with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East \nAsian and Pacific Affairs, Senator Thomas, in offering this amendment. \nI very much appreciate his support. I also appreciate the support of \nthe Senator in the chair, the Senator from Maine, for her support and \ncosponsorship as well.\n  The language in this amendment is very straightforward. It prohibits \nthe granting of any special trading privileges to the socialist \nRepublic of Vietnam unless the President makes two key certifications \nto Congress. The first of these is that Vietnam is cooperating fully \nwith efforts to account for missing American servicemen from the \nVietnam war.\n  That is very straightforward. It does not mean that they have to \nprovide answers for every single person who is missing; some they may \nnot be able to provide. The key is, are they fully cooperating with \nthose efforts to account for missing Americans, giving us the help and \nassistance that we need to try to get information regarding our \nmissing.\n  Second, that Vietnam has taken steps to improve its human rights \nrecord, which is far from exemplary, and that would include addressing \nUnited States objections over the detention of American citizens now in \nVietnam. The POW/MIA-related portion of this amendment was part of a \nresolution I introduced this past May which was cosponsored by the \nmajority leader, Senator Dole, and by the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Helms, and the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Thurmond, the Banking Committee chair, the \nAsian Pacific Subcommittee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, the \nCommerce-State-Justice Appropriations Subcommittee, and the \nInternational Operations Subcommittee. All of those chairs supported \nthis.\n  As my colleagues may recall, since coming to office, President \nClinton has taken five major steps to improve relations with Vietnam. \nLet me just briefly reiterate those.\n  One, in July 1993, 2 years ago, the President ended United States \nobjections to Vietnam having access to International Monetary Fund \nloans, a very significant step, moving Vietnam allegedly into the \ninternational community.\n  Second, in September 1993, the President allowed United States \ncompanies to bid on internationally financed development projects in \nVietnam.\n  Third, in February, 1994, he ended the U.S. trade embargo.\n  Fourth, in January 1995, the President allowed Vietnam and the United \nStates to open liaison offices in our respective capitals.\n  And finally, Madam President, this past summer the President \nannounced his decision to establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam.\n  So the administration has taken very dramatic steps in the past 2 \nyears to bring Communist Vietnam into the family of nations, but it \nshould not be one-sided, Madam President. There should be a two-sided \nequation.\n  Quite frankly, I think it is now time for Vietnam to take some very \ndramatic steps equaling in significance the steps taken by the \nPresident before the American taxpayer is asked to subsidize specific \ntrading privileges with that country.\n  Specifically, I want the President to tell us if Vietnam is fully \ncooperating on the POW/MIA issue. That is all I am asking--the \nPresident to say Vietnam is fully cooperating with us on the POW/MIA \nissue.\n  I would like assurances that Vietnam is addressing our human rights \nconcerns as well.\n  We also would like the President to provide us with complete \ninformation on the status of those who are still missing from the war, \nsomething which was required last year by a unanimous vote in this \nChamber. By unanimous vote of the Senate, we asked that information on \nthe status of Americans still missing from the Vietnam war be provided \nto the Congress.\n  Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, I would just \ninclude three items in the Record that will give a perspective of where \nwe are concerning the issue of human rights in Vietnam and the MIA/POW \nissue.\n  The first item is an Associated Press article from last month \nconcerning the sentencing of two American citizens in Ho Chi Minh City \nwho did nothing more than try to organize a nonviolent conference in \nVietnam. That was their crime, a nonviolent conference.\n  I know that Senator Thomas has already expanded on this issue of \nVietnam's human rights record in a floor statement he made earlier this \nmonth so I am not going to belabor it because I think he will speak to \nthat.\n  The second item is a letter I sent to the Under Secretary of Defense \nin August requesting information on POW/MIA cases, as is required by \nlaw. There has been no response to that request despite the \ncongressional testimony earlier this year that the requested \ninformation would be provided to Congress by this past July. It is a \ndifficult task to provide this information, and I am fully aware of \nthat, but it has not been provided. I think Congress should have this \ninformation. That is all I am asking. Let Congress get this information \nbefore any further trade decisions are made on Vietnam.\n  I think this is especially important because these trade agreements \nwith Vietnam are going to be subsidized through some of these \ninternational monetary organizations by the American taxpayer. We are \ncutting moneys everywhere to reconcile our budget, get it balanced and \nhave a 7-year plan to do it, and surely the American taxpayer should \nnot be subsidizing this country if it has not provided the information \nas required by the laws passed by this Congress.\n  The third item is a breakdown of 2,197 cases of unaccounted Americans \nfrom the Vietnam war by country of loss and military service. And I ask \nunanimous consent, Madam President, that these referenced items be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, this is a very reasonable amendment. I \nknow there is some opposition to it, but it makes clear to Vietnam, it \nsends a very strong message to Vietnam and to President Clinton about \nthe seriousness of our resolve in Congress to obtain full cooperation \non the POW issue as well as improvements in human rights cases. It \nsends that message. That is a reasonable message to send that we expect \nfull cooperation and we expect improvement in human rights cases if we \nare going to provide taxpayer subsidies to help them, the Vietnamese, \nget loans. This is not an attempt to replay the decision that was made \nto establish full diplomatic relations. We lost that debate, and I \nunderstand that. I did not like it, but I understand it. But what we \nare trying to do now is make Vietnam comply with what is required.\n  When the President is ready to tell the American people that our \nconcerns have been addressed, then I will withdraw any objections that \nI have to move forward on trade. But the President must tell us, and he \nhas not done that. If the President is going to move forward on trade, \nforward on establishing the diplomatic relations and the mission and \nall of those things, is it too much to ask to simply have the President \nof the United States certify to Congress that we are receiving the \nfullest possible accounting? \n\n[[Page S 13938]]\n\n  I hope that my colleague, the Senator from Kentucky, might take a \nsecond look at opposition to this amendment because I do not think it \nis unreasonable. It is really very, very specific and very, very \nreasonable. We should not have to fund any trade decisions before \nreceiving a certification from the President. It is that simple. That \nis what the law provides for.\n  Let us hope, Madam President, that the leaders of Vietnam will choose \nto respond in a significant way to the five major concessions that this \nPresident has already made to Vietnam. I have listed all five. And they \nhave been made in the last 2 years, not over a period of 20 years, but \na period of 2, very rapidly.\n  And I would just say that if those conditions would be met, if the \nVietnamese could respond to those five points, the President steps \nforward and says that we have fully received now the full cooperation \nof the Vietnamese and we get that list on MIA's and we can get the \ncooperation on the human rights violations, both specifically--I think \nSenator Thomas will discuss the two cases--then I think we can move on. \nBut we should not be moving on before. A lot of people died in this \nwar, and a lot of families are still waiting for answers. And they \ndeserve to have the President of the United States step up to the \nmicrophone, face the American people, and say very simply, the \nVietnamese are fully cooperating; they are providing all the \ninformation that they have and can provide unilaterally to the United \nStates of America regarding their missing in action. When he says that, \nthe day he says that, I will be the first Senator down on the floor to \nsay, ``Fine. Let us move on.'' That is all I am asking. That is not an \nunreasonable request.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dole be listed \nas an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Associated Press, Aug. 16, 1995]\n\n  State Department Calls Vietnamese Jailing of U.S. Citizens Unwelcome\n\n       Washington.--The State Department says the jailing by \n     Vietnam of two Vietnamese-Americans on subversion charges is \n     unwelcome.\n       In a two-day trial ending Saturday, a court in Ho Chi Minh \n     City sentenced Nguyen Tan Tri, 39, to seven years in prison \n     and Tran Quang Liem, 45, to four years on charges of trying \n     to overthrow Vietnam's government.\n       Both hold American as well as Vietnamese citizenship and \n     have been held since November 1993.

Walter B. Slocombe,\n     Under Secretary of Defense,\n     Department of Defense, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Walter: I am writing to express my concern that the \n     Congress has yet to receive the final results of the \n     comprehensive review of Vietnam-era POW/MIA cases promised by \n     Secretary of Defense Perry in his letter to the Senate Armed \n     Service Committee dated February 17, 1995. As you know this \n     review was initiated in response to Section 1034 of the \n     Fiscal Year 1995 National Defense Authorization Act (Public \n     Law 103-337), the intent of which was to require a listing of \n     such cases by November 17, 1994.\n       In a followup letter to me dated April 7, 1995, you stated \n     that the Department of Defense was giving this matter its \n     utmost attention and that you were confident the review would \n     be completed during the summer. You also reiterated that \n     ``the Department will report the results of DPMO's review to \n     Congress on its completion.'' Subsequently, in testimony \n     before Congress on June 28, 1995, Deputy Assistant Secretary \n     of Defense for POW/MIA Affairs James Wold stated that he \n     expected that the review would be an ``all-encompassing look \n     at every individual case which would provide a solid analytic \n     assessment of the appropriate next steps for achieving the \n     fullest possible accounting.'' I support Secretary Wold's \n     conclusion on June 28th with respect to this review that \n     ``our unaccounted for Americans deserve no less,'' and that \n     he would ``work to ensure that we keep our promise to them.''\n       It is my understanding that the above-mentioned review has \n     now been completed by the Defense POW/MIA Office (DPMO), in \n     conjunction with J2 of the Joint Task Force (Full \n     Accounting). I further understand that the analytical product \n     which resulted from this review has been presented to \n     National Security Council and Department of Defense policy \n     level officials for comment before it is forwarded to the \n     Congress.\n       As you know, there are many of us in Congress who believe \n     that the results of an honest and thorough analytical review \n     of outstanding POW/MIA cases by DPMO would likely reinforce \n     previous CIA and DOD assessments that Communist Vietnamese \n     and Laotian officials have the ability to unilaterally \n     account for several hundred missing American servicemen.\n       It is my hope that you will keep the commitment in your \n     letter dated April 7, 1995 to ``report the results of DPMO's \n     review to Congress on its completion.'' I certainly \n     understand the obvious interest of DOD and NSC policy level \n     officials in the results of this review, especially in view \n     of Administration statements that Communist Vietnam's \n     ``splendid and superb'' cooperation on the POW/MIA issue \n     provided justification for the President's decision to expand \n     diplomatic and economic relations with Hanoi. Nonetheless, I \n     hope that any objective assessments by DPMO's intelligence \n     analysts will not now be subjected at the policy level to \n     ``different views about how things should be put in the \n     report,'' as you described on April 7th. As you know, I \n     previously raised similar concerns about policy level skewing \n     of intelligence information in my March 7, 1995 letter to you \n     regarding Secretary Perry's February 17th interim report.\n       Accordingly, I request that the analytical results of \n     DPMO's comprehensive review of Vietnam-era cases of \n     unaccounted for personnel be immediately forwarded to the \n     Congress.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I had some lingering hope that the \nCongress, or at least the Senate, had finished debating Vietnam. The \nPresident made his decision to normalize relations with Vietnam--a wise \ndecision in my judgment--and most Americans, including most veterans, \nconcurred in that decision. Editorial opinion was almost uniformly \npositive.\n  There was, of course, some inflammatory language coming from some \nMembers of the House of Representatives--but they were so few in number \nas to be insignificant. Suffice it to say, that the President was right \nto normalize relations with Vietnam, and the country has breathed a \nsigh of relief that our long war with Vietnam is over.\n  It is also apparent to all that there is little support in the Senate \nfor reversing the President's decision to open an embassy in Hanoi. If \nthere were such support I am sure we would be debating an amendment to \nprohibit funds for an embassy. Thus, Madam President, I was lulled into \nthe comforting, but false notion that I would not be obligated to \ndebate my colleagues again on the subject of Vietnam.\n  I should have known better.\n  Mr. dear friend--and he is my dear friend--from New Hampshire is a \npersistent opponent on this question. He has chosen to take another cut \nat running our Government's Vietnam policy out of his office. It is his \nright to make such an attempt. And while I respect his zeal and his \npatriotism, I hope he will under stand my disappointment in having to \ncome to the floor to take issue with him again. I fear that it has \nbecome my fate to forever fight about Vietnam, and that is something I \nnever anticipated when I left that country so many years ago.\n  Madam President, the President of the United States has set the \npolicy for United States-Vietnam relations, as it is his duty to do. It \nis my friend from New Hampshire's right to oppose that policy. And make \nno mistake, his amendment is an attempt to overturn it.\n  Although the amendment does not reverse the President's decision to \nopen an embassy, it does prevent or at least impede the development of \nnormal relations between our two countries. I think that is a serious \nmistake; I think most Americans will see it as a mistake, and I hope \nthe Senate will go on record in strong opposition to it.\n  On the question of using trade as leverage to ensure continued POW/\nMIA progress, let me point out an incontrovertible fact: Before the \nPresident lifted our trade embargo against Vietnam, opponents of that \ndecision warned that without the coercion of an embargo, the Vietnamese \nwould stop cooperating with our efforts to account for our remaining \nmissing. As it turned out, quite the reverse happened. Vietnam's \ncooperation increased. Before the President decided to open an embassy \nin Hanoi, opponents of that decision warned that once we abandoned the \nincentive of diplomatic relations, the Vietnamese would stop \ncooperating with our accounting efforts. Again, quite the reverse \nhappened. Cooperation has continued.\n  Eight sets of remains, believed to be Americans, have been recovered \nsince the President announced his intention to normalize relations.\n  During his August visit, the Vietnamese gave Secretary Christopher a \n3\\1/2\\ inch stack of wartime records, 116 documents in all.\n  Senator Harkin, in his trip to Vietnam this summer, also received a \ngreat many pages of documents, records from the Vietnamese Interior \nMinistry.\n  Our 37th joint field operation with the Vietnamese is currently \nunderway and yielding good results.\n  Now, the opponents of normal relations argue that if we do not freeze \nthe development of normal relations by restricting United States \nbusinesses from trading with and investing in Vietnam, Hanoi will no \nlonger cooperate with us. On this, as on every occasion in the past, \nthey will be proven wrong. They will be proven wrong because the \nVietnamese, like most Americans, believe it is in their interests--\ntheir best interests--to develop a strong, mutually beneficial \nrelationship. Those interests override any lingering resentments from \nthe war.\n  Vietnam's interests are numerous. The most obvious are Vietnam's \ndesire to enter the modern world and enjoy the same economic growth and \nprosperity experienced by their Southeast Asian neighbors. They also \nare rightly concerned about regional stability and the determination \nthat no single power dominate Southeast Asia.\n  It is for these reasons and others that Vietnam will continue to \ncooperate with our POW/MIA efforts. There is also the fact that there \nis nothing to be gained by not cooperating. The Vietnamese are a lot of \nthings, but it has been my experience that they are seldom capricious. \nThey act in their interest. Their interests are best served by good \nrelations with the United States--whether or not we give them MFN or \nOPIC credits or whatever. They know that, and will act accordingly.\n  It is also in our interests to engage Vietnam. First, as I have \nalready pointed out, because it best serves the cause of POW/MIA \naccounting. Second, because we too have an interest in regional \nstability, and an economically sound Vietnam playing a responsible role \nas a valued member of ASEAN serves that end very well.\n  I also believe that since it is not in our power to isolate Vietnam--\nthey have rapidly developing relations with the rest of the world--our \nbest hope for encouraging political reforms is to engage Vietnam and \nbecome more deeply involved in their economic well-being.\n  Madam President, I do not really want to debate this issue much \nlonger. Few topics have been so extensively debated in American history \nas Vietnam. Frankly, I am extremely weary of the subject, so I will \nconclude with this reminder.\n  It is profoundly in our interest to construct from the peace a \nrelationship with Vietnam that serves the interest of the Vietnamese \nand the American people far better than our old antagonism did. The war \nin Vietnam is over. It is over. I respectfully ask my colleagues to \ndemonstrate that the Senate has grasped this reality and support the \nPresident in his attempt to make something better from our future \nrelations with Vietnam than we were able to do in our sad distant past.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment of the Senator from New Hampshire to H.R. 1868, regarding the \nextending of economic benefits to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\n  I shall be brief. My associate from Missouri wants to speak, and we \nwant to vote before 7 o'clock.\n  As Senator Smith pointed out, while the Clinton administration has \nbeen quick to normalize relations with the Government of Vietnam, it \nhas not been as quick to meet its obligations to the Congress and the \nAmerican people. For example, section 1034 of Public Law 103-337 \nrequires the Secretary of Defense to provide the Congress with a \ncomplete list of missing or unaccounted United States military \npersonnel about whom it is possible that Vietnamese and Laotian \nofficials could produce information or remains.\n  The statute mandated that report to be submitted to us by November \n17, 1994. When the DOD requested an extension of the deadline to \nFebruary 17, 1995, we did not object. We did not object when the DOD \nsupplied us with a \n\n[[Page S 13940]]\nsadly incomplete interim report. But, Madam President, more than 7 \nmonths after that date, we still have not received the complete report \nrequired by the statute. This was not a request, not a casual \ninvitation to provide information. It is a legal mandate.\n  Second, despite both administration and Vietnam protestations to the \ncontrary, I do not believe the Government of Vietnam has done its \nfullest to account for the POW/MIA's, especially as regards records of \nUnited States servicemen who disappeared in, or were taken across the \nborder into Laos.\n  Finally, in all this controversy surrounding the POW/MIA issue, we \nseem to have lost sight of the important fact that there is disregard \nfor human rights in that country. I will not go into detail. I put them \nin the Record some time ago.\n  So I will just conclude by saying, until the President can certify to \nus that, in his judgment, the Vietnamese are living up to their \nexpectation--that is not too much to ask--and their promises regarding \nthe MIA's and POW's and its international right to commitment, I think \nit is irresponsible and bad judgment for us to provide funding for \nthem.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Senator's amendment. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I say to the Senator from Missouri, I \nwill take just a couple minutes.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I have a couple of brief responses.\n  I thank my colleague from Wyoming for his remarks. He has been very \nhelpful on this issue. This amendment, I want to point out, does not \nreverse anything the President has already done. It does not reverse \nthe diplomatic ties, it does not go back and replay the war, it does \nnot mean that Senator Smith is running Vietnam policy out of his \noffice. What it does mean is that this debate continues because this is \na one-sided equation. It continues because the President of the United \nStates has made significant movements. Some of us oppose those \nmovements, but we are not replaying that. He made those decisions, and \nhe moved forward.\n  I respect the will of the majority. That decision has been made. I am \nnot replaying that. But what I am trying to point out is that the \nVietnamese have not responded in kind to those moves. I think we have \nan obligation to the families who still wait for answers to have them \nrespond in time before the taxpayers of America, through subsidizing \nthe International Monetary Fund and other international organizations, \nare going to be providing funds to the Vietnamese. I think they have a \nright to have the President of the United States, who implemented this \npolicy, stand before the Congress and the American people and say: \n``The Vietnamese are fully cooperating with the United States \nGovernment on the accounting of our men.''\n  I ask any of my colleagues who have spoken previously in opposition \nto my amendment, or who will speak in the future in opposition to my \namendment, whether it be Senator Bond or anyone else, stand here on the \nfloor of the Senate and make the statement in the affirmative that the \nVietnamese are fully cooperating--fully cooperating--with the United \nStates of America and the accounting of our men. I have not heard that.\n  If you think Vietnam has been fully cooperative, if you really think \nthey have been, vote against my amendment; I want you to vote against \nmy amendment. If you believe the Vietnamese are fully cooperating on \nthis issue, then vote against my amendment. If you believe they are \nnot, then you should vote for my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I join my colleagues from Arizona and \nMassachusetts in urging Senators to oppose this amendment. Earlier this \nyear, President Clinton made the decision to restore diplomatic \nrelations with Vietnam. That was a correct decision for him to make, \none which I supported and I believe a majority of this body supported.\n  Frankly, when the President announced his recognition of Vietnam, he \nmade an announcement at the time that the conditions had been complied \nwith. I think it is time the United States restore relations with \nVietnam. It is in the best interest of the United States and in the \nbest interest of the families of those soldiers who continue to be \nmissing in action.\n  I did not serve in Vietnam, as did my colleagues from Arizona, \nMassachusetts, and New Hampshire, but I have traveled, however, to \nVietnam in the past year. I participated in extensive meetings with our \nmilitary officials there who are responsible for discovering the fate \nof those missing in action.\n  I came away from every single one of those conversations with the \nsame clear message, and that is, the Vietnamese are working very hard \nto meet our request for assistance. I got the same message in June when \nI met with the Presidential delegation who just returned from meetings \nin Vietnam. Vietnam has allowed us to conduct field exercises, allowed \nus to dig up military cemeteries.\n  Can you imagine our permitting a nation with which we engaged in \narmed conflict to come in and dig up Arlington? You talk about \ncooperation. I had the opportunity to talk with Col. Mel Richmond who \nis in charge of the Joint Task Force for Full Accounting, and he has \noutlined the great lengths of cooperation to which the Vietnamese have \ngone. I can tell you from the men who are directly involved in the \neffort that they believe that increased contacts and relations between \nthe United States and Vietnam will increase our ability to find out any \npossible leads to those who remain, and they are very few.\n  Those who were not lost at sea, those who have had any possible \nsightings, there are fewer than 100 open cases, and there have been \nextensive efforts on behalf of each of those cases to track them down.\n  The amendment that is offered by our friend from New Hampshire would \nset additional conditions before the administration can go forward with \nadditional trade ties, including Eximbank support, OPIC, TDA and MFN \nstatus.\n  There would not, as suggested by my colleagues, be any savings to the \nAmerican taxpayer. These activities, basically, are to provide \nassistance to American businesses which are now competing for business \nin Vietnam. These programs carry with them their own conditions on when \nthey can be utilized, and there is, in my judgment, no reason to delay \nat this point the opportunities to obtain, through better contact, \ninformation from Vietnam by allowing American businesses who are there \ncompeting for the opportunities in a growing market to go further.\n  I believe that the demonstrated activities, the demonstrated efforts \nby the Vietnamese have justified the President's announcement on the \nsigning of the relationship agreement with Vietnam that the conditions \nare being complied with.\n  That does not make sense. It would only have the impact of keeping \nUnited States firms from being competitive with their European, \nJapanese, and Taiwanese competitors. It will do nothing to help the MIA \nsearch.\n  All of these programs carry requirements that must be met in terms of \nhuman rights certifications, labor certifications, and so forth. It \ndoes not make sense to add additional requirements.\n  Certainly we need to keep pressure on the Vietnamese Government to \nhelp us with the MIA search, and certainly we need to keep pressure on \nthem to improve human rights.\n  However, it only makes sense to increase bilateral ties, increase \ntrade ties, and have as many Americans over there. That increased \ncontact is the best thing we can do to influence their conduct.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as a cosponsor, I rise in support of the \namendment offered by the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Smith.\n  Mr. President, I would like to recognize the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Hampshire for his tireless efforts on behalf of the families \nof American POW's and MIA's. As a Vietnam veteran, he has always kept \nfirst in his \n\n[[Page S 13941]]\nconcern the fate of those American men and women who never returned \nfrom this most divisive of all of our wars.\n  This amendment puts aside the controversies over President Clinton's \ndecision to grant full diplomatic relations to the Socialist Republic \nof Vietnam. Rather, this amendment simply says that Vietnam will not \nreceive most favored nation trading status, or other trade benefits \nuntil the President reports to Congress that Vietnamese officials are \nfully meeting United States expectations on the POW/MIA issue.\n  I would like to emphasize that the criteria the President would have \nto certify are drawn directly from the President's own past statements \non the strict standards he would use for judging whether the Vietnamese \nhave indeed been entirely cooperative in achieving the fullest possible \naccounting of America's MIA's.\n  We all have the same goal, which is to achieve the fullest possible \naccounting for those Americans who did not return from Vietnam. But the \nfamilies and loved ones of those Americans are not able to so easily \nput this issue behind them. They have a need to know; they have a right \nto know.\n  And that leads to what I believe this issue is all about: that is, \nwhat does this nation stand for? My personal belief is that a basic \nprinciple is at stake here.\n  What America is all about requires us to keep our faith with the \nfamilies of those who remain missing and who are unaccounted for from \nthe Vietnam war. This argues for using the leverage we have to ensure \nthe greatest possible accounting for these missing Americans.\n  To this end, the United States has already come half way. Indeed, we \nhave come more than half way.\n  In just the past 19 months, the United States lifted its economic and \ntrade embargo, permitting full trade relations and investment by U.S. \ncompanies in the country. In addition, we reached an accord with \nVietnam settling property claims between our two governments; we have \nestablished in Hanoi a United States liaison office staffed by American \ndiplomats and functioning as a lower-level diplomatic presence; we have \nsigned a diplomatic agreement protecting United States citizens who may \nreside in or travel to Vietnam; and we have established full diplomatic \nrelations with Vietnam.\n  For years the Government of Vietnam refused to provide even the \nslightest assistance in resolving these MIA cases. Vietnam only began--\ngrudgingly--to assist in accounting for these missing Americans when \nthe country lost its patron with the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n  In the words of the American Legion, ``Vietnam's cooperation on the \nresolution of the POW/MIA issue has not fulfilled reasonable \nexpectations.'' The National League of Families of American Prisoners \nand Missing in Southeast Asia has also criticized those, ``commending \nVietnam for full POW/MIA cooperation despite evidence to the \ncontrary.''\n  In fact, the league has noted that actions the United States already \ntook leading up to the President's normalization decision have, \n``signaled Vietnam that unilateral actions on their part are not \nexpected nor required to achieve their political and economic \nobjectives.''\n  And since the President ended the United States embargo on Vietnam, \nonly eight Americans who were captured or became missing in action in \nNorth Vietnam have been accounted for.\n  I believe that we should have been more insistent in using the \nconsiderable leverage we have with Vietnam--leverage that we are in \ndanger of throwing away if this amendment is not approved. Vietnam is \nanxious to establish close economic and political ties to the United \nStates as a counter-weight to China, its traditional rival to the \nnorth.\n  But to me, and I believe to most Americans, full cooperation in \naccounting for our remaining MIA's should have been an absolute \nthreshold that Vietnam was required to meet before we took the final \nstep of rewarding the Vietnamese Government with a full United States \ntrade relations.\n  The only step remaining is the granting of full trading relations to \nVietnam. I believe that the status of our relations with Vietnam are \nstill too new and too uncertain for such a precipitous step. Granting \nthis final concession now is simply too great a risk, given continuing \ngrave uncertainties about the true level of Vietnamese knowledge about \nthe fate of the many of the Americans who never returned.\n  And the POW/MIA issue does remain in question. The names of 58,196 \nAmericans have been etched into the reflective walls of the Vietnam \nVeteran's Memorial. Listed with them, each marked with a simple cross, \nare the names of 2,205 Americans still unaccounted for in Vietnam. This \nmeans that for every 25 young Americans who gave their life in Vietnam, \nan additional American simply disappeared and was never heard from \nagain.\n  A much more reasonable approach, I believe, is the approach proposed \nby the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Smith. The Smith amendment \nwould ensure that our duty and obligation as a nation is fully met to \nour MIA's and their families before we in the U.S. Senate endorse full \ntrade relations between our two countries.\n  I urge adoption of the Smith amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. The hour of 7 o'clock will momentarily arrive. I know the \nSenate is under a UC to go into certain business.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed for no longer \nthan 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. I will be very, very brief. There are \ntimes when many of us have been prompted to come to the Senate floor in \norder to solicit action from the Congress on the basis that the \nPresident was not doing something or we were engaged in a bad policy. \nBut, as my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know--and I know \nthe Senator from Arizona has followed this as closely as anybody in the \nSenate--the President has been pursuing a very deliberate, very \ncareful, very cautious strategy with respect to Vietnam and, step by \nstep, has guaranteed that they are cooperating fully in the process of \naccountability.\n  We have heard these arguments before. Each year, when we have heard \nthese arguments, we have seen irrefutable proof that Vietnam is \ncooperating to the best of our military commander's judgment, to the \nbest of the judgment of the people in the field.\n  I would think most of my colleagues would feel that this is really an \nexcessive intrusion on the part of the Congress, an unwarranted \nintrusion into the legitimate powers of the President, and at a time \nwhen there is nothing that suggests that anything but a careful and \ndeliberative accounting process is going on.\n  Finally, there is language in this particular amendment which is so \nunspecific, nonspecific, as to open a Pandora's box of capacity for \nreally an imprecision that allows nobody to know exactly what documents \nwe are asking for, and precisely who has them. I say that based on my \nknowledge of this issue, at this point, there is no knowledge that they \neven exist. So we, once again, begin chasing one of the mythical \ndragons. I think it is unnecessary. I associate myself with the \ncomments of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the yeas \nand nays have been ordered on the Smith amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest that we vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

I would like at this time \nto yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senate that on the Brown \namendment No. 2708, there will be 5 hours of debate equally divided, \nand the Senator from Colorado yields to the Senator from Washington, \n[Mr. Gorton].\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Chair.\n  I appear here this evening to add my voice to my vote in supporting \nthe amendment of the Senator from Colorado. Much, perhaps all, that \nneeds to be said on this issue has already been said, but I believe it \nimportant that there be more voices than the handful that have spoken \nout so far.\n  The Senator from Colorado has pointed out that in spite of the \npolicies of the United States, Pakistan has continued to be a friend \nand an ally of the United States, has helped the United States when we \nwere involved in assisting rebels in Afghanistan, has helped the United \nStates in connection with the return of fugitives fleeing justice here \nin this country, has moved in spite of great difficulties more and more \ntoward a democratic system and toward a system based on free market \neconomies.\n  As the Senator from Colorado has pointed out, in a very difficult \npart of the world, this nation has helped in the pursuit of peace and \nsecurity and stability.\n  I should like to say that in the most profound sense, as we deal with \nthis issue, that friendship and that assistance is almost irrelevant. \nThis debate in this body at least is not so much about Pakistan and \nIndia as it is about the United States, its administration, and this \nbody.\n  Mr. President, a great nation honors its commitments. This Nation has \nrepudiated its commitments and should reverse its course of action and \nembrace that part of honor once again. This Nation permitted the \nmanufacture and sale to Pakistan of certain military aircraft. They \nhave been bought and paid for, and yet for years we have not only \ndenied the right of the purchaser to take possession of those aircraft, \nwe have added insult to injury by not showing our willingness, having \nset this policy, to pay back the purchase price and in fact are \ndemanding from Pakistan payment for storage charges for the aircraft.\n  That is not the action of an honorable country. That is not the \naction of a nation which keeps its commitments. I strongly suspect that \nthe Senator from Colorado would prefer simply that we keep our original \nagreement. He has not gone so far. He has simply suggested that those \nitems of military equipment that are owned by Pakistan that are here \nfor repair, which have also effectively been confiscated by the actions \nof our Government, be returned to Pakistan and that in the most modest \npossible way of dealing with the aircraft, they be sold to third \nparties and the proceeds of those sales be returned to the nation which \nhas paid for them.\n  I wish we were voting on a more decisive action, Mr. President. I \nhave that wish not so much because of a strong opinion on the rivalry \nbetween India and Pakistan as I do to remove this blot from our own \nrecord. As I said earlier, an honorable nation keeps its commitments. \nWe have not kept our commitments. We should do so to the extent \nrequired by this amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me time?\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield the Senator 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized \nfor 20 minutes.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, let me give a little history of how this \namendment came about, if I may be allowed to do so.\n  In the mid 1980's, the Carter administration had shut off aid to \nPakistan because of their alleged nuclear activities. In about 1985, \nthere was an amendment in the Foreign Relations Committee known as the \nCranston amendment which would have legally shut off aid to Pakistan. \nThe Reagan administration at that time asked me to offer an amendment \nto the Cranston amendment which would allow Pakistan to get money. The \namendment said that Pakistan would receive United States aid money and \nbuy military aircraft, and so forth, so long as the President could \ncertify that they did not have a nuclear weapon.\n  Now, under the terms of that agreement, Vice President Bush at that \ntime and others were promised by the Pakistanis that they were not \ndeveloping a nuclear weapon and that the so-called Pressler amendment \nwould never come into effect. Indeed, until 1990, Pakistan received aid \nand received military equipment and there was military sales.\n  Then, in 1990, then President Bush, who had been Vice President at \nthe original time we worked this out, was President and his \nadministration could no longer certify that Pakistan did not have a \nnuclear weapon. So, in other words, President Bush concluded that \nPakistan had not told the truth and it was buying arms under false \npremises.\n  That is the twist to this debate which seems to have been forgotten. \nOriginally, Pakistan supported the Pressler amendment. Originally, the \nPressler amendment was a means to help Pakistan get money and to buy \narms provided that she was not developing a nuclear weapon.\n  That seems to have been forgotten in this whole debate, because we \ntalk about countries' honor and countries' decency, and so forth. There \nare many twists to this story regarding the Pressler amendment. Since \n1990, each year our CIA with our technical means of assessment has \nconcluded that Pakistan does, indeed, have a nuclear weapon, although \nPakistan has continued to deny that, although on one or two occasions \ntheir top generals have said that that is true.\n  Another complex thing in this whole matter is that there seems to be \ntwo distinct governments in Pakistan. And let me say, first of all, I \nlike Pakistan. I have been to Pakistan several times.\n  I want our country to be friends with Pakistan. I have been up to the \nKhyber Pass. I know that Pakistan has been our ally and Pakistan has \ndone a great deal for and with the United States, and we have done a \ngreat deal for Pakistan. I want to be friends with India and Pakistan \nin the long run. I think China is driving the nuclear weapons race over \nthere, basically. And China \n\n[[Page S 13943]]\nreally is the country we should be worried about. So I am not here to \nbeat up on Pakistan or to criticize it.\n  But I would also say that I have had some good talks with the Prime \nMinister of Pakistan about trying to get this resolved. The problem is \nthat it is the Pakistani military who really makes the decisions, I \nthink, on the issue of nuclear weapons and on whether or not they \npossess them. So that is how we have gotten to where we are today.\n  Now, it is proposed that we are somehow guilty or we have done \nsomething wrong as a nation. But Pakistan purchased these planes while \nknowing very well that they were developing nuclear weapons, knowing \nvery well that we had a law against it, knowing very well that they \nwould not be able to be delivered if that were discovered. And in 1990 \nthat was discovered. So there has been kind of a twist put on this \nwhole thing that is a reverse twist so to speak.\n  Now, Mr. President, the three key powers in the region--Pakistan, \nIndia, and China--have nuclear weapons programs. A fourth, the renegade \nterrorist state of Iran, will stop at nothing to acquire nuclear \ncapability. All are striving to obtain modern delivery systems, such as \nballistic missiles and aircraft. There also have been credible reports \nthat Pakistan has received from Communist China M-11 ballistic missile \ntechnology. Without question, a nuclear war in South Asia would be \ncataclysmic. The names of the perpetrators, and their accessories, \nwould be cursed for a millennium.\n  To its credit, Mr. President, the U.S. Senate consistently has taken \ninitiatives to promote peace and stability in South Asia--the core of \nthat leadership has been the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In \n1985, the committee--under the able leadership of the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar]--voted to adopt my amendment \nthat allowed United States aid to Pakistan to continue as long as the \nPresident could certify that Pakistan was not in possession of a \nnuclear explosive device--the so-called Pressler amendment.\n  Why did the committee take this action? At that time, Pakistan was \nthe third largest recipient of United States foreign assistance, \nreceiving as much as $600 million annually. Pakistan and its people \nwere instrumental in channeling American resources to Afghan rebels as \nthey sought to repel Soviet invaders.\n  U.S. officials rightly were concerned, however, that government in \nIslamabad at that time was intent on developing a nuclear weapon--a \ncourse of action clearly not in our national interest.\n  I have recounted the events, but the purpose of the Pressler \namendment was designed to send one message: Nuclear proliferation has a \nprice. And if we are going to do what is in the Brown amendment, we are \naccepting nuclear proliferation.\n  Now, let me say, Mr. President, I think it is very strange that the \nClinton administration, with all the things President Clinton and Al \nGore have said about nonnuclear proliferation, that they would allow \nsupport for this amendment or they would give support for this \namendment, because we are excusing nuclear proliferation, we are \nexcusing a country that promised us, that made a deal with us, that \nthey would not develop a bomb. We are giving them a carte blanche to go \nahead.\n  In fact, a number of Senators believed enough evidence existed to \nverify Pakistan's drive for the bomb, and strong enforcement of United \nStates laws that would result in an immediate cutoff of United States \naid. The Pressler amendment was designed to avoid an immediate United \nStates aid cutoff, but reinforce our Nation's policy that it would not \ncondone--through United States taxpayer dollars--Pakistan's drive for \nthe bomb. In addition, the Pressler amendment was designed to give \nPakistan a financial incentive to ensure that its nuclear program \nserved a peaceful purpose. In short, the Pressler amendment was \ndesigned to send one message: Nuclear proliferation has a price.\n  Mr. President, those were the key reasons why the U.S. Congress \nadopted the Pressler amendment 10 years ago. It was the right thing to \ndo. President Ronald Reagan agreed. So did the Government of Pakistan \nat that time. Let me repeat that: the Government of Pakistan supported \nthe Pressler amendment. It gave our Government its assurance that it \nwas not pursuing a nuclear bomb program. By supporting the Pressler \namendment. Pakistan agreed that if it acquired a nuclear explosive \ndevice, it deserved the penalty of a United States aid cutoff.\n  In 1990, President Bush could no longer certify, under the terms of \nthe Pressler amendment, that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear \nexplosive device. As a result, all United States economic and military \naid to Pakistan was terminated. Further, a $1.4 billion commercial \norder of military equipment to Pakistan was put on hold.\n  Now, Mr. President, it is clear that Pakistan possesses nuclear \nweapons. It is also clear that Pakistan was pursuing a nuclear bomb \nprogram between 1985 and 1990, despite repeated public assurances that \nit was not. During that time, Pakistan received approximately $3.5 \nbillion in United States foreign aid. Again, the Government received \nthese funds from the American taxpayer in return for its assurance that \nit would not go nuclear. Yet, the reality was that the existing \ngovernment in Pakistan in fact produced nuclear explosive and used the \nAmerican people's money to do it. That was an extraordinary act of \ndeception.\n  That is the history behind the Pressler amendment. And to borrow the \nwords of Abraham Lincoln, we cannot escape history. We cannot escape \nthe fact that the United States subsidized Pakistan's nuclear weapons \nprogram for 5 years after the Pressler amendment became law. We cannot \nescape the fact that Pakistan repeatedly assured its ally, the United \nStates, it was not pursuing a nuclear weapons program. Prime Minister \nBenazir Bhutto stood in this building--in the House Chamber--on June 7, \n1989, and stated: ``Speaking for Pakistan, I can declare that we do not \npossess nor do we intend to make a nuclear device. That is our \npolicy.'' The opposite was true in each case.\n  Mr. President, we cannot escape history.\n  We also were given assurances by Pakistan's government regarding the \nlevel of enrichment of its uranium, foreign nuclear procurement, \ncooperation with communist China, and other related nonproliferation \nissues. In each case, the Government of Pakistan broke its word.\n  Thus, despite United States law, despite clear United States policy, \nand despite repeated assurances from its leaders, Pakistan built a \nnuclear weapons program and used American taxpayer dollars to do it.\n  Those are the facts. We cannot escape history.\n  Yet, we are here today to consider an amendment that ignores history. \nEven worse, if we adopt this amendment, we would be condemning \nourselves to repeat history. Nothing in the Brown amendment would \nensure that American taxpayer assistance would not further directly or \nindirectly Pakistan's bomb program. Do any of my colleagues believe we \nshould reverse this long-standing United States policy? Should we risk \nonce again subsidizing Pakistan's nuclear bomb program with the \nAmerican people's tax dollars? Certainly not. That is the fundamental \nreason why this amendment should be defeated, because that is exactly \nwhat it would do.\n  So, Mr. President, what I am saying to you, in the past, American tax \ndollars directly or indirectly have been used to develop a nuclear bomb \nin Pakistan. The passage of this amendment will allow American \ntaxpayers' dollars to be used in that regard again.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the impact of unconditionally \nreversing a fundamental element of U.S. nuclear nonproliferation \npolicy. I ask my colleagues to consider what signal this amendment \nwould send to other nations who play by international non-proliferation \nrules. Frankly, it sends the worst possible message: nuclear \nproliferation pays.\n  Mr. President, some years ago I served as chairman of the Arms \nControl Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee. We held \nnumerous hearings, and we urged other nations to engage in \nnonproliferation policies. We have elaborate schemes and treaties. This \namendment would leave a big hole and set a terrible precedent for \n\n[[Page S 13944]]\nour nuclear nonproliferation efforts throughout the world.\n  Perhaps no issue is more critical to our national security--and the \nsecurity of all people--than nuclear nonproliferation. I agree strongly \nwith the Senator from Colorado that we must improve our relations with \nPakistan. And I would like for us to be friends with Pakistan. I \nconsider myself a friend of Pakistan. Very few would disagree. The \nquestion is: How? My concern here is that our nuclear nonproliferation \npolicy will made a sacrificial lamb on the alter of better relations \nwith Pakistan.\n  The Pressler amendment has achieved a number of successes in the area \nof nuclear nonproliferation. First, through never verified, Pakistan \nclaims it has ceased developing weapons grade enriched uranium. Second, \nthe threat of Pressler sanctions has deterred a number of states that \npursued active nuclear weapons research programs in the 1980's, \nincluding Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan, and South Africa.\n  Second, despite what's being said, nuclear nonproliferation does not \ndiscriminate against Pakistan.\n  Pakistan is not the only country that is identified by name for \nnonproliferation sanctions. For years a number of other countries have \nbeen designated for special controls and sanctions. China has been \nsingled out for violations of ballistic missile sanctions. Yet, \nironically, Pakistan is the only country to receive waivers of United \nStates nonproliferation laws in order to receive United States aid. One \neight occasions, Congress authorized special waivers of United States \nnonproliferation laws just for Pakistan. The Pressler amendment itself \nwas effectively a waiver to prevent tougher enforcement of U.S. law. \nYes, Congress has engaged in special discrimination, but it was \ndiscrimination in favor of Pakistan, and against all other countries \nthat play by international nonproliferation rules.\n  In addition, Mr. President let me point out that our relationship \nwith India is impacted by United States nonproliferation policy. \nBecause of India's unsafeguarded nuclear program, there is no United \nStates/Indian agreement for nuclear cooperation. United States military \ncooperation with India is merely consultative. The United States will \nnot export certain forms of missile equipment and technology to India \nand any other goods that are related to weapons of mass destruction. It \nis true that United States sanctions have not been invoked against \nIndia, but that is because India has not violated its commitments under \nUnited States law. Mr. President, the bottom line is this: in 1985, the \nGovernment of Pakistan agreed with the United States government that \nfuture United States aid would be tied to its development of a nuclear \nexplosive device. That was Pakistan's contract with America. Pakistan \nunderstood and accepted the potential price if it development the bomb. \nI believe my friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator Glenn, said it \nbest in 1989 when he said: ``There simply must be a cost to \nnoncompliance--when a solemn nuclear pledge is violated, the solution \ndoes not lie in voiding the pledge.''\n  The Brown amendment proposes that very solution. We are being asked \nto void a portion of this contract by allowing nonmilitary aid to \nresume unconditionally.\n  Second, we are being asked to set aside Pakistan's contract with \nAmerica so that the administration can deliver without conditions \nnearly $400 million of United States military equipment previously \npurchased by Pakistan. This package--part of a larger $1.4 billion \norder that included 28 F-16's--includes P-3C Orion antisubmarine \naircraft, Harpoon and Sidewinder missiles, and engines and parts for \nPakistan's existing fleet of Cobras and F-16 aircraft, which are \ncapable of carrying nuclear weapons.\n  Though it supported its 1985 contract with America, the Government of \nPakistan now argues that we should either return the military equipment \nor pay back Pakistan. In short, we are being asked to honor our \nmilitary contract with Pakistan. The reason why the equipment and the \nfunds remain out of Pakistan's hands is because Pakistan was found in \n1990 to have violated its 1985 contract with America. Pakistan knew \nthat if the Pressler contract was violated, its military contract would \nbe put on hold. I recognize that is a tough deal. Again, nuclear \nproliferation has a price.\n  However, I am willing to consider options to compensate Pakistan. In \nfact, I would not oppose using proceeds from a third party sale of any \nof the equipment to reimburse Pakistan. That is a fair approach.\n  To his credit, President Clinton took my suggestion to seek a third \nparty sale of the 28 F-16 aircraft sought by Pakistan. I commend the \nPresident. It was a wise move for one simple reason: F-16's are capable \nof carrying a nuclear payload. It would be contrary to the spirit and \nletter of our Nation's nuclear nonproliferation policy for the United \nStates to waive a nonproliferation law so that Pakistan could take \npossession of nuclear delivery vehicles.\n  That is one of the main reasons why I called for a third party sale \nof the F-16's last May. However, I also stated I would oppose the \nreturn of any military equipment to Pakistan that would serve to \nundermine our nuclear nonproliferation goals, and add to the current \ninstability in the region. That is why I am opposed to the Brown \namendment.\n  The military transfer called for in the Brown amendment is ill-\nadvised for three key reasons:\n  First, it would spark a renewed arms race between Pakistan and India. \nAs my colleagues know, P-3's serve a dual function--they are naval \nreconnaissance aircraft with offensive capabilities. The military aid \npackage also includes torpedoes and missiles that can be launched from \na P-3. The P-3's would give Pakistan greater naval surveillance and \nstriking capabilities than the aircraft Pakistan currently uses, the \nFrench-made Atlantique.\n  In addition, as the Department of Defense admitted, the F-16 \ncomponents in the military package represent a reliability upgrade of \nPakistan's F-16 aircraft, which are capable of carrying nuclear \nweapons. Given our longstanding policy on nuclear nonproliferation, I \ndo not understand why the Clinton administration would seek to improve \nPakistan's nuclear delivery capability with United States-made \nequipment.\n  I recognize that the Senator from Colorado has gone to great lengths \nand made every conceivable effort to reassure his colleagues that this \nmilitary package would not upset the strategic balance between India \nand Pakistan.\n  However, the Indian Government assessed this package on all levels--\npolitical, strategic, and diplomatic. It concluded it would have no \nchoice but to engage in additional military procurement if this \ntransfer goes through. Why should the United States risk a potential \narms race in an already unstable South Asia?\n  Second, the military transfer could inadvertently improve the \nterrorist state of Iran's military capability in the region. According \nto news reports, Iran and Pakistan have been cooperation on nuclear \nweapons research for a decade. Also, Iran and Pakistan have been \nengaged in cooperative military efforts dating back as far as last \nyear, when the two countries conducted joint naval maneuvers in the \nArabian Sea. I was disturbed to learn that a new round of naval \nmaneuvers is scheduled later this fall.\n  Given this sustained Pakistan-Iran cooperation, the P-3's take on \nadded significance. The P-3's surveillance capability would cover the \nentire Arabian Sea and the entire Persian Gulf. The data from this \nextended surveillance--data on the movements of our own Navy in the \nregion--surely would be of critical use to Iran as it seeks to extend \nthe reach of its naval power.\n  Is there anything in the Brown amendment that would require a written \nassurance from Pakistan that the P-3's or any other United States made \nmilitary equipment would not be used to benefit a terrorist country? \nNo.\n  If that is the case, why would we inadvertently enhance Iran's \nmilitary alliance with Pakistan to the detriment of our own naval \nforces, and our friends and allies in the region? It makes no sense.\n  Finally, this transfer sends the worst possible message: nuclear \nproliferation pays.\n  In this case, a country that has gone into nuclear proliferation, \nafter it agreed with us not to, is being rewarded, and we are supposed \nto have sanctions against countries that have \n\n[[Page S 13945]]\nentered into agreements and broken them. So we are rewarding nuclear \nproliferation in this very move.\n  The Clinton administration assured Congress that the United States \nwould oppose any commercial military upgrades for Pakistan. This has \nbeen U.S. policy since 1990. Yet, the proposed transfer would break its \nassurance to Congress in the worst way--by upgrading Pakistan's nuclear \ndelivery vehicles--its F-16's. This upgrade is not just a reversal of \nU.S. arms policy, it undermines the very principles of the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty. It defies logic that the Clinton \nadministration would work so valiantly to ratify this treaty and then \nturn around and support a clear violation of that treaty's core \nprinciples.\n  Despite these very disturbing activities, the administration is \nintent on going ahead with the military transfer--one that does not \nachieve one credible United States policy initiative, while undermining \nthree vital policies--regional stability in South Asia, containment of \nIran, and worldwide nuclear nonproliferation.\n  Do we have alternatives? Yes. Last week, I called on President \nClinton to expand this initiative one step further by pursuing the \nthird party sale option on all the military equipment sought by \nPakistan. And as I said with respect to the F-16's, if the \nadministration and the Congress wish to use the proceeds from the third \nparty sales to reimburse Pakistan, I would not object.\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to discuss the provisions in the \namendment that would repeal nonmilitary sanctions against Pakistan. My \ncolleagues will recall that similar language was offered by my friend \nfrom Colorado during consideration of the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill. These provisions, though seemingly well-intended, \ngo too far.\n  First, this amendment specifically rewrites the Pressler amendment so \nthat the sanctions apply only to military aid. This amounts to an \nunconditional repeal of nonmilitary sanctions against Pakistan. This is \nan extraordinary and far-reaching change that could have serious \nimplications.\n  In fact, this amendment could be used to aid Pakistan's nuclear bomb \nprogram. All of us know that scores of nonmilitary items can serve \nmilitary purposes. Pakistan knows that all to well. Let me provide one \nspecific example: A story in the McGraw-Hill newsletter NuclearFuel, \ndetailed how Pakistan intended to violate a joint venture with Siemens \nAG by using telecommunications equipment as part of a project to \nenhance uranium into bomb grade material. I ask unanimous consent that \nthis story be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Nuclear Fuel, Aug. 28, 1995]\n\n       Siemens Venture Believed Used in Pakistan Centrifuge Quest\n\n                            (By Mark Hibbs)\n\n       Departing from company procurement rules, Pakistan in 1991 \n     used a national telecommunications joint venture with Siemens \n     AG to try to obtain equipment in Germany that export control \n     officials suspect had been sought instead for gas centrifuge \n     rotor assemblies used to enrich uranium.\n       Intelligence sources said that the case is apparently \n     similar to others in which it is believed Pakistan used \n     legitimate businesses to disguise nuclear procurement. \n     Sources said that in the U.S., Pakistan hid nuclear \n     procurement by giving as the end use a bona fide Pakistan-\n     U.S. program to supply equipment to maintain Pakistan's fleet \n     of F-16 aircraft.\n       At issue in the German case are specialized ring magnets \n     that Western officials say Pakistan has repeatedly sought \n     from firms in Germany, Britain, and elsewhere in Europe since \n     the mid-1980s for its clandestine uranium enrichment program.\n       The top magnetic suspension bearing of gas centrifuges \n     built by Pakistan at its Kahuta enrichment plant features a \n     pair of ring magnets. The upper magnet is suspended in a \n     housing containing oil that is resistant to the highly \n     corrosive uranium hexafluoride (UF6) gas fed through \n     centrifuges. The other magnet is fitted to the top end cap of \n     the rotor assembly.\n       According to Western officials, the Pakistan Embassy in \n     Bonn, on behalf of Telephone Industries of Pakistan (PVT) \n     Ltd., in early 1991 sought ring magnets from the firm \n     Magnetfabrik Bonn (MFB) GmbH. But German experts suspected \n     that the technical specifications given for the magnets did \n     not match the non-nuclear end use cited by the Pakistan firm, \n     and MFB blocked the transfer of the magnets after discussing \n     the matter with German export control authorities. The export \n     had initially been approved by Germany.\n       Telephone Industries of Pakistan is a joint venture between \n     Siemens and Pakistan's national post, telephone, and \n     telegraph (PTT) organization, and is located in Haripur, \n     Pakistan. Siemens controls 30.02% of the venture. The \n     government-owned Pakistan PTT owns 69.98%.\n       According to Reiner Schoenrueck, a Siemens spokesman, the \n     Pakistan joint venture makes equipment, including telephones, \n     for digital communications systems. Queried by NuclearFuel, \n     he reported that Telephone Industries is authorized to \n     independently purchase equipment locally in Pakistan. ``But \n     any equipment which Telephone Industries wants in Germany \n     must be obtained through Siemens itself,'' Schoenrueck said, \n     not by the Pakistan government or by officials at the \n     venture's office in Haripur.\n       NuclearFuel has learned that regardless of these \n     procurement guidelines, Telephone Industries of Pakistan \n     recently renewed independent efforts to order magnet parts in \n     Germany. Current attempts are said to involve items having \n     different specifications than magnets ordered on its behalf \n     in 1991. Sources said the Pakistan firm has given non-nuclear \n     engineering end uses, such as motors and power equipment, for \n     items it now seeks.\n       In March 1991, Azmat Ullah, an official at the Pakistani \n     Embassy in Bonn, first made contact with MFB on behalf of \n     Telephone Industries of Pakistan to obtain so-called \n     aluminum-nickel-cobalt (Alnico)-260 S-ring magnets. Officials \n     said that, after Pakistan provided a non-critical end use for \n     the magnets, an export permit was awarded by Germany.\n       However, sources said that in late 1991, after the permit \n     was awarded but before the magnets were exported, the \n     manufacturer became aware of the potential use of ring \n     magnets containing cobalt in gas ultracentrifuges. The \n     company then contacted the Federal Economics Office, now the \n     Federal Export Control Office (BAFA) in\n      Eschborn, responsible for export controls, and the export \n     authorization to Pakistan was rescinded.\n       Section 0201/2.D of Germany's commodity control list, valid \n     in 1991 when the export was approved, required express \n     authorization for complete magnet assemblies only: ``Liquid-\n     damped magnetic bearings, made of ring magnets, which are \n     mounted in a housing containing a damping medium. The magnet \n     is mounted on a rotor end cap pole piece or coupled to a \n     second magnet.'' According to a spokesman at BAFA, the export \n     to Pakistan of magnets not conforming precisely to these \n     specifications would have been approved provided no \n     ``knowledge'' was available that the equipment would be used \n     in weapons of mass-destruction or that the peaceful end use \n     was ``implausible.''\n       Western officials said the parts MFB was to make for \n     Pakistan did not fall within 0201/2.D so the export was \n     initially approved. Officials said, however, that the German \n     firm later doubted the peaceful end use given by Pakistan \n     after Pakistan specified that the magnets must feature \n     unusually fine machining tolerances and a capability to \n     withstand exceedingly high rotating speeds.\n       Pakistan had first indicated that Telephone Industries \n     sought magnets sized at 52 millimeters in diameter and 8 mm \n     in height, with a ring thickness of 36 mm. It later specified \n     a precise diameter of 52.8 mm and a thickness of 36.8 mm and \n     defined fine tolerance requirements in the range of a few \n     hundredths of millimeters.\n       Azmat Ullah, the Pakistan government employee who sought \n     the ring magnets for Telephone Industries of Pakistan, was \n     listed in the official German register of foreign diplomats \n     for 1991 and 1992 as an attache in the commercial section of \n     the Pakistan Embassy. He left Germany in 1993. According to \n     diplomatic sources, the Pakistani attache had been involved \n     in previous attempts to obtain material in Germany for \n     Pakistan's centrifuge program before he sought the ring \n     magnets. Sources said that in 1985, for example, Ullah had \n     been responsible at the embassy for ordering centrifuge-grade \n     maraging steel produced by Arbed Saarstahl, a German \n     specialty steel producer. The steel is believed to have been \n     intended for making centrifuge rotor tubes for Kahuta.\n       In early 1992, after the planned magnet export to Pakistan \n     was stopped, MFB alerted other German magnet-producing firms, \n     including subsidiaries of Krupp AG and Thyssen AG, about the \n     intended transaction. In addition to stopping the export from \n     MFB to Pakistan by withdrawing the permit, BAFA also blocked \n     transfer of the ring magnets to Pakistan from all other \n     German firms.\n\n\n                   no critical magnet deal with iran\n\n       Contrary to previous non-official reports asserting that \n     German firms contributed recently to an Iranian program to \n     develop gas centrifuges, MFB, which was solicited without \n     success by Pakistan to obtain ring magnets, never supplied \n     any critical magnets or magnetic equipment to Iran, company \n     officials said.\n       According to customs intelligence documents obtained by \n     NuclearFuel, the Sharif University of Technology in\n      Tehran has tried to obtain nuclear-related equipment from \n     firms in Germany and elsewhere in Europe, including \n     equipment meant to be used for a \n\n[[Page S 13946]]\n     centrifuge development program (NF, 28 March '93, 10). On the basis of \n     this information, BAFA will not award export permits for \n     any equipment destined for end use at Sharif University. \n     But the Zollkriminalamt (ZKA), Germany's customs \n     investigative agency, denies that any German firms have \n     exported equipment to Iran's nuclear program over the last \n     10 years (NF, 10 April '94, 5).\n       Herbert Krosney, author of the book ``Deadly Business,'' \n     claimed that Sharif University approached MFB for Alnico \n     centrifuge magnets and that the German firm ``received a \n     substantive order from Iran.''\n       MFB said this month that the statement is false. It \n     asserted that the company never agreed to transact any Alnico \n     centrifuge magnet business with Iran and that MFB was never \n     contacted by Sharif University for any business. Since 1993, \n     MFB has sold some ferritic magnets to Iran. They were not, \n     BAFA ruled, useful for uranium enrichment.\n       In the wake of information it obtained alleging that MFB \n     had been involved in violations of export rules, Western \n     intelligence sources said, the Oberfinanzdirektlon in \n     Cologne, a customs investigation arm of the Federal Ministry \n     of Finance, searched the MFB premises in 1990, one year \n     before Pakistan attempted to obtain ring magnets from the \n     Bonn company.\n       According to a statement that company management provided \n     to employees, however, no violations were found and the \n     firm's conduct was judged ``exemplary.''\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, this is just one example. The fact is \nPakistan built its current bomb program in part from seemingly \nnonmilitary transactions. Further, in February 1993, then-CIA Director \nJames Woolsey described for the Senate Committee on Governmental \nAffairs how untied and seemingly nonmilitary loans and grants could \nfurther Pakistan's nuclear program.\n  Does the Brown amendment require Pakistan to make written and \nverifiable assurances that seemingly nonmilitary aid will not aid \ndirectly or indirectly its bomb program? No.\n  Again, Mr. President, we cannot escape history. We once before \ninadvertently aided Pakistan's bomb program. Now, with this open-ended, \nunconditional repeal of a portion of the Pressler amendment, we are \nsetting ourselves up to make the same mistake yet again. Why would we \nonce again put American taxpayers in the position of aiding Pakistan's \nbomb program?\n  Further, let me correct for the record a serious misperception of the \nPressler amendment. Some have argued that we need this amendment so \nthat we can provide vital civic and humanitarian assistance to \nPakistan. We already can provide that assistance. Current law permits \nUnited States aid to Pakistan through nongovernmental organizations in \na wide range of areas, including agriculture and rural development, \nnutrition, human rights, endangered species, and illicit narcotics \nprevention. Pakistan also continues to receive annually hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in development assistance via multilateral lending \nagencies to which the United States is a major contributor. The Brown \namendment goes beyond even a limited approach, and again would do so \nwithout requiring a single nuclear concession from Pakistan.\n  Mr. President, I strongly respect and admire my friend from Colorado. \nHe sincerely is interested in trying to find ways to improve our \nrelations with Pakistan and improve the conditions for the entire \nIndian subcontinent. I commend him for proposing a U.S.-led \nmultilateral summit designed to reduce the presence of nuclear weapons \nin South Asia. I would support such a summit. It represents a more \nconstructive first-step toward what I hope is the elimination of the \nnuclear threat from South Asia.\n  But, in this case, we are not moving toward nonproliferation with \nthis particular amendment. We cannot escape history, and I have \noutlines that history of the Pressler amendment, of which there is much \nmisunderstanding.\n  Beyond that, my friend from Colorado and I disagree on how best to \napproach the vexing problems in South Asia. We also need to keep in \nmind the question of United States--India relations. For more than 40 \nyears, our relations with the world's most populous democracy were \ndifficult, dictated largely by cold war conventional wisdom. Since \n1991, our relations have improved markedly. India's economy is \nundergoing a remarkable transformation, fueled by a nearly five-fold \nincrease in foreign investments from 1990 to 1994. More than one-third \nof those investments were from American firms. It is my hope that \nPakistan can enjoy similar progress in the near future. Economic growth \nfor both countries is the key to long-term regional stability.\n  One of the lessons of our improved relationship with India is that \nour actions have a clear impact on Indian public opinion. That \ncertainly is the case in Pakistan as well. Given this impact, I believe \nthat we must pursue our policies in South Asia with great care and \ngreat caution. We must ensure that we do not unnecessarily return to \nthe previous, unproductive levels of our relationship. We also must \nensure that we do not unnecessarily fuel the already strong tensions \nthat exist in the region.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I must repeat yet again, we cannot \nescape history--both the history behind us and before us. The history \nwe make today not only will determine the history of tomorrow, but will \ndetermine how well we comprehended the hard lessons of history. The \nBrown amendment is a grim reminder to all of us that those who try to \nescape history are condemned to relive it. I cannot allow that to \nhappen. We must not ask the American taxpayer to subsidize a bomb \nprogram we cannot condone. Nor do we need ask the American taxpayer to \nsubsidize an arms race in South Asia, or the military ambitions of a \nterrorist state.\n  Last year, the President states that no single foreign policy issue \nwas more important than nuclear nonproliferation. If that is the case, \nthere is no justifiable reason why Pakistan once again must be exempt \nfrom Federal nonproliferation laws or the nonproliferation policies we \nimpose on all other signatories of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.\n  Let us give Pakistan some concrete incentives to honor its word.\n  Let us not reward proliferation.\n  Since we cannot escape history, let us learn constructively from it.\n  I urge the defeat of the Brown amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                 Action on Amendment No. 2721 Vitiated\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the \naction on amendment No. 2721. It is my understanding this has been \ncleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment no. 2708\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. Brown. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from South Dakota \nhas raised a number of important points. I will not try to deal with \nall of them right now, but I do think it is important to respond.\n  First, let me commend the Senator for his leadership in this area. \nWhile we disagree on the particular resolutions of these contract items \nthat have been in dispute for a number of years, I think his efforts \ntoward nonproliferation and his sincerity and hard work in the area are \nto be commended and reflect great credit on the American psyche in \ndealing with foreign policy.\n  Mr. President, there are a couple of things that I think are \nimportant to look at, though, that I hope Members will consider.\n  First of all, statements were made that the amendment is \nunconditioned and open-ended repeal. Mr. President, I think he was \nreferring to parts of it. But I sincerely believe that is not a fair \ndescription of what is anticipated here.\n  First of all, let me emphasize what the amendment does not do. It \ndoes not, in any way, repeal the restriction on military aid or \nmilitary sales to Pakistan. There are a couple of areas that are \nclarified, though, and let me be specific about that. The bars and \nrestrictions on aid and sales stay in place. We do a couple of things \nhere. One, we make it clear that parts that had been sent--military \nparts--to the United States for repair and had never been repaired were \nbe shipped back to them. These are used parts that were not \nfunctioning. I suppose we can insist on keeping those used parts here, \nbut it seemed like that should be sent back. I do not think that is an \nopen-ended repeal. That is a disposition of parts that \n\n[[Page S 13947]]\nhave been around for a long time and they are sent back unrepaired.\n  Second, we deal with contracts that are 8 and 9 years old that have \nbeen paid for. We allow three-fourths of them--or almost three-fourths \nof them--to have their money back and not get delivery of the planes. \nThose are the things that all of the people in the area have looked at \nand say are the most inflammatory--that is, the F-16. We allow delivery \nof $368 million of military equipment. Those are on contracts that were \nexecuted before the 1990 action under the Pressler amendment.\n  Mr. President, what this issue is all about is simply and solely \nsaying you are either going to get your money back, or you are going to \nget the parts back, or you are going to get the things you contracted \nfor. It is simple fairness. We signed a contract to sell military \nequipment. We have not delivered on it. We have taken their money, and \nwe have refused both to give them their money back and/or deliver on \nour contract.\n  All we are trying to do with this is make it clear that we ought to \neither give them their money back or give them what they contracted \nfor. The compromise, I suppose, somebody could criticize. This was \nworked out by the President. I do not think the President or the \nadministration claims it is perfect, nor do I.\n  Mr. President, I do know that the planes amount to almost three-\nfourths of the entire package. The planes are the things that almost \nevery critic I know of says is the most inflammatory and significant \npart of the package, and the planes are not delivered. The other parts \nof the package--and we already quoted from experts that indicate that \nthese are not significant in terms of the military balance of the area. \nWe have already pointed out that India enjoys a two-to-one advantage.\n  Mr. President, there is another item that I think ought to be at \nleast quoted at this point. The suggestion was that we are already in \nthe process of delivering aid to Pakistan and that it is not necessary \nto have this amendment. The suggestion was that NGO's are authorized \nunder aid to Pakistan. Indeed, we have NGO's allowed to conduct \nactivity in Pakistan right now. It is on temporary authority, and that \nauthority is on a 1-year waiver and that waiver is not renewed and it \nruns out. So as far as NGO's being able to operate in the country and \ndeliver aid, which they have talked about, the point is that the facts \nare exactly the opposite of what was said on the floor. The NGO's are \nnot going to be able to do that. We need this legislation to be able to \ninvolve ourselves with Pakistan, and this is to our benefit. I have yet \nto hear anyone say that cooperating with the Pakistanis in the \nsuppression of the narcotics trade is not to our benefit. It clearly is \nin our benefit. Cooperating with the Pakistanis in this is in our \nbenefit. So both of those points do not hit the mark.\n  Let me put a few things in the Record, and I will try and do it \nbriefly. I want to quote the Assistant Secretary of State, who \nresponded to the committee's questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield myself 5 additional minutes.\n  This is what our Assistant Secretary of State said when asked about \nthe Pakistan question, and particularly why we have been involved in \nassistance to Pakistan. That was certainly raised by the Senator. I \nwill have more to say about this later. But I want to quote the \nAssistant Secretary of State on that question of why we aided Pakistan:\n\n       Pakistan undertook substantial risks as our partner in an \n     effort to stand up to the Soviet aggression in Afghanistan \n     during the 1980's. Intrusions into Pakistan airspace by \n     Soviet war planes were common. On several occasions, Soviet \n     military aircraft actually bombed Pakistani facilities along \n     the border in retaliation for Pakistan's assistance to the \n     mujaheddin. I might say it was assistance to us in helping to \n     liberate Afghanistan.\n\n  She continues:\n\n       Pakistan was also a target of Scud missiles. During the \n     period, the Soviets also initiated numerous covert actions \n     against the government of Pakistan, including actions aimed \n     at destroying caches of munitions and arms in Pakistan.\n\n  Mr. President, this is what Pakistan put on the line. They risked \ntheir very existence, they risked military attacks from one of the \nstrongest military powers in the world, the Soviet Union. They did it \nat our request.\n  She continues:\n\n       During the Soviet occupation, 5 million Afghan refugees \n     flooded into Pakistan. With the help of the international \n     community, Pakistan provided food and shelter for the \n     refugees. Many remain in Pakistan because of the unsafe \n     conditions in Afghanistan.\n\n  To suggest that our aid had nothing to do with the 5 million refugees \nthat came in, I believe, ignores the facts.\n  She continues:\n\n       Finally, there were widespread fears that the Soviet Union \n     did not intend to stop its expansion into the Afghan border \n     with Pakistan. Many in Pakistan believe that an accommodation \n     with the Soviets was called for and the government was under \n     pressure to follow such a course.\n\n  Mr. President, imagine what would happen if the Government of \nPakistan--which has been so maligned in the discussions on this issue \nin this Chamber--would have acceded to people in their country to make \nan accommodation with the Soviet Union. It is not just the Afghans that \nwould not have an opportunity for freedom today, it is a great many \nmore people in the world.\n  Mr. President, she concluded her response to that question by this \nstatement:\n\n       The primary purpose of U.S. military and economic \n     assistance to Pakistan during this period was to help \n     Pakistan manage these risks and burdens.\n\n  Mr. President, the suggestion that the reason Pakistan got military \naid and assistance during this period was solely to stop the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons I do not believe is accurate. It \ncertainly does not square with this. I do think it is accurate, as \nMembers pointed out, that that was an interest of the United States at \nthe time, that it was hoped that would be a reaction of the Pakistanis. \nBut to say that is the reason for their aid, I do not think that \nsquares with the history and with the statement of the Assistant \nSecretary of State.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. \nExon] is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from Ohio. Were it not for the fact that \nI have made a commitment to go to an affair elsewhere in the Capital \nCity, I would stay and become involved in this debate. I am going to be \nvery brief because others here will go into the matter in more detail.\n  I simply say, Mr. President, that while a case can be made that we \nneed improved relations with Pakistan, from the information that I \nhave, the proliferation arrangement and laws of the United States of \nAmerica have been violated by arrangement, among others, of shipments \nof materiel from China to Pakistan. I simply say that while we can make \nexcuses, and while we can say that we need the cooperation of Pakistan \nwith regard to drugs and terrorism, which I agree with, the fact of the \nmatter is that the laws of the United States have been violated.\n  An official of the Clinton administration called me and asked me to \nsupport the Brown amendment. I asked that individual was it not true \nthat the laws had been violated, but the administration, working with \nthe majority in the U.S. Senate, are simply going to wink at that and \nsay, it is OK.\n It is OK. We are going to make this exception to make them happy.\n\n  It seems to me we are setting a precedent here. I do not believe my \nvoice or the voice of others is going to change the vote, but as well \nintentioned as the amendment offered by the Senator from Colorado is, \nit is a mistake. It is a mistake entered into by the Clinton \nadministration. They are wrong, in my opinion. I state that as clearly \nas I can.\n  What they are doing in this particular case, Mr. President, is simply \nto offer an alibi to try to soothe the Government of Pakistan.\n  If our laws with regard to proliferation are going to mean anything, \nthen we have to recognize that both Pakistan and China should be \nsubject to the laws that we enacted in the Congress of the United \nStates and cannot be winked at.\n  I object to the fact that the Clinton administration is winking, \ngoing back \n\n[[Page S 13948]]\non the laws that we have in our land. I think that is a mistake, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I suspect that the Senate is going to make a mistake because I do not \nthink 5 hours of debate after most people have gone home is going to \nchange any minds.\n  I simply back the position of Senator Glenn and Senator Levin, both \nassociates of mine from long standing on the Armed Services Committee. \nI hope that the Senate will come to its senses and do an about face on \nthe earlier vote that we had in the Senate on this matter today.\n  I thank my friend from Ohio. I thank my friend from Michigan. I thank \nmy friend, Senator Feinstein, from California, who I understand is \ngoing to speak on this. I thank my friend, Larry Pressler of South \nDakota, who was author, I believe, of the law that we have in place.\n  I simply say, Mr. President, this is a mistake. I hope the U.S. \nSenate will reverse course, recognize it is a mistake, notwithstanding \nthe pressure that has been brought to bear by the Clinton \nadministration to not change the vote.\n  Mr. BROWN. Will my good friend from Nebraska yield for a question?\n  Mr. EXON. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BROWN. I know the Senator has had a number of people talk to him, \nand I did not know if the Senator was aware of subsection 8 where we \nspecifically state, ``Nothing contained herein shall affect sanctions \nfor the transfers of missile equipment or technology required under \nsection 11(B), the Export Administration Act of 1979, or section 73 of \nthe Arms Control Act.''\n  In effect, Mr. President, what we do is specifically make it clear \nthat the ballistic missile sanctions are in no way affected by this.\n  Mr. EXON. I say to my friend from Colorado that I think if we get \ninto those kinds of details, we may cloud the central purpose. The \ncentral purpose of my opposition to this, notwithstanding the strong \nfeeling about my friend and associate from the neighboring State of \nColorado, is that we are violating both the intent and the principles \nof the law that we have in effect with regard to proliferation. \nTherefore, this Senator feels it is a mistake.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I know we want to hear from other speakers, but I did \nwant to respond to a very important point that I think the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Nebraska made.\n  He is concerned about the potential impact of missile sanctions. Mr. \nPresident, I am concerned about that as well.\n  We have added to this amendment exact and specific language that \nmakes it very clear that nothing in this amendment in any way \ninterferes with the sanctions, should they ever take place.\n  Members should rest assured that I am very conscious of that, and we \nhave provided specific legislative language to make it quite clear that \nthis in no way waives any sanctions with regard to violations of \nmissile agreements for U.S. legislation.\n  That point has been raised. The fact is, at least in my view, it is \ninvalid because we specifically made it clear that this in no way \ninterferes with that. Indeed, if they have violated it, they will be \nsanctioned, and they should be sanctioned.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na statement from our Secretary of State.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Address by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, on U.S. National \n                  Interest in the Asia-Pacific Region\n\n       Question: Will the Clinton Administration order additional \n     sanctions against China for supplying missile technology to \n     Pakistan and Iran?\n       Secretary Christopher: As I mentioned in my remarks, we are \n     concerned about proliferation issues, and we are certainly \n     concerned about it as they relate to South Asia. We monitor \n     it very carefully and very closely.\n       At the present time, although there is a fairly large body \n     of evidence, we do not think there is the evidence there that \n     would justify the imposition of sanctions. But I want to \n     assure all that we feel an obligation to keep this matter \n     carefully under review and to follow and comply with the law \n     in this regard.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. The question was asked, will the Clinton administration \norder additional sanctions against China for supplying missile \ntechnology to Pakistan or Iran?\n  Secretary Christopher said, ``As I mentioned in my remarks, we are \nconcerned about proliferation issues, and we are certainly concerned \nabout it as they relate to South Asia. We monitor it very carefully and \nclosely.''\n  Here is what he says: ``At the present time, although there is a \nfairly large body of evidence, we do not think there is evidence there \nthat would justify the imposition of sanctions.''\n  Mr. President, the point is this: The sanctions are for any violation \nof a missile treaty or missile technology restrictions in U.S. laws. In \nno way does this amendment interfere with those sanctions whatever. As \na matter of fact, the review of the administration in this area has \nbeen clear and significant and, if sanctions are justified, they will \ntake place.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank the \nSenator from Ohio.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Colorado. As the ranking member of the Near \nEastern and South Asian Affairs Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I have worked closely with Senator Brown, the chairman of \nthis subcommittee, to try to work toward a more productive United \nStates policy in South Asia.\n  I respect him and I respect what he is trying to do. However, while \nthere are some issues on which we are in agreement, there are many on \nwhich we differ.\n  Let me first say that I echo the statement of the Senator from \nNebraska by saying that I believe the administration is wrong.\n  I have heard two major reasons put forward as to why we should put \nthis $368 million of military equipment in Pakistan's hands now. The \nfirst is, they paid for it, it is the honorable thing to do.\n  I agree. I will introduce an amendment which will carry with it Sense \nof Congress language which will say that the President is asked to try \nto sell the F-16's and return as much of the equity payment made by \nPakistan back to Pakistan as possible. I believe that is the honorable \nthing to do.\n  The second thing I have heard is that we have to buttress the Bhutto \nregime. This is what gives me the deepest trouble.\n  If there is anybody that believes that one stabilizes or buttresses a \nregime which suffers from instability, in an area where there is a \ntinderbox of hostilities between two countries, and where both \ncountries have the ability in a matter of days to have a nuclear \ncapacity utilized--I think that is the wrong idea. I could not go to \nsleep at night knowing this equipment went, and that I voted for it, at \nabsolutely the wrong time. I will explain in my remarks why I believe \nit is the wrong time.\n  Sanctions were invoked against Pakistan in 1990 because President \nBush could not certify that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear \nexplosive device.\n  Nothing has changed since that time. To this day, neither President \nBush nor President Clinton has been able to make that certification. \nAnd today President Clinton cannot make that certification.\n  So, despite its remonstrances to the contrary, Pakistan to this day \ncontinues to develop its nuclear weapons program and has technology \nimported from abroad. And I believe even today Pakistan is engaged in \ndeveloping an indigenous capability to produce nuclear weapons--not to \nhave to get the technology from abroad, but to do it right at home.\n  As late as a couple of months ago, the Prime Minister of Pakistan \ndenied that. That is a problem for me. That is a problem for me, to \nvote for something which I know will be used for one purpose and one \npurpose only, and that is probably to attack a neighbor, when I am told \nan untruth. As Senator Glenn, I believe, will outline, these same \nstatements have been made year after year for the past decade.\n  So, under these circumstances, I believe it is wholly inappropriate \nfor the United States to release to Pakistan \n\n[[Page S 13949]]\nthis military equipment. For us to take this step, Pakistan should make \nvast improvements in the area of nonproliferation.\n  I believe that Pakistan has acquired M-11 missiles in violation of \nthe MTCR. Pakistan is subject to MTCR sanctions. We have alleged that \nChina sold these missiles to Pakistan. China is not a signatory to the \nMTCR. Recently, as a product of negotiations with our State Department, \nChina has agreed to abide by the MTCR. But Pakistan knows better. They \nare subject to MTCR rules, and every M-11 has inherent nuclear \ncapability. Let there be no doubt about that. So, if one looks at both \nIndia and Pakistan, to add weapons at this time is a big mistake.\n  Let me tell you what the Indian Ambassador has told me. What he has \ntold me is that he believes that the 28 Harpoon missiles which are part \nof this package, would give Pakistan a standoff capability to which \nIndia has no immediate response.\n  What does this mean? If we do this now, India is a few months before \nan election. It simply fuels the fires within the Indian political \nstructure and perhaps prompts them to deploy a missile known as the \nPrithvi, which they have, in response to this. That is a scenario that \nI find inescapable in the transfer of these weapons.\n  We can cloak this in any terms we want. But if we know and honestly \nbelieve that this might be the result of the delivery of these weapons, \nwhy are we doing it? How can we sleep and do it? The P-3C aircraft can \nlaunch a Harpoon. The Harpoon also has a surface-to-surface capability. \nThe Indians believe the P-3C can carry the Harpoon from Karachi to Sri \nLanka, so it has the distance.\n  There are certain aspects of the Brown amendment that I support. I \ncertainly share the view that it is desirable for there to be an \nimprovement in the United States-Pakistani relationship. Pakistan is \nstrategically located, has a significant population, it is a good \nfriend in the Moslem world, it is an emerging democracy in a part of \nthe world where we would like to see more democracy.\n  As has been said, Pakistan has cooperated with the United States in a \nvariety of ways. It is the second largest contributor of troops to U.N. \npeacekeeping operations. I think that is a big deal. Pakistan has been \nprepared to put its troops on the line to keep peace in the world, and \nI, for one, appreciate that.\n  It has assisted in our antinarcotics efforts, and it has been helpful \nto U.S. antiterrorism efforts. And it is helpful right now in a very \nterrible and tragic situation in Kashmir, where one American is still \nbeing held hostage.\n  There is certainly room for more cooperation and the kinds of \nnonmilitary assistance which would be allowed to resume under this \nproposal--antiterrorism assistance, antinarcotics assistance, \nimmigration control training, environmental and population assistance, \ncivil aviation cooperation--would not only build even greater \ncooperation, but they would directly benefit the effort and interests \nof the United States in a range of areas.\n  Part of the amendment I will offer will do just that: Take the \nnonmilitary part of Senator Brown's amendment and allow it to go ahead. \nIt is my understanding that these types of assistance were never \nenvisioned to be cut off at the time that the Pressler amendment was \nadopted, so I see no harm and much good that could come by restoring \nthese types of assistance programs to Pakistan.\n  I was pleased to cosponsor an amendment with the Senator from \nColorado in the Foreign Relations Committee to allow this assistance. \nHowever, I think we need to tread much more carefully when it comes to \nmilitary assistance. Returning Pakistan's broken spare parts is, I \nthink, a reasonable gesture of good will--no problem with that. \nAllowing Pakistan to resume its participation in the IMET military \ntraining course will help rebuild the ties between the United States \nand the Pakistani military, which is important for strategic \ncooperation. But allowing the transfer of the package of equipment \nallowed by this amendment is another story.\n  The Pressler amendment sanctions took effect because our Government \nin effect knew that Pakistan was not abiding by earlier agreements made \nwith our Government, and commitments made to United States Senators on \nthis floor at that time, in the 1980's. They asked for aid contingent \non them not pursuing nuclear weapons, and then they turned around and \ndid just what they said they would not do.\n  Pakistan needs to make progress reversing that problem, and I believe \nwe would send a dubious message by renewing our supply line to the \nPakistani military. As I mentioned, the package transferred under this \nproposal would include P-3C surveillance aircraft, capable of providing \nsubmarine deterrence, which is a major concern to India; the Harpoon \nmissiles; the TOW missile launchers; the spare parts for F-16's; and \nother sophisticated equipment.\n  It is not a significant enough package to substantially alter the \nmilitary balance in South Asia, but it is a change in the military \nbalance of South Asia. Do we want to change the military balance of \nSouth Asia shortly before a hotly contested election in India, when we \nknow major candidates running in that race will be forced to respond? \nThey will be forced to respond, and one of the things that has been a \ngoal of American foreign policy is to prevent the deployment of the \nPrithvi missile. Instead, we are providing the excuse for the \ndeployment of the Prithvi missile, and therefore further escalating and \nheightening tensions between the two countries.\n  And there is major tension. There is no subject as sensitive, as \ndifficult, on which the sides are more implacable than the Kashmir \nproblem. You have seen the worst results of that tension in terms of \nthe taking of the hostages, the cutting off of the head of one of them, \nand the rolling of the head down the street. If that does not \ndemonstrate what feelings are, I do not know what will.\n  So, I know the Clinton administration does not want to prop up \nunstable regimes, does not want to put equipment in the middle of a \ntinderbox, but that is exactly what this does, and there is no way to \nsay it does not. It does.\n  Anyone who has had the security briefing I think better understands \nthe problem.\n  So I cannot support a resumption of these arms transfers. The \ngreatest threat of nuclear war on the planet today, I believe, rests in \nSouth Asia and rests between India and Pakistan. India has contributed \nto this tension just as much as Pakistan has. But it is there. It is \nreal. It is palpable and it is fueled by a dramatic ongoing debate \nwhich one country views as a major assault on its territorial \nsovereignty. What else does one need as a precipitant to a \nconflagration?\n  So I urge my colleagues to look carefully at this resolution, to look \ncarefully at the list of equipment, at the rockets, at the missiles, at \nthe parts that are being sent in this $368 million transfer. I hope \nthat the Brown amendment might be defeated and that we would have an \nopportunity to put forward an amendment which would carry forth the \neconomic and the humanitarian, the antinarcotics and antiterrorism \nportions of Senator Brown's very well-meaning amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield my time.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, first of all, I want to say what a great \npleasure it has been to work with the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia. She is bright and thoughtful and she has been very \nenergetic in applying herself to not only the committee work but this \nparticular problem. I have found her to be very thorough and very \nsincere in the kind of approach she has taken, I might say also very \nconstructive. And I appreciate the fact that she will offer an \nalternative to Members of the Senate to review that will give them some \nchoices on this issue.\n  I must say as a Member I have found it a bit difficult to discuss the \nissue in trying to develop legislation, which I think is our job as \nlegislators, with some Members who simply want to preclude the issue \nfrom being reviewed or discussed or legislated on and view the right \nway to do it is with a filibuster. I believe reasonable men and women \ncan come to a reasonable solution that \n\n[[Page S 13950]]\nis best for our country, and so I welcome her initiatives and I commend \nher on a very thoughtful approach to it.\n  Mr. President, I might say my approach all along has been to say, \nlook, what is central here is for the United States to be true to \nitself. It is not in character for us to take someone's money for a \ncontract and then refuse to return their money or refuse to deliver on \nthat contract. What we need to do is either give them their money back \nor give them their equipment that they contracted for but not keep \nboth. That I think is simple basic fairness that most Americans would \nagree with. I believe the Senator from California shares that view. She \ndoes have a different view than I in terms of the package, limited \npackage of military equipment that my amendment would deliver.\n  Mr. President, I will simply add one other comment at this point. It \nis something of a technical background for Members. I note the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio is here and he has been a leader in the \nSenate, and in the world I might say, in terms of nonproliferation.\n  The MTCR, the Missile Technology Control Regime, has 25 countries--at \nleast that is the latest CRS report--that indicate they are not so much \nsigners but partners, in the parlance of the CRS, and these partners in \naddition have contacted other countries that do include China, that \nhave agreed to abide by their guidelines. Pakistan is not a partner in \nMTCR, and they are not listed by the CRS among the countries that have \nagreed to observe it.\n  I believe the MTCR is a very important item here for Members to \nconsider. We have statutes that are designed to control this \ntechnology. The suggestion has been made by some Members, for whom I \nhave a great deal of respect, there may have been a violation of this \nstatute with regard to China and Pakistan. If that is true, there will \nbe severe sanctions. It is very important to know that the amendment \nwhich is before the Senate in no way waives those sanctions. As a \nmatter of fact, it has a separate specific section that makes it \ncrystal clear that nothing in this legislation waives those sanctions.\n  So should you be concerned about MTCR? Absolutely. But does this \namendment in any way interfere with MTCR? Absolutely not. In fact, it \ndoes the opposite. It makes it crystal clear if there are sanctions \nthere they have the responsibility to go ahead with them as provided by \nour law.\n  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend from Ohio. And \nalso let me commend the Senator from Ohio for the decades of work he \nhas put in in the fight against the proliferation both of nuclear \nweapons, weapons of mass destruction, and means of delivery of those \nweapons. It is the missiles particularly which we are talking about \ntoday, but there are also weapons themselves which are involved in this \ndebate, and nobody has worked harder than the Senator from Ohio to try \nto address the proliferation concerns which are the emerging threats to \nthis world. The cold war may be over, but the world is a more dangerous \nplace in many ways now than it was before. The reason it is more \ndangerous in many ways is because of the threat of nuclear weapons, \nweapons of mass destruction and means of their delivery, the \nproliferation threat which we face.\n  The issue is whether we are going to be serious about them. That is \nreally what the Senate is going to decide tomorrow, whether or not we \nare going to be serious about a proliferation issue which is so clear \nthat I would urge our colleagues to go up to the fourth floor, as about \n10 of us have, and review the materials. They are there. The charts are \nthere. They will be there in the morning. Some of us have had this \nbriefing now three times. We can hide our head in the sand and we can \nsay, well, gee, maybe there is not a violation of the Missile \nTechnology Control Regime, which is supposed to be enforced by our \nexport control laws, but I think it is pretty difficult to do that \nafter the briefings that we have received.\n  Now, that is my conclusion. Maybe others can reach different \nconclusions. It is difficult for me to see how any of us can reach a \ndifferent conclusion, but it is more difficult for me to see how we \nwould not at least go up to the fourth floor and expose ourselves to \nthose materials which are there very clearly for each Member of this \nSenate to see and consider.\n  If there is no more serious issue than proliferation--and I do not \nknow of too many issues that are more serious--surely it is worth a \nvisit to the fourth floor to review the intelligence reports on the \nquestion of whether or not China has delivered, transferred to Pakistan \nmissiles or missile components which exceed the limits which are \nprovided for in the Missile Technology Control Regime.\n  Now, our good friend from Colorado has given a bunch of reasons that \nwe should proceed with the sale of this equipment to Pakistan. Pakistan \nis an ally; that is true. Pakistan has supported common goals in \nAfghanistan; that is true. Of course, it was in their own self-interest \nto pursue those goals, but nonetheless they were common goals and she \npursued them. Pakistan, indeed, supports multinational peace \nenforcement. So do we.\n  I hope it is in her self-interest to do that. But the fact that we \nhave a common interest in that is given as a reason for why we should \nproceed with the sale of this nature.\n  I think the other point that the Senator from Colorado makes, which \nis one I share, which is that it is not in our character to take folks' \nmoney and then not deliver the product, I must say in this regard I \nthink that the Senator from Colorado is correct, that if equity \nrequires that we not allow that money to be kept at the same time that \nthe delivery has not been made, then true to ourselves, whatever \nportion of that money equity requires be returned to Pakistan should be \nreturned to Pakistan.\n  But that is not the issue here tonight either. The Senator from \nCalifornia is going to be introducing an amendment tomorrow which will \ntake us down that path which is the path of being true to ourselves and \nour laws on exports at the same time living up to a moral obligation to \nbe true to ourselves to not take money from folks and not deliver the \nproduct.\n  Now, I believe that the Senator from California's amendment tomorrow \nis going to be worded in such a way that whatever funds equity requires \nbe returned to Pakistan, or words to that effect, should be returned to \nPakistan. And I would be supporting that amendment because that is the \nway we can be true to ourselves in all regard.\n  We can make sure that we enforce our laws against proliferation at \nthe same time we do not take money which does not belong to us and keep \nmoney which does not belong to us. But we can do both.\n  The issue in this amendment tonight that we are debating, the Brown \namendment, is whether or not we are going to ignore our law relative to \nthe proliferation of missiles by authorizing the shipment of military \nequipment which, if Pakistan received missiles that exceed the limits \nin the missile technology control regime, could not be properly sent to \nPakistan.\n  Now, our law is clear. It is the Arms Export Control Act. The law \nsays that sanctions will be applied to those who export, transfer or \ntrade in certain areas. And then they refer to the missile technology \ncontrol regime annex. And that missile technology control regime is \nvery specific, that if missiles or components of technology have a \nrange of more than 300 kilometers and a payload of more than 500 \nkilograms, then that is violative of the missile technology control \nregime and then people who export, transfer or trade that type of \nmissile or components for those missiles or technologies for those \nmissiles will be subject the sanctions. It does not say ``may be \nsubject to sanctions,'' by the way. It says the President ``shall \nimpose sanctions'' in that event.\n  Now, that leaves it up to each of us to reach our own conclusion as \nto whether or not missiles have been transferred to Pakistan which \nexceed those limits. If so, our law does not permit the transfer of the \nequipment which would be allowed under the Brown amendment. Our law \njust simply does not permit that. \n\n[[Page S 13951]]\n\n  Now, maybe individuals can conclude that the evidence is not clear on \nthis issue, that Pakistan has received missiles of this range and \npayload. And if an individual, a Member of the Senate, can go up to the \nfourth floor and reach that conclusion, it seems to me they could then \nsupport the Brown amendment. But I would urge Members to do that. I \nhave done that now twice. I have had a third briefing on top of that. I \ncannot in good conscience reach any conclusion such as that, or come \nclose to it. It is not even, to me, a close question.\n  I think in order for a person to conclude anything other than what I \nhave concluded would require absolutely closing one's eyes to the \nextraordinarily clear evidence on this subject. What is that evidence? \nWe are not allowed to describe that on the Senate floor. It is \nclassified. We can describe our own conclusions, and we have. We can \nurge our colleagues to go and review that evidence--it does not take \nlong--and reach their own conclusions, which surely our colleagues I \nbelieve should do. But the issue here is so important. It is a \nproliferation issue that it is incumbent upon those of us who have seen \nthat briefing to urge our colleagues tomorrow morning, prior to the \nvote, to take a few minutes and go up and look at those materials in \nroom S-407.\n  Now, our good friend from Colorado--I must commend him for a lot of \nreasons--he has applied an intellectual acumen to this matter as well \nas his own great spirit which makes it always difficult for those of us \nwho disagree with him to disagree with him, because he is a man of \ngreat reason and a man of great integrity. He has pointed out in his \namendment that it specifically says that ``nothing contained herein \nshall affect sanctions for transfers of missile equipment or technology \nrequired under section 11B.'' And that language is indeed in his \namendment.\n  The problem is that his amendment does affect sanctions. The words in \nsection 8 which I just read, which says nothing shall affect sanctions, \nare the words. But actions speak louder than words. The action part of \nthis amendment is earlier in the amendment when it says that military \nequipment, ``other than F-16 aircraft, may be transferred to Pakistan \npursuant to contracts for cases entered into before October 1, 1990.'' \nSo the words in subsection (h) which say that ``nothing contained \nherein shall affect sanctions'' are contradicted by what is contained \nherein, which is the authority to transfer military equipment to \nPakistan. That is the action part of the amendment.\n  How I wish it were true that nothing herein affected sanctions for \ntransfers of missile equipment required under section 11B. If there \nwere nothing in here which affected our missile technology control \nregime, if there were nothing in here which affected our Arms Export \nControl Act, there would not be any opposition to the Brown amendment \non this floor. The problem is that this very amendment, by authorizing \nthe transfer of military equipment to Pakistan, is undermining the Arms \nExport Control Act which says that this equipment shall not be \ntransferred if--this is the big ``if''--if, in fact, Pakistan has \nreceived missiles or components or technology within the missile \ntechnology control regime. That is the ``if.''\n  Each one of us can reach our own conclusion. I think the conclusion \nis so crystal clear that there is not much room for doubt. The \nSecretary of State apparently has said that there is enough doubt in \nhis mind that he has not yet reached that conclusion. How he has been \nable to say that in light of all that evidence beats me. But I hope \neverybody will reach their own conclusion. But this issue is so \ncritically important, this proliferation issue, that it requires each \nof us to focus on that evidence, reach our conclusion, and if the \nconclusion is that, in fact, missiles have been transferred and if the \nconclusion is that they have a range and payload that exceeds the \nmissile technology control regime, then it seems to me that the Brown \namendment must be defeated.\n  And so, Mr. President, again, let me commend the Senator from Ohio, \nthank him for yielding me time. I also want to thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for the amendment which she is working on which will give us \nan opportunity to do two right things: One is to live up to our own \nArms Export Control Act and to do the right thing on proliferation at \nthe same time that we do what equity requires relative to the return of \nany funds that indeed equity might require be returned to Pakistan.\n We cannot do both things.\n\n  The Senator from California will be offering an amendment which will \nallow us to do both things, but the amendment before us puts us on a \nvery, very difficult road which I think undermines the deep concerns \nwhich every Member of this body feels about proliferation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I not only yield, I am happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Vermont \nwants to make a brief presentation. While I have indicated to the \nSenator from Iowa that he would be next, with his acquiescence, I yield \n5 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will be brief, as I have to take the \nchair as soon as I can.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that John F. \nGuerra, a Pearson fellow on my staff, be granted the privilege of the \nfloor for the pendency of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will be brief. First, I will support \nthe amendment of the Senator from Colorado, but I also will take a \nmoment to commend the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] for the \ntime and hard work he and his staff put into crafting this legislation. \nHe has done a commendable job with a tough assignment: to reduce our \nexpenditures on foreign aid by a significant amount without \ncompromising national interests. I appreciate his willingness to work \nwith all of the members of the subcommittee to craft a bill that meets \nthe budget allocation and comes to the floor with a broad backing of \nboth the Appropriations Committee and a majority of the foreign \nassistance community.\n  Let us look at the big picture for a moment. We have committed \nourselves to reducing the crippling Federal deficit, and failure to do \nso would irrevocably cripple our Nation and our economy for years to \ncome.\n  Yet, we must not blindly slash spending across the board. We must \ncarefully review our priorities and assign our limited funds \naccordingly.\n  I have been arguing for some time that education must be one of our \ntop priorities. Spending on education is only about 3 percent of the \nentire Federal budget. Yet, if we do not prepare our children for the \nfuture, we will be unable to maintain our standard of living.\n  I am concerned that the quality of our educational system is falling \nbehind that of our major international competitors, and if this trend \ncontinues, we will find ourselves severely handicapped in our efforts \nto maintain a position of economic leadership and our standard of \nliving.\n  The other very small, yet very important, area of Federal spending is \nforeign aid. While many Americans think we spend about 15 percent of \nour budget on foreign aid, in truth foreign aid comprises only 1 \npercent of the budget. And this small investment is being cut in this \nbill by almost 10 percent. Foreign aid is doing its share in \ncontributing to deficit reduction.\n  Yet, there is a danger in cutting these accounts too deeply. Much of \nthis funding goes to meeting basic human needs abroad and to empower \npeople to take control of their own development. If we do not make a \nmodest contribution to the efforts of certain less developed nations to \nget their societies and economies on the right track, then we will lose \nout as these markets open to foreign business. If we do not increase \nour exports, we will not be able to maintain our standard of living. It \nis that simple.\n  Let me touch briefly on a few of the concerns I have with the bill. I \nam confident that the chairman and the ranking member will continue to \nwork with me and other Members to address the \n\n[[Page S 13952]]\nissues as we move through the process. While I am appreciative of the \nefforts that have been made to increase the funding for international \norganizations and programs account, more needs to be done. The funding \nis highly leveraged in most cases by funding matches from many other \ncountries that share these development and environmental priorities.\n  I hope we can address this issue further as we move through this \nprocess. Otherwise, I worry that we may jeopardize the very good work \ndone by many international organizations, including those ably led by \nAmericans.\n  Let me mention the consolidation of the development assistance and \neconomic support fund into a single assistance account. That dissolves \nthe well-established separation between those two distinct aspects of \nU.S. economic aid. I am worried this change makes developmental \nassistance vulnerable, especially in the event of emergencies, to \nshort-term pressures at the expense of long-term goals.\n  I understand the chairman's reasons for including both the \ndevelopment fund for Africa and the child's survival program in the new \nbilateral economic assistance account. However, I trust that as we move \nthrough the process, every effort will be made to protect these \nprograms from any further reductions. It is critical that the funding \nfor these neediest individuals and the neediest continent be preserved.\n  The cut of $28 million below the administration's request for \nvoluntary funding for the peacekeeping account is also of concern. \nInternational peacekeeping is a great way of leveraging our defense \nexpenditures and reducing the exposure of our troops, while helping to \nresolve conflicts of direct concern to us. It is one of the most cost-\neffective methods of increasing capabilities while sharing the burden \nin situations that demand our attention.\n  Mr. President, I want to again commend the Senator from Colorado for \nraising and discussing very eloquently this very difficult and \nimportant amendment. I also again want to commend both the chairman and \nranking member of the subcommittee for their efforts in crafting a bill \nunder extremely difficult circumstances.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we have been trading back and forth. I have \ncommitted to the Senator from Iowa. I certainly will understand if the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio----\n  Mr. GLENN. That is all right.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank him and thank him for his \ngenerosity in allowing us to proceed. I yield now to the Senator from \nIowa such time as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding me this \ntime.\n  I am proud to join with my colleague, Senator Brown, in cosponsoring \nthis amendment to the foreign operations bill. I think this amendment \nby Senator Brown is the first step in moving toward a stronger and more \nflexible relationship with Pakistan, and I commend the Senator for all \nof his work on this important issue.\n  First, I will just say that some may call this a pro-Pakistan \namendment, implying this is to help Pakistan and nothing more. Quite \nfrankly, I see this as a pro-American amendment that strengthens U.S. \ninterests and objectives in a vital region of the world.\n  I am sorry I was not able to be here for some of the earlier \nstatements that were made, but I was here for most of the comments made \nby my colleague from Michigan. As I was listening, I was jotting down \nsome notes. I could not help but think, as the Senator from Michigan, \nmy good friend, was speaking, that the missile technology control \nregime only covers exports and imports. It obviously does not cover \nmissiles developed in the country.\n  The question I was going to pose to the Senator from Michigan when he \nyielded the floor was whether or not the Senator from Michigan would be \nwilling to extend these kinds of sanctions to India, even though it is \nnot under the MTCR? We understand that. But nonetheless, a duck by any \nother name is still a duck, and when you are talking about missile \ntechnology and throw weight and whether or not you have the capability \nof delivering certain types of weapons, then certainly India has \nproceeded down that path.\n  MTCR, as we know, only covers imports and exports, but when you are \ntalking about sanctions in terms of a missile regime, I think you have \nto look at it more broadly than that. So, again, if you are going to \nhave sanctions, why not have sanctions on India, too? I rather doubt \nthe Senator would be in favor of that.\n  But I say to my friend from Michigan that I think--and I checked \nthis; it has been checked by staff with the State Department--that the \nmajor flaw in the argument of the Senator from Michigan is this: If \nthere are violations, would the MTCR prohibit only all new licenses to \nPakistan and China? The items we are talking about here were already \nlicensed in the 1980's. These are old licenses, not new.\n  So my point is that even if MTCR sanctions were imposed tomorrow, all \nof these items could still go to either Pakistan or to China.\n  So the Senator from Michigan made an interesting statement, but it \njust does not comport with the facts and with what MTCR covers.\n  Mr. President, again, whether or not this evidence exists, let me \nread here a statement made by Secretary Warren Christopher on July 28, \n1995, this summer, to the National Press Club.\n  Here was the question:\n\n       Will the Clinton Administration order additional sanctions \n     against China for supplying missile technology to Pakistan \n     and Iran.\n       Secretary Christopher. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are \n     concerned about proliferation issues, and we are certainly \n     concerned about it as they relate to South Asia. We monitor \n     it very carefully and very closely.\n       At the present time, although there is a fairly large body \n     of evidence, we do not think there is the evidence there that \n     would justify the imposition of sanctions. But I want to \n     assure all that we feel an obligation to keep this matter \n     carefully under review and to follow and comply with the law \n     in this regard.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this statement appear at \nthis point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Address by Secretary of State Warren Christopher on U.S. National \n Interest in the Asia-Pacific Region, National Press Club, Washington, \n                                  DC.\n\n       Question. Will the Clinton Administration order additional \n     sanctions against China for supplying missile technology to \n     Pakistan and Iran?\n       Secretary Christopher. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are \n     concerned about proliferation issues, and we are certainly \n     concerned about it as they relate to South Asia. We monitor \n     it very carefully and very closely.\n       At the present time, although there is a fairly large body \n     of evidence, we do not think there is the evidence there that \n     would justify the imposition of sanctions. But I want to \n     assure all that we feel an obligation to keep this matter \n     carefully under review and to follow and comply with the law \n     in this regard.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, Secretary Christopher said, as late \nas July 28, there was not enough evidence that would justify the \nimposition of sanctions.\n  That is really kind of what we are talking about here. Again, my \nfriend from Michigan mentioned something in his comments about the \ntransfer of missiles and missile technology. All I can say is that the \nlast paragraph of the amendment is very clear and unequivocal. It says:\n\n       Nothing contained herein shall affect sanctions for \n     transfers of missile equipment or technology required under \n     section 11B of the Export Administration Act of 1979 or \n     section 73 of the Arms Export Control Act.\n\n  You cannot get much clearer than that. Again, I think the Senator \nfrom Michigan sort of raised a kind of straw man here because, \nobviously, the amendment offered by the Senator from Colorado is \nexplicit in its last paragraph in saying that nothing herein shall \nviolate the Arms Export Control Act.\n  Next, Mr. President, in case anybody says, ``Well, that was July 28 \nthat Secretary Christopher made those comments,'' I have a copy of a \nletter here to the majority leader, Senator Dole, from Secretary \nChristopher, regarding several issues, one of which is the issue \nregarding Pakistan. Let me read this paragraph that is in the letter \ndated September 20:\n\n       We appreciate the bipartisan interest we have seen in \n     improving our relationship with \n\n[[Page S 13953]]\n     Pakistan. We would support an amendment that would permit aid to \n     Pakistan that is in our own interest, such as trade \n     promotion, counternarcotics assistance, and counterterrorism \n     programs. We also support language that would allow for the \n     return of military equipment for which Pakistan has already \n     paid.\n\n  That is what is in the Brown amendment.\n\n       To engage Pakistan on issues of concern to us, including \n     non-proliferation, it is essential to resolve this unfair \n     situation.\n\n  That is dated September 20.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that be printed at this \npoint in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Secretary of State,\n\n                                   Washington, September 20, 1995.\n       Dear Senator Dole: As the Senate begins consideration of \n     the FY 1996 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, I would \n     like to address several issues in the version of the bill as \n     reported by the full Appropriations Committee.\n       At the outset I would like to thank Chairman McConnell and \n     Senator Leahy for their willingness to work with us and to \n     include priority initiatives such as a long-term extension of \n     Middle East Peace Facilitation Act (MEPFA) and a drawdown \n     authority for Jordan in the subcommittee mark. We would \n     oppose any amendments that would alter the carefully \n     negotiated language for either of these initiatives. Also, we \n     appreciate the Subcommittee's removal of objectionable \n     conditions adopted by the House on population assistance and \n     aid to Turkey, Haiti, and Mexico. We hope to continue in this \n     cooperative fashion to produce a Foreign Operations bill that \n     can be presented to the President with bipartisan support.\n       Despite the favorable aspects of the legislation, there are \n     several items that are of great concern to be Department of \n     State. The funding levels throughout the bill are well below \n     the President's request level. The Foreign Operations cuts, \n     coupled with the cuts being proposed to international \n     programs in the Senate's Commerce, Justice, State Department \n     Appropriations bill, represent a serious threat to America's \n     leadership in international affairs.\n       The bill also contains numerous earmarks and substantially \n     restructures our foreign aid accounts. We expect \n     international agencies to do their share in the effort to \n     balance the budget as the President's budget plan makes \n     clear. However, we, the Administration, should have the \n     flexibility to apply funds to the programs that provide the \n     best results. Earmarks in our programs for the New \n     Independent States, International Counternarcotics, and \n     economic assistance would prevent us from being able to \n     respond to the crises and unexpected requirements of the \n     post-Cold War world. Further, the proportionality requirement \n     in the new Economic Assistance account restricts our ability \n     to change the distribution of these funds from year to year. \n     We oppose these restrictions.\n       The bill also contains a number of objectionable policy \n     provisions. Retrictions on our ability to contribute to the \n     Korean Energy Development Organization (KEDO) would, in \n     effect, prevent U.S. funding of KEDO and greatly hinder, if \n     not destroy, the international effort to implement the Agreed \n     Framework. We oppose linking KEDO funding to substantial \n     progress on North Korean/South Korean dialogue. Imposing an \n     artificial and unrealistic deadline on North/South talks, \n     which have taken years to progress, will hold hostage the \n     very funding that will facilitate the progress we all so \n     desire. We remain convinced that the North/South dialogue \n     will move forward substantially as a result of the Agreed \n     Framework and the creation of KEDO. Our failure to contribute \n     to KEDO will threaten its ability to meet its obligations \n     under the Framework and, consequently, invite North Korean \n     non-compliance. The Agreed Framework is working. North Korea \n     has frozen its nuclear weapons program. We need Congressional \n     support for KEDO to keep the freeze in place.\n       Regarding assistance to the New Independent States (NIS) \n     and Russia, we have reached a critical moment in the reform \n     process. Continued funding is essential. It can make a major \n     difference in whether reformers in Russia, Ukraine, Armenia, \n     Moldova and other states will be able to maintain momentum, \n     or the opponents of reform will halt the development of \n     democratic market societies. We need to stay the course for \n     this transitional period, while normal trading and investment \n     relationships develop in the former Soviet states. We very \n     much appreciate the continued support we have received from \n     the Congress, and the Senate Appropriations Committee in \n     particular, for this critical effort, as reflected in this \n     bill.\n       At the same time, however, we oppose new conditions on \n     assistance to the NIS. It is of course tempting to withdraw \n     our assistance as punishment when we do not agree with \n     Russian actions or policies. But this would be a mistake. \n     This assistance is in our national interest. Cutting or \n     restricting aid would hurt reformers, the very people who \n     have protested the war in Chechnya, criticized Russia's \n     proposed nuclear sale to Iran, or insisted that Russia end \n     cooperation with Cuba. We urge you to remove such conditions \n     from this bill. Let me assure you that we share your concerns \n     about Russia's policies in these areas; that is why we \n     continue to work on other fronts to stop the Russian nuclear \n     reactor sale to Iran and to prevent completion of the Cuban \n     reactor project.\n       We also urge you to restore the national security waiver \n     for the certification requirement on violations of \n     territorial integrity, which has been removed from the Senate \n     version of this bill. It is important that the President \n     retain the ability to determine whether the national security \n     of the United States justifies a waiver of this requirement. \n     Moreover, removal of the waiver provision could have \n     unintended consequences, such as prohibiting humanitarian \n     assistance to the victims of regional conflicts in countries \n     such as Armenia.\n       The language regarding restrictions on the terminaiton of \n     sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro also reflects \n     objectionable House language carried over in the Senate bill. \n     The recent combination of NATO's resolve and energetic United \n     States leadership on the diplomatic front has led to some \n     encouraging opportunities for a negotiated settlement to the \n     conflict. To prematurely close off any avenues that may lead \n     to a diplomatic settlement, including adjustments to the \n     sanctions regime against Serbia, would complicate our \n     efforts.\n       We appreciate the bipartisan interest we have seen in \n     improving our relationship with Pakistan. We would support an \n     amendment that would permit aid to Pakistan that is in our \n     own interest, such as trade promotion, counternarcotics \n     assistance, and counterterrorism programs. We also support \n     language that would allow for the return of military \n     equipment for which Pakistan has already paid. To engage \n     Pakistan on issues of concern to us, including non-\n     proliferation, it is essential to resolve this unfair \n     situation.\n       There remain other problematic issues in the bill, but we \n     are encouraged by the willingness of the bill's managers to \n     work with us, and we hope that these other issues can be \n     resolved on the Senate floor or in conference.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Warren Christopher\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, last, regarding the letters, in making the \npoint that the points of the Senator from Michigan are not in keeping \nwith the views of the Secretary of State or of this administration, let \nme also read from a letter dated August 2 from the Secretary of \nDefense, William Perry, to the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Strom Thurmond. Again, I will read the first \nparagraph:\n\n       For the past six months, the Administration has wrestled \n     with the difficult problem of trying to build a stronger, \n     more flexible relationship with Pakistan--an important, \n     moderate Islamic democracy in a troubled region which has \n     been a long-time friend and has become a major partner in \n     peacekeeping operations--while promoting the very important \n     nonproliferation goals of the Pressler Amendment.\n\n  Then he went on in the letter to point out basically what is in the \namendment and what the President would support. And then Secretary \nPerry says this:\n\n       While we recognize this is not a perfect solution, it is, \n     we believe, the course which will best help us resolve a \n     difficult problem with a country which has long been a \n     friend. This is an effort to resolve issues involving \n     ``fairness'' that have become a major irritant in our \n     relationship with Pakistan--it is in no way an effort to \n     resume a military supply relationship. Meanwhile, our ability \n     to work with Pakistan to achieve nonproliferation goals is \n     eroding. The status quo, unfortunately, offers few incentives \n     for future cooperation or restraint by Pakistan--or by India, \n     whose nuclear and missile programs are also of concern. If we \n     succeed in putting this issue behind us, we will be in a \n     better position to engage Pakistan in a constructive way on \n     issues of concern to us, particularly nonproliferation.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this entire letter to \nSenator Strom Thurmond, dated August 2, 1995, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 2, 1995.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: For the past six months, the \n     Administration has wrestled with the difficult problem of \n     trying to build a stronger, more flexible relationship with \n     Pakistan--an important, moderate Islamic democracy in a \n     troubled region which has been a long-term friend and has \n     become a major partner in peacekeeping operations--while \n     promoting the very important nonproliferation goals of the \n     Pressler Amendment.\n       Based on a detailed review within the Administration and \n     consultations with Congress, the President had decided to \n     address this matter on three fronts:\n       First, he strongly supports provisions already contained in \n     the House and Senate versions of the Foreign Aid \n     Authorization \n\n[[Page S 13954]]\n     bill that would permit us to resume economic assistance and limited \n     military assistance affecting clear U.S. interests (including \n     assistance in peacekeeping, counterterrrorism and \n     counternarcotics as well as IMET).\n       Second, the President has decided to seek authority, as \n     provided by an amendment to be proposed by Senator Brown, \n     that would release approximately $370 million worth of \n     embargoed military equipment purchased by Pakistan before the \n     imposition of Pressler sanctions. This authority would \n     specifically exclude the release of the F-16s. Among the \n     items that would be released are three P-3C Orion maritime \n     patrol aircraft, Harpoon anti-ship missiles, counter-mortar \n     radars, howitzers, and support kits for F-16s and Cobra \n     helicopters already in the Pakistani inventory. These items \n     will not disturb the conventional arms balance in South Asia \n     which overwhelmingly favors India.\n       Finally, the President has decided that, rather than \n     releasing the 28 F-16s to Pakistan, he will seek to sell them \n     to a third country and deposit the proceeds of any sale in \n     the Pakistan Trust Fund to reimburse, as much as the sale \n     permits, Pakistan's investment in these aircraft.\n       While we recognize that this is not a perfect solution, it \n     is, we believe, the course which will best help us resolve a \n     difficult problem with a country which has long been a \n     friend. This is an effort to resolve issues involving \n     ``fairness'' that have become a major irritant in our \n     relationship with Pakistan--it is in no way an effort to \n     resume a military supply relationship. Meanwhile, our ability \n     to work with Pakistan to achieve nonproliferation goals is \n     eroding. The status quo unfortunately, offers few incentives \n     for future cooperation or restraint by Pakistan--or by India, \n     whose nuclear and missile programs are also of concern. If we \n     succeed in putting this issue behind us, we will be in a \n     better position to engage Pakistan in a constructive way on \n     issues of concern to us, particularly nonproliferation.\n       The second aspect of this three-part effort--embodied in \n     Senator Brown's pending amendment to provide authority to \n     release the embargoed Pakistan equipment other than the F-\n     16s--may be coming to a vote very shortly. I urge you to \n     support our efforts to resolve this problem by supporting \n     Senator Brown's amendment when it is offered.\n           Sincerely,\n     William J. Perry.\n                                                                    ____\n\n Putting the Release of Embargoed Pakistani Equipment into Perspective\n\n       The total package has a value of $368 million--not $700 \n     million as has been reported.\n       Although the P-3C Orion provides a long-range offensive \n     capability, three aircraft would hardly disturb India's \n     nearly 2 to 1 advantage over Pakistan in naval systems:\n       It is claimed that the P-3s provide a ``lethal stand off \n     capability'' against Indian naval targets as far south as \n     Cochin; however, it should be noted that because the Pakistan \n     Navy has no aircraft carriers (of which the Indian Navy has \n     two), the Pakistanis would be unable to provide fighters to \n     escort these slow aircraft when operating at such a great \n     distance from Karachi--thus leaving them vulnerable to \n     interception by either land-based Indian Air Force fighters \n     or carrier based Indian Navy aircraft.\n       It is incorrect to say that the P-3C represent a new \n     weapons system for the region as the Indian Navy already has \n     two squadrons of similar maritime patrol aircraft that \n     include five Il-38 (the Russian version of the P-3) and eight \n     Tu-142 Bear F aircraft. While these aircraft do not have a \n     system equivalent to the Harpoon, they do have equipment to \n     locate submarines and are capable of launching torpedoes.\n       The Indian Navy also possesses an anti-ship missile, the \n     Sea Eagle, which is similar to the Harpoon. Although not \n     capable of being launched from the maritime patrol aircraft \n     mentioned above, the Indian Sea Eagles can be carried on the \n     Sea Harrier jets and the Sea King helicopters which operate \n     from India's two aircraft carriers--thus giving the Indian \n     Navy a more formidable long-range strike capability than that \n     provided by three P-3s.\n       C-NITE would enable Pack Cobra helicopters to launch TOW 2 \n     anti-tank guided missiles at night; however, these 19 \n     helicopters, so equipped, would hardly offset India's 2 to 1 \n     advantage (by over 2000 tanks) over Pakistan.\n       The Pakistani F-16s are already equipped with the AN/ALR-69 \n     radar warning receiver and AN/ALQ-131 electronic counter \n     measures jamming equipment. These are defensive rather than \n     offensive systems. The ALR-69 alerts the pilot that a radar \n     has ``painted'' his aircraft; the ALQ-131 electronically \n     deflects the hostile missile. The ALR-69 and ALQ-131 kits \n     that would be released would enhance the reliability of these \n     systems rather than provide any new military capability.\n       Since Pakistan has previously received over 200 AIM-9L air-\n     to-air missiles, the release of 360 more will not provide any \n     new capability. Furthermore, India will still enjoy an almost \n     2 to 1 advantage in jet combat aircraft over Pakistan to \n     include a better than 2 to 1 advantage in aircraft equivalent \n     to the Pakistani F-16s (i.e., MiG-29 and Mirage 2000).\n       The 24 howitzers that would be released to Pakistan are \n     M198 155 mm towed howitzers. Given the fact that the Indian \n     Army has over 3000 towed artillery pieces (almost twice the \n     number in the Pakistani inventory), 24 more will not make a \n     significant difference. It should be noted that during the \n     nearly five years that these howitzers were embargoed, India \n     acquired over 250 equivalent artillery pieces from \n     Czechoslovakia and Russia/USSR.\n       In regard to MK-46 torpedoes, Pakistan will receive parts \n     that constitute less that one operational MK-46.\n       As for the 2.75'' rockets, these constitute a resupply of \n     ammunition for one of the weapons systems on the Pakistani \n     Cobra helicopters--they do not give Pakistan any new \n     capability.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wanted to make those points up front to \nadequately refute, I think, some of the points made by my friend from \nMichigan. This basically is, as the Senator from Colorado has stated so \nmany times, a basic issue of fairness. Pakistan has been a long-time \nfriend and ally of the United States.\n  I know the hour is late, but I think it is important that, once \nagain, we review a little bit of history so that we do not kind of \noperate in a vacuum, as though Pakistan was born yesterday, or that \nsomehow our relationship with Pakistan just started.\n  This is a relationship that goes back a long way. At the time of its \nindependence, in 1947, Pakistan made a conscious choice to promote \nfriendship with the United States rather than the Soviet Union. The \nfirst Prime Minister of Pakistan, Liaqat Ali Khan, chose to undertake \nhis first overseas visit to the United States instead of to the Soviet \nUnion, despite efforts by Moscow to entice him there. While in the \nUnited States during 1950, the Prime Minister explained to various \nAmerican audiences that the principles on which the nation of Pakistan \nwas based were as compatible with the political, economical, and \nideological goals of the United States as they were incompatible with \ncommunism. He expressed that it would be the view of his government to \n``throw all its weight in the effort to maintaining stability in \nAsia.''\n  In a speech to this Congress, Prime Minister Liaqat Ali Khan \nproclaimed that ``no threat or persuasion, no material peril, or \nideological allurement could deflect Pakistan from its chosen path of \nfree democracy.''\n  Pakistan lived up to its commitments later on in June of 1950 when it \ndeclared its unqualified support for the United States in our war in \nKorea and backed us in that war.\n  In 1954, they joined the Central Treaty Organization. In 1955, they \njoined SEATO. These two American-backed alliances were aimed at the \ncontainment of communism and were very successful. In 1959, our two \ncountries signed a Mutual Defense Treaty, which is still operational \ntoday. So this is a long history.\n  Again, some will say, well, Pakistan has had military dictatorships \nand violations of human rights. Listen, I understand that. But I \nbelieve that the freedom advocates in Pakistan have been at it \ncontinually. They have been assassinated and tortured, but they \ncontinue to struggle for democratic freedoms in that country. Those are \nthe ones about whom I spoke, not the military dictators, not the \nrepressive forces in Pakistan, of which there are more than just a few, \nbut to those brave people of Pakistan who, through all of this, \ncontinue to struggle and to fight and to maintain an adherence to \ndemocracy.\n In 1960, Pakistan's commitment, its friendship to the United States \nwas put to a very severe test.\n\n  Again, in accordance with the Mutual Defense Treaty, Pakistan allowed \nus to set up some bases. One of them was a base from which we flew our \nU-2 flights over the Soviet Union and one of those flights, as we all \ntoo sadly remember, was shot down by the Soviets. Francis Gary Powers \nwas the pilot. We all know how the Soviets paraded him as one of their \ntrophies.\n  Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev turned his ire on Pakistan because he \nknew that is where the plane left from. He threatened to use nuclear \narms and weapons against Pakistan. He boasted that the City of Peshawar \nwould be wiped off the face of the earth because that is where the base \nwas. The former Foreign Minister of Pakistan, in his recently published \naccount of the incident, describes the cool and confident reaction of \nthe then-President of Pakistan, who dismissed the Soviet threat by \nsaying, ``So what?\" \n\n[[Page S 13955]]\n\n  Again, put yourself in that context. Korean war, Mutual Defense \nTreaty, allowing us to base our U-2 flights here. They are bordering \nright on the Soviet Union, and yet they stood by us.\n  Pakistan again came to the help of the United States by helping to \nfacilitate the crucial opening of American relations with China. In \n1970, then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger undertook a secret visit \nto China from Pakistan. Thus, again, Pakistan served as that vital \nbridge between the United States and China. Again, it was critical in \nthe cold war to restrain the Soviet Union.\n  Moscow began to speak of the Washington-Beijing-Islamabad axis. \nAgain, it was only Pakistan which bore the brunt of Soviet anger when \nMoscow signed the defense treaty with India, and through a massive \ntransfer of arms as well as political support which enabled India to \ninvade East Pakistan in 1971.\n  Regrettably, the United States stood by even though we had a mutual \ndefense treaty with Pakistan at that time.\n  In 1979, once again Pakistan's friendship with the United States was \nput to a severe test when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Over \nthe next decade, Pakistan joined the United States in helping to roll \nback Soviet communism and expansion. It did so at great cost. Not only, \nagain, did the Soviet Union threaten Pakistan with dire consequences, \nbut launched a campaign of subversion and terror against Pakistan. The \ncountry experienced numerous violations of its ground and airspace, \nterrorist bombings, subversion.\n  To add to these problems, Pakistan provided refuge to more than 3.2 \nmillion Afghans at great political and economic cost to itself. Think \nabout that, Mr. President: 3.2 million Afghans sought refuge in \nPakistan.\n  Pakistan continues to pay the price for the role it played in the \ndefeat of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. But they stood by us and \nthey helped. Ironically, however, this successful cooperation between \nPakistan and the United States was followed by the worst period in \ntheir bilateral relations with our country with the imposition of the \nPressler sanctions against Pakistan in 1990.\n  Even despite this development, Pakistan continued to seek friendly \nrelations with the United States and came to our assistance whenever we \nrequested. Pakistan made significant troop contributions to the \nmultinational forces during the gulf war to liberate Kuwait. At the \npolitical level, Pakistan not only condemned the Iraqi invasion of \nKuwait but was instrumental in promoting the U.N. efforts for the \nliberation of Kuwait.\n  Again, Pakistan took a lead role in the peacekeeping operations in \nSomalia, serving together with American troops in that country. It was \nnot the first time that American and Pakistani soldiers died together \nfor the same cause.\n  Again, at our request, Pakistan has been at the forefront of \ncontributing to U.N. peacekeeping operations. Pakistan forces have been \ndeployed for peacekeeping purposes in Bosnia, Liberia, Haiti. Pakistani \ntroops were in Haiti, helping us to restore democracy to Haiti, Western \nSahara, Mozambique, Georgia.\n  Recently, the United States and Pakistan have also joined hands in \nthe fight against terrorism and narcotics. Recently, and in cooperation \nwith American personnel, Pakistan recently apprehended Ramzi Yousaf for \nalleged involvement in the World Trade Center bomb blast, and Pakistan \nhas extradited over half a dozen drug barons to the United States in \nour joint counter-narcotics drive.\n  Again, Mr. President, I recite all this. I know a lot of people know \nthis history, but maybe too many of us have forgotten, and we have \nforgotten what a close friend and ally Pakistan has been.\n  Again, as a moderate democratic Islamic country, Pakistan is the only \ntried and trusted friend that we have in that Islamic world. The recent \nvisit of Prime Minister Bhutto clearly demonstrated that Pakistan's \ncommitment to friendship with the United States remains as strong as it \nwas during the cold war.\n  Mr. President, with this kind of history, for the life of me, I \ncannot understand why we continue to treat that country as we do. \nAgain, I am only talking again about fairness. Secretary of State \nChristopher said that. It is an issue of fairness. Secretary of Defense \nPerry said it is a question of fairness and a question of our \nrelationships with Pakistan.\n  Mr. President, again, neither India or Pakistan are a party to the \nNuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. I wish they were. If I had an argument \nagainst Pakistan, it would be that argument. They ought to be a part of \nit. But so should India. India cannot skate by on this simply because \nthey say they are not importing and they are building their own. They \ncannot skate by on that kind of flimsy excuse.\n  Again, I do not think anyone here would advocate unilateral \ndisarmament on our part. Certainly, we could not expect Pakistan to \nhave a unilateral disarmament on their part.\n  Again, I hope that both sides, India and Pakistan, would agree to a \nregime of peaceful relations and a downgrading of both of their \nmilitary systems. But we cannot expect Pakistan unilaterally to do \nthat, not given the history of that region.\n  I understand Pakistan is not a perfect country. But, again, what we \nare doing is not fair. Absolutely not fair.\n  The Brown amendment moves United States policy forward so that we can \nwork with Pakistan to tackle a lot of problems: drug trafficking, \ninternational terrorism, peacekeeping, illegal immigration. But, again, \nit also strengthens a competitive position for United States companies \nto do business in Pakistan. So it advances our interests abroad.\n  Again, on the question of military equipment, the Brown amendment is \na fair and responsible approach. A fair and responsible approach. We \nshould not be charging Pakistan with the storage of military equipment \nthey purchased that we did not release. It is not fair. We should not \nbe holding on to military equipment that Pakistan simply sent here for \nrepair. It is not fair. And we should not hold on to the money and hold \non to the equipment that Pakistan has bought and paid for. That, too, \nis unfair.\n  This issue has led to a steady erosion of our relationship with \nPakistan, an old friend--a struggling democracy, struggling, a very \ntroubled part of the world.\n  So in order to strengthen our partnership and advance American \ninterests, it is essential to put this problem behind us, wipe the \nslate clean and concentrate on the issue of nonproliferation, which is \nthe intent of the Pressler amendment.\n  The Brown amendment helps us do just that.\n  Again, when you look at the equipment that we are talking about, \nthere is nothing in here that is new. As I said, these are items that \nwere already approved. These are not items that would be covered under \nthe missile technology control regime.\n  I want to make that point one more time to my friend from Michigan. \nEven if the MTCR sanctions were imposed tomorrow, all the items in the \nBrown amendment could go because they had already been approved under \nthe old regime.\n  Again, the Brown amendment is fair, it is responsible, it is \nreasonable, it will wipe the slate clean. I think it will help promote \ndemocracy and the democratic forces that are struggling and have \nstruggled so hard in Pakistan. I do not think it will do one iota in \nany way to encourage any kind of nuclear proliferation or technology of \nmissiles or anything else. As I said, the Secretary of State and the \nSecretary of Defense have both said that the evidence is not there in \nsufficient amount to impose these kinds of sanctions.\n  So, again, I would just say that it is in our best interests to adopt \nthe Brown amendment. That is why the administration supports it so \nstrongly. That is why I support it. I believe we have to get on with \nrenewing our relationship with Pakistan, to wipe the slate clean, to \ntreat them fairly--not unfairly.\n  If people want to talk about the country that has, I think, pushed us \nto the limits in terms of using nuclear devices, testing nuclear \nweapons, and building up nuclear arsenals, we ought to be talking about \nIndia, not Pakistan. So I think this will get us back on a more even \nkeel and perhaps will set us up in a regime where we can actually \nengage both India and Pakistan \n\n[[Page S 13956]]\nto begin a process of more peaceful relations and negotiations leading \nto a cooling down in that region of the world and, perhaps, even a \nreduction in the weapons in both India and Pakistan.\n  If we continue on the way we are going, then I fear the hard line \nforces in Pakistan, the antidemocratic forces, are going to go to the \nforefront. I think they are the ones who are going to be able to say \nlook, how can you trust the United States? Here we have done all these \nthings for the United States over all these years--we have supported \nthem, been their great friends, backed them up, and they turned their \nback on us.\n  If you want to push Pakistan, as some of these people are saying, \ncloser to China, that is the way you do it. If you defeat the Brown \namendment you will get just what you asked for. You will get the more \nrepressive forces in Pakistan going along with the repressive forces \nthat are dominant in China today, and then we really will have a \nproblem in South Asia.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the Brown amendment and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Iowa leaves, I want \nto point out, he was questioning whether we would have the guts to \nsanction India. I point out to him that we did sanction India under the \nMTCR. We had United States sanctions imposed against India, the Indian \nspace research organization, and against Russia, Glavcosmos, for the \nRussian transfer of cryogenic rocket engines. That was in 1992, I \nbelieve. So we did actually have sanctions against India.\n  What we did was we cut the United States exports of missiles for a 2-\nyear period, I believe it was. I do not have the exact date it was put \ninto effect--yes, we do. This is out of the May 12, 1992 Washington \nPost, an article by R. Geoffrey Smith titled, ``U.S. Imposes Sanctions \nAgainst Russian-Indian Concerns Over Rocket Deals.''\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, that is true, but the \nsanctions have since expired.\n  Mr. GLENN. They expired, but I thought the point was we did not have \nguts enough to assign sanctions against India--but we did. We have done \nit.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, we continued the sanctions on Pakistan but let \nthem expire on India.\n  Mr. GLENN. The same sanctions expired on India. But, anyway, the \nissue here is not the money, small amounts of equipment and so on. The \nissue is: Does the United States of America have a nuclear \nnonproliferation policy worthy of the name or not? That is basically \nwhat we are talking about. Do we have one and are we willing to abide \nby it? Or is it a sham? Is it only for press conferences? Is it only \nfor campaign talk and little else? That is the question.\n  Talk about trusting the United States, let us talk about how much we \ncan trust other nations of the world whom we try to help and work with. \nWe have felt strongly enough about our nuclear stockpiles and what is \ngoing on around the world that we have exhorted other nations to please \nsign up under the nonproliferation treaty. At the same time, we pledged \nthat if a situation ever got to where we could start working our \nstockpiles of nuclear weapons down, vis-a-vis the Soviet Union, we \nwould do that. Fortunately, at this day and time, after all these years \nof cold war, we have reached that point where we now are downsizing, as \nwe call it, our nuclear weapons stockpiles. And we are all glad that is \noccurring.\n  In the meantime we asked other nations to sign up under the NPT, to \nsubmit to IAEA inspections. And we have had 178 other nations that have \nput their faith in the United States of America, to follow our lead and \nsay, ``Yes, we trust you. And, yes, we will go along, we will not \ndevelop nuclear weapons in return for America's cooperation in peaceful \nuses of nuclear energy.''\n  Who is the most egregious violator of all these things with regard to \nnot signing up, refusing to sign up under the nonproliferation treaty, \nnot cooperating in matters nuclear, in fact telling untruths, one right \nafter the other, one right after the other, on and on and on and on and \non? That is Pakistan.\n  I can appreciate very much the situation Pakistan finds itself in. \nSome years ago China developed nuclear weapons. They have been part of \nthe nuclear weapons scene across the world for many years. India and \nChina have had border troubles, disputed territories. Both claimed \ncertain areas up along the border, and they have been back and forth at \neach other for many, many decades, going way back. So, as soon as China \ndeveloped nuclear weapons, India felt they had to do the same thing or \nthey would not be safe. So they set about a nuclear weapons development \nprogram. In 1974 they set off their first nuclear device. They called \nit a PNE, a peaceful nuclear explosion. OK, that is fine, they can call \nit what they want, but a bomb is a bomb is a bomb is a bomb, whether \nyou call it a peaceful bomb underground for test purposes or whether it \nis a bomb that is usable, an explosive device that will go off \nsomewhere else.\n  As a result of the Indian PNE, then we had Pakistan swore they would \nget the bomb one way or another, no matter what they had to do to do \nit. In fact then Prime Minister Bhutto, the current Prime Minister's \nfather, who later died, said that, to quote his words, Pakistan would \n``eat grass'' if it was necessary to get that nuclear capability. They \nhave been embarked on a nuclear weapons program ever since, even though \nthey have steadfastly denied it, year after year after year after year. \nAnd they have been untruthful to us.\n  I went to Pakistan, met personally with President Zia back years ago, \nwith Yaqub Khan, who was foreign minister, and their atomic energy \ncommissioner at that time, met with all these people, sat and talked to \nthem one on one, looked them right in the eye, and they swore up and \ndown they had no nuclear program under way. And I think they even knew \nat that time that I knew that what they were telling me was not true, \neven though we had good intelligence information at that time.\n  Let me just quote--I am going to put some of this in the Record later \non at the end of my remarks, but let us bring it up to date here with \nthe present Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto. Listen to some of her \ncomments on this. Going back when she was opposition leader, Benazir \nBhutto, shortly before she became Prime Minister, the Washington Post \nquotes her as saying:\n\n       We don't want any controversy with the U.S. on the nuclear \n     issue. We want it clear beyond doubt that we are interested \n     only in energy, not nuclear weapons.\n\n  That was on November 19, 1988.\n  On November 28, 1988, once again opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, \ninterviewed in Time Magazine, says:\n\n       We believe in a peaceful nuclear program for energy \n     purposes and nothing else.\n\n  Now Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, interviewed in the Calcutta \nTelegraph on December 14, 1988--she is now Prime Minister--is quoted as \nfollows:\n\n       I can tell you with confidence there is no bomb program in \n     Pakistan. There is no bomb program. There is no bomb program.\n\n  Later on Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, interviewed on MacNeil/Lehrer \non December 16, 1988:\n\n       We are committed to a peaceful energy program. We don't \n     have any nuclear weapons policy. Pakistan doesn't have any \n     intention to get a nuclear device or a nuclear weapon.\n\n  Bring it on up a little bit. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, once \nagain addressing a joint session of the U.S. Congress, on the other end \nof the Capitol from us, when she came over here and addressed us on \nJune 7, 1989, said:\n\n       Speaking for Pakistan, I can declare that we do not possess \n     nor do we intend to make a nuclear device. That is our \n     policy.\n\n  That was to the Congress of the United States.\n  July 10, 1989, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto:\n\n       Pakistan has not, nor do we have any intention of putting \n     together or making a bomb or taking it to the point where you \n     can put it together.\n\n  Another one quoted by AFP on August 29, 1989:\n\n       We do have the knowledge but I do think there is a \n     difference between knowledge and capability. So we do have a \n     knowledge, if confronted with a threat to use, but we do not \n     in the absence of any threat intend to \n\n[[Page S 13957]]\n     use that knowledge. In fact, as a matter of policy, my government is \n     firmly committed to nonproliferation.\n\n  Then quoted in an interview in a German newspaper, as quoted by \nReuters, on October 22, 1989:\n\n       It is true that Pakistan has certain knowledge in the \n     nuclear field but it has no intention of using this \n     knowledge. To put it another way, we do not want to convert \n     this knowledge into, shall we say, a nuclear capability at \n     the present time.\n\n  And the last one that I will read here out of a number of other \nexamples I could give was in 1994, last November, November 18, 1994, \nbeing interviewed by David Frost on PBS. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto:\n\n       We have neither detonated one nor have we got nuclear \n     weapons. Being a responsible state and a state committed to \n     nonproliferation, we in Pakistan through five successive \n     governments have taken a policy decision to follow a peaceful \n     nuclear program.\n\n  Well, at a later time I will ask to enter these in the Record at the \nend of my remarks. But those are examples of some of the statements and \nthere are several dozen others here by various Pakistani officials that \ngo along the same line.\n  Well, so much for the protestations that they have made through the \nyears.\n  In 1987, Yaqub Khan, father of the bomb in Pakistan as he is known, \nin an interview, I believe it was in London, made the mistake of saying \nthat, yes, they had the bomb. That was it, period.\n  MTCR was brought up a little while ago as well as M-11's. When we \ntalked to some of the people over at the White House today, after I \nsaid, what if the missile technology, MTCR, has been violated? What \nwould be the administration's policy? I was told by the person I was \ntalking to, not the President, but I was told by the person I was \ntalking to, ``Well, if MTCR has been violated, we will abide by the \nlaw.''\n  I hope they mean it. I wish they would do the same thing with regard \nto the Pressler amendment and with the other legislation that we have \nhad on the books for a long time.\n  To understand how we arrived at this difficult state of affairs with \nPakistan, in which they have paid $658 million in cash and used $200 \nmillion in credits for 28 F-16's but cannot have them delivered, I \nthink we need to go back. I think we need to review a little bit of the \nhistory of Pakistan.\n  I would also add that $658 million in cash and $200 million in \ncredits comes up to about $858 million that we are talking about.\n  But to go back a little bit, in the mid-1970's, Congress became \nconcerned about increasing evidence of international nuclear trade in \ndangerous technologies associated with producing nuclear weapon \nmaterials.\n  A number of countries, including but not limited to Pakistan, South \nKorea, Brazil, Taiwan, were actively engaged in seeking such \ntechnologies, and suppliers such as France and Germany seemed prepared \nto meet the demand.\n  Now, in an attempt to dampen such activity, in 1976 and 1977, \nCongress enacted what is now called the Glenn-Symington amendment to \nthe Foreign Assistance Act which provided that countries importing or \nexporting such dangerous technologies under certain conditions would be \ncut off from U.S. economic and military assistance.\n  This law was universal in its application. It was not directed \nspecifically toward Pakistan at all. Nonetheless, in 1979, after much \ninformation became available about illegal Pakistani activities \ninvolving the smuggling of design information and equipment related to \nnuclear enrichment, President Carter invoked the Glenn-Symington \namendment to cut off the Pakistanis.\n  After the war in Afghanistan broke out, attempts by the Carter \nadministration to restore some assistance to Pakistan in return for \nrestraints on their nuclear program were rebuffed by the Pakistanis. \nWhen the Reagan administration arrived, aid to Pakistan and the \nmujaheddin was high up on the administration's foreign policy agenda. \nAt that time, they even suggested repeal of the Glenn-Symington \namendment. That was suggested during some of the congressional \nconsultations we had with them. That was rejected.\n  Instead, a proposal was made and adopted into law that allowed the \nPresident to resume aid to Pakistan for 6 years despite its violations \nof section 669 of the Glenn-Symington amendment which related to \nuranium enrichment activities. President Reagan used this authority in \n1982 and also issued a waiver under section 670 of the amendment. This \nrelated to reprocessing activities--to exempt Pakistan indefinitely \nfrom the cutoff provisions of that section of the Glenn-Symington \nlegislation as well.\n  Now, he could not do the same under section 669 unless he had \nreliable assurances that the Pakistanis were not developing nuclear \nweapons. And such assurances were clearly not available.\n  Thus, a specific waiver for Pakistan was created and has been \nsubsequently renewed five times. That allowed them to escape from the \nsanctions imposed by United States law for proliferators. This has been \ndone for no other country that I am aware of. So anyone who thinks we \nare being too harsh on Pakistan, poor little Pakistan, we have renewed \nthat waiver on five different occasions. Nonetheless, Congress was \nunwilling to give a complete blank check to Pakistan and stipulated in \nthe waiver legislation that Pakistan would still be cut off if--if--it \nreceived or exploded a nuclear device.\n  Now, in addition, Congress stipulated that an annual report would be \nprovided on Pakistan's nuclear activities so that Congress could \nconfirm that United States assistance was indeed inhibiting Pakistan's \nbomb program as was confidently assumed by Reagan administration \nofficials.\n  We have a number of statements that they made at that time about what \na big thing this was going to be, and that was the best thing to do to \nget the Pakis to hold back on their bomb program. So we required \nreports, and those reports, along with supplementary intelligence \ninformation, revealed there was no effect whatsoever on the pace or the \ndirection of the Pakistani bomb program.\n  The Pakistanis continued to say publicly they had no nuclear weapons \nprogram and continually lied to United States authorities whenever \nquestioned. Indeed, then-President Zia and then-head of the Pakistani \natomic energy commission, Mir Khan, both lied to me in my visit to \nIslamabad in 1984. Lying is a harsh word, but I cannot put any other \nword to it. That occurred when I asked about information I had \nconcerning their nuclear program.\n  The result of all this mendacity, plus ongoing information that the \nPakistani program was progressing, was the enactment of the Pressler \namendment. The Pressler amendment was passed in 1985, which was \ndesigned to draw a new line in the sand regarding the extent of United \nStates forbearance over Pakistan's nuclear weapons program.\n  The amendment required the United President to certify annually that \nPakistan did not ``possess,'' in quotes--``possess,'' key word--a \nnuclear explosive device in order for assistance to continue and that \nsuch assistance would significantly reduce the risk that Pakistan would \npossess such a device.\n  Please note that the argument about the Pressler amendment being \nunfair because it applies only to Pakistan is completely disingenuous \nbecause it ignores the fact that Pressler was created to shape further \nthe unique special exemption from United States nonproliferation law \ngiven to Pakistan years earlier. If we had not had the waiver, we would \nnot have needed Pressler.\n  It has been reported that CIA officials who were privy to \nintelligence information concerning the Pakistani program were very \nskeptical beginning from 1987 on that the President could make the \nappropriate certifications under Pressler to allow aid to continue; in \nother words, to say with some certainty that they did not possess any \nnuclear device and that our assistance was significantly reducing the \nrisk that they would possess.\n  Statements from high-ranking Pakistani officials around this time \nsuggested they had the bomb within their grasp. Nonetheless, President \nReagan in 1987 and 1988 and President Bush in 1989 made those \ncertifications. It has also been reported that President Bush told the \nPakistanis in 1989 that he would be unable to make this certification \nthe next year in 1990.\n  Now, the contract for the sale of 28 F-16's was signed in 1989, the \nyear Pakistan ostensibly had been warned that there would be no further \ncertification that would allow them to receive military equipment from \nthe \n\n[[Page S 13958]]\nUnited States. The first cash payment by Pakistan of $50 million was \nmade at the beginning of fiscal year 1990. Subsequent to the cutoff, \nwhich came because of the Pressler amendment which took affect in \nOctober 1990, Pakistan continued to send periodic payments for the \nmanufacture of F-16's. That is, $150 million in fiscal 1991, $243 \nmillion in fiscal 1992, $215 million in fiscal 1993, for a total of \n$658 million.\n  Why did they continue to send money when they knew that U.S. law \nwould not enable them to receive the planes? That is a question only \nthey can answer. But it is not unlike an investor buying a stock of a \ncompany whose assets are under lien in the hope that the lien will \nsomehow be removed. If it does not get removed, the investor can hardly \ncall foul.\n  All this is to say that the Pakis are hardly entitled to any sympathy \nin their national security plight in South Asia. They fought three wars \nwith a much larger adversary, India, who is pursuing a nuclear weapons \nprogram and exploded a device in 1974. By virtue of the India nuclear \nprogram being indigenous and not in violation of the terms of the \nGlenn-Symington amendment, the Indians have not been subject to the \namendment sanctions, which would not have been effective in any case \nsince the Indians received only token amounts of economic or military \nassistance from the United States.\n  But that is not the same thing as saying that United law is \ndiscriminatory in its application. Now, I indicated earlier we have 178 \nnations who have signed up and extended the nuclear nonproliferation \ntreaty, made it a permanent treaty. It has been the policy of every \nAmerican President over the past 25 years since the treaty went into \neffect to support the treaty, and we have been steadfast in that \nsupport.\n  Now, the members of the treaty deserve our trust. We have to be \ndeserving of that trust. They put their trust in us.\n  Now, how will we be keeping faith with those 178 nations meeting in \nNew York if the message that is sent is that a proliferator with a \nhistory of mendacity can receive from the United States a significant \nnumber of nuclear-weapons-delivery systems, that is, F-16's. Well, to \neven ask the question is to give the answer: The United States cannot \nbe a champion of nonproliferation on the one hand and a facilitator of \nnuclear weapons development or delivery on the other.\n  Sending F-16's to Pakistan before full realization of the history we \nlaid out in this letter would indeed be a gross violation of our \ncommitment to foster nonproliferation ethics in the world through the \nNPT and other means and would rightfully subject us to strong \ninternational criticism.\n  I am certainly not an enemy of Pakistan. I visited there. I like the \ncountry. I supported them when they were threatened in the past, such \nas during the war in Afghanistan. I want their cooperation in the fight \nagainst terrorism and drugs. But surely we have to find a way to \nsupport them in these activities without enhancing their nuclear-\nweapons-delivery systems.\n  As to the cash payments for the F-16's, we cannot ignore the fact \nthat, contrary to the grossly incorrect public statement made by \nAssistant Secretary Robin Raphel at a White House briefing on April 11, \nno payments were made by Pakistan before fiscal 1990. Sticking to the \npayment schedule of the contract until fiscal 1993 was a gamble by \nPakistan that did not pay off. Now they want to be held harmless from \nlosing their gamble.\n  Now, I want to get them their money back, if we can possibly do it. \nIt is perhaps unfortunate that U.S. officials did not disabuse the \nPakistanis of the hope that making those payments would put pressure on \nthe United States to reverse the Pressler sanctions and deliver the \nplanes. But that is no reason to turn that hope into reality right now.\n  Mr. President, there have been a number of milestones in the United \nStates-Pakistan nuclear relations. The background of this arms transfer \nscheme can be summarized by recalling a sequence of some 10 milestones \nin the history of our nonproliferation efforts in Pakistan. I guess \nmilestone 1 would involve those waivers and favors. Throughout the \n1980's, officials from the executive branch assured Congress and the \nAmerican taxpayers that billions of dollars in aid that we shipped to \nPakistan throughout that decade would shore up Pakistan's security and \nthereby act as a substantial break on Pakistan's nuclear program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert at the end of my \nremarks a list of no less than 20 such assurances to Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. GLENN. To get this aid to Pakistan, Congress had to create some \nspecial waivers for the President to invoke, discriminatory waivers \ntailored exclusively on Pakistan's behalf. There was a waiver of our \nuranium enrichment sanctions on February 10, 1982, just for Pakistan. \nThere was a waiver of our plutonium reprocessing sanctions on the same \nday, February 10, 1982, just for Pakistan. There was another waiver of \nour uranium enrichment sanctions on January 15, 1988, just for \nPakistan. There was a waiver of a nuclear procurement sanction on the \nsame day, January 15, 1988, just for Pakistan.\n  There was a waiver of our uranium enrichment sanctions on March 28, \n1990, just for Pakistan.\n  There were waiver authorities of uranium enrichment sanctions that \nCongress created but which fortunately were not exercised by the \nPresident on November 5, 1990, October 6, 1992, and September 30, 1993, \nonce again, just for Pakistan.\n  So much for the discrimination in United States policy, as though we \nare picking on Pakistan.\n  By this record, the United States has unquestionably and shamelessly \ndiscriminated on behalf of Pakistan where American law was concerned. \nThe next time I hear much complaint about the fact that the Pressler \namendment only refers to Pakistan, I can only wonder what has happened \nto our memory about these waivers and about our appreciation for that \nhistory.\n  The future of this great Republic depends upon our Nation's ability \nto learn from, not ignore, its experiences. I am tired of \ndiscrimination--all discrimination--but most especially discrimination \nin favor of proliferation. Of all the arguments that have been levied \nagainst the Pressler amendment, I have never heard anyone accuse it of \nbeing in favor of proliferation. That is more than I can say about the \ncurrent proposal.\n  Milestone 2, we title this ``Those Peaceful Nuclear Assurances.''\n  Officials from Pakistan, meanwhile, lost no effort in blanketing our \nCapital with a blizzard of peaceful nuclear assurances. My staff \nassembled an impressive collection of over 70 of these promises, \nassurances, pledges and other offerings intended to reassure America \nthat Pakistan was not just taking our aid and proceeding with its bomb, \nwhich is, of course, exactly what Pakistan was doing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record at the \nend of my remarks a collection of these assurances that was compiled by \nMichelle Fraser, an intern with the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I recall hearing the testimony of the State \nDepartment's Under Secretary James L. Buckley before the \nNonproliferation Subcommittee of the Committee on Governmental Affairs \nback on June 24, 1981. He stated:\n\n       I was assured by the ministers, I was assured by the \n     President himself that it was not the intention of the \n     Pakistani Government to develop nuclear weapons.\n\n  Mr. Buckley went on to argue how new United States aid would act to \ncurb Pakistan's nuclear ambitions. Recall that at the time those \nremarks were spoken, very few commentators or analysts were claiming \nthat Pakistan was a de facto nuclear weapons state. Pakistan did not \nhave bomb-grade uranium from its unsafeguarded enrichment plant at \nKahuta. News reports had not yet circulated that China had provided a \ndesign of a nuclear weapon to Pakistan along with other nuclear \nassistance. We had seen virtually nothing about Pakistan engaging in \nhigh-explosive testing of components of nuclear weapons.\n  Pakistan had no fleet of F-16 aircraft which could potentially be \nused as a delivery system for nuclear weapons. \n\n[[Page S 13959]]\nNo, indeed, all the above came only after or during the massive flow of \naid to Pakistan through the 1980's.\n  Despite this record, we are hearing today some of the same old \nrecycled arguments: Provide aid and it will buy us influence. Some \npeople just refuse to believe that what Pakistan really wants is both \nits bomb and our aid.\n  Milestone No. 3 we can title ``Proliferation Unbounded.'' By the mid-\n1980's, the situation was really getting out of hand. Everybody knew \nthat Pakistan's bomb program was rolling right along. This aid included \nsubstantial quantities of military assistance, even F-16 aircraft, that \nwere quite suitable for use in delivering nuclear weapons.\n  To illustrate the scope of the progress Pakistan was making on its \nbomb as we continued providing aid, Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent to print in the Record at the end of my remarks a chronology \nshowing how bad the problem was.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the record is thus quite clear. There was a \ndirect positive relationship between the flow of United States aid and \nthe progress of Pakistan's bomb program, not the negative relationship \nthat the executive repeatedly assured Congress would exist.\n  Milestone No. 4, ``Congress Steps In.'' By 1985, Congress justifiably \nhad enough. With the agreement of the executive and even the Pakistani \nGovernment, we passed a law known as the Pressler amendment to set some \nground rules to permit the resumption of aid to Pakistan.\n  That is overlooked, as my colleague Senator Pressler said on the \nfloor just a while ago; that the Pressler amendment was supposed to set \nsome ground rules to permit resumption of aid to Pakistan. First, \nPakistan must not possess a nuclear explosive device, however; and \nsecond any new aid must reduce significantly the risk that it will \npossess such a device.\n  Note how far the current legislative proposal departs from these \nresponsible standards. Not only does the proposal call for resuming \nfull economic aid and significant new arms deliveries to Pakistan \ndespite its failure to satisfy the nonpossession standard, but the aid \nis supposed to be provided even if it has no effect whatsoever upon \nreducing the risk of Pakistan getting the bomb. For those who truly \ncare about nonproliferation, this is truly a lose-lose proposition. \nWhere is the beef? There is no beef.\n  This brings me to milestone 5, the issue of the certifications that \nPakistan did not possess the bomb. I guess we could title milestone 5, \n``From Red Line to Elastic Clause.''\n  In the late 1980's, Pakistan crossed several additional red lines \ntoward acquiring the bomb. Even its top nuclear scientists boasted in \n1987 that Pakistan already possessed the bomb, and somehow Pakistan \nkept receiving its annual certification that it did not possess. As for \nthe executive's approach to the word ``possess'' through that period, I \nam reminded of a quote from a character in Lewis Carroll's ``Through \nthe Looking Glass:'' ``When I use a word,'' Humpty Dumpty said in \nrather a scornful tone, ``it means just what I choose it to mean, \nneither more or less.''\n  That is where we find ourselves in regard to defining the word \n``possess.'' It can mean so many different things.\n  There comes a time when we need to hold the line against the \ntemptation of our officials to redefine terms of law for diplomatic \nconvenience. As for the possession standard, fate would soon catch up \nwith Pakistan.\n  Milestone 6, ``A Nuclear Near Miss.'' In the summer of 1990, Pakistan \nalmost engaged in a nuclear exchange with India. If any of my \ncolleagues are skeptical about the relevance of nuclear weapons \nproliferation in South Asia to United States national security, I \nstrongly recommend they read Seymour Hersh, in an article published in \nthe New Yorker on March 29, 1993, aptly entitled ``On the Brink of \nNuclear War: How Pakistan Came Close to Dropping the Bomb--And How We \nHelped Them Get It.''\n  This article is, incidentally, also a good candidate of the \neccentricities of our system for enforcing export controls. The article \ndescribes a 1986 United States undercover operation to stop yet another \nplanned Pakistani purchase of United States nuclear-related material. \nAccording to Hersh:\n\n       The State Department's Near East Bureau was not told of the \n     planned operation, for fear that the officers there would tip \n     off the Pakistanis, as they had done in the past, by sending \n     a diplomatic protest (known as a demarche) to the Pakistani \n     Government.\n\n  Though the operation ultimately led to the highly publicized arrest \nof Mr. Arshad Z. Pervez in July 1987 on charges of trying illegally to \nbuy 25 tons of special steel used in Pakistan's uranium enrichment \nprogram, it was surely not due to much help from the regional experts \nin the State Department. In a statement related directly to our subject \ntoday, one nonproliferation official told Hersh in the article that.\n\n       ``The only thing we had going for us. . .was the Pressler \n     and Solarz amendments.''\n\n  Such accounts of our export control process only further reinforce my \nopposition to the scheme offered in the recent State authorization bill \nto abolish the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and transfer all of \nits functions to the State Department, in effect, making State the new \nnonproliferation czar.\n  Fortunately, there do appear to be some individuals left in \nGovernment, as indicated in the last quote, who treat the Pressler \namendment as a useful tool rather than an obstacle to be circumvented.\n  Milestone 7, ``Judgment Day.'' By October 1, 1990, even the State \nDepartment lawyers had enough and finally ran out of words to explain \nwhy Pakistan deserved its annual nuclear certification. President Bush \ndecided not to renew Pakistan's nuclear meal ticket. The time had \nfinally come for proliferation to start costing something.\n  Milestone 8, ``New Nuclear Assurances, This Time to Congress.'' Since \n1990, representatives from both the Bush and Clinton Administrations \nhave sought to repeal the Pressler amendment--these representatives \npromised Congress, in writing and repeatedly, that even if the Pressler \namendment were repealed, rest assured, it would remain the policy of \nthe United States to require Pakistan to satisfy the Pressler \nstandards. Furthermore, Congress was assurred by the Executive that \nwhen it came to licensing commercial arms sales, we would never, never, \nnever approve any ``upgrades'' to existing military capabilities in \nPakistan.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat this point a few samples of these assurances.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Conditions for Resuming Economic Aid to Pakistan: A Historical Review \n               of Executive Branch Assurances to Congress\n\n       April 12, 1991: President Bush sends a letter to Congress \n     accompanying the Administration's ``International Cooperation \n     Act of 1991''--the letter acknowledges an intent to repeal \n     the Pressler Amendment, but reassures Congress that: ``I will \n     continue to insist on unambiguous specific steps by Pakistan \n     in meeting nonproliferation standards, including those \n     specifically reflected in the omitted language, known as the \n     Pressler Amendment. Satisfaction of the Pressler standard \n     will remain the essential basis for exercising the national \n     interest waiver that is in the Administration's proposal in \n     order to resume economic and military assistance to \n     Pakistan.''\n       November 24, 1993: State Department spokesman Michael \n     McCurry says that: ``. . . as a matter of administration \n     policy, we will continue to apply Pressler standards'' to \n     Pakistan.\n       November 25, 1993: Assistant Secretary of State Wendy \n     Sherman is quoted as having said in a letter to Congress \n     accompanying the Clinton Administration's new foreign \n     assistance bill that: ``The absence of any country-specific \n     language in this draft should not be interpreted as \n     constituting a change in U.S. policy toward any country.''\n       November 26, 1993: After the Clinton Administration \n     introduced its new foreign aid legislation would repeal the \n     Pressler Amendment, the State Department issued the following \n     statement: ``Even if a new foreign assistance act without \n     specific language on Pakistan were passed, we would continue \n     to apply Pressler standards to Pakistan.''\n       November 30, 1993: State Department spokeswoman, Christine \n     Shelley, tells reporters that despite the Administration's \n     efforts to drop the Pressler Amendment, ``. . . satisfaction \n     of the Pressler standard will remain the essential basis for \n     exercising any national interest waiver and for resuming \n     economic and military assistance, including any decision by \n     the U.S. Government to sell or transfer military technology \n     to Pakistan . . . What we have indicated is that Pakistan \n     would continue to be subject to sanctions \n\n[[Page S 13960]]\n     along the lines of the Pressler amendment under the administration's \n     new proposal.''\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Just as the United States expects Pakistan to comply with \nits nuclear assurances, I think it is fair for the Congress to insist \non the Executive honoring its own assurances to Congress when it comes \nto implementing our nuclear nonproliferation policy.\n  Milestone 9, ``Some Early Signs of Restraint.'' Although Pakistan's \nbomb program is no doubt continuing, and it is indeed maintaining its \nnuclear and missile cooperation with China, it may have also acted to \nhalt production of highly-enriched uranium I would like to inform my \ncolleagues today that this is the most significant restraint I have \nseen in some 15 years in Pakistan's nuclear program--the bad news is \nthat Pakistan's bomb program has not disappeared from the face of the \nearth, the good news is that it is not expanding as rapidly as we once \nthought, and the news which most Americans will probably be most \ngratified to hear is that this first demonstration of genuine nuclear \nrestraint by Pakistan did not cost the American taxpayer a red cent--it \nis due entirely to the effect of the Pressler amendment. This is the \nlaw that detractors continue to tar as having been ``ineffective'' or \n``inflexible.''\n  Supporters of the Pressler amendment make no apologies about standing \nup for this ``inflexible'' law. After all, my dictionary defines this \nterm as follows, ``. . . of an unyielding temper, purpose, will, etc.'' \nTo supporters of nonproliferation generally, the alternative of \n``passive accommodation'' has little attraction indeed. Thus we have no \nquarrel with the charge that the Pressler amendment has been \ninflexible. Let us be glad it has.\n  Unfortunately, this term is not quite accurate, given the significant \nflexibility that the law has shown in recent years to allow the \nfollowing to occur in spite of Pakistan's continued violations of that \nlaw: First, the United States still issues licenses to export \ncommercial munitions and spare parts to Pakistan, including spares for \nPakistan's nuclear-weapon delivery vehicle, the F-16; second, United \nStates military visits and joint training exercises continue to take \nplace; third, United States aid with respect to agriculture, \ncounterterrorism, nutrition, population control, literacy, advancement \nof women, health and medicine, environmental protection, disaster \nrelief, and many other areas can continue to flow to Pakistan via \nnongovernmental organizations; fourth, the Export-Import Bank also has \nextended loans, grants, and guarantees to Pakistan; fifth, PL-480 \nagricultural aid continues; sixth, arms control verification assistance \ncontinues (a seismic station); seventh, millions of dollars of aid in \nthe ``pipeline'' as of October 1990 was allowed to flow to Pakistan; \neighth, cooperation on peacekeeping is continuing; and ninth, Pakistan \ncontinues to receive billions of dollars in development assistance via \nmultilateral lending agencies.\n  Also under this so-called inflexible law, Pakistan has used almost \n$200 million in FMS credits to fund the purchase of 11 F-16's between \nfiscal years 1989 and 1993, of which about $150 million were used after \nthe Pressler sanctions were invoked. And the United States continues to \nreview and license exports of dual-use goods and technology to \nPakistan.\n  Milestone 10, ``Today's Debate.'' Which brings us here today: a \nmilestone of its own in the history of United States efforts to grapple \nwith Pakistan's bomb. It is not so much a milestone as a crossroads--do \nwe stand up for a strong nonproliferation policy, or do we tell \nPakistan and the rest of the world that proliferation pays, in a big \nway?\n  Here we stand, debating a proposal which I think is appropriate to \ncall, ``Operation Deja Vu''--a scheme to ship, under the false flags of \n``fairness'' and helping out an old friend, several more hundred \nmillion dollars of military equipment to Pakistan. Who knows, the \nargument goes, it may even lead to some sentiment of good will that may \nsomeday serve the cause of nonproliferation. There never was a better \nillustration a policy based on a triumph of hope over experience, than \nthere has been with respect to United States policies toward Pakistan's \nbomb.\n  Why in the world, given the chronology I have just reviewed, should \nany one Member of this August Chamber believe for a single moment that \nthe delivery of this lethal military gear will have any effect \nwhatsoever on restraining Pakistan's bomb program? Why should we be \nunconditionally lifting all economic sanctions on Pakistan? Has anybody \nreally even considered the signal such a gesture would send to \nproliferators around the world?\n  This gear that we would transfer under this proposal is, by the way, \nnot only lethal, but it could well trigger a regional arms race that \nwould destabilize the whole balance of power in South Asia. The Indian \ngovernment has already said it would not simply stand by and watch \nhundreds of millions of dollars in new military gear flow from the \nUnited States to Pakistan. We are talking about delivering upgrades for \nPakistan's nuclear weapon delivery vehicles. Upgrades for Cobra \nhelicopters. Additional P-3 antisubmarine aircraft. All kinds of \ntactical missiles: Harpoons, AIMs, TOW's, and battlefield rockets. Over \na quarter billion dollars' worth of such items. To say the shipment of \nthese goods will have no political or military consequences in South\n Asia is simply wrong. But the proposal does not only address new \nmilitary transfers.\n\n  It is the unconditional lifting of economic sanctions, also. The \nproposal would also lift unconditionally all economic sanctions against \nPakistan under the Pressler amendment, even though Pakistan is still in \nviolation of that amendment. It seems reasonable that before we rush \noff to provide United States Government guarantees for private loans to \nPakistan, we should surely first take a close look at the potential \nrisks and costs that will be borne by the American taxpayer who will, \nunder the current proposal, underwrite those hundreds of millions of \ndollars in private United States investment in Pakistan--a country \nwhose once-impressive leading city is now virtually off-limits to \nforeign visitors because it has become a battleground of urban \nterrorism. Editorials in Pakistani newspapers are themselves asking if \nPakistan can survive in such a climate of domestic unrest.\n  Economic aid might also not quite be the peaceful activity that some \nmight believe it is. For years, our intelligence experts have been \naware of the potential role that economic assistance can play in \nassisting a country to acquire the bomb. Then-CIA Director James \nWoolsey, for example, stated the following in a written reply to a \nquestion after a hearing of the Governmental Affairs Committee on \nFebruary 24, 1993:\n\n       Loans and grants from both bilateral and multilateral aid \n     agencies free money for Pakistan to spend on its nuclear \n     program . . . these untied funds helped finance civilian \n     imports, freeing an equivalent amount of funds to spend on \n     the nuclear program.\n\n  No, unconditionally lifting economic sanctions on Pakistan is not a \nneutral benign act. It is an action that conflicts with, rather than \npromotes, our nonproliferation goals. Providing such assistance will \nnot give Pakistan a free market. It surely does not have such a market \ntoday. Indeed, the Heritage Foundation recently issued a survey called \n``The Index of Economic Freedom'' which placed Pakistan's market in the \ncategory, ``Mostly Not Free.'' As for foreign economic aid, here is \nwhat the study had to say about past aid to Pakistan:\n\n       Much of this aid has been squandered in economically \n     useless projects, and Pakistan has been unwilling to adopt \n     significant economic reforms.\n\n  Yet proponents of lifting economic sanctions still seem to believe--\ndespite both facts and reason to the contrary--that this is a great \nidea. That it will serve our economic interests. That it will \ndiscourage proliferation.\n  All of this I feel is utter nonsense. The aid will only inspire the \nflow of American tax dollars out of the wallets of U.S. citizens to a \ncountry determined to have both the bomb and U.S. aid. I think that is \nthe wrong course to go.\n  Now to look at the F-16's for a moment.\n  I have examined the list of items that would be shipped off to \nPakistan under this proposal and find that it actually includes \nupgrades--that is right, reliability upgrades--to the engines for \nPakistan's F-16 nuclear weapon delivery vehicles. So here we are, \nwaving \n\n[[Page S 13961]]\nour finger at Pakistan's bomb program, while bending over backward to \nassist Pakistan directly to deliver such weapons. With due respect to \nmy colleague from Colorado and to a few offices in the Executive who \nsupport this scheme, there is simply no justification for such a \ntransfer that serves our nonproliferation interests. None.\n  I have heard it often said that basic ``fairness'' requires us to \ndeliver this equipment since Pakistan already ``paid'' for it.\n  What exactly did Pakistan actually pay for? Pakistan surely did not \npay cash for all of these goods--a good part of their purchases were \nfinanced by United States taxpayers by means of foreign military sales \ncredits, many of them, by the way were used well after sanctions came \ninto effect in October 1990. All of the P-3 aircraft that Pakistan \nwants to use for antisubmarine operations, for example, had an FMF \nfunding source. In February 1994, I regret to report, Pakistan engaged \nin joint naval exercises with Iran--by at least one account, P-3 \naircraft were used in those exercises. Why are we even considering \nshipping antisubmarine aircraft to a country that engages in joint \nmilitary exercises with a terrorist state--not just any run-of-the-mill \nterrorist state, but a terrorist state that our own Secretary of State \nhas declared is pursuing a crash program to acquire nuclear weapons?\n  The proposal would also upgrade Pakistan's Cobra helicopters--\nevidently abandoning our current policy of not\n upgrading Pakistan's military capabilities. This assistance too is \nfunded by FMF credits. How about tactical missile systems? The Harpoon \nantiship, TOW missiles, AIM-9L air-to-air missiles, and 2.75-inch \nrockets in this little package are also funded via the FMF route--\npresumably these missiles are not exclusively for peaceful purposes, \nexcept perhaps by Pakistan's definition of the phrase.\n\n  Even many of the engine upgrades for Pakistan's F-16 nuclear weapon \ndelivery vehicle were paid for using FMF money. Eleven of the twenty-\neight F-16's that Pakistan ordered, but which could not be delivered \ndue to Pakistan's noncompliance with the Pressler amendment, were \nfinanced with FMF money. Recall that of the $199 million available in \nFMF credits for the eleven planes, Pakistan used only a quarter of \nthese credits by the time sanctions were invoked in October 1990. They \nused the remaining three-quarters after sanctions were in place. As for \nthe remaining 17 planes, they were paid for in cash--of these payments, \nhowever, over $600 million out of a total $658 million were paid by \nPakistan after sanctions were invoked in October 1990. In short, they \nwere paying for planes they knew they were not qualified to receive.\n  Besides the issue of money, why should we help Pakistan to improve \nits nuclear weapon delivery capability? My staff has brought to my \nattention a major study performed by Stanford University's \ndistinguished Center for International Security and Arms Control in \n1991 entitled, ``Assessing Ballistic Missile Proliferation and Its \nControl.'' Here is what the Stanford study had to say about Pakistan's \nF-16's:\n\n       Pakistan is widely believed to have either already \n     developed nuclear warheads or to be on the brink of acquiring \n     them. Pakistani F-16 aircraft could be effective nuclear-\n     delivery vehicles even if Pakistan's nuclear warheads are \n     large and heavy.\n\n  Now that quote is significant enough to leave little doubt about the \ncapabilities of this aircraft; indeed, they are nuclear-capable in our \nown inventory. But it is also interesting that at least three officials \nof the current administration, including Secretary of Defense Perry, \nwere listed as participants in that study.\n  I am reminded also of a passage from Seymour Hersh's article in the \nMarch 1993 issue of the New Yorker. Writing about the near nuclear war \nbetween Pakistan and India in 1990, Hersh writes:\n\n       The American intelligence community noticed an intense \n     increase in Pakistani radar activity early in the year. \n     Earlier reports showed that the Pakistani Air Force, working \n     closely with officials from Pakistan's nuclear-weapons \n     program, had stepped up its F-16 training to practice what \n     seemed to be the dropping of a nuclear bomb. Further \n     intelligence, from Germany, reported that the Pakistanis had \n     designed a nuclear warhead that could be fitted under the \n     wing of an F-16, and that the design had gone through a \n     series of wind-tunnel tests. Pakistan was also reported to \n     have learned to program its in-flight computer system to \n     provide the correct flight path for a nuclear-bomb run.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that several quotes relating to Pakistan's F-\n16's be printed at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 4.)\n  Mr. GLENN. So now we are discussing shipping over some more spare \nparts for these nuclear weapon delivery vehicles. Here is what \nPakistan's federal minister for defense production, Mir Hazar Khan \nBijarani, said in an interview in 1992 concerning the various ways the \nPressler amendment has been interpreted with respect to Pakistan's F-\n16's:\n\n       We did face tremendous problems in acquiring spare parts \n     [for F-16's] after the suspension of U.S. military \n     assistance, but now we have overcome this problem as the \n     Americans have lifted [the] ban on commercial sales.\n\n  See how this works. First we relax commercial sales of spare parts \nfor Pakistan's nuclear weapon delivery vehicles. And now, here we are \ndebating whether to provide on a government-to-government basis some \ngear to upgrade Pakistan's nuclear weapon delivery vehicles.\n  Let us not be blind to what we are proposing to do: after years of \nfighting for nuclear nonproliferation, the Congress under this proposal \nwould put on the statute books America's first nuclear proliferation \nlaw. Rest assured, if this proposal passes, America will not be the \nonly country with other nuclear proliferation laws on their own books. \nThe race will be on to cash in on proliferation, rather than to prevent \nit. This is an extremely dangerous course and one which the Congress \nshould summarily reject as contrary to the national security interests \nof the United States. It is an embarrassment to this legislature even \nto be debating this extremely ill-advised scheme.\n\n\n                             what is fair?\n\n  I must come back to the basic question: what exactly is fair? Is it \nfair for Pakistan to have given the United States solemn assurances \nthat it proceeded to break with impunity?\n  Recently, Prime Minister Bhutto declared during her recent visit to \nthe United States that Pakistan had kept its contract with\n America. I will repeat this: that Pakistan had kept its contract with \nAmerica.\n\n  Some of us might recall when Prime Minister Bhutto addressed a joint \nsession of Congress back on June 7, 1989, when the Prime Minister \nsolemnly stated the following:\n\n       Speaking for Pakistan, I can declare that we do not \n     possess, nor do we intend to make a nuclear device. [Extended \n     applause.] That is our policy.\n\n  Mr. President, that was Pakistan's contract with America. That is \nwhat United States taxpayers were being told about Pakistan's bomb \nprogram. It is that contract, I submit, that Pakistan has proven so \nutterly incapable of fulfilling. Yet here we stand, debating fairness. \nThe absurdity of the proposal that is the focus of this debate simply \ndefies description.\n  I read recently a statement from Mr. John Malott, then the interim \ndirector of the State Department's South Asia bureau, which appeared in \nan AFP wire service report on May 16, 1993. Here is what Mr. Malott had \nto say about the fairness issue:\n\n       We kept our part of the bargain but Pakistan let us down by \n     crossing the line in 1990 . . . we had promised Pakistan \n     billions and billions of dollars if that line was not \n     crossed.\n\n  So much for what is fair. Mr. Malott put it exactly right: Pakistan \nbroke its contract with America. It is now paying a price that should \nonly go up with time, not down. To lower the price of proliferation is \nto condone proliferation. That is not our policy. That is not our \ndomestic law. That is not at all consistent with our solemn \ninternational treaty commitments.\n That is how we should want other countries to treat proliferants.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to restate very briefly the theme I used in \nstarting out. This is not about fairness. We have been fair. Pakistan \nhas been unfair with us.\n  The issue here is, are we serious about nonproliferation in the \nworld? Are we a world leader in nonproliferation or are we not? Do we \nhave a proliferation policy or is it one that only \n\n[[Page S 13962]]\ncomes out for press conference purposes or at time of political \ncampaigns?\n  We took the lead in getting 178 nations to sign the nonproliferation \ntreaty. They put their trust in us. They also trusted that there would \nbe sanctions against people who were not willing to cooperate, if they \nwere egregious violators of what we thought was right.\n  We have seen Pakistan be the most egregious violator. We have seen \nthem be uncooperative with regard to nuclear matters. They have not \njoined NPT. They have not gone by NPT rules. They have violated every \nnorm of diplomatic behavior in telling us things that were not true and \nthat we knew were not true. I do not think that kind of mendacity \nshould be rewarded by sending the material that is proposed by the \namendment.\n  These have been nothing but untruths told to us through the years, \nover and over again. I will not read those off again. It seems to me, \nif we are to deserve the trust of the nations that signed up under NPT \nand followed our leadership, then I believe we must refuse to approve \nthis amendment. I know the Senator from California will have a proposal \nin the morning for a substitute amendment and we will look at it in the \nmorning and see whether we feel we can support it or not. But as for \nthe amendment we are debating tonight, it is one I just cannot support \nand I urge my colleagues not to support it.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     U.S. Aid Policies and Pakistan's Bomb: What were we trying to \n                              accomplish?\n\n       Letters to Congress from Presidents Reagan & Bush, 1985-\n     1989, required under Sec. 620E(e) of Foreign Assistance Act \n     (Pressler Amendment):\n       ``The proposed United States assistance program for \n     Pakistan remains extremely important in reducing the risk \n     that Pakistan will develop and ultimately possess such a \n     device. I am convinced that our security relationship and \n     assistance program are the most effective means available for \n     us to dissuade Pakistan from acquiring nuclear explosive \n     devices. Our assistance program is designed to help Pakistan \n     address its substantial and legitimate security needs, \n     thereby reducing incentives and creating disincentives for \n     Pakistani acquisition of nuclear explosives.''--President \n     George Bush, 10/5/89; President Ronald Reagan, 11/18/89; 12/\n     17/87; 10/27/86; & 11/25/85.\n       President George Bush, letter to Congress (addressed to J. \n     Danforth Quayle as President of the Senate), 12 April 1991, \n     urging abandonment of Pressler certification requirement:\n       ``. . . my intention is to send the strongest possible \n     message to Pakistan and other potential proliferators that \n     nonproliferation is among the highest priorities of my \n     Administration's foreign policy, irrespective of whether such \n     a policy is required by law.''\n       Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Teresita Schaffer, \n     testimony before House subcommittee, 2 August 1989:\n       ``None of the F-16's Pakistan already owns or is about to \n     purchase is configured for nuclear delivery . . . a Pakistan \n     with a credible conventional deterrent will be less motivated \n     to purchase a nuclear weapons capability.''\n       Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Arthur Hughes, \n     testimony before House subcommittee, 2 August 1989:\n       ``Finally, we believe that past and continued American \n     support for Pakistan's conventional defense reduces the \n     likelihood that Pakistan will feel compelled to cross the \n     nuclear threshold.''\n       Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Robert Peck, testimony \n     before House subcommittee, 17 February 1988:\n       ``We believe that the improvements in Pakistan's \n     conventional military forces made possible by U.S. assistance \n     and the U.S. security commitment our aid program symbolizes \n     have had a significant influence on Pakistan's decision to \n     forego the acquisition of nuclear weapons.''\n       Special Ambassador at Large Richard Kennedy, testimony \n     before two House subcommittees, 22 October 1987:\n       ``We have made it clear that Pakistan must show restraint \n     in its nuclear program if it expects us to continue providing \n     security assistance.''\n       Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy, testimony \n     before Senate subcommittee, 18 March 1987:\n       ``Our assistance relationship is designed to advance both \n     our non-proliferation and our strategic objectives relating \n     to Afghanistan. Development of a close and reliable security \n     partnership with Pakistan gives Pakistan an alternative to \n     nuclear weapons to meet its legitimate security needs and \n     strengthens our influence on Pakistan's nuclear decision \n     making. Shifting to a policy of threats and public ultimata \n     would in our view decrease, not increase our ability to \n     continue to make a contribution to preventing a nuclear arms \n     race in South Asia. Undermining the credibility of the \n     security relationship with the U.S. would itself create \n     incentives for Pakistan to ignore our concerns and push \n     forward in the direction of nuclear weapons acquisition.''\n       Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Howard Schaffer, \n     testimony before House subcommittee 6 February 1984:\n       ``The assistance program also contributes to U.S. nuclear \n     non-proliferation goals. We believe strongly that a program \n     of support which enhances Pakistan's sense of security helps \n     remove the principal underlying incentive for the acquisition \n     of a nuclear weapons capability. The Government of Pakistan \n     understands our deep concern over this issue. We have made \n     clear that the relationship between our two countries, and \n     the program of military and economic assistance on which it \n     rests, are ultimately inconsistent with Pakistan's \n     development of a nuclear explosive device. President Zia has \n     stated publicly that Pakistan will not manufacture a nuclear \n     explosives device.''\n       Special Ambassador at Large Richard Kennedy, testimony \n     before two House subcommittees, 1 November 1983:\n       ``By helping friendly nations to address legitimate \n     security concerns, we seek to reduce incentives for the \n     acquisition of nuclear weapons. The provision of security \n     assistance and the sale of military equipment can be major \n     components of efforts along these lines. Development of \n     security ties to the U.S. can strengthen a country's \n     confidence in its ability to defend itself without nuclear \n     weapons. At the same time, the existence of such a \n     relationship enhances our credibility when we seek to \n     persuade that country to forego [sic] nuclear arm . . . We \n     believe that strengthening Pakistan's conventional military \n     capability serves a number of important U.S. interests, \n     including non-proliferation. At the same time, we have made \n     clear to the government of Pakistan that efforts to acquire \n     nuclear explosives would jeopardize our security assistance \n     program.''\n       Statement by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Harry \n     Marshall, 12 September 1983, before International Nuclear Law \n     Association, San Francisco.\n       ``U.S. assistance has permitted Pakistan to strengthen its \n     conventional defensive capability. This serves to bolster its \n     stability and thus reduce its motivation for acquiring \n     nuclear explosives.''\n       President Ronald Reagan, Report to Congress pursuant to \n     Sec. 601 of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act (``601 \n     Report''), for calendar year 1982:\n       ``Steps were taken to strengthen the U.S. security \n     relationship with Pakistan with the objective of addressing \n     that country's security needs and thereby reducing any \n     motivation for acquiring nuclear explosives.''\n       ``President Ronald Reagan, Report to Congress pursuant to \n     Sec. 601 of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act (``601 \n     Report''), for calendar year 1981:\n       ``Military assistance by the United States and the \n     establishment of a new security relationship with Pakistan \n     should help to counterpart its possible motivations toward \n     acquiring nuclear weapons . . . Moreover, help from the \n     United States in strengthening Pakistan's conventional \n     military capabilities would offer the best available means \n     for counteracting possible motivations toward acquiring \n     nuclear weapons.''\n       Assistant Secretary of State James Malone, address before \n     Atomic Industrial Forum, San Francisco, 1 December 1981:\n       ``We believe that this assistance--which is in the \n     strategic interest of the United States--will make a \n     significant contribution to the well-being and security of \n     Pakistan and that it will be recognized as such by that \n     government.

Pakistan, \n     moreover, will be obligated by contract not to modify its new \n     acquisitions without the approval of the United States.''\n       Views attributed to German Intelligence Agency (BND), in \n     Der Spiegel, 24 July 1989:\n       ``The Pakistanis have secretly planned to use the fighter \n     aircraft as a delivery system for their bomb. According to a \n     report by the Federal Intelligence Service (BND), relevant \n     tests have already been successfully concluded. The BND has \n     reported to the Chancellor's Office that, using an F-16 \n     model, the Pakistanis have made wind tunnel tests and have \n     designed to shell of the bomb in a way that allows them to \n     install it underneath the wings. At the same time, the \n     detonating mechanism has been improved, so that the weapons \n     can now be used. . . According to the BND report, the \n     Pakistanis long ago found out how to program the F-16 on-\n     board computer to carry out the relevant flight maneuvers in \n     dropping the bomb. According to the report from Pullach [BND \n     headquarters], they also know how to make the electronic \n     contact between the aircraft and the bomb.''\n       Sen. John Glenn, letter to President Ronald Reagan, 5 March \n     1987:\n       ``And I believe we should continue to try to provide \n     assistance to the Afghans. But if the price that must now be \n     paid is acceptance of Pakistani nuclear weapons production \n     along with the continued provision of a `make in the U.S.A.' \n     delivery system (F-16s), a combination certain to ultimately \n     erode the national security of the United States and some of \n     its closest allies, then the price is too high.''\n       Undersecretary of State James Buckley, testimony before the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 12 November 1981:\n       [Sen. Hayakawa]--``Do the F-16's provide Pakistan with a \n     delivery system for nuclear devices?''\n       [Buckley]--``Yes, they would. But by the same token, this \n     is not the only aircraft that would have that capability. My \n     understanding is that the Mirage III currently possessed by \n     Pakistan, would have the capability of delivering a small \n     nuclear device.''\n       E.F. Von Marbod, Director of Defense Security Assistance \n     Agency, testimony before two House Subcommittees, 16 \n     September 1981:\n       [Solarz]--``I gather the F-16's are technically capable of \n     carrying nuclear weapons. Will the F-16's supplied Pakistan \n     be able to carry nuclear weapons?''\n       [Von Marbod]--``Mr. Solarz, all nuclear capabilities will \n     be deleted from these F-16's. All wiring to the pylons, all \n     computer software programs that manage the hardware stores \n     and all cockpit controls that are nuclear-related.''\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to \nthe President regarding the Pakistani situation that I sent on April 19 \nbe printed in the Record, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                            Committee on Governmental Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 19, 1995.\n     President William Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to express my concern \n     about the direction of U.S. nonproliferation policy in South \n     Asia in the wake of the visit last week of Prime Minister \n     Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan. Press reports and commentary \n     regarding her visit and the joint press conference you held \n     with her have been singularly devoid of information on the \n     history of the Pressler Amendment, the activities of Pakistan \n     in the nuclear area, and the circumstances surrounding the \n     two 1989 contracts for the sale of F-16s. Without such \n     understanding, it is easy to conclude that an injustice has \n     been perpetrated upon Pakistan, and that to rectify it, a \n     major adjustment in our nonproliferation policy must be made. \n     The truth, however, is much more complicated, and the problem \n     does not lend itself to easy resolution.\n       To understand how we have arrived at this difficult state \n     of affairs with Pakistan, in which they have paid $658 \n     million in cash and used $200 million in credits for 28 F-16s \n     but cannot have them delivered, let us review some history.\n       In the mid-70s, Congress became concerned about increasing \n     evidence of international nuclear trade in dangerous \n     technologies associated with producing nuclear weapon \n     materials. A number of countries, including but not limited \n     to Pakistan, South Korea, Brazil, and Taiwan were actively \n     engaged in seeking such technologies, and suppliers such as \n     France and Germany seemed prepared to meet the demand. In an \n     attempt to dampen such activity, in 1976 and 1977, Congress \n     enacted what is now called the Glenn/Symington amendment to \n     the Foreign Assistance Act which provided that countries \n     importing or exporting such dangerous technologies under \n     certain conditions would be cut off from U.S. economic and \n     military assistance. This law was universal in its \n     application and was not directed specifically toward \n     Pakistan. Nonetheless, in 1979, after much information became \n     available about illegal Pakistani activities involving the \n     smuggling of\n      design information and equipment related to nuclear \n     enrichment, President Carter invoked the Glenn/Symington \n     Amendment to cut off the Pakistanis. After the war in \n     Afghanistan broke out, attempts by the Carter \n     Administration to restore some assistance to Pakistan in \n     return for restraint on their nuclear program were \n     rebuffed by the Pakistanis.\n       When the Reagan Administration arrived, aid to Pakistan and \n     the Mujahideen was high up on the administration's foreign \n     policy agenda, and the repeal of the Glenn/Symington \n     Amendment was suggested during Congressional consultations. \n     This was rejected. Instead, a proposal was made and adopted \n     into law that allowed the President to resume aid to Pakistan \n     for six years despite its violations of ``Section 669'' of \n     the Glenn/Symington Amendment (relating the uranium \n     enrichment activities). President Reagan used this authority \n     in 1982 and also issued a waiver under ``Section 670'' of the \n     amendment (relating to reprocessing activities) to exempt \n     Pakistan indefinitely from the cutoff provisions of that \n     section of the Glenn/Symington legislation as well/ (He could \n     not do the same under Section 669 unless he had ``reliable \n     assurances'' that the Pakistanis were not developing nuclear \n     weapons, and such assurances were clearly not available). \n     Thus, a specific waiver for Pakistan was created (and has \n     been subsequently renewed five times) that allowed them to \n     escape from the sanctions imposed by U.S. law for \n     proliferators. This has been done for no other country that I \n     am aware of.\n       Nonetheless, Congress was unwilling to give a complete \n     blank check to Pakistan, and stipulated in the waiver \n     legislation that Pakistan would still be cut off if it \n     received or exploded a nuclear device. In addition, Congress \n     stipulated that an annual report would be provided on \n     Pakistan's nuclear activities so that Congress could confirm \n     that U.S. assistance was indeed inhibiting Pakistan's bomb \n     program as was confidently assumed by Reagan Administration \n     officials.\n       Those reports, along with supplementary intelligence \n     information, revealed that there was no effect whatsoever on \n     the pace or direction of the Pakistani bomb program. The \n     Pakistanis continued to say publicly that they had no nuclear \n     weapons program, and continually lied to U.S. authorities \n     whenever questioned. Indeed, then-President Zia and the then-\n     head of the Pakistani Atomic Energy Commission, Munir Khan, \n     both lied directly to me during my visit to Islamabad in 1984 \n     when I asked them about information I had concerning their \n     nuclear program.\n       The result of all this mendacity, plus ongoing information \n     that the Pakistani program was progressing, was the enactment \n     of the Pressler Amendment, passed in 1985, which was designed \n     to draw a new line in the sand regarding the extent of U.S. \n     forbearance of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. The \n     amendment required the U.S. President to certify annually \n     that Pakistan did\n      not ``possess'' a nuclear explosive device in order for \n     assistance to continue, and that such assistance would \n     ``significantly reduce the risk'' that Pakistan would \n     possess such a device. Please note that the argument about \n     the Pressler Amendment being unfair because it applies \n     only to Pakistan is completely disingenuous because it \n     ignores the fact that Pressler was created to shape \n     further the unique, special exemption from U.S. \n     nonproliferation law given to Pakistan years earlier.\n       It has been reported that C.I.A. officials who were privy \n     to intelligence information concerning the Pakistani program \n     were skeptical, beginning from 1987 on, that the President \n     could make the appropriate certifications under Pressler to \n     allow aid to continue. Statements from high ranking Pakistani \n     officials around this time suggested that they had the bomb \n     within their grasp. Nonetheless, President Reagan in 1987 and \n     1988, and President Bush in 1989 made those certifications. \n     It has also been reported that President Bush told the \n     Pakistanis in 1989 that he would be unable to make the \n     certification in 1990.\n       Now, the contracts for the sale of 28 F-16s was signed in \n     1989, the year Pakistan was ostensibly warned that there \n     would be no further certifications that would allow them to \n     receive military equipment from the United States. The first \n     cash payment (of $50 million) was made at the beginning of FY \n     1990. Subsequent to the cutoff, which took effect in October, \n     1990, Pakistan continued to send periodic payments for the \n     manufacture of F-16s, i.e., $150 million in FY 1991, $243 \n     million in FY 1992, and $215 million in FY 1993, for a total \n     of $658 million.\n       Why did they continue to send money when U.S. law would not \n     enable them to receive the planes? This is a question only \n     they can answer. But it is not unlike an investor buying the \n     stock of a company whose assets are under a lien in the hope \n     that the lien will somehow be removed. If it doesn't get \n     removed, the investor can hardly call ``foul''.\n\n[[Page S 13968]]\n\n       All this is not to say that the Pakistanis are not entitled \n     to any sympathy in their national security plight in South \n     Asia. They have fought three wars with a much larger \n     adversary, India, who is also pursuing a nuclear weapons \n     program and exploded a device in 1974. By virtue of India's \n     nuclear program being indigenous and therefore not in \n     violation of the terms of the Glenn/Symington Amendment, the \n     Indians have not been subject to the amendment's sanctions \n     (which would not have been effective in any case, since the \n     Indians received only token amounts of economic or military \n     assistance from the U.S.). That is not the same thing as \n     saying that U.S. law is discriminatory in its application.\n       As I write this, more than 170 nations are meeting in New \n     York to determine whether and for how long to extend the \n     Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It has been the policy of \n     every American President over the past twenty five years \n     since the Treaty went into effect to support the Treaty and \n     we have been steadfast in that support. As a result, we have \n     every right to ask, as you have done, that the members of the \n     Treaty vote for indefinite extension. The NPT has been a \n     success because we have cooperated with those Parties to the \n     Treaty who have taken their nonproliferation commitments \n     seriously, just as we are taking our own commitments \n     seriously by reducing our stockpiles of weapons and engaging \n     in a moratorium on testing.\n       How will we be keeping faith with those 170+ nations \n     meeting in New York if the message we send is that a \n     proliferator with a history of mendacity can receive from the \n     United States a significant number of nuclear weapons \n     delivery systems (F-16s)? To ask the question is to give the \n     answer.\n       The U.S. cannot be a champion of nonproliferation on the \n     one hand and a facilitator of nuclear weapons development or \n     delivery on the other. To send F-16s to Pakistan with full \n     realization of the history I have laid out in this letter \n     would be a gross violation of our commitment to foster a \n     nonproliferation ethic in the world through the NPT and other \n     means, and would rightfully subject us to strong \n     international criticism.\n       I am not an enemy of Pakistan, and I have supported them \n     when they have been threatened in the past, such as during \n     the war in Afghanistan. And I, along with you, Mr. President, \n     want their cooperation in the fight against terrorism and \n     drugs. Surely we ought to be able to find a way to support \n     them in these activities without giving them a nuclear \n     weapons delivery system. I am prepared to discuss with you or \n     your representatives various options in which such support \n     might be provided without undermining our nonproliferation \n     standing and efforts around the world.\n       As to the cash payments for the F-16s, we cannot ignore the \n     fact that, contrary to the grossly incorrect public statement \n     made by Assistant Secretary Robin Raphel at a White House \n     briefing on April 11, no payments were made by Pakistan \n     before FY1990. Sticking to the payment schedule of the \n     contract until FY1993 was a gamble by Pakistan that didn't \n     pay off, and now they want to be held harmless from losing \n     their gamble. It is perhaps unfortunate that U.S. officials \n     did not disabuse the Pakistanis of the hope that making those \n     payments would put pressure on the U.S. to reverse the \n     Pressler sanctions and deliver the planes, but that is no \n     reason to turn that hope into reality now.\n       In closing, Mr. President, I urge again that in finding \n     ways to improve our relations with Pakistan, we not lose \n     sight of the importance of keeping good relations with the \n     nonproliferators of the world. They have a large claim on our \n     loyalty.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       John Glenn,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I defer to the distinguished Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank my colleague and I yield 10 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                        environmental provisions\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I would like to briefly draw the attention \nof my colleagues to the funding measures that the foreign operations \nappropriation bill recommends with regard to our participation in \nimportant ongoing international environmental efforts. In particular, I \nwish to refer to the allocation of $50 million that have been earmarked \nfor the Global Environment Facility, commonly referred to as the GEF. \nAt the outset, let me highlight that while this amount falls short of \nthe $110 million that the administration had requested, it represents a \n66-percent increase from the amount that the House of Representatives \nhad recommended. This important increase is the result of the joint \nefforts of Democrats and Republicans, who in a spirit of bipartisanship \njoined their efforts to increase funding for international \nenvironmental activities.\n  Mr. President, the GEF was recently restructured and now represents \nall the good that can come out of sound international efforts on the \nenvironment. The committee report that accompanies the foreign \noperations bill correctly emphasizes the need to maintain U.S. \nleadership in this vital organization, which seeks to combat ocean \npollution, ozone depletion, loss of biodiversity, and other serious \nthreats to the Earth's environment. Specifically, the GEF aims to \nassist developing countries in meeting the\n new challenges of sustainable development.\n\n  We are now at a time where the impacts of global change are starting \nto have significant effects on our environment and the United States \njust cannot afford to relinquish its leadership role. This point was \nhighlighted in a recent editorial piece in the New York Times, which \nenumerated the mounting evidence experts now have on the depletion of \nthe ozone layer and other climate change factors. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of this article be included at the end of my \nremarks. We should not be reducing our commitment to a healthy global \nenvironment at such a critical time.\n  I also note that the Senate Appropriations Committee has increased \nfrom the House bill the amount that will be dedicated to international \norganizations and programs, which also includes U.S. efforts to promote \nsustainable development, and particularly the protection of the global \nenvironment. The United States has been an active partner in the \nactivities of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and the \nMontreal Protocol on the Depletion of the Ozone Layer. The \nadministration has highlighted the fact that the Montreal protocol fund \nis a low-cost and very effective shield to protect the health of our \ncitizens and our environment. The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate \nChange addresses the problem of climate change with policies that are \nboth good for the environment and good for the economy. The committee \nreport recognizes the importance of these organizations and programs \nand urges that adequate funding be provided for these important \nactivities.\n  The need to protect biodiversity is also highlighted as a priority \nand the report recognizes that global biological wealth is vital to \nU.S. security and key to our own agricultural and pharmaceutical \ninterests. The report thus urges AID to remain active in regions that \nare significant for biological diversity. I support that commitment.\n  Finally, the foreign operations bill recognizes the key role played \nby the U.N. Environment Programme [UNEP], by requiring that any \nreduction in the amounts made available for UNEP shall not exceed the \npercentage by which the total amount appropriated for international \noperations and programs is reduced. UNEP provides a means to pursue \ninternational environmental standards that are both compatible with \nU.S. interests and comparable to U.S. regulatory requirements and \nrestraints. Further, UNEP goals are complementary to our own, \nparticularly in the area of climate change and ozone depletion.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful for the bipartisn approach that \nprevailed in the Appropriations Committee which has allowed us to \nensure that the United States will remain committed in our very \nimportant efforts to protect the environment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan editorial from the New York Times on that subject, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  There being no objection, the articles was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 18, 1995]\n\n                        Global Warming Heats Up\n\n       The evidence mounted last week that manmade gases are \n     causing deterioration of the earth's atmosphere. First came \n     news that a United Nations scientific panel believes it has \n     found, for the first time, evidence that human activities are \n     indeed causing a much-debated warming of the globe. The \n     report, though preliminary, appeared to strengthen the case \n     that governments throughout the world may need to take \n     stronger action to head off potential damage.\n       Then came an announcement from the World Meteorological \n     Organization that a worrisome hole in the earth's protective \n     ozone shield appears to be getting even larger over \n     Antarctica. Such enlargement had been expected because it \n     will take a while \n\n[[Page S 13969]]\n     for corrective actions already taken by many governments to exert their \n     effect. But the report underscored that the battle to save \n     the ozone layer is not yet safely won.\n       The U.N.'s global warming report, described by William K. \n     Stevens in the Sept. 10 Times, indicates that man-made global \n     warming is a real phenomenon. It can not be dismissed as \n     unproved ``liberal claptrap,'' as Representative Dana \n     Rohrabacher, Republican of California, who heads a house \n     environmental subcommittee, has derisively suggested.\n       For years now scientists have been arguing over whether the \n     omission of ``greenhouse gases,'' such as carbon dioxide \n     generated by the burning of fossil fuels, has contributed to \n     a small rise in global temperatures over the past century--\n     and whether such emissions will drive temperatures even \n     higher in coming decades.\n       Such a change in temperature might, if drastic enough, have \n     serious consequences, as is made clear today in a second \n     article by Mr. Stevens. Global warming could cause a rise in \n     sea level that would flood coastal lowlands, an increase in \n     weather extremes and damage to forest and croplands in some \n     regions. Forestalling truly severe damage might will warrant \n     action to slow the emission of greenhouse gases by reducing \n     the world's reliance on fossil fuels. But that would be a \n     wrenching, costly process that few political leaders are \n     eager to undertake absent compelling evidence that human \n     activities really are driving world temperatures toward \n     dangerous levels.\n       Now the U.N's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \n     the scientific panel charged with analyzing the problem, has \n     concluded in a draft report that it is seeing signals that \n     man-made global warming is under way. The signals are not in \n     the form of a ``smoking gun.'' Instead, they are found in \n     computer patterns. The computer models that predict rising \n     temperatures seem to be matching up more closely with some of \n     the patterns of climate change actually observed. There are \n     great uncertainties in how much the temperature will rise and \n     how great any damage might be. But the case for being \n     concerned about global warming is getting stronger.\n       That makes it especially distressing that committees in the \n     House and Senate are slashing funds for programs aimed at \n     protecting the global environment. Steep cuts have been \n     imposed on research to study global climate change, on \n     programs to help reduce carbon emissions and on funds to help \n     developing countries phase out their ozone-destroying \n     chemicals. It is perverse that, as the evidence of global \n     atmospheric harm gets somewhat stronger, the political \n     response to mitigating it gets progressively weaker.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from Ohio for \nhis very thoughtful comments. He has been a very sincere and a tireless \nadvocate of the cause of nonproliferation, and he has made a major \ncontribution not only to the United States effort in that but to the \nworldwide efforts in that. While we find ourselves on opposite sides of \nthis particular issue, I certainly want to indicate my admiration for \nhis tireless efforts and also my thanks for the contribution he has \nmade to the debate tonight. I think it has been helpful and \nconstructive. I do come to a different conclusion with regard to the \namendment, but that does not mean I do not share his strong feelings \ntoward nonproliferation. I do.\n  The first portion of what has been said that I want to deal with is \nthe very significant question: What is the value, militarily, of the \nslightly more than one-fourth of the package that would be delivered \nunder this amendment. These are arms negotiated for in 1986 and 1987 \nand 1988. These are arms that have aged somewhat, that are somewhat out \nof date. But I thought that was a valid question and an important one \nfor our deliberations.\n  We held a series of hearings on this whole matter, including one \ndirected specifically to that particular question; that is: How \nsignificant are these weapons? What kind of problems would they create? \nHow significant are they in military terms?\n  I want to deal with the specifics of the answers but let me just \nsummarize. The experts that we called in were both Democrat and \nRepublican, they were both military personnel and personnel from \nacademia. They were both people who had worked with India--we had the \nformer Ambassador to India as well as other experts on India, \nconsultants who work with India all the time--and there were experts \nwho had worked in Pakistan. So we had a broad range of people, \nbackgrounds, and issues. We asked all of them the same question: What \nis the effect on the balance of power in the area?\n  They said this. First, that India maintains the balance of power and \nthat it is militarily overwhelming, roughly a ratio of 2 to 1, \ndepending on the category of weapons system. In some areas the ratio is \neven more than 2 to 1. Certainly in population it is much more than \nthat. In overall resources it is more than that.\n  Second, these experts said it would not affect the balance of power \nat all.\n  Third, they said the weapons themselves are not terribly significant.\n  I have summarized what they said. I want the Record to reflect \nprecisely what they said. But the military significance of the items \nthat would be transferred to Pakistan is a valid question. I think the \nSenator is right to raise it. I wanted the Senator and other Members of \nthis Chamber to know I was concerned about it, that we called a hearing \non it, that we got testimony from all the experts including the \nadministration, all of which agreed stated that the equipment to be \ntransferred would have little military significance.\n  I will just give a quick sampling of the testimony taken because it \nlends important background as Members consider this particular \nquestion. How significant are these arms that will be delivered under \nthis amendment? Here is what Stephen Cohen, Director of Program in Arms \nControl, Disarmament and International Security at the University of \nIllinois, said:\n\n       In terms of the regional military balance, I don't think \n     that the release of this military . . . equipment really will \n     have no significant impact on the balance one way or another.\n\n  Those remarks, sentiments, were echoed by George Tanham. He was the \nVice President of the Rand Corp. I believe he is retired at this point, \nbut nevertheless is an important expert in this area.\n  I agree with Steve that the package won't change the balance at all. \nIn fact, there is no balance now. India dominates so strongly. They \nhave twice as large an army as Pakistan, twice as large an air force, \ntwice as large a navy, twice as many tanks, twice as many airplanes. So \nthere isn't a balance at the moment. India has overwhelming strength.\n  This one is from Michael Krepon. He is the president of the Henry \nStimson Center.\n\n       Conventional arms transfers like those under consideration \n     by the Congress have not in the past been sources of \n     instability or arms racing in the region.\n\n  This next one is by the Honorable William Clark, Jr. He was the U.S. \nAmbassador to India during the period of 1989 to 1992.\n\n       We have got F-16's that have been sitting in the desert and \n     being maintained. The P-3 and the Harpoon, three of them are \n     marginally useful, if at all, and they have been already. The \n     requirement has been met in other ways. From the politics of \n     it, it is terribly important. The military utility of it, \n     they would rather buy more modern equipment with the money.\n\n  What he is suggesting there is that if the Pakistanis had the choice, \nthey probably could get better quality weapons if we returned their \nmoney than if we delivered the weapons. That is particularly important \nif, indeed, the amendment proposed by the Senator from California is \noffered with an alternative to return the money.\n  This is from James Clad, professor at Georgetown University.\n\n       The offer for Pakistan is exactly as Dr. Tanham pointed out \n     an equalizing hand in trying to somehow correct the \n     subcontinental mismatch of conventional weaponry capability \n     and geographical reality. I think another turn on a dime on \n     this issue is going to I think do further damage to the \n     American diplomacy.\n\n  Professor Clad's ``other turn'' was reversing the President's \ncompromise reached after negotiations with the Pakistan government, \nwhich, of course, is the amendment we have offered. If we turn down the \nPresident after he has negotiated a settlement, after he has taken the \nlead and gotten an agreeable settlement in this very sore situation, we \nnot only discredit the President but we undercut his ability to \nnegotiate for us in the future. Those are my words, not Professor \nClad's, but I think the point that he makes is very accurate.\n  The last one is from Bruce Fein. He is a constitutional and \ninternational law specialist and also a syndicated columnist.\n\n       It is true that they--\n\n  Referring to India--\n\n\n[[Page S 13970]]\n\n     are searching at present for substantial additional arms \n     purchases, hundreds of millions, that I think would dwarf \n     anything that would follow any relaxation of the Pressler \n     amendment: very high technology MiG aircraft.\n\n  I might say, Mr. President, that nothing compares in this package to \nanything that India is currently shopping for, has the money to buy and \napparently will buy at some point.\n  Mr. President, those comments deal as seriously as I know how to deal \nwith the question of how significant the equipment that is transferred \nwill be. The experts tell us it is not significant and, indeed, that is \nwhat the administration tells me.\n  Now, that was not Hank Brown talking. Those statements were given by \nexperts in the field in a public hearing subject to the scrutiny and \nreview of the media and other experts. It is important because I must \ntell you my own view is I do not want to get involved in arms sales to \nthe subcontinent that will create an escalating arms race or that \nchange in the balance in favor of one side or the other. I want the \nUnited States to be friends with both countries. We have a great future \nof trade, investment and mutual development with both India and \nPakistan.\n  Ultimately, the people who have tried to exploit the difference \nbetween those two countries will be viewed with hostility by both \nnations as well. Ultimately, both of these neighbors will face common \nchallenges. They must be friends and must work together. The American \nsense that we do not want to get in between the two is the right sense. \nThat is why it is so important to clear up this contractual dispute \nafter 9 years and get it out of our way. The administration is right \nwhen they say it is not their intention to get involved in future arms \nsales.\n  That deals with the question of how significant the one-fourth of the \npackage that is being delivered is. A second area that I thought maybe \nwas worthwhile: Much has been made by my distinguished friends about \nthe fact that Pakistan did not reveal the full extent of what they were \ndoing with nuclear material or other areas.\n  What perhaps was not said is what India said about their nuclear \nprogram. We are not dealing with a nation in isolation. Pakistan's \nneighbor, which is geographically far bigger, has a much greater \npopulation and a military that is twice its size, also has nuclear \nweapons. But all that has been criticized here tonight are the \nstatements and denials of Pakistan. Nothing has been said about the \nstatements of India.\n  Now, it is in our interest as a country to run down either country, \nbut it is unfair to turn a blind eye to what goes on in that \nsubcontinent. If we are to be concerned about one country, we must be \nconcerned about the other. The reality is that between the two \ncountries, India and Pakistan, our legal restrictions apply to Pakistan \nbut exempt India.\n  Is this an inconsistent policy? Mr. President, I believe it is. The \nwaivers that were talked about earlier simply relate to Pakistan \nbecause the restrictions apply to Pakistan. The fact is this: If we are \nconcerned about nuclear weapons, we ought to be concerned about both \nIndia and Pakistan and our laws ought to apply equally to both \ncountries.\n  Mr. President, they do not. If we are concerned about statements \ncountries make about their nuclear weapons program, we ought to be \nconcerned about statements by India as well as by Pakistan. Mr. \nPresident, we have not heard that concern about India tonight. We have \nonly heard it about Pakistan.\n  If Members are concerned about violations of the MTCR--and I am--if \nthey are concerned and want to impose sanctions, they ought to be doing \nwhat the law says, which is to impose sanctions not only in the country \nthat buys items that violate the MTCR but also on the country that \nsells in violation. We have had a lot of people talk about applying \npenalties against Pakistan under the MTCR. But who has come forward to \npropose penalties against China? Under MTCR, they are equally at risk \nif, indeed, the allegations are correct, but the reality is that all we \nhave heard are sanctions against Pakistan and none against China, or at \nleast the Members who have spoken have not talked about China.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself an additional 10 minutes.\n  It seems to me, if we are going to be consistent, we ought to apply \nour concerns about nuclear technology to both India and Pakistan. If we \nare concerned about nuclear technology, we ought to be willing to apply \nthe laws that restrict its development and spread to both India and \nPakistan, not just to one of the two. If we are concerned about \nmissiles and missile technology, we ought to be willing to apply those \nrestrictions to both India and Pakistan. The fact is the MTCR does not \napply to missiles that are developed in-country but they do apply to a \ncountry that acquires them from outside.\n  Once again, we have drafted a law that only applies in this case to \nPakistan and not to India, at least in relation to the two countries.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, if we are going to be consistent, we ought to \ntalk about penalties not just for Pakistan if, indeed, they have \nviolated the MTCR, but for China as well. Yet what we have heard \ntonight are slings and arrows pointed only at Pakistan.\n  Well, that is perhaps appropriate in some ways. This amendment does \ndeal with Pakistan. It is right for them to bring these issues up. But \nfrom my point of view, our level of consistency ought to be higher than \nthat.\n  Lastly, let me ask Members this: If you were a reporter and you \ntalked to President Truman in 1944 and you said, ``Mr. Truman, tell me \nwhether or not the United States has a nuclear weapon?'' What do you \nthink President Truman would have said? Would he have said, ``Well, \nit's a top military secret. Its disclosure would harm our national \nsecurity. But I want to tell you anyway and I'll tell you all about \nit''?\n  Does anybody here think President Truman would have said that?\n  He was not President in 1944; he was Vice President. But at least at \nthat period of time.\n  But the fact is, President Roosevelt--later President Truman who led \nus in the later 1940's--did not reveal, to questions, that we had a \nnuclear weapon. It was a matter of utmost national security.\n  Should the Pakistanis have revealed their national security secrets \nto us? Well, maybe they should have. I can understand Members' \nfrustration with that. But I also understand this, India has the \nnuclear weapons. And they had them first. If anyone is shocked or \nsurprised that Pakistan, who has been involved in three wars with India \nand lost all three, would think about developing weapons comparable to \nthe country that beat them in three wars, I think they have not studied \nmuch of world politics.\n  Is anyone surprised that Pakistan sought to get missiles, if indeed \nthey have? I suspect they have sought to find missiles. The fact is \nthat India has developed missiles. Is anybody surprised that Pakistan \nthen in turn would try to acquire missiles? I am not surprised. Do we \nwish this was not going on? Absolutely. But our challenge ought to be \nto think of ways that we can slow it down or stop it. That involves \nadditional leverage. To ignore the situation, to close off our contacts \nand our discourse with Pakistan is not the way to solve the problem.\n  Mr. President, I offer these observations at the same time I want to \nrenew my sense that it is terribly important that we pursue our efforts \nto slow proliferation or stop it. What is at stake here is solving an \nold dispute, and what stays in place, what is unharmed or unchanged is \nthe flat prohibition on military aid or sales to Pakistan. That is \nunchanged. What stays in place is a strong penalty against Pakistan who \nhas been our ally through thick and thin. We keep that in place because \nwe want to keep a lesson out there for the rest of the world that there \nis a penalty.\n  But this amendment delivers a small portion of the package of \nequipment that Pakistan had contracted for 8 or 9 years ago, which they \nhave paid for and which is deemed to be militarily insignificant by the \nexperts, to them. Their money on three-fourths of the package is sent \nback to them, or at least inasmuch as we can sell those planes for \nsomething and send it back. What we do in this package is begin to deal \nfairly with Pakistan. What we do not do is undercut our efforts at \nnonproliferation. I believe in the long run we improve those efforts.\n  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time. \n\n[[Page S 13971]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, as I understood it, we cannot carry this \ntime over until tomorrow. The time has to be used this evening.\n  We have 1 hour total equally divided. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I would be prepared to yield back the \nremainder of my time, if the Senator from Colorado is prepared to do \nthe same.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I also would be happy to yield back the \nremainder of my time for this evening.\n  Mr. President, at this point I will suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n                        Aid to Israel and Egypt\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of U.S. aid to \nour strongest allies in the Middle East: Israel and Egypt.\n  I believe foreign aid should be dispensed only when and where it is \nin America's national interest, and H.R. 1868, the foreign operations, \nexport financing and related appropriations bill of 1996, meets those \ncriteria.\n  H.R. 1868 authorizes $3 billion for Israel, including $1.8 billion in \nmilitary assistance and $1.2 billion in economic aid; and $2.12 billion \nfor Egypt--$1.3 billion in military aid and $815,000 in economic \nassistance.\n  Mr. President I believe support for Israel and Egypt furthers our \ngoal of supporting countries that defend and advance America's \ninterests.\n  The Middle East is an incredibly volatile region and events that \ntranspire there have major implications for the United States. Both \nIsrael and Egypt help protect our strategic interests in that part of \nthe world and for this reason they deserve our continued support.\n  Now is not the time to abandon our friends, but rather the time to \nassist them as they face many of the same challenges we do as we strive \nto promote stability in the post-cold war world.\n  The Middle East has witnessed historic changes that seemed \nunimaginable only 5 years ago: the collapse of the Soviet Union has \nremoved the most powerful supporter of rogue nations in the region; the \nUnited States, with Egypt's crucial involvement, led an international \ncoalition in a successful effort during the Persian Gulf War; political \nand economic relations were established between Israel and Morocco, \nTunisia, and many other countries around the world; bilateral \nnegotiations were initiated between Israel and some of her most ardent \nenemies; an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians was \nformalized; and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan was signed.\n  But despite these developments and achievements, the Middle East is \nstill among the most dangerous regions in the world.\n  Instability in the Middle East is contrary to our national security \ninterests because it threatens the supply of oil, which could create a \ncrisis the likes of which the people of Western Europe and America have \nexperienced before. It could also threaten our access to the Suez Canal \nand increase the influence of terrorist regimes.\n  And this instability could resurface at any time. Parties opposed to \nthe peace process have sought to undermine it. Economic \nunderdevelopment in many countries breeds political instability and \neven violence.\n  In order to minimize these dangers while continuing to build on \nhistoric accomplishments in the region, United States support for \nIsrael and Egypt is as critical today as ever. Both Israel and Egypt \nstand firmly with us in countering these threats.\n  The joint military exercises the United States conducts with Israel \npromote American goals in the region by solidifying a cooperative \nstrategic plan which can be quickly implemented. Dozens of American \nweapons systems, including the Patriot missile and the F-15 fighter, \nhave been improved with Israeli technological innovations. The Arrow \nmissile program, which has been a joint American-Israeli project, \nshould some day help America and our allies protect ourselves against \nballistic missile attacks. I should also point out that aid to Israel \nis used primarily to purchase United States-made military equipment.\n  Similarly, joint United States-Egyptian military exercises have \nproven fruitful in such coordinated efforts as Desert Shield and Desert \nStorm. As the United States assists in maintaining the efficiency of \nthe Egyptian armed forces, these forces can continue to protect and \nenhance our interests in the region. Furthermore, Egypt purchases over \n85 percent of its military equipment from the United States, including \nthe M1A1 tanks.\n  Mr. President, we must authorize these funding levels not only \nbecause it makes sense when considering our strategic goals in the \nMiddle East, but also because it is consistent with our objectives in \nthe ongoing peace process.\n  As the chief sponsor of both past and current peace negotiations, the \nUnited States should maintain its leadership role in pursuing peace in \nthe region by continuing its unequivocal support for Israel and Egypt. \nPeaceful resolutions to Middle East conflicts will promote stability in \nthis important part of the world.\n  The provisions of this aid package are, in my view, well structured \nto serve the interests of Americans, Israelis and Egyptians.\n  Additionally, H.R. 1868 provides funding for the United States to \nassist the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza as they develop their \neconomy and strive to accomplish peace in the region. In my view, the \nUnited States should help lead an international community effort to \nstimulate private investment in Gaza and Jericho, including the \ncontinuation of a free-trade agreement and the development of \nindustrial parks. Such initiatives can drive economic growth for the \nPalestinians. A stronger economy in turn will ultimately help produce \npeaceful self-rule.\n  Mr. President, l believe we must continue to assist nations which \nserve our interests by promoting stability in a volatile region. I am \nhopeful that ultimately there will be a peaceful resolution to the \nArab-Israeli conflict. I urge my colleagues to vote for this \nlegislation, because I believe aid to Israel and Egypt, as well as to \nthe Palestinians, is a small price to help attain paramount \ninternational goal of the United States--permanent stability and peace \nin the Middle East.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, during the wrapup tonight--I know the \nprocedures for tomorrow will be laid out by my distinguished colleague \nhere. Since the regular floor managers for this bill are not here this \nevening, I would like to point out that Senator Feinstein had hoped to \nbe able to put her amendment in and have it considered at the end of \nthe hour period and following the vote that will occur on Senator \nBrown's amendment.\n  Although the managers are not here tonight, I hope we can honor that \nposition for her so that the votes on this same subject will occur at \nabout the same time or in sequence tomorrow. I hope that the floor \nmanagers tomorrow will look favorably on that, although they are not \nhere to approve that tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/20/senate-section/article/S13920-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

A bill to provide for the establishment of certain \nlimitations on advertisements relating to, and the sale of, tobacco \nproducts, and to provide for the increased enforcement of laws relating \nto underage tobacco use, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                THE TOBACCO PRODUCTS CONTROL ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, I want to talk just a bit about personal \nfreedoms. That notion is so deeply embedded in how Americans define \nthemselves that we fought wars to defend it, marched down every Main \nStreet in America to guard it, and turned politicians out at the polls \nto protect it.\n  That dedication to personal freedom was at the very core of how our \nFounding Fathers defined a nation, and it has endured the test of time.\n  Thomas Jefferson said that the ultimate powers of society belong to \nthe people themselves. And, when Government is concerned that people \nmight not be knowledgeable enough to exercise their control in a \nhealthy direction, he wrote, ``The remedy is not to take it from them, \nbut to inform.''\n  He understood that Government has a mission to inform, but not to \ndictate, because when Government passes over that line of guidance to \ncoercion, every American's guarantee of personal freedom is irrevocably \ndamaged.\n  I want to say this in the most forceful way possible, Madam \nPresident, that no one--no one--supports teen smoking. I am introducing \nlegislation today directed at reducing the number of teenaged smokers \nin this country. But make no mistake, this legislation is equally \ndriven by the need to prevent Government from regulating the legal \nchoice of adults--of adults--in this country. And it does so by keeping \nthe FDA out of the business of regulating tobacco.\n  It is no secret, Madam President, that the FDA would like to ban \ntobacco under the guise of regulating teen tobacco use. And that is why \nwhen many people in my State hear the phrase ``Big Brother,'' they see \nthe face of the FDA's David Kessler.\n  The other day I heard a radio interview of some stock car racing \nfans. They had some pretty harsh words for Washington and for the \nproposed regulations that could have a devastating effect on the sport \nthat they enjoy so much. They used words like ``misguided,'' and \nphrases like ``Big Brother intruding.''\n  You see, Madam President, they could not understand how the \nGovernment could prevent them from buying a T-shirt or a cap with their \nfavorite race driver and sponsor on it. Plenty of those fans are \nparents who have no desire to see their children smoking cigarettes and \nwho support commonsense efforts to reduce teen smoking. But \n\n[[Page S 13973]]\nsomething is clearly wrong when a regulation aimed at young people \njeopardizes a sport where fewer than 3 percent in attendance are under \nthe age of 18.\n  We are not just talking about sports fans or patrons of major art \nshows and performances. We are talking about the truck driver who \nchooses to wear a Skoal cap. We are talking about adults, whether they \nwork on Wall Street, under the hood of a car, at the bank, or checking \ngroceries, being able to get a pack of cigarettes at a local bar's \nvending machine, a place where no minor has any business being in the \nfirst place.\n  I am introducing this legislation today because I am fiercely opposed \nto Government interference into the legal decisions of adults in this \ncountry. I believe this is an issue we could have solved and still can \nwithout FDA intervention by working with industry and the \nadministration. And in fact, many of the larger companies had already \nmade substantial efforts in that direction. But I believe nothing less \nthan complete prohibition is good enough for the regulators over at the \nFDA and the antitobacco zealots.\n  In fact, I am so concerned about the FDA's intentions to limit \nadults' rights with regard to tobacco that I believe some legislative \nsolution is imperative to prevent further intrusion into the private \ndecisions of adults in this country. That is why my legislation in no \nuncertain terms removes any FDA involvement in the regulation of \ntobacco.\n  But as I said on the day those regulations were announced, no one is \nhere to protect peddling tobacco to minors. No one. And I am here today \nto follow up with serious, enforceable measures on advertising and \naccess to stop underaged tobacco use.\n  You also find in this legislation retail and marketing restrictions \nwhich we incorporate into substance abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration rules and State laws already on the books.\n  Under my legislation, we ban outdoor advertising of cigarettes and \nsmokeless tobacco products within 500 feet of schools. We ban \nadvertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products in \npublications with any significant youth subscriptionship. We ban paid \ntobacco advertisements or props in movies. We ban cigarettes or \nsmokeless tobacco advertising in videos, video game machines or family \namusement centers.\n  We require States to restrict vending machine sales of cigarettes or \nsmokeless tobacco products to supervised locations--bars, private \nclubs, or places of employment like factories and warehouses. And we \nrequire States to limit free sampling of cigarettes and smokeless \ntobacco products and use of coupons to locations where youth access is \ndenied and where proof-of-age requirements have been met.\n  Instead of creating a whole new bureaucracy and turning jurisdiction \nover to the FDA, this legislation maintains the enforcement scheme of \ncurrent SAMHSA law, extending it to tobacco sales and marketing \nrestrictions and doubling--I underscore doubling--applicable penalties.\n  These are serious, enforceable measures to combat teenage smoking, \nbut they do not interfere with the legal, private decisions of adults \nnor do they trample on freedom of speech that the first amendment \nprotects. The same cannot be said for the FDA regulations, which have \nalready sent advertising and tobacco industry lawyers scrambling to the \ncourts setting up lengthy legal challenges where the fight will go on \nfor years and years and years.\n  I have been told by those familiar with constitutional law that \nrecent appellate court decisions and legal reviews have supported \nrestrictions on the location of advertising but not on the content of \nthe advertising. My bill responds to legal precedent, where FDA \nregulators have tried to circumvent all legal precedent, attempting to \ncontrol an advertisement's content affecting not just a teenage \npublication, but a truck driver's baseball cap or a banker's financial \nmagazine.\n  Nor does my legislation put an illegal tax on the industry forcing \nthem to use millions and millions of their own dollars to tell the \npublic not to use their product. Can you imagine that? They are going \nto ask the industry to put up millions to say, ``Stop buying our \nproduct.'' Any other industry would go berserk. There is absolutely no \nother industry in this country that has been ordered--ordered, Madam \nPresident--to pay millions to put themselves out of business. Yet the \nFDA regulations attempt to raise taxes without any act of Congress.\n  We can address the issues of teen smoking today without new taxes or \nconstitutionally suspect restrictions on advertising rather than \nwaiting years and years and years for the courts to finally settle the \nmatter. When it comes right down to it, whether a teenager gets a pack \nof cigarettes or not in large part depends on whether an individual \nstore clerk decides to sell it to them. It is already illegal in every \nState in the this country for that clerk to do so.\n  But because too many store clerks do not feel pressured to enforce \nthis law, we clearly need to change the current environment and leave \nno doubt in anyone's mind that it is in their best interest not to sell \nthat pack of cigarettes to a minor. We do that through much tougher \npenalties and by ensuring that States have the enforcement resources \nthey need to back up these laws.\n  My legislation also works to reduce the chances that a teenager will \never walk into that store looking to buy a pack of cigarettes in the \nfirst place. I think that is what all of us want, from the \nadministration to my tobacco farmers to the American public. The \nPresident is clearly committed to making serious inroads on the issue \nof teenage smoking. And in his press conference before the August \nrecess he stated his backing of the self-supporting tobacco program and \nof adults' rights to make their own decision with regard to smoking. \nUnfortunately, overzealous regulators under the direction of David \nKessler have done the President and the country a disservice by going \nway too far beyond simply protecting our young people, and, instead, \ntheir regulations infringe on numerous constitutional rights,\n invade the privacy of average adult Americans, and take the first step \non a short road to prohibition.\n\n  These overzealous regulators include a clause that essentially gives \nthe FDA total control over tobacco's fate if there is not a 50 percent \nreduction in teenage tobacco use from 1993 levels--not 1995, but they \ngo back to 1993--within 7 years. In fact, the percentage of teenage \ntobacco use is already well below the level it was 15 to 20 years ago. \nWhile we are willing to discuss additional, reasonable steps, these FDA \nregulations are nothing more than a guarantee that they are going to be \ncoming back and attempt to expand their jurisdiction even further.\n  I took the President at his word when he said that he prefers a \nlegislative solution. In this legislation, we have taken one of the \ntoughest State laws on the books regarding advertising, and one of the \ntoughest State laws on the books regarding vending machine sales and \nsamples as the basis for a serious and enforceable national policy on \nteenage smoking.\n  The antismoking advocates talk forcefully about the numbers of \nteenagers who begin smoking every day. In citing those figures these \nadvocates would be nothing short of negligent if they reject my \nlegislation and allow this issue to be delayed indefinitely by a court \nfight. They will clearly be choosing a delay over compromise, self-\npromotion over certain progress.\n  There is no doubt that this legislation is about compromise. But make \nno mistake, it does not dodge the responsibility of ending teen tobacco \nuse. I think this legislation represents a serious effort at meeting \nthe President's goals on teenage smoking sooner, rather than later. \nEqually important, by leaving the FDA out of this process, my \nlegislation will not set a course for tobacco that leads to \nprohibition.\n  Madam President, I believe this proposal establishes a framework \nwhich, taken in its entirety, is as tough as the toughest State laws on \nteenage tobacco use in existence today.\n  I challenge critics to show me a better approach--one equally strong \nand one equally reasonable. They are guided by common sense, both in \nthe removal of the FDA from the process and in the expansion of laws \nalready on the books. You will not find any new taxes or new \nbureaucracy, just strong, enforceable measures to end teenage \n\n[[Page S 13974]]\nsmoking and teenage tobacco use today.\n  Madam President, I send a copy of my bill to the desk and ask that it \nbe appropriately referred, and I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The bill \nwill be received and appropriately referred.\n                                S. 1262\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto revise existing regulations concerning the conditions of payment \nunder part B of the Medicare Program relating to anesthesia services \nfurnished by certified registered nurse anesthetists, and for other \npurposes, to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the medicare anesthesia services reform act\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I, along with Senators \nPressler, Thurmond, and Inouye, introduce the Medicare Anesthesia \nServices Reform Act.\n  Whether the issue is Medicare reform or overall health care reform, \nour Nation needs to identify and develop efficient, cost-effective \nmethods of delivering health care. But as we seek to cut health care \ncosts, we must be careful to protect the quality of the health care \nthat patients receive. One way to both provide quality care and better \nutilize our Nation's health care resources is to more appropriately use \nthe services of Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists--CRNA's.\n  The Medicare Anesthesia Services Reform Act addresses two important \nissues affecting the regulation of anesthesia practice as it affects \nCRNA's. The first defers to State laws in determining whether or not \nnurse anesthetists must be supervised by a physician. And the second \nprovision provides parity of payment when two anesthesia providers are \ninvolved in a single Medicare case. The Act helps CRNA's maximize the \nuse of their skills to provide quality health care to patients.\n  Nurse anesthetists administer more than 65 percent of the 26 million \nanesthetics given to patients each year in the United States. They are \nthe sole anesthesia providers in 85 percent of rural hospitals, \nincluding all but a handful of counties in North Dakota. CRNA's play an \nintegral role in providing rural medical facilities with obstetrical, \nsurgical, and trauma stabilization capabilities. CRNA's perform the \nsame anesthesia delivery functions as anesthesiologists and work in \nevery setting in which anesthesia is delivered--traditional hospital \nsuites, obstetrical delivery rooms, dentists offices, HMO's ambulatory \nsurgical centers, Veterans Administration facilities, and others.\n  The first provision in the bill requires the Health Care Financing \nAdministration to defer to State law when determining whether to \ncondition Medicare reimbursement to CRNA's on physician supervision. \nMedicare's regulations require physician supervision of CRNA's as a \ncondition for hospitals or ambulatory surgical centers to receive \nMedicare reimbursement, despite many State laws that allow nurse \nanesthetists to practice without such supervision. In fact, most States \ndo not require physician supervision or direction of nurse anesthetists \nin the States' nurse practice acts, board of nursing rules and \nregulations, medical practice acts, or their generic equivalents.\n  The Federal supervision requirement creates several problems for \nCRNA's. First, some surgeons have been dissuaded from working with \nCRNA's, in the face of arguments that the physicians may be subjecting \nthemselves to liability for engaging in supervision. But the truth is, \nthe attending physician is no more legally liable for the CRNA's \nactions than he or she is for the acts of an anesthesiologist. Second, \nthe Federal restriction is anti-competitive, acting as a disincentive \nfor CRNA's to be utilized. Finally, the restriction creates an \ninaccurate perception among some surgeons that they have an obligation \nto direct or control\n the substantive course of the anesthetic process, even though there is \nno such obligation.\n\n  By eliminating this prescriptive Federal regulation, we can better \nmaximize the use of nurse anesthetists and eliminate the confusion \nsurrounding CRNA supervision. At a time when the Federal Government is \ndeferring to State judgment on a whole host of issues, it seems \ncompletely consistent to let States decide how best to use nurse \nanesthetists, particularly in light of CRNA's long track record of \nsuccess.\n  CRNA's have been around for a century. They have been the principal \nanesthesia providers in combat areas in every war the United States has \nbeen engaged in since World War I. CRNA's have received medals and \naccolades for their dedication, commitment, and competence. And recent \nstudies indicate that better utilization of CRNA's could save the \nFederal Government as much as $1 billion per year by the year 2010. \nClearly, it make sense for the Federal Government to defer to States on \nan issue that could very well save significant Federal expenses over \ntime.\n  The second proposal included in the Medicare Anesthesia Services \nReform Act applies to fairness in reimbursement to CRNA's and \nanesthesiologists. Under Medicare's current regulations, if an \nanesthesiologist and a CRNA work together on one case and Medicare \nlater decides that the use of two anesthesia providers was not \nmedically necessary, neither the hospital nor the CRNA gets paid. \nConsequently, there is an economic disincentive for hospitals to employ \nnurse anesthetists, even though they provide such cost effective \nservices.\n  Obviously, Medicare should not pay for services that are not \nmedically necessary. And our bill would not require Medicare to do so. \nRather, it simply requires that anesthesiologists and CRNA's or the \nhospitals that employ them split the fee equally. If someone works on a \nMedicare case, he or she should get paid for it.\n  The problem CRNA's confront is the poor definition of what \nconstitutes ``medical necessity.'' Medical necessity is interpreted on \na case-by-case basis, making it easy for Medicare carriers to deny a \nclaim for payment to a CRNA who cannot prove medical necessity. If a \nclaim is denied, then only the anesthesiologist gets paid, even though \nboth the anesthesiologist and the CRNA did the work. That is just not \nfair.\n  Last year, I introduced legislation that would have required Medicare \nto reimburse CRNA's and anesthesiologists based on their contribution \nto the case. Under that proposal, if a CRNA did more of the work, he or \nshe might get 60 or 70 percent of the payment compared with 30 or 40 \npercent for the anesthesiologist. If the anesthesiologist did more of \nthe work, he or she would receive a greater percentage of the payment.\n  Some viewed the provision I proposed last year as too difficult to \nimplement. In addition, during health care reform, I worked with the \nAmerican Association of Nurse Anesthetists and the American Society of \nAnesthesiologists to develop a compromise that included the 50-50 split \nthat has been incorporated into this bill. Given the negotiations that \noccurred last year, I believe it is best to include the 50-50 split \nprovision, rather than the provision that I initially proposed.\n  Mr. President, this is sensible legislation. It is fair to both \nCRNA's and anesthesiologists, alike. And it eliminates some significant \nproblems that are creating difficulty for nurse anesthetists and the \nhospitals that employ them.\n  Our proposal replaces outdated Medicare regulations and lets \nhospitals make their individual anesthesia staffing decisions based \nupon their own needs. It also gives more flexibility to \n\n[[Page S 13976]]\nthe States. I hope my colleagues will support it.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S. 1264. A bill to provide for certain benefits of the Missouri River \nbasin Pick-Sloan project to the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\nTHE CROW CREEK SIOUX TRIBE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT TRUST FUND ACT OF \n                                  1995\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Crow Creek Sioux \nTribe Infrastructure Development Trust Fund Act of 1995. This bill will \nprovide for the development of certain tribal infrastructure projects \nfunded by a trust fund set up for the Crow Creek Tribe within the \nDepartment of the Treasury. The trust fund would be capitalized from a \npercentage of hydropower revenues and would be capped at $27.5 million. \nThe tribe would then receive the interest from the fund to be used \naccording to a development plan prepared in conjunction with the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service.\n  The Flood Control Act of 1944 created five massive earthen dams on \nthe Missouri River. This public works project known as the Pick-Sloan \nPlan provides flood control, irrigation, and hydropower. Four of the \nPick-Sloan dams are located in South Dakota.\n  The impact of the Pick-Sloan plan on the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe has \nbeen devastating. The Big Bend and Fort Randall dams created losses to \nthe Crow Creek Tribe for which they have not been adequately \ncompensated. Over 15,000 acres of the tribe's most fertile and \nproductive land, the Missouri River wooded bottom lands, were inundated \nas a result of the Fort Randall and Big Bend components of the Pick-\nSloan project.\n  By and through the Big Bend Act of 1962, Congress directed the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers and the Department of the Interior to take \ncertain actions to alleviate the problems caused by the dislocation of \ncommunities and inundation of tribal resources. These directives were \neither carried out inadequately or not carried out at all.\n  Congress established precedent for this legislation in 1992 by the \npassage of the Three Affiliated Tribes and Standing Rock Sioux Tribe \nEquitable Compensation Act which I cosponsored. At that time, Congress \ndetermined that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers failed to provide \nadequate compensation to the tribes when their land was acquired for \nthe Pick-Sloan projects. There is little controversy on finding that \nthe tribes bore an inordinate share of the cost of implementing the \nPick-Sloan program. The Secretary of the Interior established the Joint \nTribal Advisory Committee to resolve the inequities and find ways to \nfinance the compensation of tribal claims. As a result, the Three \nAffiliated Tribes and Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation \nAct set up a recovery fund financed entirely from a percentage of Pick-\nSloan power revenues.\n  The Crow Creek Sioux Tribe Infrastructure Development Fund Act of \n1995 will enable the Crow Creek Tribe to address and improve their \ninfrastructure and will provide the needed resources for further \neconomic development of the Crow Creek Indian Reservation.\n  This legislation has broad support in South Dakota. Gov. Bill Janklow \nstrongly endorses this proposal to develop the infrastructure at the \nCrow Creek Indian Reservation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record and a letter from Gov. Bill Janklow.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Crow Creek Sioux Tribe \n     Infrastructure Development Trust Fund Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Congress approved the Missouri River basin Pick-\n     Sloan project by passing the Act of December 22, 1944, \n     commonly known as the ``Flood Control Act of 1944'' (58 Stat. \n     887, chapter 665; 33 U.S.C. 701-1 et seq.)--\n       (A) to promote the general economic development of the \n     United States;\n       (B) to provide for irrigation above Sioux City, Iowa;\n       (C) to protect urban and rural areas from devastating \n     floods of the Missouri River; and\n       (D) for other purposes;\n       (2) the Fort Randall and Big Bend projects are major \n     components of the Pick-Sloan project, and contribute to the \n     national economy by generating a substantial amount of \n     hydropower and impounding a substantial quantity of water;\n       (3) the Fort Randall and Big Bend projects overlie the \n     western boundary of the Crow Creek Indian Reservation, having \n     inundated the fertile, wooded bottom lands of the Tribe along \n     the Missouri River that constituted the most productive \n     agricultural and pastoral lands of the Tribe and the homeland \n     of the members of the Tribe;\n       (4) Public Law 85-916 (72 Stat. 1766 et seq.) authorized \n     the acquisition of 9,418 acres of Indian land on the Crow \n     Creek Indian Reservation for the Fort Randall project and \n     Public Law 87-735 (76 Stat. 704 et seq.) authorized the \n     acquisition of 6,179 acres of Indian land on Crow Creek for \n     the Big Bend project;\n       (5) Public Law 87-735 (76 Stat. 704 et seq.) provided for \n     the mitigation of the effects of the Fort Randall and Big \n     Bend projects on the Crow Creek Indian Reservation, by \n     directing the Secretary of the Army to--\n       (A) replace, relocate, or reconstruct--\n       (i) any existing essential governmental and agency \n     facilities on the reservation, including schools, hospitals, \n     offices of the Public Health Service and the Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs, service buildings, and employee quarters; and\n       (ii) roads, bridges, and incidental matters or facilities \n     in connection with such facilities;\n       (B) provide for a townsite adequate for 50 homes, including \n     streets and utilities (including water, sewage, and \n     electricity), taking into account the reasonable future \n     growth of the townsite; and\n       (C) provide for a community center containing space and \n     facilities for community gatherings, tribal offices, tribal \n     council chamber, offices of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \n     offices and quarters of the Public Health Service, and a \n     combination gymnasium and auditorium;\n       (6) the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the \n     Interior have failed to meet the requirements under Public \n     Law 87-735 (76 Stat. 704 et seq.) with respect to the \n     mitigation of the effects of the Fort Randall and Big Bend \n     projects on the Crow Creek Indian Reservation;\n       (7) although the national economy has benefited from the \n     Fort Randall and Big Bend projects, the economy on the Crow \n     Creek Indian Reservation remains underdeveloped, in part as a \n     consequence of the failure of the Federal Government to \n     fulfill the obligations of the Federal Government under the \n     laws referred to in paragraph (4);\n       (8) the economic and social development and cultural \n     preservation of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe will be enhanced \n     by increased tribal participation in the benefits of the Fort \n     Randall and Big Bend components of the Pick-Sloan project; \n     and\n       (9) the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe is entitled to additional \n     benefits of the Missouri River basin Pick-Sloan project, \n     including hydropower revenues and infrastructure development.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The method for funding in the bill is \n     fair and I hope a majority of both houses of Congress and the \n     President will realize the importance of passing this bill \n     and signing it into law.\n       In several different ways, all of the various groups of \n     people who live in South Dakota have not received the \n     benefits promised when the great dams were built in the \n     1950s. The persistence of the members of the Crow Creek Sioux \n     Tribe to right this wrong is worthy of high praise. \n     Congratulations on creating an excellent proposal.\n       If there is anything I can do to help you, please let me \n     know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William J.

Mr. President, when Mr. Christopher Patten became \nGovernor of Hong Kong 3 years ago, he made a very important decision. \nHe decided to allow the people of Hong Kong the opportunity to express \ntheir preference on a simple issue: Democracy--yes or no?\n  As the New York Times editorial today notes, ``Hong Kong's voters \ndeclared overwhelmingly on Sunday their preference for democracy and \ntheir doubts about Beijing's plans for the colony's future.'' Final \nreturns from Sunday's vote show the Democratic Party led by Mr. Martin \nLee won the largest number of seats, 19, in the 60 seat legislative \ncouncil. Other prodemocracy allies will give Mr. Lee a working majority \nof 31.\n  By contrast, pro-Beijing candidates of the Democratic Alliance for \nthe Betterment of Hong Kong won only six seats and the party's top \nthree officials were all defeated. Regrettably, spokesmen for Beijing \nhave not learned to lose gracefully and have resorted to threats and \nintimidation.\n  Again Governor Patten has proved to be the best analyst: ``Everybody \nhas to recognize that Hong Kong has expressed its views about the \npresent and the future with great clarity.''\n  Mr. President, I am submitting a resolution expressing the sense of \nthe Congress regarding the recent elections in Hong Kong. The \nresolution congratulates the people of Hong Kong for exercising their \nright to vote, calls on China to respect the clear will of the people \nof Hong Kong to have a fully democratic government, and calls on China \nto enter into a dialogue with the democratically elected \nrepresentatives of the Hong Kong people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that number of articles and \neditorials from the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Wall \nStreet Journal be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 19, 1995]\n\n   Rebuff of China Proves Sweeping--Pro-Democratic Bloc in Hong Kong \n             Legislature Could Hold Majority on Key Issues\n\n                         (By Keith B. Richburg)\n\n       Hong Kong, Sept. 18.--China and Hong Kong today seemed set \n     for a prolonged period of confrontation after residents here \n     gave a substantial vote of no-confidence to Beijing's \n     preferred legislative candidates, instead of choosing \n     independent-minded lawmakers who are already promising to \n     shout about human rights, free speech and the rule of law as \n     Chinese rule approaches.\n       Final returns from Sunday's vote showed the Democratic \n     Party, led by lawyer Martin Lee, will be the largest single \n     party in the new legislature, with 19 of 60 seats. Counting \n     other like-minded parties and independents, advocates of \n     democracy who favor standing up to China will form a bloc of \n     at least 27.\n       Published analyses indicated that on issues involving \n     relations with China, the pro-democratic vote would be a \n     majority of 31. The one clearly pro-China party won six \n     seats.\n       In a victory press conference today, an elated Lee promised \n     to continue the same kind of tough rhetoric that already has \n     made him China's nemesis in the colony. Lee said the \n     elections proved that Hong Kong people ``want legislators who \n     will stand up for them'' to protect the territory's freedoms \n     in the coming battles with China's Communist leadership.\n       Lee said the democracy bloc of the new legislature will use \n     the remaining 21 months of British rule to try to strengthen \n     laws protecting press freedom and free speech, to enact a \n     freedom of information ordinance, and to try again to change \n     a Sino-British agreement for a new supreme court to guarantee \n     that future judges can act with greater independence.\n       Lee's statements are the sort that most unnerve mainland \n     China, and make it more likely now, in the view of some \n     analysts, that Beijing will take an even tougher stance \n     toward Hong Kong, keeping its vow to jettison the local \n     legislature and possibly even doing away with direct \n     elections entirely after reversion in July 1997.\n       Pro-China politicians and official Chinese statements from \n     Beijing tried to put the best face on the election results. \n     The leader of the main pro-China party, the Democratic \n     Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (known as DAB), \n     Tsang Yok-sing, explained the loss to reporters by saying the \n     Democrats fielded far more incumbents and had more experience \n     campaigning and organization.\n       A statement from the official New China News Agency said \n     the elections ``showed that hope for a smooth transition and \n     love of the motherland and Hong Kong remain the main trend in \n     Hong Kong.'' But the agency quoted an official in Beijing of \n     the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office as repeating China's \n     vow to dismantle the legislature and replace it with a \n     provisional body whose deputies would be picked by China.\n\n[[Page S 13979]]\n\n       ``Beijing will feel more insecure and more suspicious \n     toward Hong Kong,'' said Joseph Cheng, a political science \n     professor at the City University here. It's likely to result \n     in ``a tougher line.''\n       ``It seems the Hong Kong people want candidates who dare to \n     criticize China, to provide some checks and balances, or at \n     least to articulate their grievances,'' he said.\n       But Cheng said that under the existing colonial system, \n     with most power still resting with the British governor, the \n     new lawmakers may find themselves frustrated over the next 21 \n     months. The legislature may not introduce any bills that \n     would increase government spending, and the governor can \n     ignore the legislature whenever he chooses.\n       Most analysts said the dismal performance of the main pro-\n     China party suggested a new era of confrontation. Had more of \n     its candidates won seats, the theory goes, China might have \n     felt more comfortable about the idea of direct elections in \n     Hong Kong and less inclined to abolish the legislature when \n     it takes over.\n       But many of the candidates openly aligned with China were \n     decisively beaten by the democracy advocates. The main pro-\n     China party could manage no more than six seats.\n       Moreover, the pro-China party's three senior officers--the \n     chairman, the vice chairman and the secretary general--all \n     were crushed. The pro-China candidates together received \n     about 30 percent of the popular vote, compared to more than \n     60 percent for the Democratic Party politicians.\n       In other results, the pro-business Liberal Party, which in \n     pursuing commercial interests is likely to vote with them in \n     mind, won 10 seats. The remaining 17 seats also represent \n     interests that might shift according to the issue.\n       Analysts said the loss of so many pro-China politicians, \n     considered relative moderates, means a likely dominance now \n     of more hard-line Communist voices in Hong Kong's pro-Beijing \n     United Front. The front as a whole took no part in the \n     election, even as the DAB--a part of the front--went its own \n     way on this matter and did so. This could presage a further \n     heightening of the rhetoric and increasing polarization of \n     the political dialogue, these analysts said.\n       The result also means the political situation is likely to \n     become more confusing in the waning months of British \n     colonial rule. Christopher Patten, the British governor and \n     the man who engineered the changes that made the elections \n     possible, is to remain until the end of June 1997. But the \n     new legislature he helped create can claim it has the \n     legitimacy of the people, since unlike the governor, all 60 \n     members were elected, directly or indirectly.\n       China has said it will unveil its own ``provisional \n     legislature'' next year, and although technically it will \n     have no power until the turnover in 1997, it is foreseen as a \n     ``shadow legislature'' competing with the elected one for \n     influence. And China is also expected to name the team that \n     will run the government in Hong Kong after July 1997, meaning \n     there will also be a shadow executive and cabinet waiting in \n     the wings.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 19, 1995]\n\n       China and Hong Kong Victors Square Off After the Election\n\n                         (By Edward A. Gargan)\n\n       Hong Kong, September 18.--As jubilant members of Hong \n     Kong's Democratic Party celebrated their sweeping defeat of \n     pro-China parties in legislative elections on Sunday, Beijing \n     renewed its promise that the legislature would be disbanded \n     on July 1, 1997, the day the territory is scheduled to revert \n     to Chinese rule.\n       ``The last legislature of the British administration in \n     Hong Kong will end on June 30, 1997,'' a spokesman for \n     China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office was quoted as \n     saying today by the New China News Agency. ``The attitude of \n     the Chinese Government on this issue is consistent and will \n     not change and will not be influenced by the result of the \n     election.''\n       But members of the Democratic Party, founded in the wake of \n     the 1989 Tiananmen massacre to challenge China's plans for \n     controlling Hong Kong and regarded by Beijing as a subversive \n     organization, refused to accept what appears to be the \n     inevitable demise of their careers as lawmakers.\n       ``This election makes clear the will of Hong Kong,'' said \n     Martin C.M. Lee, the party's chairman who decisively regained \n     his seat in the Legislative Council. ``This election is a \n     referendum on the aspirations of the people of Hong Kong.''\n       ``Hong Kong people voted with their hearts and their minds \n     for freedom and genuine democracy,'' he said. ``The \n     elections, in short, are a mandate for democratic government \n     in Hong Kong and real constitutional, legal and human rights \n     reform to ensure basic freedoms in Hong Kong after 1997.''\n       Sunday's elections for the 60-seat Legislative Council, the \n     last under more than a century of British rule, marked the \n     first time that all seats were elected, whether directly or \n     indirectly.\n       The Democrats took 12 of the 20 directly elected seats, and \n     secured another 7 indirectly elected seats. Another 10 to 12 \n     successful candidates who ran as independents or from smaller \n     parties are regarded as allied to the Democrats, potentially \n     giving the pro-democracy bloc a majority in the new \n     legislature.\n       Most surprising, commentators said, was the defeat of the \n     pro-China Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong \n     Kong. The party's top three officials were defeated and the \n     party managed to secure only six seats, all but two from \n     indirectly elected constituencies.\n       ``From the Hong Kong people's point of view, the message is \n     quite clear,'' said Joseph Cheng, a professor at City \n     University of Hong Kong's Contemporary China Research Center. \n     ``The Hong Kong people always want a spokesman who can \n     criticize China and who can provide checks and balances.''\n       In their monthlong campaign, the pro-China candidates \n     hammered the theme of their close relationship with the \n     Chinese Government, cautioning Hong Kong voters that their \n     interests would be best served by electing legislators who \n     could communicate well with Beijing. Many Democratic \n     candidates described that campaign as little short of \n     blackmail, a suggestion that seemed to be borne out today in \n     bitter comments by Gary Cheng Kai-nam, the No. 2 official in \n     the pro-China party.\n       ``The Hong Kong people will have to pay for it,'' he said, \n     referring to the strong showing by the Democratic Party. ``We \n     warned that it would be better to see different voices.''\n       Chinese companies, newspapers and the Chinese Government's \n     official presence here, the Hong Kong office of the New China \n     News Agency, were active throughout the campaign in support \n     of the Alliance. Employees in Chinese companies were \n     aggressively lobbied, left-wing unions rallied members to \n     volunteer for Alliance campaigns and the pro-China newspapers \n     daily assailed the Democrats for anti-China attitudes.\n       But the poor showing by pro-China candidates has created, \n     in many people's views, new problems for China, one put \n     bluntly by Gov. Christopher Patten, the architect of the \n     elections.\n       ``Everybody has to recognize the results,'' Mr. Patten said \n     at a news conference today. ``Everybody has to recognize that \n     Hong Kong has expressed its views about the present and the \n     future with great clarity.''\n       Today, in one of his most forceful comments, Mr. Patten \n     challenged China today to show how the elections violated \n     either agreements reached with Britain or the territory's \n     constitution, the Basic Law.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 19, 1995]\n\n                     Hong Kong Votes for Democracy\n\n       Hong Kong's voters declared overwhelmingly on Sunday their \n     preference for democracy and their doubts about Beijing's \n     plans for the colony's future. Pro-China candidates lost \n     consistently to members of the Democratic Party, which favors \n     autonomy for Hong Kong after the planned takeover by China in \n     1997.\n       Ominously, China quickly threatened to dissolve the newly-\n     elected Legislative Council. Perhaps even more ominously, \n     Gary Cheng Kai-nam, an official of the pro-Chinese Democratic \n     Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, said the colony's \n     six million people would ``have to pay for'' their choice. It \n     is not in the interest of either Hong Kong or China for \n     Beijing to crush Hong Kong's vibrant economy and developing \n     democracy in 1997.\n       Britain is to hand Hong Kong over to Beijing's control when \n     the 99-year lease on the colony expires. The agreement \n     governing the terms of the handover was signed in 1984, at a \n     time when China seemed to be liberalizing both its economic \n     and political systems. Hong Kong's political structure then \n     was not strictly democratic, and the prospects for finding a \n     workable accommodation between the two systems seemed \n     difficult but not impossible.\n       But since the Chinese crackdown on democracy demonstrations \n     in Tiananmen Square in 1989, the match has seemed \n     increasingly awkward. Hong Kong residents showed their \n     revulsion for Beijing's brutality in a one-million-strong \n     demonstration after the tanks rolled through Tiananmen \n     Square. Since then Christopher Patten, Britain's last Hong \n     Kong Governor, has sought to encourage and strengthen \n     democratic institutions. Sunday's balloting was his latest \n     move to cross the Chinese.\n       If China takes a heavy-handed approach and eliminates the \n     new political institutions that Hong Kong's people clearly \n     want, it risks undermining the business confidence that makes \n     the territory such a valuable asset. Political turmoil is the \n     enemy of a flourishing economy.\n       Beijing needs to take a longer view. If it wishes to \n     preserve Hong Kong's unique role as a regional financial hub, \n     it must find ways to accommodate its lively, individualistic \n     culture, flavored by its long-term and intimate relationship \n     with Western capitalism. Hong Kong's people, many of them \n     refugees from the mainland, will not be easily silenced.\n                                                                    ____\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 19, 1996]\n\n     Hong Kong Voters Hand Setback To Candidates Backed by Beijing\n\n                            (By Peter Stein)\n\n       Hong Kong.--Voters here signaled their willingness to stand \n     up to China by giving pro-democracy candidates to the \n     territory's Legislature a landslide victory over their China-\n     backed opponents.\n       The magnitude of their triumph in the last Hong Kong \n     elections to be held before the British colony reverts to \n     Chinese sovereignty in mid-1997 seemed to take even the \n\n[[Page S 13980]]\n     pro-democracy camp by surprise. Led by Chairman Martin Lee, the \n     Democratic Party won 19 out of the 25 seats they contested, \n     while allies of the Democrats secured eight more seats in the \n     60-seat Legislative Council. Before the vote, campaign staff \n     had privately anticipated the party winning about 15 seats.\n       China-backed candidates fared worse than expected. The pro-\n     China Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong won \n     six seats. But the party's top leadership, including Chairman \n     Tsang Yok Sing, a Marxist schoolteacher, were defeated by \n     pro-democratic candidates.\n       Sunday's vote, Hong Kong's broadest exercise in democracy, \n     represented the culmination of political reforms first \n     introduced by Gov. Chris Pattern three years ago. Riled by \n     those reforms, China has already vowed to dissolve Hong \n     Kong's Legislature when it takes control of the territory \n     July 1, 1997.\n       For Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, which also swept the \n     1991 elections, the performance was a vindication of its \n     hardline approach to dealing with China. ``It has certainly \n     quelled all our doubts as to whether we enjoy the support of \n     the Hong Kong people,'' Mr. Lee said. The results signaled \n     that ``Hong Kong people love democracy, they love the rule of \n     law, they want their rights preserved.''\n       Throughout the campaign, China-backed candidates attacked \n     the Democrats and their allies for their inability to enter \n     into a dialogue with Beijing. Meanwhile, the pro-democracy \n     candidates campaigned on their willingness to stand tough \n     against Beijing on issues such as preserving Hong Kong's rule \n     of law. Democrats campaigned hard against a compromise \n     agreement between China and Britain on Hong Kong's future \n     court of final appeal, which they argue will destroy the \n     independence of Hong Kong's judiciary.\n       China' official Xinhua news agency, reporting on the \n     election, avoided any mention of the Democrats' victory. \n     ``The results of the Hong Kong Legislative Council elections \n     showed that hope for a smooth transition and love of the \n     motherland and Hong Kong remain the main trend in Hong \n     Kong,'' a Xinhua spokesman was quoted as saying. The \n     spokesman nonetheless branded the elections as ``unfair and \n     unreasonable.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 19, 1995]\n\n                               One China?\n\n       Coming on the heels of all the recent thunder out of China, \n     the Hong Kong elections have a significance reaching far \n     beyond one island. Especially since the anti-Beijing outcome \n     is certain to be repeated in legislative elections in Taiwan \n     in December, it's time for the U.S. and other democracies to \n     review the basics of their China policy.\n       The ``one China'' policy was originally set out in the \n     famous 1972 Shanghai communique. The U.S. declared that it \n     ``acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan \n     Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is \n     part of China. The United States government does not \n     challenge that position. It reaffirms its interest in a \n     peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese \n     themselves.'' (In the same communique, China declared ``China \n     will never be a superpower and its opposes hegemony and power \n     politics of any kind.'')\n       When the U.S. established diplomatic relations with Beijing \n     and suspended them with Taiwan in 1978, the joint communique \n     stated that ``the people of the United States will maintain \n     cultural, commercial and other unofficial relations with the \n     people of Taiwan.'' In a unilateral statement at the same \n     time, the U.S. declared that it ``expects that the Taiwan \n     issue will be settled peacefully by the Chinese themselves.'' \n     These understandings were codified into U.S. law by the \n     Taiwan Relations Act of 1979.\n       In 1982, when the U.S. agreed to reduce arms sales to \n     Taiwan, President Reagan issued a statement that the policy \n     was based on ``the full expectation that the approach of the \n     Chinese government to the resolution of the Taiwan issue will \n     continue to be peaceful.'' He added, a ``We will not \n     interfere in this matter or prejudice the free choice of, or \n     put pressure on, the people of Taiwan in this matter.''\n       These are the principles that the U.S. has followed ever \n     since Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger started the \n     rapprochement with China. They stress above all that \n     reunification should be peaceful. And they include a not-so-\n     tacit premise that reunification is the desire of Chinese \n     people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, a premise that \n     looks increasingly dubious.\n       To sharpen the point, throughout the history of the ``one \n     China'' policy the United States has studiously avoided any \n     suggestion that it would participate in forcing Taiwan into \n     China against the will of its people. Of course this is \n     precisely what Beijing wants when it talks of ``one China'' \n     or ``sovereignty'' or an ``internal matter.'' The course of \n     events is splitting this delicate straddle, and a yes-or-no \n     answer may impend.\n       This is why China threw a tantrum over the visit to Cornell \n     by Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui, though to use a college \n     reunion looks like the unofficial relations contemplated by \n     the 1978 communique. The missile tests splashing down north \n     of Taiwan were a clumsy effort to intimidate the electorate \n     there. President Lee has been pushing for more recognition of \n     Taiwan\n      in international organizations such as the World Trade \n     Organization and the International Monetary Fund. The \n     opposition party takes the position that Taiwan already is \n     an independent nation; it holds a third of the \n     parliamentary seats, and expects to gain in December.\n       China's efforts at intimidation will surely backfire, as \n     they so clearly did in Hong Kong. While branded as \n     ``unpatriotic'' and ``subversive,'' Hong Kong's Democratic \n     Party carried 12 of 20 contested seats, while like-minded \n     independents took four more. Democratic leader Martin Lee got \n     80% of the votes in his own constituency, the highest margin \n     of any candidate. The main pro-Beijing grouping, the DAB, \n     captured only two seats, while its chairman and vice chairman \n     were trounced in their races. These results confounded the \n     public opinion polls, no doubt because residents did not give \n     truthful answers to callers who might be reporting to \n     Beijing.\n       It's easy enough to understand why voters in Hong Kong or \n     Taiwan would have doubts about being ruled by the present \n     government of China. It's been prone to lurches such as the \n     Cultural Revolution and the post-Tiananmen crackdown. But at \n     the same time, the current Chinese leadership can rightly \n     feel that it has done much for its people over the past \n     decade, by unleashing the economy and hastening development. \n     In particular, an educated middle class has already started \n     to emerge. The shape of China's transition, internal and \n     external, will be determined by Chinese, but America and the \n     Western World can help or hurt the prospects. With the Cold \n     War over, surely there are few more important diplomatic \n     tasks than incorporating a quarter of mankind into a peaceful \n     and prosperous world system.\n       What China most of all needs from the world's remaining \n     superpower is a constancy that has been sorely lacking. The \n     world would have been far better off if the Clinton \n     Administration had from the first said it would decide who \n     could visit Ithaca. China did in the end release Harry Wu, \n     after all, and has agreed to negotiate a code of conduct \n     concerning the disputed and possibly oil-rich Spratly \n     Islands. Beijing, that is, is perfectly capable of acting \n     responsibly if someone stands up and asks it to.\n       The U.S. should be telling the Chinese authorities \n     something like this: That the U.S. intends to maintain its \n     historic ``one China'' policy, wishing the Han people well in \n     efforts to forge one nation, but steadfastly opposing the use \n     of force. That it's unthinkable that the U.S. would try to \n     coerce a democratic Taiwan into an unwilling union, and \n     seeking such an American commitment will be disruptive and \n     counterproductive. That with the incorporation of Hong Kong \n     in 1997, China will have an opportunity to show good faith by \n     keeping its promise of a high degree of autonomy. That \n     bringing Hong Kong to heel, destroying its institutions, is \n     the last policy likely to result in a one China.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/20/senate-section/article/S13978-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13980-S13988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n                                 ______\n\n\n    THE FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n                APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                  DOLE (AND HELMS) AMENDMENT NO. 2707\n\n  Mr. HELMS (for Mr. Dole for himself and Mr. Helms) proposed an \namendment to the bill (H.R. 1868) making appropriations for foreign \noperations, export financing, and related programs for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 1996, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the committee amendment, add the following \n     new title:\n  TITLE VII--CONSOLIDATION AND REINVENTION OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AGENCIES\n\n     SEC. 701.
