Mr. President, the other evening, the majority \nleader, Senator Dole, spoke about the opportunities which the GI bill \nprovided to thousands of Americans following World War II. Enactment of \nthe GI bill in 1944 marked the beginning of Federal efforts to open the \ndoor to postsecondary education for individuals who would otherwise be \nunable to attend. Over the past 50 years, the scope and variety of \nFederal student aid programs have expanded considerably. Today, any \nstudent in need of financial help can obtain it.\n  My reason for addressing the Senate now is to dispel the notion that, \nsomehow, all this will change if Congress enacts student loan changes \nas part of the budget reconciliation bill. Unfortunately, \nmisconceptions about this legislation are widespread, and I believe it \nis important to set the record straight.\n  A few weeks ago, the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources \nreported its portion of this legislation, providing Federal student \nloan savings of $10.85 billion over 7 years. Because the Federal \nstudent loan program is one of the few mandatory spending programs \nunder the jurisdiction of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, it \nwas the only place we had to turn in order to comply with our \ninstruction.\n  Granted, $10.85 billion is a substantial sum over 7 years. However, \nto hear some describe our package, one would assume that it spells the \nend of higher education as we know it. Mr. President, that is simply \nnot the case.\n  Federal student loan programs were established to assist students and \ntheir parents in financing postsecondary education. These programs have \nbeen successful in achieving that goal. Approximately $26 billion in \nloan funds have been made available this year. The figure will grow \nnext year. Even if the Labor Committee package is approved intact, that \nvolume will grow.\n  The reason is that the savings in this package were achieved without \nrestricting a student's ability to borrow. In short, there is nothing \nin the package which limits the amount of loan funds available. Loans \nwill continue to be available to all who qualify. There is nothing in \nthe package which limits the ability of a student to qualify for a \n\n[[Page S 15298]]\nFederal loan. The rules are exactly the same as they have been.\n  There is nothing in the package which increases the cost of the loan \nto a student who is in school. The only direct cost to students \nincluded in the package applies to new borrowers after they leave \nschool. At that point, they will continue to be able to defer loan \npayments for 6 months--the so-called grace period--but the Federal \nGovernment will no longer subsidize interest payments during that \nperiod of time.\n  That, I believe, Mr. President, is reasonable. This package was \ndeveloped with the clear intention of minimizing costs to students. I \nbelieve that purpose was accomplished. It is, therefore, particularly \ndisturbing to me that students and their families are being \nintentionally misled about the impact of the proposed changes. I fear \nthat this misinformation will discourage some students from even \nexploring postsecondary education, and that, I believe, would be a real \ntragedy.\n  I would like to explain briefly how the $10.85 billion in savings is \nachieved. First of all, about $4 billion of the savings comes from \nreductions to entities involved in the guaranteed loan program, such as \nbanks and guaranty agencies.\n  The elimination for new borrowers of the interest subsidy during the \n6-month grace period achieves about $2.7 billion in savings over that \n7-year period. This change would mean an extra $1.89 a month for an \nundergraduate who borrows $5,500 in 1 year. At most, it would mean an \nadditional $22.50 a month for a graduate student who has borrowed the \n$65,000 maximum through his or her college career.\n  Capping the direct loan program at 20 percent of loan volume produces \nabout $1.5 billion in savings. Additional savings are achieved through \nthe elimination of fees paid to schools and alternative originators for \ndirect loan administration. Whatever one may believe about the merits \nor demerits of direct lending, the fact remains that the way a loan is \ndelivered has absolutely nothing to do with the ability of students to \nborrow or with the amounts they may borrow. The terms and conditions of \ndirect loans are identical to those of guaranteed loans. There is no \ndifference to the students at that juncture. To suggest that paring \nback the direct loan program will deprive students of loan funds or \nmake those funds more expensive is plainly inaccurate. The one \nadvantage, at this point, of direct loans and direct lending is that it \nmakes a loan available immediately.\n  It does expedite the process of obtaining a loan by a student. As far \nas any difference in the loans being more expensive, that is certainly \nnot the case.\n  The package also calls upon postsecondary education institutions to \nparticipate in achieving savings by imposing a fee equal to 0.85 \npercent of the amount of Federal loans made available to their \nstudents. This proposal produces about $1.9 billion over 7 years.\n  Some have argued that these costs will be passed directly on to the \nstudents rather than being absorbed through the efficiencies in other \nschool operations. Perhaps that will be the case. Even if the entire \ncost is passed on to the student, it would amount to an average of $20 \nto $25 per student per year. That is at the high end. Others would be \nabout $11 to $12 to $13 per year.\n  Finally, approximately $700 million in savings is achieved by \nincreasing the interest rate and the interest rate cap on parent loans.\n  When one looks beyond the hype to see the facts, Mr. President, it is \nclear that this reconciliation package does not spell disaster for \nsecondary education in this country. Blaming a Republican Congress for \nreducing access to postsecondary education by increasing its costs may \nbe convenient, but it does not explain away the fact that college \ntuitions have been growing at a rate surpassing inflation for well over \na decade. That is what has caused such enormous problems for students \nand their families, is the escalating cost of college education due to \nincreased tuition.\n  Figures recently released by the college board show an average \ntuition increase this year of 6 percent, more than double the inflation \nrate. Average tuition in fees at a 4-year public institution are \n$2,860. For a 4-year private institution, these costs average $12,432.\n  Mr. President, another 6-percent increase in those amounts next year \nwould mean an additional per-student cost ranging from $171 to $745, \npresenting far more serious problems for students and their families \nthan anything in this reconciliation package.\n  Federal student aid is simply not going to be able to pick up the \nslack in such an environment, nor is that a role for which it was \nintended. That is what I think we need to understand, Mr. President.\n  There is not anything in the reconciliation package regarding student \nloans that I suppose we would be comfortable with. On the other hand, \nit is not the tragedy that is being portrayed. I think it is very \nimportant that students and their families understand that.\n  No one relishes the task of cutting back. It is much easier to build \nupon the expensive policies that have brought us to our current budget \nproblems in the first place. However, one can prune the branches \nwithout killing the tree. It is a disservice to the American taxpayers \nto suggest otherwise.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous unanimous consent, the \nSenator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I wonder if the Senator from Minnesota would yield \nfor a few moments for some unanimous-consent requests.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15297-6", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15298-S15311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION APPROPRIATIONS \n                    AUTHORIZATION, FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM.

Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is \nconsidering S. 1048, the NASA Authorization Act for fiscal year 1996, \nwhich I introduced as chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation. Let me also take this opportunity to thank \nSenator Burns, who is chairman of our Space Subcommittee, for his fine \ncontributions to this bill and his leadership in space policy matters.\n  NASA faces two challenges. The first is maintaining America's \nleadership in aeronautics and space. The second is accomplishing these \nleadership goals within the confines of a balanced Federal budget. This \nauthorization bill allows NASA to meet both of these challenges.\n  NASA started out this year with a plan to cut $5 billion over 5 years \nfrom its budget. Then, the Senate and House developed budget plans \nrequiring even deeper cuts. In keeping with this new fiscal reality, \nour bill authorizes a total of $13.8 billion for NASA in Fiscal Year \n1996, a 3-percent decrease from the current funding level of $14.26 \nbillion.\n  Despite the funding cut, the bill manages to support a diverse and \nforward-looking space program. It authorizes all of NASA's major \ncurrent programs such as Mission to Planet Earth, space station, space \nscience, and aeronautics and, in almost all cases, at their requested \nfunding levels. At the same time, it prepares NASA for the future by \nauthorizing a number of new starts--including the new reusable launch \nvehicle technology development program aimed at providing private \nindustry the technology to eventually build a shuttle replacement, and \na new radar satellite program to develop and make use of the latest \nadvances in satellite remote sensing technology.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to make special mention of certain \nportions of the bill.\n  I believe Mission to Planet Earth may be NASA's most important and \nrelevant program. The satellite data from Mission to Planet Earth will \ndeliver direct benefits to the taxpayer in contrast to the speculative \nspinoffs promised by other space activities. For this reason, the bill \nfully funds this activity at $1.36 billion. Using the latest satellite \ntechnology, Mission to Planet Earth will help researchers understand \nand predict the global climate trends that affect our lives. As a \nSenator representing a State whose economy is dependent upon \nagriculture, I have a keen interest in this program's potential to \nprovide detailed data on soil conditions, topography, crops, and other \ninformation critical to the farming and ranching community. I also take \ngreat pride in the selection of the EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, \nSD, as one of the regional data centers that will collect and \ndistribute this satellite data.\n  If Mission to Planet Earth is to realize its full potential, we must \nensure its satellite data are converted to useful information that can \nbe applied to real life problems. Reflecting that thinking, our bill \nauthorizes $10 million for an Upper Missouri River Basin project to \nsupport hydrology studies of that flood-plagued region. This project \nwill enable a consortium of regional institutions led by the South \nDakota School of Mines and Technology to apply NASA's space-age \ntechnology to develop better systems for managing and investigating \nfloods and other natural disasters. I am hopeful NASA will undertake \nmore projects of this type in order to put our country's wealth of \nscientific knowledge and talent to work for the taxpayers' benefit.\n  I am pleased with the current direction of the Mission to Planet \nEarth Program, but, equally significant, so is the scientific \ncommunity. In September, the National Academy of Sciences released its \nlong-awaited report on the program. The report, which was based on a \n10-day workshop featuring the Nation's finest scientists, strongly \nendorsed the program's goals, missions, and activities. In short, the \nscientific community formally declared that Mission to Planet Earth is \nindeed good science.\n  It is because this program is on the right track that I am deeply \nconcerned about the possibility of NASA taking any imprudent and \nunnecessary efforts to further restructure the program. Mission to \nPlanet Earth has just completed a restructuring exercise. In my view, \nfurther redesigns to the program would only add costs, produce schedule \ndelays, and reduce scientific capabilities. To guard against this \noccurrence, the bill specifically prohibits NASA from changing the data \nmanagement component of the program, unless, 60 days before such \naction, NASA has reported to Congress on the nature and overall impact \nof the planned changes.\n  Mr. President, the bill also provides the full $2.1 billion requested \nfunding for space station. However, this authorization should not be \ninterpreted as a ringing endorsement of that program. I am a \nlongstanding supporter of the program, but, in recent years, I have \nbecome concerned that it has become too expensive, too complex, and too \ndependent on the contributions of Russia, the latest station partner. \n\n[[Page S 15304]]\n\n  In a June 1995 report, the General Accounting Office [GAO] estimated \nthe total cost of the design, launch, and operation of the space \nstation will be $94 billion. That is almost seven times the entire \nannual budget for NASA. Given the history of past missions, it is fair \nto assume the $94 billion price tag for the program will increase over \ntime. If that happens, we may wake up to find the enormous space \nstation budget has crowded out every other NASA program to become \nNASA's only mission. Earlier this year, I voted for space station \nfunding, but I may well reconsider my support in the future if the \nprogram starts to threaten the balance in our space program.\n  As important as current space programs are, we also have an \nobligation to prepare NASA for the future. To that end, the bill \nsupports several new initiatives at NASA to extend its vision into the \nnext century. The bill authorizes a reusable launch vehicle program, \nwhich will support NASA's X-33 and X-34 activities to pave the way for \nthe later development by the private sector of a replacement for the \nshuttle in the next decade.\n  Employing 1970's technologies and costing $400 million per flight, \nthe shuttle may have outlived its usefulness. However, within today's \nbudget constraints, the Government cannot afford to foot the entire \nbill for a new multibillion-dollar spacecraft development program. That \nis why the reusable launch vehicle program--with its emphasis on \nsharing development costs with industry and its goal of moving our \nnational space transportation system toward privatization--seems a \nviable concept worth pursuing.\n  The bill also authorizes the New Millennium initiative to develop new \nmicrominiature technologies aimed at reducing the cost and development \ntimes for satellites, and provides funding for two infrared astronomy \nprograms to help us better understand the vast universe in which we \nlive.\n  Mr. President, radar satellites are one of the most important new \ntechnologies in satellite remote sensing. In recognition of that, S. \n1048 authorizes a new radar satellite program and a third shuttle \nflight for the shuttle imaging radar ``C'' satellite. Because radar \nsatellites have the ability to ``see'' through cloud cover, they will \ndramatically enhance the capability of America's existing optical-based \nsatellite systems such as Landsat. Japan and Europe already operate \nradar satellite systems, and Canada is set to deploy one later this \nyear. To maintain our scientific leadership as well as protect our \nnational security, the United States must not get left behind in this \ncritical technology.\n  In my role as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, it has \nbecome apparent to me that small city, rural States like my home State \nof South Dakota are often forgotten in our vast $70 billion Federal \nscience and technology enterprise. That part of America wants to be \npart of the technological revolution. More importantly, it wants to \ncontribute.\n  It is in the national interest to strengthen the scientific talent, \nresources, and infrastructure in our rural States through appropriate \nresearch, education, and outreach activities. The bill attempts to \naccomplish this in several ways. It increases funding for the \nExperimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research Program [EPSCoR] \nfrom its current level of $4.9 to $6.9 million. NASA's EPSCoR Program, \nas well as similar programs in six other science agencies, have been \ninstrumental in providing Federal funding for quality academic research \nin rural States. Our bill also funds a rural teacher resource center, a \nrural technology transfer and commercialization center, and a regional \nscience education and outreach center for the Plains States region.\n  Mr. President, I believe NASA is up to the challenge of keeping \nAmerica preeminent in aeronautics and space despite the intense budget \npressure and despite the increasing competition from other spacefaring \nnations. It is my belief this authorization bill provides NASA with the \nsupport it needs to meet that challenge.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues for their contributions and support and \nI urge the Senate to pass S. 1048 as amended.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1048, \nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act, \nfiscal year 1996. While both the administration and I have some \nconcerns with this bill, it is in general a ringing endorsement of the \nbipartisan space and aeronautics programs and a strong statement in \nsupport of our Nation's future in space.\n  The bill strongly supports the space station and funds NASA's most \nimportant new satellite initiative, Mission to Planet Earth. It \nauthorizes full funding for research on reusable launch vehicles, and \nsupports the important Cassini and Mars Surveyor projects. It also \nfully authorizes the President's requested funding for aeronautical \nresearch and technology, thus continuing the industry-government \npartnership that is so vital to the long-term strength of our vital \naircraft industry.\n  In addition, the bill requires the NASA Administrator to conduct a \nstudy of the feasibility of privatizing the space shuttle--an important \nstep in the on-going debate about how to reduce shuttle costs and \nbureaucracy without jeopardizing safety or Government requirements. And \nI am proud that the bill continues the small but very valuable NASA \nExperimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research [EPSCOR]. I also \nsupport the bill's authorization for the Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation at the Transportation Department, and the title III \namendments that will update the important Commercial Space Launch Act.\n  Mr. President, the administration does have several concerns about \nthe NASA portions of this bill. The most important concerns the bill's \nproposed $200 million reduction in shuttle funding. NASA is committed \nto reducing shuttle costs over time, but the agency is concerned that \nthe assumption that $200 million can be cut in 1 year is unrealistic. \nThe second is the administration's concern about several other cuts the \nbill makes, including funding cuts for the gravity probe-B satellite \nproject, high-performance computing in the aeronautical program, and a \n$100 million reduction in the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System \nReplenishment Program. Third, the administration also objects to the \n$123 million in new, unrequested projects authorized by the bill. I \nbelieve that these are all important issues, and I will discuss them \nfurther with Chairman Pressler and Chairman Burns as S. 1048 moves \nthrough the legislative process.\n  Overall, however, there is much to commend in this bill. I commend \nChairman Pressler and Chairman Burns for their dedication to NASA \nissues and for working with us on this legislation. I support S. 1048 \nand its strong endorsement of our Nation's space and aeronautical \nobjectives, and I urge our colleagues to join me in voting for it.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I stand in support of bill, S. 1048, \nthe NASA authorization bill for fiscal year 1996 which I have \nenthusiastically cosponsored. The bill authorizes a total of $13.8 \nbillion for the agency, a 3-percent decrease from the requested level \nof $14.26 billion. That funding should allow NASA to continue the \nimportant missions already underway such as space station, mission to \nplanet Earth, and the aeronautics and space science programs. It should \nalso prepare NASA for the future by authorizing several new missions, \nsuch as an effort to develop a shuttle replacement and a new radar \nsatellite program.\n  Mr. President, as you know, we are in a budget crisis and NASA \ndeserves a great deal of credit as one of few Federal agencies to \nrespond to it early and responsibly. In 3 years, NASA cut the space \nshuttle budget from $4 billion to $3.1 billion. It developed a redesign \nof space station that was $5 billion less expensive than the earlier \nspace station Freedom concept. Mission to planet Earth has been reduced \nfrom a $17 billion armada of satellites to a $7 billion focused \nsatellite system. Earlier this year, faced with the prospect of deep \ncongressional budget cuts across Government, NASA took the initiative \nand developed a plan to cut $5 billion in 5 years, without reducing \nprogram content.\n  But NASA did not stop there. This year, it conducted a comprehensive \nzero-based review of all of its activities and programs to achieve even \ngreater savings. That review looked at a broad \n\n[[Page S 15305]]\nrange of money-saving measures such as workforce reductions, \nelimination of redundant activities, consolidation of functions, and \noperating more efficiently. I understand that, within the \nadministration, NASA's efforts are often cited as the model for \nreinventing Government.\n  After 3 consecutive years of substantial budget cuts, NASA is now \ndown to the bone. To require additional reductions would force NASA to \ncancel important space programs, close vital facilities, or layoff \nessential skilled personnel. That would decimate the Nation's science \nand technology base. Equally important, it would decimate the morale of \nthe good men and women who have made our space program the subject of \nmovies like ``Apollo 13'' and inspired thousands of scientists, \nengineers, and schoolchildren across our country.\n  It is time to give NASA the support it needs to face the challenges \nof the future. This NASA authorization bill is designed to do just \nthat.\n  The bill provides the full $2.1 billion requested level for space \nstation. This program is NASA's most costly, complex, and controversial \nactivity and we are all aware of the many criticisms leveled against \nit. However, space station is precisely the kind of bold vision that \nNASA was created to pursue. Space station will enable the United States \nand the international science community to conduct unique microgravity \nresearch and expand our knowledge about humans' ability to live and \nwork in space. If past missions are any indication, the space station \nwill undoubtedly yield breakthroughs in biomedicine and advanced \nmaterials. We can probably also expect exciting spinoffs just as past \nspace missions have spawned microelectronics, pacemakers, advance water \nfiltration systems, communications, and many other products and \nservices we now take for granted.\n  I am a strong station supporter and the funding provided in the bill \nwill keep the program on track for a first element launch in 1997.\n  The bill also provides full funding for Mission to Planet Earth. \nMission to Planet Earth is NASA's $7 billion satellite program aimed at \nstudying how the oceans, land, and atmosphere work as a system in order \nto understand and predict global climate change. For those of us \nrepresenting farm States, weather and water are our lifeblood. Mission \nto Planet Earth promises dramatic improvements in our ability to \npredict climate change and manage our scarce water resources. If those \nexpectations are met, the program will easily pay for itself in lives \nand property saved and improved water management.\n  Mr. President, in my view, one of the most important areas within \nNASA is aeronautics--the first ``A'' in NASA. For many years, \naeronautics seemed to be reduced to a small ``a'' status. It always \nseemed to take a back seat to the higher profile space missions. \nHowever, under Dan Goldin's leadership, that is beginning to change and \nNASA is giving aeronautics the backing it deserves.\n  To me, the aeronautics research is critical to maintaining U.S. \ntechnological leadership and aerospace competitiveness. For instance, \nthe High-Speed Research Program is developing precompetitive \ntechnologies in support of supersonic aircraft. It is estimated that \nthe first country to market such an aircraft stands to gain $200 \nbillion in sales and 140,000 new jobs. Similarly, the Advanced Subsonic \nTechnology Program funds research in support of subsonic airplanes--a \nmarket that generates 1 million jobs and contributes over $25 billion \nannually to the U.S. trade balance. These programs are moneymakers and \nit is in the national interest to give them the support they need. \nAccordingly, our NASA bill authorizes aeronautics research at the \nrequested level of $891 million for fiscal year 1996.\n  As a final point, Mr. President, I note that the bill also authorizes \na collection of activities and initiatives designed to extend NASA's \nvision to include our rural States. Our rural States can make an \nenormous contribution to the civilian space program if only given the \nchance. For example, in May, Prof. Steve Running of the University of \nMontana testified before the Science Subcommittee about his efforts to \nuse remote sensing satellite data in forest and crop management. To \nembrace our rural States in our space program, the bill contains a $2 \nmillion increase for the EPSCoR Program, which funds important research \nin our rural States. It also funds another rural teacher resource \ncenter to the existing nine centers, as well as an additional rural \ntechnology transfer and commercialization center, to fill in coverage \ngaps in those two programs.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this bill provides NASA with the \nsupport it requires to continue and build on its important work in \nspace and aeronautics and I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my colleague from Michigan, Senator Abraham \nand I would like to engage the chairman of the Senate Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation in a brief colloquy concerning \nthe treatment of the Consortium for International Earth Sciences \nInformation Network [CIESIN] is S. 1048.\n  The committee's report suggests that funding for CIESIN should be \neliminated since it is,\n\n     . . . an activity which was deemed largely irrelevant to \n     NASA's goals and missions and which has been severely \n     criticized in the past by NASA's Inspector General.\n\n  Unfortunately, the committee report's assertion is based on the draft \ninspector general's [IG] report. The final version of the IG's report \nstates:\n\n       By rescoping CIESIN's mission to include only SEDAC-related \n     activities, NASA now possesses the necessary expertise to \n     manage CIESIN. Because the context within which SEDAC will \n     operate is data management and integration, NASA is more \n     uniquely qualified for this role than any other federal \n     agency.\n\n  Further, NASA itself, in a letter from the Associate Administrator \nfor Mission to Planet Earth to the president of CIESIN (July 6, 1995), \nstates:\n\n       The contribution CIESIN has made toward information \n     technology and access to environmental data are highly \n     beneficial to NASA and to society.\n\n  There are many more examples which I can provide that directly and \nfactually challenge the committee report's assertion. We would \nappreciate the chairman's clarification of these statements.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I appreciate the remarks of the senior Senator from \nMichigan and the information he has provided. I understand that the \nNASA IG's final report does not make any recommendation regarding \ntermination of CIESIN's EOS related activities and finds CIESIN's SEDAC \nactivity well within the goals of the EOS and EOSDIS programs.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to touch on a related \nsubject. During consideration of H.R. 2099, the VA, HUD, and \nindependent agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 1996, I \nprovided to the distinguished subcommittee chairman, Senator Bond, a \nbrief summary of the value of CIESIN's work for NASA.\n  CIESIN is one of NASA's nine Distributed Active Archive Centers \n[DAAC's] supporting the Earth Observing System Data and Information \nSystem. CIESIN is the only one that provides integrated socioeconomic \ndata access for the study of the affect society has upon the \nenvironment. This is a unique capability and one that NASA officials \nconsider vital to EOS. As the distinguished manager of the bill may \nknow, the Senate's version of H.R. 2099 advises NASA to integrate \nCIESIN into the EOS plan for 1996.\n  Obviously, CIESIN's SEDAC activity is hardly irrelevant to NASA's \nmission and should not be eliminated, as proposed in the committee's \nreport. And, CIESIN's valuable skills and expertise may be of use to \nNASA in non-SEDAC ares or to other Federal agencies. The House's NASA \nauthorization bill explicitly provides that CIESIN will not be \nprecluded from receiving contracts awarded following a full and open \ncompetition and that the rights of any parties under existing contracts \nshall not be affected. This language would allow CIESIN to compete for \nNASA or any other Federal agency grants or contracts.\n  Would the chairman be able to support this non-controversial \nlanguage?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I understand the Senator's point and will certainly \nwork in conference to obtain similar language in the final bill \nregarding CIESIN's ability to bid on contracts.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I appreciate the Senator's assistance.\n  \n[[Page S 15306]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would also like to add my thanks for the manager's \nconsideration.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to express my serious reservations \nconcerning section 205 of the NASA authorization bill S. 1048. This \nprovision authorizes the conveyance of approximately 1,200 acres of \nFederal property, including all improvements and any personal property \nlocated there to the State of Mississippi. Additionally this provision \nprovides $10 million in transition assistance to the State of \nMississippi. Would the distinguished chairman of the Committee, Senator \nPressler, care to discuss this issue with me?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I would be pleased to discuss this issue with my friend \nfrom Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank my friend. This provision concerns me because it \nskirts existing law, namely the Federal Property Act, which governs the \nprocess by which the Federal Government disposes of excess property. \nThe Federal Property Act sets up a process designed to ensure that \ntaxpayers--who footed the bill to acquire the property as well as the \nbuildings and personal property associated with it--get the best return \non their investment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I agree with the Senator that the Federal Property Act \nhelps ensure that the taxpayers interest are protected.\n  Mr. GLENN. In particular, the Property Act helps to ensure that we \navoid the situation of one agency of Government giving property away, \nwhile another agency, unbeknownst to the first, may be trying to \nacquire similar property. Now, Mr. President, I cannot say that such a \nsituation is happening in this case. We simply cannot say for sure \nbecause no screening has taken place. However, we have encountered such \nsituations in the past, and I can assure my colleagues, that in such \ncircumstances, the taxpayer ends up on the short end of the stick.\n  One of the main purposes of the Federal Property Act is to ensure \nthat, before Federal property is determined to be excess, a screening \nperiod occur during which time other Federal agencies have an \nopportunity to show that they have a compelling need for the property. \nThe General Services Administration, the property management experts in \nthe Federal Government, coordinate this screening. If no Federal agency \nspeaks up during the screening process, then the property is made \navailable to the States and other eligible nonprofit organizations. Can \nmy friend from South Dakota tell me whether or not the Yellow Creek \nproperty has undergone my formal, or even informal, screening? If so, \nwhat have been the results?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. No formal screening has occurred. However, NASA \ncontacted the following agencies which it believed could make use of \nthe Yellow Creek facilities: the Department of the Air Force, the \nDepartment of the Navy, the Department of the Army, the Department of \nEnergy, and the Environmental Protection Agency. After much discussion \nbetween NASA and these parties, none of these agencies indicated that \nit could make use of this facility.\n  Mr. GLENN. Would the Senator agree that it is in the best interest of \nthe United States and the taxpayer that some form of informal Federal \nscreening by the General Services Administration be conducted--in an \nexpedited fashion, no more than 30 days--to assure us that other \nFederal agencies cannot make use of this facility?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I agree that such action would be in the best interests \nof all taxpayers.\n  Mr. GLENN. Finally I would ask my colleague whether he has an \nestimate of the market value of the real and personal property which is \ncovered in this section?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. It is my understanding, based on information from NASA \nthat the breakdown of the market value of the real and personal \nproperty at the site is: Land--$3.8 million based on a recent \nappraisal; fixed assets, buildings--about $10 million in market value \nbecause of their uniqueness to rocket manufacture, their completion \nstatus, and location; personal property--about $10 to $15 million in \nmarket value, some of which is so unique to rocket manufacture that it \ncan only be sold as scrap.\n  However because of the limited purposes for which the property can be \nused, these figures may somewhat overestimate the real market value of \nthe property.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank my colleague and look forward to working with him \nto address this issue as this bill moves into conference with the other \nbody.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the committee substitute, as amended, be agreed \nto, the bill be deemed to have been read a third time and passed, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be placed in the appropriate place in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2939) was agreed to.\n  The committee substitute, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1048) was deemed read for a third time and passed; as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 1048\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 177, \nreported today by the Judiciary Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 177) to designate October 19, 1995, \n     National Mammography Day.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues in \noffering this important resolution to designate October 19, 1995 as \n``National Mammography Day.'' I am pleased to support this effort to \nset aside 1 day in the midst of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month \nto increase awareness about the best method of reducing the breast \ncancer mortality rate--early detection by mammography.\n  This frightening disease has taken the lives of far too many women, \nincluding many of my own friends. It is one of the leading killers of \nwomen--claiming the lives of more than 46,000 women each year. Breast \ncancer is a growing public health problem in this Nation, and a great \nthreat to women's health.\n  We can all agree that more must be done to educate us about the \nrisks, prevention and treatment of breast cancer. I also believe we \nmust be vigilant in supporting continued research on breast cancer, and \nclear up the mixed messages that women receive about ways to protect \nthemselves from this disease.\n  But, there is one indisputable fact that is very clear: early \ndetection by mammography saves women's lives. Mammograms can detect 90 \nto 95 percent of all breast cancers and is the most reliable method of \ndetection. In addition, and perhaps the most tragic feature of this \ndisease--9 out of 10 women could survive breast cancer if detected \nearly and treated properly.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that education and awareness are \nsome of our best tools for fighting this disease; combined with \ncontinued research and treatment breakthroughs. This day is critical in \nour efforts to win the battle against breast cancer. We owe it to our \nmothers; our daughters; our sisters; our neighbors and our friends to \nget the word out--early detection can save your life. And we must not \nlet our efforts diminish; every month should be Breast Cancer Awareness \nMonth.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues for expressing their commitment \nto saving women's lives, and for paying particular attention to raising \nawareness about the importance of mammography. I encourage all of you \nto support this resolution, and help us protect women from the tragedy \nof breast cancer.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleagues \nin recognizing today, October 19, as National Mammography Day.\n  Today, 500 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Most likely, \neach will be frightened, uncertain about her future, and in search of a \ntreatment that, if it cannot cure her, will at least prolong her life. \nEach woman's family and friends, co-workers and caregivers, will worry \ndeeply about her.\n  Today, 150 women will die of breast cancer. Their lives will be ended \nprematurely. Their families and friends, coworkers and caregivers will \nbe grief-stricken.\n  Tragically, today's numbers are every day's numbers in our Nation. \nListen to the enormity of this disease: one out of nine women will get \nbreast cancer; since 1960 nearly 1 million women have died from this \ndisease. With their deaths, millions of their loved ones, including \nchildren and aging parents dependent on them, have suffered as well. We \nstagger under these numbers, as we search for the causes and the cure.\n  All women are at risk for breast cancer, with the incidence \nincreasing among older women and the mortality rate higher for African-\nAmerican women. While other factors that may put women at risk are \nbeing thoroughly investigated, we are still ourselves at risk for \nfeeling helpless in the face of this killer.\n  However, we do have one sure thing to offer to women and today we \nbring that to national attention. With mammography, we offer the \npossibility of \n\n[[Page S 15312]]\nearly detection. Along with breast self-examination, this is one of the \nbest steps women can take for themselves in the fight against breast \ncancer. And it is the single best service our health care system can \nmake available to all women in this struggle. Offering this service is \nnot enough. We must also assure the quality of the service, especially \nthe equipment used.\n  Early detection made possible by mammography is wise health care. \nWith early detection we can reduce the mortality rate by one-third. \nFurthermore, early discovery of the disease allows for less radical and \nless costly treatments. Equally important, with the provision of \nmammography, we say to American women that we understand the trauma of \nthis disease and will persist in efforts to triumph over it.\n  Remembering that these women are our wives, sisters, mothers, \ndaughters, and friends, I am proud to add my voice in recognition of \nNational Mammography Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15311-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL MAMMOGRAPHY DAY\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today, I would like to call attention to a \nday of critical importance to women across this Nation--National \nMammography Day.\n  America's women are facing a devastating crisis, and its name is \nbreast cancer.\n  It is a devastating crisis that targets women's lives, their \nconfidence in health care, their work, their friends and their \nfamilies.\n  It is a crisis that results in approximately 182,000 new cases of \nbreast cancer being diagnosed each year, and 46,000 deaths.\n  Breast cancer is a crisis that has become the most common form of \ncancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American \nwomen--an estimated 2.6 million in the United States are living with \nbreast cancer, 1.6 million have been diagnosed, and an estimated 1 \nmillion women do not yet know they have breast cancer.\n  It is a crisis in which one out of eight women in our country will \ncome to develop breast cancer in their lifetimes--a risk that was one \nout of 14 in 1960. In fact, this year, a new case of breast cancer will \nbe diagnosed every 3 minutes, and a woman will die from breast cancer \nevery 11 minutes.\n  It is a crisis that has tragically claimed the lives of almost 1 \nmillion women of all ages and backgrounds since 1960. This is more than \ntwo times the number of all Americans who have died in World War I, \nWorld War II, the Korean war, the Vietnam war, and the Persian Gulf \nwar, and 48 percent of these deaths occurred in the past 10 years \nalone.\n  Finally, it is a crisis that has become the leading cause of death \nfor women aged 40 to 44, and the leading cause of cancer death in women \naged 25 to 54.\n  But what really hits home for this Senator is the fact that my mother \ndied of breast cancer when I was only 9 years old, as well as the fact \nthat 900 Maine women were diagnosed with breast cancer last year.\n  This is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among Maine women, and \nthis represents more than 30 percent of all new cancers among women in \nMaine.\n  We all know these statistics, we live with them every day of our \nlives and face them with a growing concern and deepening sorrow, and \nthey are a constant reminder of the work that remains to be done.\n  But we know that they represent more than just numbers--each number \nrepresents the life of a mother, sister, grandmother, aunt, daughter, \nwife, friend, or co-worker. They are the fabric of our families, our \ncommunities, our States and our Nation.\n  As a former co-chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, \nI have joined other members of that caucus in working diligently to \nbring the respect and action that is needed to the struggle against \nbreast cancer.\n  In past years, we have introduced and passed vital legislation to \nhelp us win this struggle--and that has included the Women's Health \nEquity Act, which in 1993 included the National Breast Cancer Strategy \nAct, which established a National Breast Cancer Commission--an \ninteragency office on breast cancer--and authorizes $300 million for \nincreased breast cancer research at NIH.\n  The WHEA also contained the Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality \nPrevention Act Reauthorization, which provides much-needed grants to \nStates for mammograms and pap-smears for low-income women and was \npassed by Congress and signed into law in late 1993.\n  And we also passed the NIH Revitalization Act, which authorized \nincreased funding for clinical research on breast, cervical and other \nreproductive cancers in women.\n  But these are just the first steps in our crusade to find a cure for \nbreast cancer and to bring relief and comfort to its victims and their \nfamilies.\n  Our fight goes on. We need more funding. We need more research. We \nneed more education and awareness of breast cancer and its causes. We \nneed more understanding. We need more compassion. And we need a cure.\n  Yet despite these frightening statistics, we know that with early \ndetection and regular screening, a survival rate of over 90 percent can \nbe achieved. Unfortunately, these statistics reveal that not enough \nwomen are taking advantage of preventive measures with proven \nbenefits--such as mammograms. In fact, the Director of the National \nCancer Institute announced yesterday that ``one of the biggest barriers \nto reducing breast cancer mortality is lack of information.''\n  Given that such a promising survival rate is associated with early \ndetection and treatment, it is essential that we be relentless in our \nefforts to increase public awareness of this terrible disease. The \nlives of our mothers, daughters, sisters and friends may well depend on \nour ability to educate them about the importance of mammograms.\n  This year, I submitted Senate Concurrent Resolution 8, expressing the \nsense of Congress on the need for accurate guidelines for breast cancer \nscreening for women ages 40-49. However, on this day, National \nMammography Day, there are things we can all do to ensure there are no \nmore victims of breast cancer, but only survivors. Talk to the women in \nyour family and your home States about the importance of breast cancer \nscreening. Tell them to arrange for a physical, including a clinical \nbreast exam. Tell them to schedule a mammogram for themselves or a \nloved one. Talk to them. Talk to them today. Tell them not to wait.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe resolution appear in the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 177) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 177\n\n       Whereas, according to the American Cancer Society, one \n     hundred eighty-two thousand women will be diagnosed with \n     breast cancer in 1995, and forty-six thousand women will die \n     from this disease;\n       Whereas, in the decade of the 1990's, it is estimated that \n     about two million women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, \n     resulting in nearly five hundred thousand deaths;\n       Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with \n     a woman at age seventy having twice as much of a chance of \n     developing the disease than a woman at age fifty.\n       Whereas 80 percent of the women who get breast cancer have \n     no family history of the disease;\n       Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at a \n     certified facility, can provide a safe and quick diagnosis;\n       Whereas experts agree that mammography is the best method \n     of early detection of breast cancer, and early detection is \n     the key to saving lives; and\n       Whereas mammograms can reveal the presence of small cancers \n     of up to two years or more before regular clinical breast \n     examination or breast self-examination (BSE), saving as many \n     as one-third more lives: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designate October 19, 1995 as \n     ``National Mammography Day.'' The Senate requests that the \n     President issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the \n     United States to observe such day with appropriate programs \n     and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15312-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15312-S15313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            REFERRAL OF AMTRAK APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM.

Mr. President, today I rise before the Senate to \ncomment on some of the provisions of the legislation to be reported out \nof the Senate Finance Committee.\n  I want to start out by asking a simple question: Why are we reducing \nrevenue and investment in Medicare and medical assistance and higher \neducation and other programs, which are critical to communities and \npeople in Minnesota and all across the country, before going after some \nof the tax breaks for special interests that have been embedded in the \ntax code for decades?\n  If we are serious about deficit reduction, it seems to me that all \nthese loopholes and deductions and giveaways ought to also be on the \ntable.\n  Mr. President, what kind of priorities are these that are reflected \nin this bill? They are certainly not the priorities of the people I \nrepresent, who understand the value of having funding available to take \ncare of elderly people, understand the value of taking care of \nvulnerable people who are in nursing homes, of boosting kids' chances \nto go to college, of helping struggling families enter the middle \nclass, of ensuring that elderly people can afford health care, of \nmaking sure that children have adequate nutrition. It makes no sense at \nall, Mr. President.\n  After days of closed-door meetings, this week Republicans on the \ncommittee announced their proposal for a $245 billion tax cut. Taken as \na whole, this proposal includes serious reductions and cuts in Medicare \nand Medicaid and, in addition, includes some enormous new tax breaks \nfor wealthy corporations and others, further worsening our budget \ncrisis.\n  Mr. President, instead of scaling back billions of dollars in tax \nbreaks, it provides billions for firms with high-powered tax lobbyists \nand almost nothing for working families.\n  In fact, by slashing the earned income tax credit for working \nfamilies by over $42 billion, this legislation will greatly increase \nthe tax burden on millions of citizens throughout the country.\n  In my State of Minnesota, there will be an increase of taxes for \n172,740 Minnesota taxpayers. Mr. President, these are low- and \nmoderate-income families that are trying to work their way into the \nmiddle class.\n  At the same time, the bill makes only a tiny, token effort to \npartially scale back a few loopholes in the Tax Code. And the proceeds \nfrom these modest changes are, in turn, used to subsidize new and much \nbigger tax breaks precisely for those taxpayers in the Nation who least \nneed them.\n  For example, it relaxes the alternative minimum tax that was \nestablished in 1986. What was the idea back then? The idea was that \nlarge and profitable corporations, often multinational corporations, \nafter taking a variety of different deductions and credits and \nexclusions, still are going to have to pay some minimum tax. It is a \npart of fairness. Now what we have is a provision to scale that back. \nThat provision ought to be struck from this piece of legislation. It is \ntruly outrageous.\n  If you ask people in the country, ``Do you believe that tax cuts \nshould be a priority while at the same time we are trying to reduce the \ndeficit?'' most would say--and the polls bear this out--``No.'' If you \nask people, ``Do you believe that tax breaks for large, profitable \ncorporations ought to be expanded rather than scaled back?'' virtually \nevery single Minnesotan would say, ``No.'' Even so, that is exactly \nwhat the Finance Committee is about the business of doing.\n  I offered an amendment on the budget resolution earlier this year to \nrequire that the Senate Finance Committee close $70 billion of tax \nloopholes over the next several years. That amendment was defeated. \nNext week, or the following week when we take up the reconciliation \nbill, I intend to have specific proposals and amendments on the floor \nto close tax loopholes, with up-or-down votes.\n  If we are going to have the deficit reduction, if we are going to pay \nthe interest on the debt--all of which we agree on--there ought to be a \nstandard of fairness. And rather than focusing so much on the cuts in \nMedicare and medical assistance, rather than focusing on cuts in \nbenefits for veterans, rather than causing great pain for children and \nthe most vulnerable in our country, it seems to me it is not too much \nto ask that large corporations, wealthy corporations, pay their fair \nshare. That is why we ought to plug some of these narrowly focused tax \nbreaks and loopholes which allow the privileged few to escape paying \ntheir fair share, focusing on other people and forcing other people to \npay higher taxes to make up the difference. This is a question of \nfairness. If you are going to have sacrifice, it ought to be equitable \nsacrifice.\n  Let me make a point here that is often overlooked. We can spend money \njust as easily through the Tax Code, through tax breaks, as we can \nthrough the normal appropriations process. Spending is spending, \nwhether it comes in the form of a Government check or whether it is a \ntax break for some special purpose like a subsidy, a credit, a \ndeduction, accelerated depreciation--you name it. Some of these tax \nexpenditures are justified, they ought to be kept. But it does seem to \nme that, in a time of tight budgets, in a time when we are focusing on \ndeficit reduction, in a time when we are cutting into nutritional \nprograms for children and higher education and health care and \nenvironmental protection, why in the world are not the tax subsidies \nfor the large pharmaceutical companies and oil companies and tobacco \ncompanies and insurance companies and you name it, why are they not on \nthe table?\n  Various groups, from all ideological perspectives, from the National \nTaxpayers Union to the Cato Institute to the Progressive Policy \nInstitute to Citizens for Tax Justice, have prepared a list of tax \nloopholes and other subsidies which they believe should be eliminated. \nBut, despite the logic of their approach, which is a Minnesota standard \nof fairness, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have chosen \nthe path of least political resistance: Slash the programs for the \nvulnerable elderly, slash the programs for the vulnerable poor, slash \nthe earned-income tax credit, slash the programs for child care, slash \nthe programs for middle-income people. But when it comes to these \nlarge, multinational corporate interests who march on Washington every \nday, the big players, the heavy hitters, people who have the lobbyists, \nfor some reason, we do not ask them to tighten their belts at all.\n  It is only fair that this be a part of the agenda. So I want to just \noutline very briefly some of the areas on which I want to focus the \nattention of my colleagues next week. Let me give but a few examples.\n  I already talked about the minimum tax. The effort is to scale that \nback for certain corporations. That's wrong. Everybody ought to pay \nsome minimum tax.\n  Second, let me talk about expensing for the oil and gas industry. \nThis has been a special break for this industry. They get to expense \ntheir oil and gas exploration costs, instead of depreciating them over \ntime. It is an expensive tax benefit for this industry. Why should the \noil and gas industry receive special treatment in the Tax Code which is \nnot generally available to other companies and industries? It is a \nsimple question. If we are about the business of deficit reduction, we \nought to close this loophole.\n  Or take section 936, the Puerto Rico tax credit that has been debated \nin some detail in recent years. The Finance Committee has finally \nacknowledged there ought to be some change. But what it does is it \nrepeals this over a fairly long period of time, 7 years or so, with \ngenerous transition benefits for corporations in the interim period. If \nwe are going to repeal it, I think what we have to do is move as \nquickly as possible. It simply makes no sense. For those who support a \nflatter tax or a fairer tax or tax justice and think we ought to make \nthe cuts and ought to do the belt tightening, this ought to be on the \ntable. \n\n[[Page S 15314]]\n\n  Or consider the special exclusion for foreign-earned income that has \nbeen in this code for decades. This little gem will cost taxpayers \nbetween $8 and $9 billion over the next 5 years. If you are a U.S. \ncitizen living abroad, you get an exclusion of taxation for the first \n$70,000 you make. You get an exclusion of taxation on the first $70,000 \nyou make. So, if you make $170,000, you do not pay anything on $70,000 \nof that. Again, let us talk about a standard of fairness and let us \nmake some of these cuts, not just based upon the path of least \npolitical resistance, but on the basis of a path of some fairness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator from \nMinnesota that his 10 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have 3 \nmore minutes to conclude my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there is a provision right now on some \nof the corporate-owned life insurance that has generated some \nopposition from the insurance industry and large employers. Frankly, it \nhad been abused. I refer my colleagues to an article by Allan Sloan, \n``Companies Find a Premium Way To Take an Unjustified Tax Break.'' He \ntalks about Wal-Mart taking out this insurance on virtually all their \nemployees. The money does not go to their employees as beneficiaries, \nbut Wal-Mart gets to take a deduction on whatever money they put into \nthe insurance for every single employee. Again, we are talking about \nlosing billions of dollars over the years. I am going to be talking \nabout this at some great length when we finally get down to the debate \non this reconciliation bill and when we finally get down to the point \nwhere the rubber meets the road.\n  These are about four or five examples. I intend to come to the floor \nwith at least some of these specific provisions. What I am going to be \nsaying to my colleagues is: Look, eliminate them. Because what happens \nis, when these companies or these citizens who do not need this \nassistance get these kind of breaks, other citizens end up having to \npay more taxes. It is not fair. It is not tax fairness. And, in \naddition, it is an expenditure of Government money that we can no \nlonger afford. That is what it amounts to.\n  If we are going to do the deficit reduction, we ought to do it on the \nbasis of a standard of fairness. I ask the question one more time, by \nway of conclusion today. How come we are focusing so much on the \nelderly? How come we are focusing so much on the children? How come we \nare focusing so much on health care? How come we are focusing so much \non working families, low- and moderate-income families? How come we are \nstripping away environmental protection? How come we are stripping away \nsome basic consumer safety provisions that are important to all of the \ncitizens of this country, but at the same time, when it comes to some \nof this corporate welfare, some of these outrageous breaks that go to \nsome of the largest corporations in America and throughout the world \nthat are just doing fine and can afford to tighten their belts, they \nare not asked to be a part of the sacrifice?\n  These votes next week will be a litmus test of whether or not \nDemocrats and Republicans are serious about deficit reduction based \nupon a standard of fairness. I look forward to the debate.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of any colleagues here, I ask unanimous \nconsent that morning business be extended for an additional 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. Without objection, morning business is extended for an \nadditional 7 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I also want to speak on one other \nmatter that I think is very important to the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator that his \npreviously granted time has expired. Does the Senator wish additional \ntime?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 7 minutes to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for \nan additional 7 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I also rise today to strongly oppose \ndrilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge [ANWR]. This has been \nan issue that I have been involved in from the time I first came to the \nSenate. There was a filibuster over ANWR that I led when I was here \njust a short period of time and now ANWR is back again. The Energy \nCommittee has voted, over the objections of a large bipartisan group of \nSenators, to open up ANWR for drilling and to use the revenue to meet \nreconciliation instructions. I note a letter from former President Bush \nto my distinguished colleague from Alaska, that is on everybody's desk, \nsupporting this.\n  I am both aware of and respectful of the need to balance the budget. \nThat is why I have stood here on the Senate floor and voted for many \nspending cuts.\n  But there are other ways and measures that do not balance the budget \nat the expense of our natural resources. Unfortunately, though, all I \nsee is big industry, oil companies included, winning big, and our \nnatural resources losing big.\n  This is poor energy policy, poor environmental policy, and it is \npolitics that in many ways I think is profoundly wrongheaded and even \ncynical.\n  First, let me talk about energy policy. The argument is that drilling \nin ANWR will lessen our reliance on foreign oil, but we do not really \nknow whether there even is oil in ANWR. And if there is, we do not know \nhow much. The latest numbers from the U.S. Geological Survey suggest \nthat it is, at best, 4 million to 5 million barrels. This is equal to 1 \nyear's worth of U.S. oil consumption. That is no long-term solution to \nenergy dependence, and dependence on foreign oil.\n  Furthermore, there is a mixed message. At the same time proponents of \nANWR say that we ought to lessen our dependence on foreign oil, they \nare pushing to lift the North Slope oil export ban and selling off oil \nreserves in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  I do not see how it is possible to make the argument for drilling in \nANWR, at the same time that we are exporting some of our oil. It is \njust inconsistent, and it is bad energy policy.\n  The discussion about ANWR supplying jobs is also way off the mark. If \nyou just look at some statistics from the American Council for an \nEnergy Efficient Economy, they estimate that by the year 2010, we could \ngenerate 1.1 million jobs, by getting serious about saved energy and \nefficient energy use, which makes far more sense.\n  Now, let me talk about environmental policy. The Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge is one of this country's greatest treasures. The \npreservation of this land and its plants and its animals and the way of \nlife they support is vital. ANWR contains the Nation's most significant \npolar bear denning habitat on land, supports 300,000 snow geese, \nmigratory birds from six continents, and a concentrated porcupine \ncaribou calving ground.\n  Given all that ANWR has to offer, I am appalled that many of my \ncolleagues are willing to drill in ANWR without the usual procedure of \nan Environmental Impact Statement as required by current law. I pushed \nin committee to have such an environmental impact statement but my \namendment was defeated. When it was being considered, my colleagues \nasked me how it would affect scoring. This points to exactly what is \ngoing on here: We are selling important environmental protections, and \nwe are mortgaging the environment for a momentary short-run budgetary \ngain.\n  Mr. President, finally, let me just make a concluding point. For \nthousands of years, the Gwich'in people have relied on the porcupine \ncaribou to provide their food and meet their spiritual needs. I have \nheard them speak very eloquently and directly about what oil drilling \nin ANWR would do to their way of life. In fact, many of them may have \nto leave a way of life they have practiced for thousands of years if \ndrilling in ANWR happens.\n  This is a one-sided battle. People like the Gwich'in want to save the \nenvironment. But they are not the big oil companies. They do not have \nthe money. They do not have the lobbyists, and they do not have the \nlawyers here every day.\n  I believe, once again, to open up ANWR to oil drilling through the \nback door of the budgetary process is profoundly mistaken. It is not \nthe basis on \n\n[[Page S 15315]]\nwhich we should make this decision, and I think it would be a huge \nmistake for this Nation.\n  Our natural resources are among the most important things we can \nleave to future generations. Those resources are in our care. Our \nchildren and our grandchildren--we keep talking about our children and \nour grandchildren--deserve more than what this bad energy policy, bad \nenvironmental policy, and shortsighted politicking would leave them.\n  I urge my colleagues to support an amendment to the reconciliation \nbill to strike the provision opening ANWR to drilling. It is time to \nget our priorities right, and if we are serious about doing well for \nour children and our grandchildren, we will make the protection of the \nenvironment and the protection of ANWR our very highest priority.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15313-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SUPPORTING DAY OF CONFRONTING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of observing a Day of \nConfronting Violence Against Women and this week as a Week Without \nViolence.\n  Widely publicized media reports, especially those most recent, have \nliterally seized the attention of the American public and brought to \nthe forefront alarming instances of violence against women. When I \nlearn that three out of four women will be victims of violence at some \ntime in their life, it makes me angry, as it should every Member of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  This issue should strike each of us at the heart of our homes and \nfamilies. Why? Because we are not just talking about numbers and \nstatistics here, we are talking about our mothers, our sisters, and our \ndaughters. We may even be talking about some of our colleagues. When \nyou consider that every 15 seconds a women is battered in America, four \nwomen have been cruelly beaten since I began my statement only a minute \nago. When every 5 minutes a women is sexually attacked, sadly enough, \none woman's life is forever destroyed by the time I conclude my \nremarks.\n  In our country, one in every four relationships involve physical \nabuse. In my home State, I am sad to say, 250,000 women are abused each \nyear. This is why violence against women is an issue very important to \nme. One of my first acts as Senator was to sign onto Senator Dole's \nViolence Against Women Act. Last year two antistalking amendments I \noffered were adopted by the Senate. They provided for training of \ncriminal justice officials and victims' service providers as well as \nfunding for further research.\n  Most recently, I am proud to have been a cosponsor of an amendment to \nthe fiscal year 1996 Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill to \ntarget an additional $75 million funding to prevent violence against \nwomen--an amendment that was unanimously adopted. It included support \nof counseling and assistance to victims and witnesses to support them \nthroughout the prosecution process of offenders, funding for safe homes \nfor victims of violence, and improving the database that collects \nnationwide information on stalkers.\n  In closing, let me applaud the tireless work of Majority Leader Dole, \nSenators Hatch, Biden, and Snowe and many others to bring an end to \nviolence against women in this country. Even though there have been \nsome tragic setbacks recently, we cannot give up hope. We need to \ncontinue to support these efforts in the Senate and to support women \nwho are victims of violence.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15315-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 927, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 927) to seek international sanctions against \n     the Castro government in Cuba, to plan for support of a \n     transition government leading to a democratically elected \n     government in Cuba, and for other purposes.\n       Pending:\n       Dole amendment No. 2898, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Helms amendment No. 2936 (to amendment No. 2898), to \n     strengthen international sanctions against the Castro \n     government and to support for a free and independent Cuba.\n       Simon modified amendment No. 2934 (to Amendment No. 2936), \n     to protect the constitutional right of Americans to travel to \n     Cuba.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have a couple of amendments that I would \nlike to offer to the pending legislation. I point out we have already \nspent, I guess, 4 or 5 days on this bill, and I think people might \nsuggest probably more time than the legislation deserves, but \nnonetheless it is taking a great deal of time.\n  What I would like to do, if my colleague and chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee would agree, rather than having separate debates on \namendments, I will try to confine my remarks to both amendments--they \nare related, I would say to my colleague from North Carolina--and then \neither have back-to-back votes on them or, if he prefers, I could ask \nunanimous consent that these two amendments be considered as one \namendment for the purpose of a single rollcall vote. Either way is fine \nwith me, and I will yield to my colleague for any particular comment he \nmay have on procedurally how we handle it.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am perfectly willing to have the two \namendments voted en bloc. And I would further ask the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut if he would be willing to enter into a time \nagreement?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to, if he wants. I know some of our colleagues \nhave--there is one other amendment pending, the Simon amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. I believe he needs 20 minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. There is a time agreement.\n  Mr. DODD. Of 20 minutes. I would say 40 minutes, and it may not even \nbe that amount of time necessarily.\n  Mr. HELMS. Forty minutes equally?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask unanimous consent that the time agreement be 40 \nminutes equally divided--on the two amendments?\n  Mr. DODD. That is fine.\n  Mr. HELMS. Very well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments will be \nconsidered en bloc.\n  Mr. DODD. Fine. Mr. President, I will wait to ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 2906 and 2908 to Amendment No. 2936\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the amendments are at the desk. They are \nnumbered 2906 and 2908. I ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendments.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes amendments \n     numbered 2906 and 2908 to amendment No. 2936:\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2906\n\n       On page 23 of the pending amendment beginning with line 18, \n     strike all through line 21 on page 24.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2908\n\n       On page 28 of the pending amendment beginning with line 42, \n     strike all through line 32 on page 32.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me explain, both of these amendments are \nrelated to title II of this bill. \n\n[[Page S 15316]]\n\n  Let me explain both of these amendments. I should begin by thanking \nmy colleague from North Carolina that we have gotten to this point and \nthat we are considering the bill, having dropped title III of the bill.\n  I should, before discussing these two amendments, make clear, having \nread the comments of the distinguished majority leader and others, that \ntitle III of the bill will come back in the bill, I guess, or at least \nthere are threats of that when the House and the Senate go to their \nconference on this legislation. On the assumption that the bill is \npassed out of the Senate, I would just notify my colleagues that if \nthat is the case and it comes back, we will be back in the same \nposition we were in earlier this week where I strongly objected to \ntitle III of the bill and would take appropriate actions if that is the \ncase.\n  I certainly understand and respect the right of the conferees to have \nand decide what they are going to decide, but I would have to also put \nmy colleagues on notice that I would use whatever procedural vehicles \nare available to me as a Member of this body to stop consideration of \nthe legislation if that were to occur.\n  Mr. President, these two amendments, as I mentioned a moment ago, \nstrike portions of title II of the bill that I think unduly hamper the \nability of our country to provide assistance--and let me emphasize \nthis--to a post-Castro government. Title II does not talk about Fidel \nCastro's government in Cuba today. Title II exclusively talks about the \ngovernment that comes after Fidel Castro.\n  So my colleagues who are worried here that they may in some way, if \nthey were to adopt these amendments I am proposing, do something to \nsupport Fidel Castro, they have nothing to do with Fidel Castro. The \nlanguage specifically refers to the post-Castro government. And I want \nto emphasize that point because I think it sets new ground, that is, \nthe language in the bill, that I think is dangerous, in my view, and \nprecedent setting.\n  The restrictions, of course, I mentioned are not restrictions on how \nwe relate to the existing government. Rather, they are restrictions on \na relationship with a future Cuban Government, a government in \ntransition from dictatorship to democracy. And, Mr. President, this \ndoes not make any sense at all to me. Title II of this legislation \nrelates in large measure to what the United States' policy should be \ntoward a post-Castro government.\n  It states, among other things--I am quoting here:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to support the self-\n     determination of the Cuban people and to be impartial toward \n     any individual or entity in the selection by the Cuban people \n     of their future government.\n\n  That is a beautiful statement. I endorse it 1000 percent. It is \nexactly the position we ought to have. Let me repeat it again.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to support the self-\n     determination of the Cuban people and to be impartial toward \n     any individual or entity in the selection by the Cuban people \n     of their future government.\n\n  That is exactly the position we ought to have. In fact, if it ended \nright there I would be standing up here urging all my colleagues to \nsupport this. But unfortunately, Mr. President, if you read further on \nin here, we seem to then contradict the very statement that I have just \nread to you. And I suspect that many of my colleagues--most would \nendorse the first statement. However, key provisions of title II belie \nthat statement.\n  I would urge my colleagues to take a look, if they would, at sections \n205, 206, and 207 of title II which set forth a laundry list of \nconditions and requirements that either must or should be met before \nthe President, our President, the President of the United States, can \nprovide even very limited assistance to help the Cuban people make the \nvery difficult transition from dictatorship to democracy.\n  These conditions, Mr. President, go on for four pages here, laying \nout, in some cases, ``shall,'' and what we ``must'' do.\n  Section 205:\n\n       (a) A determination . . . that a transition government in \n     Cuba is in power shall not be made unless that government has \n     taken the following actions--(1) legalized all political \n     activity; (2) released all political prisoners . . .\n\n  Most of the list I do not have any problem with whatsoever except \nthat it gets to micromanagement in a sense and lays out in great \nspecificity exactly what we are going to require before we provide any \nassistance to the people of that new government.\n  Again, I go back, Mr. President, to read, if you will, the statement \nI read a moment ago when we started talking about it. ``The policy of \nthe United States to support the self-determination of the Cuban people \nand to be impartial toward any individual or entity.'' Again, we are \ntalking about a post-Castro government here. Presumably, they are \ngetting rid of the dictatorship and moving in the right direction.\n  Now, I am not suggesting we ought to say we are going to provide help \nto anybody that becomes a transition government or becomes the new \ngovernment after Castro. I would oppose just as strongly any suggestion \nin legislation that we automatically ought to be providing assistance. \nBut I also think it gets rather ridiculous if we lay out four pages, \nMr. President, of conditionality here that a government must meet \nabsolutely in many ways if we are going to provide any assistance at \nall. I am talking about humanitarian assistance to people in \ntransition.\n  And, in fact, these standards that we have here, as much as I think \nthey have value, and although I think some of the language is a little \nless than precise, I do not--``legalizing all political activity''--I \ndo not know what ``all political activity'' means. I do not know what \nwe mean about that in this country. But I am not going to quibble about \nthe individual wording in it, Mr. President. I think there is value in \neach one of these statements.\n  But my point is, if we applied these standards to the New Independent \nStates that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union, we still \nwould not be providing any assistance to them, and we would not be \nallowed to under this, if adopted. We need to provide Presidents and \nCongresses in the future with the flexibility to respond to a \ntransition in Cuba. And to sit down and have a four-page minutia detail \nby detail by detail, steps that they have to go through before we can \nhelp them, I think just is wrong, wrong headed.\n  Again, this has nothing to do with Fidel Castro. This title II works \non the presumption he is gone, he is out of there. Now, we are talking \nabout a new government.\n  Mr. President, I just think it is a mistake to be passing legislation \nthat micromanages and goes into such detail. It is not just this \nPresident. Maybe people are talking about this administration somehow. \nNo one can say with certainty when the transition is going to occur in \nCuba. We all hope it occurs peacefully and occurs soon. But it may very \nwell not be for a year or 2 or 3 or 4 for 5. Who can say?\n  We have listened to nine Presidents since Dwight Eisenhower talk \nabout the change coming in Cuba. It has not happened yet. Now, again, \nall of us here, I presume, would like to see it happen quickly. But if \nit does not happen during this administration but some future \nadministration, including the administration of some of our colleagues \nwho are in this Chamber today, they could face four pages we adopt into \nlaw setting out in detail what that government must look like before we \ncan provide assistance to them, despite the fact that we said earlier \nin the bill that it is the policy of our Government to support the \nself-determination of the Cuban people and to be impartial, impartial \ntoward any individual or entity in the election by the Cuban people of \ntheir future government.\n  Again, I would not suggest in any way whatsoever, Mr. President, that \nwe ought to write a bill that would say no matter what happens, no \nmatter who follows Fidel Castro, we ought to provide aid to them.\n  Imagine if I wrote a bill that said that, that whoever comes after \nFidel Castro automatically qualifies for U.S. assistance. I would be \nlaughed off the floor of the Senate if I suggested a bill that proposed \nthat idea. And yet, what we are doing here today, in a sense, is just \nlike that. We are saying in effect that ``no matter who comes after \nFidel Castro, unless you meet these detailed standards, we cannot \nprovide any help to you at all.''\n  I thought the idea was to encourage a transition, to move to \ndemocracy, and to then provide the kind of nurturing \n\n[[Page S 15317]]\nsupport to see that that transition occurs. Now, it may not occur \nexactly as we like.\n  One of the provisions says you must have free elections within 2 \nyears. I wish it was 6 months. I wish it were the next day. What \nhappens if it is 2\\1/2\\ years and not 2 years, or 2 years, 2 months? It \nis that kind of detail that is in this bill, Mr. President. That is not \nsmart. That is not wise. That is not prudent. I do not know of any \nother place where we provided this kind of language.\n  Imagine the Philippines if we tried that. Imagine if we tried it, as \nI said, in all of these New Independent Republics that have emerged. \nOur ability to weigh in and create that kind of transition would have \nbeen severely hampered had we been required to meet the standards we \nare going to be adopting in this legislation if my amendment is not \napproved.\n  Now, I do not know, again, how this will come out politically. But I \nhope my colleagues would look and just read the sections 205, 206, and \n207. They go on for some pages. Some require ``shall,'' others \n``should,'' in the transition.\n  Last, and it gets into this same area, the settlement of outstanding \nU.S. claims. And here the language, Mr. President, is pretty emphatic \nin the bill.\n\n       No assistance may be provided under the authority of this \n     act to a transition government in Cuba.\n\n  And then it goes on for a page or two here talking about how we \nresolve these outstanding claims.\n  Mr. President, I hope that happens. I do not think any U.S. citizen \nwho has property confiscated anywhere in the world ought not to be \ncompensated. But we have now 38 countries in the world, including Cuba, \nwhere United States citizens' property has been expropriated, and we \nare in the process of trying to get those individuals compensated for \nthat property.\n  Some of the countries where that occurs are very strong allies of \nours. Germany is one, I point out. We now have diplomatic relations \nwith Vietnam. The list is lengthy, 38 countries.\n  We never said before we cannot provide any assistance to those \ncountries until those claims and matters are all settled, and yet that \nis what we do with this legislation. We are saying we cannot provide \nunder this--the language very specifically in section 207, ``Settlement \nof Outstanding U.S. Claims to Confiscated Property in Cuba,'' section \n(A), paragraph 1:\n\n       No assistance may be provided--\n\n  The assumption is that you are going to set up a mechanism to resolve \nthese claims, again no matter how meritorious they may be, and have \nthat control our foreign policy interests, which would be, I presume, \nto support the transition to get aid to people to try to establish a \npresence there and assist that process. To have it totally linked to \nclaims issues, where we do not do that even among our allies around the \nglobe, seems to me to be going too far. It just goes too far.\n  Again, I realize with everything else going on around here that the \nattention on something like this may not seem like much to people. I \njust think it is bad policy, Mr. President, to have this kind of \ndetailed step-by-step requirement that you have to meet and then \nabsolutely hamstring not just this administration, but future \nadministrations, from being able to move intelligently and rapidly to \ntry to shore up a government that will follow Fidel Castro.\n  Again, I emphasize to my colleagues, none of these provisions has \nanything to do with the present government in Cuba--not one thing to do \nwith it. It is all about the government that comes afterward. It seems \nto me we ought to be trying to figure out a way how we can play the \nmost creative role in that transition, to try to move that process \ntoward a democratically elected government as quickly as we can--as \nquickly as we can. And yet, before we can do that, we now have to go \nthrough a series of hoops that will make it very, very difficult for us \nto respond creatively and imaginatively to a situation that has gone on \nfar too long.\n  So, Mr. President, I will not dwell on this any longer. I made the \npoint, I hope, and I urge my colleagues to look at these sections of \nthe bill. Some, as I said, are more advisory. Others absolutely demand \ncertain things occur. They can go through and read which is which. It \nseems to me we ought to stick with the paragraph I read earlier on in \nmy statement, and that is that we provide the kind of flexibility in \nallowing the Cuban people to determine for themselves what it is that \nthey would like to have as that new government.\n  We may not decide to support it. It may not meet our standards and we \nwill act accordingly, but the best policy is the one that is included \nas a preamble to this section, and the preamble to this section is one \nthat every single person in this country, let alone in this body, can \nsupport, and that is the policy of the United States to support the \nself-determination of the Cuban people and be impartial to any \nselection of the Cuban people as to their government. It is their \nchoice. If they want to make a bad choice, that is their right. We do \nnot have to support it, but that is their right if they so desire.\n  The idea, then, that we are going to detail in painful minutiae every \nstep that must be met, I think is a mistake. Again, I am not quarreling \nmyself with any provisions here necessarily. There are things I support \nand I believe make sense. But to spell out as a roadmap what they have \nto follow in great detail before we can provide any kind of help down \nthere is a mistake, and I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. As I understand it, I have 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. On the two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I will not use all that time. I will \nreserve some. When the Senator from Connecticut is willing, we will \nyield back what remains of our time.\n  Mr. President, Senator Dodd's amendment proposes to delete from the \npending bill any guidance and recommendations to the President from the \nCongress of the United States as to what constitutes a transition or \ndemocratic government in Cuba. I am a little surprised at the thrust of \nthe amendment. But I respect the Senator, although I disagree with him.\n  The administration has maintained that the President should retain \nflexibility to deal with the situation in \n\n[[Page S 15318]]\nCuba once a transition begins. So the beginning trouble with this \namendment is that it is in conflict not only with the bill itself but \nwith the administration itself.\n  As the Libertad bill was drafted, we took the administration's \nconcerns into account, and we agreed that any parameters not be \n``overly rigid,'' to quote from an administration statement on the \nHouse bill. But we also agreed that Congress should speak as to what \nconstitutes sufficient change in Cuba to merit any support or aid from \nthe United States.\n  So the result is that the pending bill gives the President of the \nUnited States, whomever he may be, a great deal of latitude in making \nthe determination required before--before--any United States aid can \nbegin to flow to a new Cuban Government.\n  I am not aware that the administration has any problems with the way \nthe pending legislation is drafted. But let me be clear about what is \nin the Libertad bill. The only specific requirement, Mr. President, \nthat a transition government must meet before United States aid is \nreleased is that the Government has legalized political activity, \nreleased all political prisoners and allowed for access to Cuban \nprisons by international human rights organizations. It also stipulates \nthat the Cuban Government must have dissolved the state security and \nsecret police apparatus, and agreed to hold elections within 2 years of \ntaking power and has publicly committed, and is taking steps, to \nresolve American property claims.\n  The pending bill contains several additional factors that the \nPresident is asked--not required, but asked--to take into account when \ndetermining whether a transition or democratic government is in power \nin Cuba.\n  Mr. President, Congress offers this type of guidance to the President \nall the time on various matters. This is not out of the ordinary, nor \nis it some legislative straitjacket. So that is why I have a little bit \nof difficulty understanding how anybody could oppose asking, before we \ngive away the United States taxpayers' dollars, that a Cuban Government \nallow political activity, free political prisoners, dissolve the secret \npolice, and agree to take care of American citizens' property claims. I \nmust ask, what is wrong with that?\n  As for the property requirements, the President can waive them if he \ndetermines that it is in the vital national interest of the United \nStates to do so. This is consistent with existing restrictions on aid \nto Cuba in section 620(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act.\n  Now, I find it ironic that Senators would come to the floor, \nexpressing concerns about the Libertad bill, ostensibly in the name of \ncertified property claimants, and then turn around and want to strike a \nprovision that reaffirms the need for Cuba to remedy past wrongs. Whose \ninterest is really being protected by removing this Libertad section? \nIt doesn't appear to be the interests of the property claimants.\n  It is clearly within Congress' power to set out conditions on \nproviding aid to other nations--we do it all the time. However, the \nLibertad bill acknowledges that the President will need flexibility in \nresponding to Cuba's political evolution. The language in the Libertad \nbill represents a balance between these interests and should be \nretained, and that is why I will move to table the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, pending Senator \nDodd's discussion of his other amendment.\n  I am advised, Mr. President, that Senator Dodd has no further comment \non his amendments. Is it fair for me to assume that he yields back the \nremainder of his time? If staff would please inquire of Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. President, while we are waiting, on occasions like this, when \nimportant legislation is being considered, I wonder what the reaction \nof those who come to visit the Senate is with respect to so few \nSenators being on the floor. The answer to that is that Senators are \ntied up in committee meetings all over this complex. I, myself, had to \nget away from a committee meeting to be here to manage this bill and to \ndiscuss Senator Dodd's amendment.\n  So I say to our guests that not only do we welcome them, but we beg \ntheir understanding that Senators are working; they are just not \nworking here at the moment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, the time not being \ncharged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have been advised--Senator Dodd has \nconveyed to me his desire that his remaining time be yielded back if I \nyield mine back. I so do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I want the Chair to correct me if I am \nwrong, but there will be one vote on the two Dodd amendments; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to ask \nfor the yeas and nays en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Now, Mr. President, that leaves Senator Simon's amendment \non which a time agreement is already in place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                Explanation of Change of Vote on Cloture\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, when the Senate first voted October 12 on \nthe cloture petition relative to H.R. 927, the Dole-Helms Cuba \nsanctions bill, I voted no. Like most of my Democratic colleagues and \nsome Republicans, I strongly opposed title III of the bill as written \nbecause of its detrimental effect on U.S. Federal courts. Indeed most \nof our debate over the last few days on the bill has focused on title \nIII's provisions allowing suits to be filed against companies that \nacquired property confiscated by the Castro regime after it took power \nin 1959.\n  This provision of the measure flouted international law, threatened \nalready severely overburdened courts with costly new litigation, and \njeopardized our relations with major trading partners who do business \nwith Cuba. If adopted, this provision would have exponentially expanded \nthe pool of persons in the United States seeking compensation from the \nCuban Government for their claims. There could be tens or even hundreds \nof thousands of persons who would be eligible to file such lawsuits.\n  While no one knows for certain how many lawsuits could have been \nfiled under title III, if even a fraction of those newly eligible did \nso, it would prove costly to the Federal courts and greatly complicate \nthe tasks of resolving claims and assisting Cuba's economic recovery \nonce the Castro regime is gone.\n  After that first cloture vote, I discussed these issues during \nprivate conversations with several of my colleagues who supported the \nmeasure, including Senator Helms, and by the time of the second vote on \nOctober 17, I had obtained assurances that title III would be \nsubstantially modified or eliminated entirely. Therefore, I was able to \nsupport cloture when the second vote occurred.\n  I am happy that we were able to reach a compromise on this \nlegislation which allowed the third cloture vote to succeed on a solid \nbipartisan vote of 98 to 0 after the announcement that title III would \nbe stricken from the bill.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I believe all my colleagues agree on the \ngoals of United States policy toward Cuba--promoting a peaceful \ntransition to democracy, economic liberalization, and greater respect \nfor human rights while controlling immigration from Cuba. Where some of \nus clearly differ, however, is on how we get there. Despite the changes \nthat have been made to the pending legislation, I believe that it \ncontinues to take us further away from achieving these goals. I \nbelieve, therefore, that this legislation is contrary to U.S. national \ninterests.\n  We should undertake policy measures to enhance contact with the Cuban \npeople, because that will serve United States national interests; \nnamely, the fostering of the peaceful transition to democracy on that \nisland.\n  In my view, greater contact with the Cuban people will plant the \nseeds of \n\n[[Page S 15319]]\nchange and advance the cause of democracy just as greater exchange with \nthe West helped hasten the fall of communism in Eastern Europe.\n  I think it is naive to think that the measure before us today is \ngoing to succeed in forcing Castro to step aside, where all other \npressures have not. However, the measures proposed in this bill do have \nthe serious potential of further worsening the living conditions of the \nCuban people and once again making a mass exodus for Miami an \nattractive option. Taken to its most extreme, this bill could even \nprovoke serious violence on the island.\n  This legislation is even more problematic than earlier efforts to \ntighten the screws on Castro. I say this because its implications go \nwell beyond United States-Cuban relations. It alienates our allies and \ntie the administration's foreign policy hands.\n  Contact and dialog between Havana and Washington will bring about \ndemocracy on the island of Cuba, not isolation and impoverishment. \nPerhaps if we took that approach, our allies would be more likely to \nsupport our policy with respect to Cuba. Today we are virtually alone.\n  The Helms-Burton bill has gone through a number of changes since it \nwas first introduced. In fact, Senator Helms' substitute amendment \ndiffers in a number of areas from the House-passed bill. However, no \nversion to date resolves the fundamental problem I have with the \ndirection it takes U.S. policy. For these reasons I will vote against \nthis bill and urge my colleagues to do so as well.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in order to save a little time, my \ndistinguished colleague from North Carolina desires to address the \nSenate, and he understands that Senator Simon is on his way to discuss \nhis pending amendment.\n  I ask that the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth] be \nrecognized for the purpose of addressing the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth] is recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15317-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15319-S15320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PROMISES TO VOTERS\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, in the closing months of the first \nsession of this 104th Congress, I rise to remind my colleagues of some \npromises which were made to voters last November.\n  You may ask why I should be addressing this issue when we have so \nmuch work that remains to be done on the budget, but I do so because I \nam surprised that we have forgotten some fundamental principles about \neconomic growth which we so clearly articulated last year.\n  Those who embrace these basic truths are now in the majority. The \nconsequence of abandoning that message of hope and opportunity could be \nprofound for the American people.\n  Many of our colleagues are hard at work trying to balance the Federal \nbudget. This is a necessary and a difficult job. The American people \nrightly expect us to balance the budget and we must not disappoint \nthem.\n  In our zeal to put our financial house in order we must not forget \nwhy we are doing this in the first place.\n  I offer this reminder: We are balancing the budget because deficits \nare a tax on the American people. Today's debt is a tax levied not only \non taxpayers, but it is levied on future generations.\n  We do not usually speak of budget deficits as taxes, but they are. \nThat is very simply what they are. Deficits are taxes.\n  Who among us would support imposing taxes on our children and \ngrandchildren? Yet every time we vote for deficit spending, we do very \nsimply that.\n  If the deficit is a tax, then the solution is not an additional tax. \nThe problem is that we are spending money that we do not have on \nprograms we do not need.\n  The answer is simple. That is, to stop the spending.\n  Who among us is really convinced that we need to raise taxes to \nbalance a budget? None of us. President Clinton supported the largest \ntax increase in American history and he now admits that it was wrong.\n  Yet our national debt continues to grow out of control. While \nPresident Clinton has been focused on new ways to take hard-earned \nmoney away from the American taxpayers, I believe that we in Congress \nshould focus on ways to drastically decrease spending and allow \ntaxpayers to keep more of their money. The answer is to cut spending.\n  I regret that I have begun to hear some of my colleagues in both \nbodies and on both sides of the aisle talk about raising taxes. I \nregret even more the manner in which they talk about raising them. Just \nas the deficit is a tax which we do not dare call a tax, a new term, a \nnew euphemism has been invented to hide a new tax increase. The new tax \nis hiding behind the call to end corporate welfare, a term whose \nmeaning has been distorted.\n  When the Government levies a tax and then uses that revenue to \nsubsidize certain industries or such activities, it is accurately \ndescribed as corporate welfare.\n  Unfortunately, we are now using the term ``corporate welfare'' to \ndescribe instances where we have simply chosen not to levy a tax. In \nother words, a tax we have not voted on. The corporations of this \ncountry are now being called corporate welfare simply because we have \nnot levied the tax.\n  Have we been here in Washington so long that we have forgotten the \ndifference between a subsidy and a tax? It is not a subsidy to allow a \ncorporation to keep more of the money it has earned so that it can \nreinvest that money, which creates jobs, pays dividends to all \nshareholders, including large institutional investors responsible for \nprotecting the pension funds of America.\n  The Federal Government does not own the American people's money. It \ndoes not own their land, their homes or their income. Failure to tax is \nnot corporate welfare.\n  For us to say we are doing the American people some sort of favor by \nnot taxing some aspect of their livelihood is the very height of \npolitical and governmental arrogance. We should not hide behind \nWashington doublespeak and call it corporate welfare.\n  It we decide to raise the tax, let us call it what it is--a plain and \nsimple tax increase. Let us not say that we are ending corporate \nwelfare when we are, in fact, raising the taxes on the corporations of \nAmerica.\n  I find nothing noble in raising taxes. It misses the point of what we \nare trying to do in the first place.\n  I campaigned on spending cuts and tax cuts. Closing certain corporate \ntax breaks certainly increases taxes. The time to address these tax \nbreaks is when we are engaged in comprehensive tax reform such as a \nflat tax. Now is not the time to rewrite the corporate Tax Code. Now is \nnot the time to impose an arbitrary retroactive tax increase on \ncompanies and, more importantly, on their employees who participate in \na corporate-owned life insurance policy purchased after 1987.\n  The only reason some are discussing tax increases now is because we \nfailed to make serious cuts in Government spending and in corporate \nsubsidies. We failed to downsize, eliminate, or privatize boondoggles \nsuch as the Export-Import Bank, the International Trade Administration, \nand the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.\n  The CATO Institute has identified more than 125 corporate welfare \nsubsidy programs which cost taxpayers over $85 billion in subsidies \nthis year alone. This is true corporate welfare. These are subsidies \nwhich we should be attacking. We need to make clear and distinct the \ndifference between a subsidy and a tax increase. We should not be \ntalking about tax increases until we have eliminated indefensible \ncorporate cash subsidies.\n  As you know, I strongly support dramatic reform in our Social \nSecurity social welfare programs. The worst of these programs simply \nuses tax dollars \n\n[[Page S 15320]]\nto subsidize and promote self-destructive behavior.\n  In the same way, I oppose corporate welfare which uses tax dollars to \nsubsidize companies in a manner inconsistent with free market \nprinciples. Taking money away from individual taxpayers and giving it \nto businesses is simply wrong, and I support my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle who call for an end to that practice.\n  As we continue our effort to balance the budget, I would hope that we \nnot forget the following:\n  The deficit is a tax on the American people and on future \ngenerations.\n  To end this tax, we must balance the budget.\n  Our problem is that we have been spending money that we do not have \non programs we do not need.\n  We need not and should not raise taxes to balance the budget. Raising \ntaxes will not balance the budget. It never has. It only leads to \nincreased spending.\n  I will not vote for a tax increase, no matter what it is ultimately \ncalled.\n  In ending deficit spending, we are doing the right thing--the honest \nthing. Let us not stray back into hidden taxes and double-talk about \nMedicare before we reach our goal of a balanced budget. Let us not give \nin to the defenders of the status quo whose political bankruptcy has \nled them to frighten our youth and senior citizens with false and \nnegative rhetoric. I implore my colleagues to abandon the rhetoric of \ntax increases and embrace spending cuts and tax cuts--to embrace \nsmaller Government and greater individual freedom. As this Congress \nchanges the size and cost of the Federal Government, it is only right \nthat taxpayers share in the dividends. That is why spending cuts, \ndeficit reduction and tax cuts must go hand in hand.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of legislation to provide tax relief to \nAmerica's families in the form of a $500 per child credit. I am also a \nsponsor of a bipartisan bill to provide a capital gains tax cut which \nwe all know is essential and necessary for economic growth and new job \ncreation.\n  Tax cuts and spending cuts are two ways of putting more money into \nthe hands of America's taxpayers who will invest that money in our \nchildren and in our economy and in our country as a whole. Both \ninvestments contribute to long-term fiscal responsibility. This is the \npath to real and sustained deficit reduction. It is what the voters \nexpect and deserve. And, it is what we in Congress owe them.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2934\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this amendment says simply that Americans \ncan use what I think is a constitutional right to travel. We should not \nrestrict travel to any country unless security is threatened, so that \nAmerican citizens are not subject to simply propaganda from one side or \nfrom our Government.\n  It is interesting that every other country in the world, so far as I \nknow, permits its citizens to travel to Cuba. Only the United States of \nAmerica does not.\n  Listen to what President Eisenhower said: ``Any limitation on the \nright to travel can only be tolerated in terms of overriding \nrequirements of our national security.''\n  President Eisenhower was right. The reality is Americans can travel \nto Cuba, but you have to go to Canada or Mexico or some other country \nto do it. We do not have the freedom the citizens of every other \ncountry in the world have, to travel to Cuba. It just does not make \nsense.\n  I will add, the American Association for the Advancement of Science \ntestified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on this question and \npointed out that there have been scientific meetings, international \nscientific meetings held in Cuba, where our scientists have not been \nable to attend. It just does not make sense.\n  In one case they were able to attend, but listen to this. In order to \nattend a meeting of the World Federation of Engineering Organizations, \nin Havana, beginning on October 17, 1993, they were first denied \nlicenses, and then, ``Finally, members were granted licenses but not \nwithout long delays and the necessity of submitting themselves to a \ndetailed screening process by Treasury Department officials.'' All \nkinds of needless paperwork. And not an American citizen who has gone \nto Canada or Mexico and traveled to Cuba has been prosecuted, sentenced \nto prison, or fined. It is just ridiculous, and we look ridiculous in \nthe eyes of the rest of the world.\n  This limitation on Americans to travel to Cuba does not do one thing \nin terms of pulling down the Castro regime. There is not a Member of \nthe United States Senate who believes that Castro is doing what he \nshould be doing for the people of Cuba. We do not like his human rights \nrecord. But I do not want to impose human rights restrictions on \nAmerican citizens because he does it in Cuba. So my amendment simply \nwould give American citizens the clear right to travel to Cuba.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. SIMON. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. Just to engage my colleague, I want to commend him for his \namendment. What is underlying in this amendment is the notion here that \nwe have to start to get back to the conduct of foreign policy. We are \ndealing with Cuba as if this were a domestic issue and not a foreign \npolicy issue. If someone can explain to me why it is that we allow \nunlimited travel to the People's Republic of China, and we allow \nunlimited travel to Vietnam--even in the case of North Korea, the North \nKoreans impose restrictions, but we do not impose restrictions. Yet \nhere for the island nation of Cuba, as much \n\n[[Page S 15321]]\nas all of us find the Government there reprehensible, I think most of \nus believe that access and contact between peoples, particularly free \npeople with the people who are living under a dictatorship, has a \ntremendous impact, or can have a tremendous impact, to say that no one \nin this country to the one place throughout the entire globe could \ntravel makes no sense at all.\n  Again, this is not as if we are talking about any other country. \nImagine if we offered an amendment here that included the People's \nRepublic of China, just add that one Communist country that engages in \nhuman rights violations--I would argue probably far more egregious than \nwhat occurs in Cuba, as bad as that may be--if I would offer that \namendment to this, it would be resoundingly defeated if we stopped \npeople going to the People's Republic of China today. And people would \nargue not just in terms of our own financial interests, but I think \nmost realize there is probably a greater likelihood of achieving change \nthere because there are those contacts. Others will argue with that. \nBut here we are singling out one country 90 miles off our shore where \nan influx of Americans down there might have a very positive impact on \nencouraging people to engage in the legitimate, political kind of \nactivity that would create the kind of change we would like to see \nthere.\n  What my colleague is offering here makes eminently good sense. It is \nthe direction we ought to be going in. It is the most effective way to \nchange the Government there. I commend him for this amendment, and I \nask him whether or not he would agree with me, if he knows of any other \ncase anywhere else in the world where we apply this.\n  Mr. SIMON. Absolutely not. It is interesting that it is the same \ndebate that we went through when we had the Soviet Union. Should we let \nAmericans travel there? We finally made the decision that it might open \nup the Soviet Union if we would let people travel. And that was the \nright decision, and that is what we are asking for here. Let us make \nthe right decision on Cuba.\n  Mr. DODD. I point out as well that it is not just that. But Cuban-\nAmericans themselves--first of all, I have said this before, Mr. \nPresident. This notion that we are dealing with a monolithic community \nhere is insulting to many Cuban-Americans. They do not like having \npeople stand up here and suggest that every American of Cuban descent \nor heritage is of totally like mind on these issues. Many feel that \nthey would like to be able to go back and start meeting with their \nfamilies, working with their families. To go through the charade of \ntraveling to Canada, going to Mexico, engaging in all kinds of \nsubterfuge in order to make contact with their families and support \nthem is not healthy.\n  I would suggest that if we could make it possible for Cuban-Americans \nto go back and be with their old neighbors, friends, and family \nmembers, that kind of involvement, that kind of contact, that kind of \ninterchange is probably something Fidel Castro worries more about than \nthe adoption of this kind of language. I suspect he may support the \nlanguage in this bill because it is that kind of contact which he would \nmost worry about jeopardizing the foundations of his dictatorship.\n  So, again, I applaud my colleague from Illinois for his proposal. I \nsuspect we may not win in these amendments, regretfully, because this \nis about domestic policy. It is not about foreign policy.\n  Mr. SIMON. I will simply add that we should make policy based on the \nnational interest, not national passion. With what we are doing, our \npresent policy is the opposite.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nsuggest that the time be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Order for Recess\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nstand in recess at 12 noon today until 4 p.m. and that at 4 p.m. the \nSenate proceed to the votes under the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I again suggest the absence of a quorum on \nthe same basis as the first request was made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, would the Chair state the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has 8 minutes, \nand the Senator from Illinois has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, what I am about to say may indicate the widest \nlegislative wing span in history, but the State Department and Jesse \nHelms agree on something. Both the State Department and Jesse Helms \noppose the Simon amendment. I do so respectfully--and Paul Simon is my \nfriend. We do not agree on everything, but that does not matter. He \noperates in good faith, and I try to.\n  Let me say very briefly that during the tenure or parts thereof of \neight American Presidents, the United States has pursued a bipartisan \npolicy of isolating Fidel Castro, including restrictions on travel to \nCuba. Obviously, the Simon amendment would enthusiastically do away \nwith that restriction.\n  I mentioned yesterday, and I guess I shall reiterate today, that \nthere are good intentions behind anything that Paul Simon does. He is a \ngentleman. I regret the fact on a personal basis that he has announced \nthat he will not seek reelection next year. But having said that, I \njust cannot support his amendment. And I cannot fail to urge Senators \nto vote against it because the result of the Simon amendment will not \nbe the free exchange of ideas that they talk about. The result will be \nto give Fidel Castro access to new and desperately needed hard \ncurrency. On this, the State Department and I absolutely agree.\n  What Castro has to offer is Cuban beaches. That is it. And allowing \nAmericans to sit on Cuban beach does not do anything for the Cuban \npeople who are oppressed and from whom we hear daily pleas to enact the \nLibertad bill. The Cuban people inside of Cuba--and also the Cuban \npeople in exile in the United States and elsewhere--unanimously, as far \nas I know, favor the pending bill. Tourism, of course, is one of Fidel \nCastro's most important sources of hard currency, and for years and \nyears Castro has lured foreigners to Cuba. This has not resulted in any \nliberalizing of his regime. It has instead resulted in less freedom and \nworse living circumstances for the Cuban people. Old Fidel, he is ugly, \nand he is blunt, and he is rough, and he is cruel, but he is not dumb. \nHe knows the value of tourism for his regime. As a matter of fact, if \nhe does not get hard cash from tourism and other aspects of operations, \ndown he goes. And that is the point. We want him to go down. We want to \nbe rid of him. We want the Cuban people to be rid of him so that they \ncan establish a democratic government there that they have not had in a \nlong, long time.\n\n  Now, back in June, Castro began imposing a 100 percent tariff on all \nnew articles brought into Cuba with a value between $100 and $1,000. \nAnd that means, Mr. President, if Castro officials, his cronies, \ndetermine that an item being brought into Cuba by a tourist is new, or \nif it is something that will be left behind when the tourist departs, \nthen Cuba can charge 100 percent of the cost of that item. The tax on \ntourists benefits nobody but Fidel Castro and his cronies.\n  Critics of the travel restrictions argue that we should remove them \nsince they are not fully enforced. I recognize that the Treasury \nDepartment has encountered some problems in enforcing travel \nregulations. They probably encounter some problems in enforcing a lot \nof regulations. The reason for any problem they have in this regard is \nthat currently only criminal penalties can be imposed for violations. \n\n[[Page S 15322]]\n The administration supports the enactment of civil penalties as the \nbest means of enforcing existing restrictions, and that is exactly what \nwe do in the Libertad bill. So there goes that wide wingspread again \nfrom left to right.\n  Mr. President, I am going to reserve the remainder of my time because \nI have one or two other points that I may want to make, but I want \nthere to be enough time for Senator Simon to make whatever rebuttal he \nwishes to make.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I think if we can, before we vote--I \nunderstand we are going to vote at 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes.\n  Mr. SIMON. If each of us can have 2 minutes, if that is satisfactory \nto the Senator from North Carolina, that is satisfactory to me.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, that is certainly a fair and reasonable \nrequest. I ask unanimous consent that 4 minutes equally divided be \nprovided at 4 o'clock on the Simon amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. I would yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HELMS. And I yield back the remainder of my time. I see the \ndistinguished majority leader. I am glad to yield to the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. I understand the chairman has gotten the consent that we \nstand in recess at noon until 4 p.m.\n  I might explain to my colleagues, the purpose of this is so that the \nFinance Committee can complete action on the tax cut package. They \nagreed yesterday to have 7 hours and then they would vote. They started \nat 9 o'clock this morning. We cannot get consent for the Finance \nCommittee to meet while the Senate is in session, so we have no \nrecourse but to let the Finance Committee meet all afternoon. But right \nnow they are moving along at a pretty rapid pace, and they would like \nto complete action. Hopefully, at 4 o'clock, they could finish and the \nSenate could come in and, as I understand, there will be three votes \nand then final passage.\n  Then after that we will hopefully take up the Labor, HHS \nappropriations bill or, if there has been any progress, State \nDepartment reorganization. I understand there is another meeting, the \nchairman has another meeting this afternoon at 2 o'clock. So hopefully \nwe can finish action this afternoon on the tax cut package. Chairman \nRoth and the ranking member, Senator Moynihan, are trying to get that \ndone by 4 o'clock. That would go to the Budget Committee. It is our \nhope that next Wednesday we will take up the reconciliation package on \nthe Senate floor, Wednesday and Thursday. In the meantime, we have a \nnumber of items on which we hope to complete action.\n  I would also indicate that we will have, hopefully, next week a \nTransportation conference report; legislative branch appropriations, a \nnew bill, but it is identical to the one vetoed by the President. That \nwill be available early to midweek; energy and water conference report. \nThat conference is going to convene next Tuesday at 9 o'clock. We hope \nto finish that day and then take that up. We are trying to get more and \nmore of the appropriations bills to the President. We hope that he \nwould indicate he will sign the bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15320-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BALANCING THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, before we recess, I would like to take a \nmoment to discuss President Clinton's appearance before reporters at \nthe White House this morning.\n  Republicans have been willing to work with the President in our \nefforts to finally balance the budget. Regrettably, the President's \nveto threat today makes us wonder whether he is serious about working \nwith the congressional majority to fulfill the mandate the American \npeople gave us. If anyone needs to think again, in my view it is \nPresident Clinton. Rather than continuing his cynical reelection \ncampaign designed to scare the American people, particularly senior \ncitizens, he should show some leadership and work with us to balance \nthe budget, cut taxes for American families, protect Medicare from \nbankruptcy, and overhaul welfare.\n  If any plan puts America's elderly at risk, it is the President's \nplan, which fails to offer any long-term reforms, any choices for \nseniors, and any real solutions, just sort of a Band-Aid to get us \nbeyond the next election in 1996.\n  I think it is interesting that the President confessed this week he \nraised taxes too much in 1993. I think a $265 billion tax increase is a \nbit too much. It affected senior citizens, people who drive \nautomobiles, subchapter S corporations, a lot of Americans who did not \nconsider themselves rich until the President announced that only the \nrich pay taxes. But he has learned since 1993 that other people pay \nthese increased taxes, too, who are not rich, when he increased taxes \non Social Security, when he increased taxes on gasoline, when he \nincreased taxes on subchapter S corporations, and a number of other \npeople who were not rich.\n  So I think now that he has confessed he made a mistake on raising \ntaxes, he ought to confess he has made a mistake on not wanting to \nadopt a balanced budget. He fought us in an effort to pass a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. He convinced six \nDemocrats who voted for a balanced budget last year to vote no this \nyear. We lost by one vote. We had 66. We needed 67.\n  So it seems to me the President is now saying, well, I raised taxes \ntoo much but it was not my fault; Republicans are responsible. Not a \nsingle Republican in the House or the Senate voted for the tax \nincrease. I do not understand how he can blame us for that. It was the \nbiggest tax increase in American history. In fact, I think the Senator \nfrom New York [Mr. Moynihan] said, no, it was the biggest tax increase \nin world history, and it probably was.\n  So I would ask the President today, now that he is feeling in a mood \nto say he has made mistakes--and we all make mistakes from time to \ntime--we would be happy to have him join us in this budget debate in \nbalancing the budget by the year 2002 and protecting, preserving, \nstrengthening Medicare and overhauling welfare and providing tax cuts \nfor families with children, the very thing that the President proposed, \nI might add.\n\n  About 70 percent of our total tax credit goes to families. They are \nnot rich. On the Senate side we have capped what your total income \ncould be if you are going to be eligible for the tax credit for your \nchildren.\n  So, Mr. President, we agree you raised taxes too much. We agree it \nhurt the economy. We agree it probably cost a lot of jobs in America. \nWe agree it cost a lot of dislocation, a lot of pain, a lot of \nsuffering. But now that you have confessed to making that mistake, let \nus not make another mistake. Let us work together. Let us try to \nbalance the budget, Mr. President. Let us try to save Medicare, Mr. \nPresident, and try to have a good tax cut for families with children \nand stimulate the economy with the capital gains rate reduction, and \nthen reform welfare, which the President indicates he supports.\n  We are prepared. I know the Speaker is prepared. I hope that we might \nhave some cooperation.\n  I yield the floor. And I think it is 12 o'clock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15322-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RECESS UNTIL 4 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded. \n\n[[Page S 15323]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, our parliamentary situation now I believe \nis that I have 2 minutes to speak on behalf of my amendment and my \ncolleague from North Carolina has 2 minutes to speak in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this is a fairly clear and simple issue: Do \nwe follow the advice of people like President Eisenhower who said, \n``Any limitation on the right to travel can only be tolerated in terms \nof overriding requirements of our national security.''\n  Americans can travel to North Korea and China. Name the dictatorship \nanywhere, we can travel there. The one country we cannot: Cuba. \nCitizens of every other country in the world can travel to Cuba, but \nAmericans cannot do it legally.\n  Now, we can go by way of Mexico or Canada and violate the law and do \nit, but that should not be the way we do things around here.\n  It is very interesting that in the Soviet Union we had this same \nquestion: Should we cut them off and isolate them, or should we have \nAmerican visitors who go there and help to ameliorate their policy? We, \nfortunately, made the right decision that Americans could travel there. \nThat should be what we do today.\n  Americans ought to have the right to travel anywhere where there is \nnot a security risk for Americans. That ought to be part of the freedom \nthat every American has.\n  Mr. President, I know there will be a motion to table. I hope, \ndespite that motion, the amendment will be agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I said earlier this morning when Senator \nSimon and I were on the floor together that this amendment has prompted \nthe widest political legislative extremes in history: The State \nDepartment and Jesse Helms agree it is a very bad amendment.\n  I believe the distinguished Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] will \nmove to table.\n  This amendment undercuts the embargo that has been in effect for \neight Presidents. It does not help the Cuban people. Tourism will not \nchange Castro. In fact, it will merely contribute to Castro's economic \nstatus a little bit.\n  I hope that the Senate will vote to table the amendment. I say that \nwith all due respect to my friend and neighbor, Paul Simon.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I could use the remaining time of Senator Helms for \nthe purpose of a couple of points. First, the current Cuban Democracy \nAct provides for limited travel under controlled circumstances to Cuba \nby three groups of Americans: those who are traveling for educational, \nreligious, or humanitarian purposes. The President, within the last 2 \nweeks, has given greater definition to who will fall within those three \ncategories and will receive authorization to travel to Cuba.\n  The basic prohibition on general travel is a cornerstone of the \nUnited States' effort to isolate the dictatorship in Cuba while we were \nattempting to reach out to the people of Cuba with a hand of \nfriendship. If we were to eliminate this prohibition on travel, we \nwould be pouring dollars into Castro's thin coffers, dollars which \nwould allow him to continue to operate the most repressive state \nsecurity apparatus left in the world, one which has set new standards \nfor human rights abuses. We would also prop up his regime against the \ninexorable forces which are leading toward its downfall.\n  Mr. President, I urge the defeat of this amendment by adopting the \nmotion that I will offer to table the Simon amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Illinois wish to use his \nremaining 25 seconds?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the assistance to Castro in terms of \neconomic terms is almost nil. What this amendment does is give \nAmericans the freedom that citizens in every other country in the world \nhave: To travel to Cuba. I think that ought to be a basic right of \nAmericans--to travel to any country where there is not a security \nthreat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I move to table the Simon amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the Simon amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 2906 and 2908\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question now \noccurs on the en bloc consideration of amendments numbered 2906 and \n2908 offered by the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd]. Debate is \nlimited to 4 minutes equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, the amendments we are about to \nvote on, or two amendments which were combined en bloc, deal with the \nissue of title II of this bill.\n  Regardless of how anyone feels about the present government in Cuba, \ntitle II of this bill does not deal with the Castro government in Cuba. \nIt deals with the next government in Cuba. It says that the next \ngovernment in Cuba must meet a set of four pages of criteria before we \ncan provide even transitional assistance to the next government in \nCuba.\n  Mr. President, I do not know what the next government in Cuba is \ngoing to look like. Hopefully, it will be a democratic government. But \nit seems to me that we ought not to be conditioning our assistance on \nsome future government in Cuba in this piece of legislation.\n  Whatever else we may want to do to the Castro government, why would \nwe want to tie the hands of this administration or future \nadministrations when you have a change in Cuba? If we applied the same \nrules and the same criteria that are located in title II of this bill, \nwe would not be able to provide the transitional assistance to many of \nthe New Independent States that have emerged after the collapse of the \nSoviet Union.\n  I urge my colleagues in the next few minutes to just read sections \n205 through 208 of this bill. They are four pages of criteria. Whatever \nelse you may feel about Fidel Castro, however you want to change the \ngovernment in Cuba, do not make it impossible for this administration \nor the next one to \n\n[[Page S 15324]]\ndeal effectively with that new government. This amendment strikes those \nsections of the bill, and I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield 30 seconds to the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment by \nthe Senator from Connecticut. Title II is authored by the only Cuban-\nAmerican Democrat in the Congress, Bob Menendez of New Jersey. For \nonce, we should be ready when the commander of a Communist dictatorship \nfalls. All this says is when the dictatorship falls, we should have in \nplace emergency relief measures and assistance that will effect the \ntransition from a command economy to a market economy, from a \ntotalitarian state to a democracy. It says for once let us be ready \nwhen a Communist dictator falls.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. In that connection, let me read one paragraph from a \nletter dated today by Congressman Menendez to the distinguished \nminority leader, Mr. Daschle:\n\n       Dear Mr. Daschle. As the author of title II of the Helms-\n     Burton Libertad legislation and the only Cuban American \n     Democrat in the Congress, I am writing to urge you to vote \n     against the Dodd amendments which seek to gut title II of the \n     legislation.\n\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I, too, rise in opposition to the \namendments offered by our colleague from Connecticut. This proposal \nlays out a rational transition from the current authoritarian Communist \nregime to what we hope will soon be a democratic and marketplace \npolitical and economic system in Cuba. It is consistent with the \nprovisions that were contained in the Cuban Democracy Act which was \npassed by this body by an overwhelming vote in 1993, but it continues \nthe dual track of the United States providing pressure against the \nregime in Cuba while it opens up to the people of Cuba, including \nopening up with a clear statement of how we will assist the transition \nto democracy.\n\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendments of the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired under the control of the \nSenator from North Carolina. The Senator from Connecticut has 21 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pending is the Helms amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask that the yeas and nays be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Have the yeas and nays been ordered on final passage?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. How much time is left on the Helms amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 10 minutes of debate on the Helms \namendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we are about to conclude action on the Cuban \nLiberty and Democratic Solidarity Act. The Senate has spent a week on \nthis bill. We had three cloture votes. A sustained lobbying campaign by \nthe White House forced Chairman Helms to delete a significant section \nof the bill. The Senate will pass the bill today, and the conference \nwill certainly address the issue of stolen property.\n  I am confident that the House-Senate conference will be able to find \na way to prevent Fidel Castro from using foreign investment to prolong \nhis tyranny. That is the issue--do we want to allow the hemisphere's \nlast dictator to replace his lost aid from the Soviet empire with \nwestern investment? The Senate will have another chance to address this \nissue when the conference report comes back.\n  We should be clear on what is still in this bill. Title I strengthens \nthe international embargo on Cuba. It requires the United States to \noppose Cuban membership in international financial institutions. It \nconditions aid to Russia on an end to support for Cuba. It tightens the \nrestrictions against the importation of Cuban sugar. And it authorizes \nassistance to the real victims of Castro's repression--the Cuban \npeople.\n  In the debate, some of the advocates of lifting the embargo have said \nthis bill looks backward, that this bill does not respond to current \nconditions. Nothing could be further from the truth. Title II of the \nbill requires the President to look ahead--to look at the inevitable \npost-Castro period. Title II provides for support for a free and \nindependent Cuba and authorizes suspension for the embargo and other \nrestrictions once a transitional government is in place. Title II also \nprovides incentives for a truly democratic government in Cuba.\n  So I think the President, the Senate is going to speak loudly today--\nin support of the Cuban people and in opposition to Fidel Castro. He \nshould know that as he prepares to come to New York for whatever he is \ngoing to do at the United Nations. The White House has made its views \nknown. By allowing Fidel Castro to enter the United States, and by \nvigorously lobbying against this bill, there is no doubt where they \nstand. Today, the Senate can make its views known, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the bill.\n  I thank Senator Helms for his outstanding work on this issue.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I said at the very outset of this debate \nthat when we consider legislation aimed at a foreign country, we ought \nto ask ourselves two basic questions. Is what is being proposed in the \nbest interest of our Nation, and is it likely to achieve the desired \nresults in the country in question--in this case, Cuba?\n  I have had grave concerns, Mr. President, about title III of this \nbill. That \n\n[[Page S 15325]]\nsection has been taken out. I thank my colleagues for supporting us in \nthat effort. Notwithstanding, however, Mr. President, this changed. The \ntwo basic questions I raised at the outset of these remarks remain. In \nmy view, the answer to both of those questions, if one reads this bill \ncarefully, is ``no.''\n  It is not in our interest to complicate our relations with the \ngovernments of Russia or other New Independent State countries. Yet, \nprovisions of this bill would do just that by linking our assistance to \nthese countries, to their policies toward Cuba. We provide, Mr. \nPresident, assistance to Russia, and other of the New Independent \nStates, because we want to see them carry out the kinds of programs \nthat we are funding, because we want to continue to strengthen their \nstill fragile democratic institutions. Conditioning, Mr. President, \nthat assistance on what is going on in Cuba, I think, is \ncounterproductive.\n  Provisions of this bill ultimately hinge on our arms control treaties \nwith Russia, specifically, on Russian verification of United States \ncompliance. While it is certainly legitimate for the United States to \ndiscuss the types of activities that appropriately fall within the \nscope of verification of arms control treaties, that should be done \nbilaterally with the Government of Russia, not unilaterally imposed by \nthe Congress in the context of a debate about Cuba.\n  Other provisions of this bill bar Cuban participation in \ninternational financial institutions until after democracy has been \nestablished in that country. We all know, Mr. President, the critical \nroles played by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in the \nearly days of Russia's transition to democracy. It is foolhardy, Mr. \nPresident, to prohibit the IMF and the World Bank from offering their \nassistance and expertise to a post-Castro government as it grapples \nwith the complicated task of dismantling a command economy.\n  Mr. President, I have already mentioned those provisions of the bill \nwhich my amendment would have sought to strike, provisions that \nseverely limit the flexibility of the United States to respond to the \nchange in Cuba when it comes. This bill could also have the United \nStates spend more money on TV Marti, this time converting from VHF to \nUHF broadcasting. We all know that TV Marti has been a complete \nfailure. GAO report after GAO report after GAO report has found that it \nis totally ineffective, that virtually nobody watches it, and that it \nis a total waste of taxpayer money.\n  More than just the individual provisions of the bill, Mr. President, \nthe entire thrust of this legislation makes no sense whatsoever. \nCalling Castro names does not get Cuba any closer to democracy. We have \nspent a week debating this. It is too long.\n  Perhaps the only individual who will truly benefit from this debate \nis Fidel Castro. Once again, we have managed to make him larger than \nlife. Once again, we have given him excuses on why his government has \nfailed and why the Cuban economy is in a shambles. Once again, we will \nforce our allies to come to his defense because they profoundly \ndisagree with our tactics. None of this, Mr. President, makes any sense \nwhatsoever. We all know that to be the case, but frankly, to state it \nbluntly, because of domestic political considerations, we continue to \ntake actions counterproductive to our own self-interest. I urge defeat \nof this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HELMS. What is the time situation, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has 3 minutes \n34 seconds. The Senator from Connecticut has a minute 26 seconds.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, passage of the Libertad bill will send a \nmessage that Congress wants a tightening of the screws on Fidel Castro.\n  Castro knows that this bill will expedite his departure from power. \nWhy on Earth would Castro have launched such a huge campaign against \nthis bill if it wasn't harmful to his rule? He knows that the Libertad \nAct will help set the Cuban people free--free from oppression, free \nfrom communism, free from Castro's dictatorship.\n  As several principal cosponsors of this bill have already stated on \nthis floor, including Senators Dole and Gramm, we are going to fight \nhard--and I mean very hard--to keep the pressure on Castro--and on this \nadministration to work for Castro's removal.\n  Mr. President, let me say this: Fidel Castro is going to come to New \nYork City this weekend to address the United Nations. Since the State \nDepartment has just given Mr. Castro a visa to enter this country, I \nwant to give Mr. Castro an early Christmas gift to be delivered to the \npeople of Cuba--a gift called the Libertad Act, on which we will vote \nfinal passage in a moment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I point out that Richard Nixon also gave \nFidel Castro a visa to come to this country. That kind of political \nrhetoric does not advance our cause. He is going to be larger than life \nwhen he comes to the United Nations. What we do here today is going to \nmake him a hero when he comes to the United Nations. I regret that. I \nyield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 2936 by the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. \nHelms].\n  The amendment (No. 2936) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the substitute \namendment No. 2898, as amended, offered by the Senator from Kansas [Mr. \nDole].\n  The amendment (No. 2898), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, a serious family emergency in \nPennsylvania has required me to leave this afternoon on the spur of the \nmoment. Had I been present, I would have voted against the amendments \noffered by Senator Simon and Senator Dodd, and in favor of final \npassage of the bill.\n\n[[Page S 15326]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I do not want my vote for final passage of \nH.R. 927, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act to be \nmisunderstood. I was strongly opposed to the centerpiece of the \nlegislation--title III. This title would have altered 45 years of \ninternational and domestic law and practice with respect to the \nresolution of claims resulting from the expropriation of U.S. property \nabroad. I supported efforts to ensure that that title was deleted from \nthe bill.\n  I will oppose any conference report that restores this title or adds \ndraconian provisions. I will join with my colleagues in utilizing all \nparliamentary procedures to ensure that a conference report containing \nwhat was title III is not enacted into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15322-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I was just looking at a letter that was \ngiven to me by the chairman of the Budget Committee, the Honorable \nSenator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], advising that the Congressional \nBudget Office has had an opportunity to review the budget \nreconciliation package that has been assembled and will be presented to \nthe Senate, we assume during next week. The good news is that the \nCongressional Budget Office's analysis of the bill as assembled at this \npoint, assuming that the tax bill being reported in the Finance \nCommittee is within the budget reconciliation targets, not only will \nachieve a balanced budget by the year 2002 but will actually result in \na small surplus.\n  The letter from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office goes \ninto more detail with the analysis that she and her staff have made of \nthis reconciliation package. But I hope that between now and next week, \nwhen the Senate will have an opportunity to take up and debate the \nreconciliation bill, Senators will review these documents and the \nanalysis that has been done, because this is the centerpiece of the \neffort to achieve the balanced budget by the target that was set in the \nbudget resolution that has passed both Houses and is reflected in the \nconference report that earlier passed the Congress.\n  This is the centerpiece, this is the heart and soul of the effort to \nachieve a balanced budget. And we are about to embark upon a very \nhistoric debate for the first time in anybody's memory on a plan to \nactually achieve an annual operating budget that is in balance, that \nchanges entitlement programs as well as the appropriated bills that \nhave passed the Congress which is about to take place. I hope that we \nwill have an opportunity as we approach that period to talk about some \nof the changes that we foresee and the resulting influence that it is \ngoing to have for good on the fiscal policies of the country, as well \nas the effect on interest rates, the effect on the general overall \neconomic environment for job creation and business activity, which will \nbe positive and continue to move us in the right direction in terms of \neconomic growth and economic well-being as a nation.\n  But I congratulate the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, for his good work and his strong \nleadership in bringing us to this point. We look forward to the debate \non the resolution.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President. It is a timely opportunity to \ntake the floor to follow my friend from Mississippi.\n  My friend from Mississippi was quoting from a letter dated October 18 \nfrom the CBO signed by Director June O'Neill. It is a letter that says \nthat based on those estimates--referring to estimates in the letter--\nusing the economic and technical assumptions underlying the budget \nresolution and assuming--this is the way economists talk--the level of \ndiscretionary spending specified in that resolution, the CBO projects \nthat enactment of the reconciliation legislation submitted to the \nBudget Committee would produce a small budget surplus in the year 2002.\n  The Senator is quite correct about what this letter said. That is \ndated yesterday.\n  Let me, however, read a letter dated today signed by the same person, \nthe Director of the Congressional Budget Office, June O'Neill. This is \nin response to a letter that Senator Conrad and I wrote to her \nyesterday saying:\n\n       This is a curious letter you have sent to Congress, saying \n     it is going to produce a surplus. Would you please tell us \n     what the impact of the reconciliation bill will be on this \n     country's fiscal policy? In other words, what kind of surplus \n     or deficit will we have if you follow the law that exists in \n     this country, in fact, the law written by the Senator from \n     South Carolina, Senator Hollings, that says you cannot use \n     Social Security trust funds as revenues to balance the \n     budget?\n\n  So we sent the letter to Director O'Neill of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, and here is the letter we received today from the Congressional \nBudget Office, this afternoon. The letter says in the first paragraph--\nthe same kind of language from economists--``Excluding an estimated \noff-budget surplus of $108 billion''--translated, it means by and large \nexcluding the Social Security trust fund surplus in 2001 from the \ncalculation--``the CBO would project an on-budget deficit of $98 \nbillion in the year 2002.''\n  Now, I have an 8-year-old son who, when we last went to Toys 'R Us, \nwas fascinated by vanishing ink. We passed this little thing. They sell \nvanishing ink. He said, ``Daddy, how do they do that?'' I said\n\n       I do not really know. I know it is simple. It does not cost \n     very much. We could buy it and take it home. But I do not \n     know how they do vanishing ink.\n\n  I could tell my son that we do not have to stop at Toys 'R Us. We \nhave folks who have Ph.D.'s that know how to deal with vanishing ink.\n  Here we have an October 18 letter that says: ``You Republicans have \nasked me, an appointee of the Republicans, how has our plan fared in \nyour eyes?'' And you said, ``Well, we think you are doing real good. In \nfact, you have produced a surplus.''\n  We sent a letter to the same person who said:\n\n       But if you do this the right way, if you calculate this the \n     right way and do not take the Social Security trust funds, \n     because you cannot misuse those, those are Social Security \n     trust funds, do not bring them over here in the operating \n     budget, that that is the way you do it, that is the way the \n     law requires that you do it.\n\n  Then what happens is the same person 1 day later says, ``By the way, \nin the year 2002 there is not a balanced budget. There is a $98 billion \ndeficit.''\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The thing even more perplexing on the point which the \nSenator from North Dakota raises is this. This is the conference report \nof the budget bill. Let me read it. It says:\n\n       Section 205 of the conference agreement requires the \n     chairman of the Budget Committee to submit the committee's \n     responses to the first reconciliation instruction to the \n     Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  So the committee has to send all of these things to the Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  Next sentence, if the Congressional Budget Office ``certifies''--this \nis the operative word--if the Congressional Budget Office certifies \nthat these legislative recommendations will reduce spending by an \namount that will lead to a balanced budget by the year 2002, the second \nreconciliation instruction is triggered.\n  If you read the letter from the Congressional Budget Office, she does \nnot certify anything; she projects a balanced budget.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Only yesterday. Today, there is a deficit.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. But the point is, certification is a certification. You \nlook in the dictionary. It says: ``certifies: to be accurate.'' I could \nproject a balanced budget. But certification and projection are two \nentirely different words. \n\n[[Page S 15327]]\n\n  I wrote her a letter, and I think the Senator from North Dakota, my \ncolleague, and several others of us sent a letter to her saying:\n\n       When you send this letter over, you should be very careful \n     to make sure that you are absolutely certain that all of this \n     is going to lead to a balanced budget, because you have been \n     instructed not to project but to certify.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator might let me reclaim my time.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is a great point.\n  I want to say Harry Truman--you know, a fine-spoken guy from \nIndependence, MO, could not always follow all of the logic, or at least \nthe presumed logic, by the Congress. He finally says in exasperation\n\n       For God's sake, give me a one-armed economist. I am so \n     tired of hearing economists saying ``on the one hand'' and \n     ``on the other hand.'' Give me a one-armed economist.\n\n  Here it is. If Harry Truman were here, he would say, This is, on the \none hand, yesterday. This plan produces a surplus. But, on the other \nhand, today, when asked by Senator Conrad and myself, if you really do \nit right, the way the law requires, then how does it add up?\n  Well, on the other hand, this produces a $98 billion deficit in the \nyear 2002.\n  My son tonight is going to be real excited to hear that you can get \nthis right in the Senate without paying for it--vanishing ink, 24 \nhours, a new letter, a new projection. This is not a balanced budget. \nIt is a $100 billion deficit in the year 2002.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is it not amazing what a day makes?\n  Yesterday, the American people were told, you enact the Republican \nplan, you have a balanced budget. You even have a little bit of a \nsurplus. But when we asked the question, yes, but what if you obey the \nlaw of the United States, which says you cannot count Social Security \nsurpluses--and, of course, the reason you cannot count Social Security \nsurpluses is because no accountant anywhere would allow you to take the \nreserve funds, the retirement funds of your people, and throw those \ninto the pot and call it a balanced budget. That is why we have a law \nthat says you cannot count the Social Security surplus. And when you \nask the question, what do you do if you obey the law? then the head of \nthe Budget Office comes back and says, including an estimated off-\nbudget surplus of $180 billion, which is the Social Security surpluses, \nCBO would project an on-budget deficit of $98 billion in 2002--$98 \nbillion. In fact, the Republican plan, in order to balance, takes every \npenny of Social Security surpluses over the next 7 years--$650 billion. \nIt takes all those Social Security surpluses, throws those into the pot \nand says, hallelujah, we have a balanced budget.\n  Well, of course, they do not have a balanced budget. They do not have \na balanced budget by the law of the United States. They do not have a \nbalanced budget that any accountant would anywhere certify to in \nAmerica.\n  I say to my colleague, is it not interesting the difference a day \nmakes, from a surplus to a massive deficit in the year 2002 under the \nRepublican plan? There is no balanced budget here, just a big fraud.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me just make one additional comment \nand yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am sorry.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We will talk a little bit more about this next week. The \nonly reason we bothered to do this is because some of us yesterday \nfound it not believable, those who held up with great pride this \nmissive from the CBO. We felt if you are going to misuse the Social \nSecurity trust funds to the tune of $100 billion in the year 2002, \nthere is a law on the books--and the law was written, incidentally, by \nthe Senator who will speak now, the Senator who is now standing--which \nsays you cannot use the Social Security trust fund.\n  Why would we do that? Because Social Security trust funds come out of \npeople's paychecks and they are dedicated to go into a trust fund to be \nused only for one purpose and no other purpose, Social Security. We are \ncreating a surplus because we need it for the future. It is one of the \nfew responsible things we have done in the last 15 years. That surplus \nunder today's budget scheme is now being used as revenue in the \noperating budget, and that is the basis on which yesterday's letter was \nissued improperly. Today we say issue it properly and then tell us what \nthe impact is.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from North Dakota has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15326-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15327-S15329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NO BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me first congratulate the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, and the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad. These two \ngentlemen have been persistent on this issue, and this particular \nSenator from South Carolina is most grateful because for a long time I \nhave felt a little like a Johnny One Note. I took the floor 2 days ago \nand now again today to reiterate what Senator Dorgan just said--namely, \nthat the Republican budget is not balanced. A couple weeks ago, when we \nwere passing the State, Justice, Commerce Appropriations bill I said \nthat if there were a way to balance the budget without increasing \nrevenues as well as holding the line on spending, I would jump off the \nCapitol dome.\n  Let me turn, Mr. President, to the subject raised by these two \ngentlemen and the response given to their inquiry by the Director of \nthe Congressional Budget Office.\n  While my distinguished colleague from Mississippi congratulated the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, I was sorry that I could not join in \nthose congratulations, and I wish to explain in a very dignified way \njust exactly why.\n  On July 10, 1990, we voted in the Budget Committee by a vote of 20 to \n1 to put the Social Security trust fund off budget--20 yeas, 1 nay. The \none nay was the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, but the \ndistinguished present chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici, voted for my Social Security preservation amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include the committee rollcall in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the vote was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     July 10, 1990--Hollings Motion To Report the Social Security \n                            Preservation Act\n\n       The Committee agreed to the Hollings motion to report the \n     Social Security Preservation Act by a vote of 20 yeas to 1 \n     nay:\n\n                                                                        \n                Yeas                                 Nays               \n                                                                        \nMr. Sasser                           Mr. Gramm                          \nMr. Hollings                         ...................................\nMr. Johnston                         ...................................\nMr. Riegle                           ...................................\nMr. Exon                             ...................................\nMr. Lautenberg                       ...................................\nMr. Simon                            ...................................\nMr. Sanford                          ...................................\nMr. Wirth                            ...................................\nMr. Fowler                           ...................................\nMr. Conrad                           ...................................\nMr. Dodd                             ...................................\nMr. Robb                             ...................................\nMr. Domenici                         ...................................\nMr. Boschwitz                        ...................................\nMr. Symms                            ...................................\nMr. Grassley                         ...................................\nMr. Kasten                           ...................................\nMr. Nickles                          ...................................\nMr. Bond                                                                \n                                                                        \n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair. On October 18, 1990, I toiled \nalongside the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, our late, \nwonderful Senator and friend, John Heinz. He had been working \ndiligently on this issue as well. He was not on the Budget Committee, \nbut I said to John, if you can get the votes on the Republican side, I \nthink we can really finally fix this problem. It needed fixing because \neveryone had been playing games.\n  The truth of the matter is, Mr. President, that beyond using the \nsurpluses in the Social Security trust fund, another $12 billion comes \nfrom other trust funds. They use the highway trust fund. They use the \nairport and airways trust fund, the civil service retirement, the \nmilitary retirement trust fund. You can go right on down the list. Back \nin 1990, you could not get anybody's attention talking about these \nother trust funds, but I said on Social Security I think we have got \nthem.\n  Mr. President, the vote on October 18, 1990, was 98 to 2. \n\n[[Page S 15328]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Senate vote \non the Hollings-Heinz amendment putting Social Security off budget.\n  There being no objection, the vote was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Subject.--Hollings-Heinz, et al., amendment which excludes \n     the Social Security Trust Funds from the budget deficit \n     calculation, BEGINNING in FY 1991.\n\n\n                               yeas (98)\n\n       Democrats (55 or 100%)--Adams, Akaka, Baucus, Bentsen, \n     Biden, Bingaman, Boren, Bradley, Breaux, Bryan, Bumpers, \n     Burdick, Byrd, Conrad, Cranston, Daschle, DeConcini, Dixon, \n     Dodd, Exon, Ford, Fowler, Glenn, Gore, Graham, Harkin, \n     Heflin, Hollings, Inouye, Johnston, Kennedy, Kerrey, Kerry, \n     Kohl, Lautenberg, Leahy, Levin, Lieberman, Metzenbaum, \n     Mikulski, Mitchell, Moynihan, Nunn, Pell, Pryor, Reid, \n     Riegle, Robb, Rockefeller, Sanford, Sarbanes, Sasser, Shelby, \n     Simon, Wirth.\n       Republicans (43 or 96%)--Bond, Boschwitz, Burns, Chafee, \n     Coats, Cochran, Cohen, D'Amato, Danforth, Dole, Domenici, \n     Durenberger, Garn, Gorton, Gramm, Grassley, Hatch, Hatfield, \n     Heinz, Helms, Humphrey, Jeffords, Kassebaum, Kasten, Lott, \n     Lugar, Mack, McCain, McClure, McConnell, Murkowski, Nickles, \n     Packwood, Pressler, Roth, Rudman, Simpson, Specter, Stevens, \n     Symms, Thurmond, Warner, Wilson.\n\n\n                                nays (2)\n\n       Democrats (0 or 0%).\n       Republicans (2 or 4%)--Armstrong, Wallop.\n\n\n                             not voting (0)\n\n       Democrats (0).\n       Republicans (0).\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  And then on November 5, Mr. President, George Bush, President George \nBush, signed into law, Public Law 101-508, saying here:\n\n       Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is \n     amended by adding at the end the following: The concurrent \n     resolution shall not include the outlays and revenue totals \n     of the old age, survivors and disability insurance program \n     established under title II of the Social Security Act or the \n     related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in \n     the surplus or deficit totals required by this subsection or \n     in any other surplus or deficit totals required by this \n     title.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record at this particular \npoint section 13301 of Public Law 101-508 of the United States.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Subtitle C--Social Security\n\n     SEC. 13301. OFF-BUDGET STATUS OF OASDI TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Social Security From All Budgets.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipt, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (b) Exclusion of Social Security From Congressional \n     Budget.--Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The \n     concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and \n     revenue totals of the old age, survivors, and disability \n     insurance program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection or in any other surplus or \n     deficit totals required by this title.''.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. President, my friends on the other side are well rehearsed in \nrepeating their little drumbeat--balanced budget, balanced budget, \nbalanced budget, balanced budget. But like they say back home: no \nmatter how many times you say it, it doesn't make it so.\n  Chairman Kasich filed a conference report on June 26, 1995, and on \npage 3 you will see the word ``deficit''--not ``balance''--for fiscal \n2002, $108.4 billion.\n  We need to open our eyes. When we started the budget process at the \nbeginning of the year, the distinguished chairman of the committee said \nthat we were going to provide the American people with a down payment. \nWe were not going to balance the budget.\n  As we marked up the budget, the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee said, ``Now, we require that the reconciliation bill be \npassed into law before we do any tax cut.''\n  That has been changed, Mr. President. Now we have a different process \nwhere we give CBO certain assumptions. We send them over one day and \nthey say we have a $10 billion surplus. We come back the next day and \nthey say you have a $100 billion deficit.\n  In the Commerce Committee, where I am the ranking member, we are \ncharged with saving $15 billion. Mr. President, $8 billion of our \nallotment has already been spent on the telecommunications bill. Half \nof our assigned savings in the Commerce Committee is absolutely false. \nThe same may be true in other committees as well.\n  It is like Cato's famous couplet, ``The politician makes his own \nlittle laws and sits attentive to his own applause.'' Why, heavens \nabove, you will probably be able to say something else tomorrow.\n  What we are trying to do is to level with the American people. What \nwe are trying to do is cut spending, freeze spending, close loopholes. \nBut you cannot balance the budget, Mr. President, you cannot do it \nwithout also increasing revenues. Nobody around here wants to say that, \nbut that is the truth.\n  I was put to the metal when the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, and others, appeared on December 18. Mr. Kasich, Senator \nDomenici, and others, said, ``We are going to have three budgets. We \ndon't care what the President has got. We are going to balance the \nbudget without taxes.'' I went to the budget staff and said, ``I'm \nmissing something.''\n  I had worked with Senator Baker on a freeze and back in 1981. Then I \ngot together with Senator Gramm and Senator Rudman, and we had a freeze \nand cuts across the board. In 1986 we closed the loopholes with tax \nreform. Then in 1989 and in 1990 we appeared before the Finance \nCommittee and in the Budget Committee proposing a value-added tax.\n  We got eight votes in the Budget Committee on that proposal. We got \nSenator Danforth, Senator Boschwitz and others to work as part of a \nbipartisan group with truth-in-budgeting.\n  But now we have a big act going on now.

Since my time is limited here, let me just point out \none thing. The interest costs are growing faster than the cuts. The \ninterest costs on the gross debt are scheduled to total $348 billion \nfor this fiscal year. That is almost $1 billion a day. In addition, \nover the 7-year period you know how much we use of Social Security, \n$636 billion. It is not a balanced budget, Mr. President, and it's high \ntime we recognize this fact.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15327-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15329-S15330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BALANCING THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I hope that everyone is watching what is going on right \nnow. I cannot tell you how long many of us have been working on the \nproblem of the deficits in this country. And we are finally to a point \nwhere we can do something about it.\n  It is hard for Americans to understand the obstacles that we are \nfacing. There are those of us who really want to do something, really \nwant to balance the budget, with the obstacles we face, and not just \nthe things that are said that are not true, but the fact that I cannot \nhelp but believe there are some people who really do not care that much \nabout balancing the budget.\n  This goes back a long, long time. I can remember, Mr. President, U.S. \nSenator Carl Curtis from Nebraska. I saw the Senator from Nebraska a \nmoment ago. I was hoping he would still be here when I talked about his \nhome State. He came up with an idea way back in 1972. Carl Curtis said \nthe only way we are ever going to get a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution is to get something ratified in advance from the \nStates to show that there is enough grassroots support to pass it.\n  And so he devised this plan. He said, we are going to have the State \nsenates and State legislatures throughout America pass and preratify an \namendment to the Constitution so that will give us the power that is \nnecessary and influence necessary to get this thing passed. He came to \nOklahoma. I was in the State senate at that time.\n  I remember back in 1972 the total national debt was something like \n$200 billion. And I remember a TV ad that they had to try to impress \nupon people to quantify how much money this really was. They had $100 \nbills that they stacked up and then finally it was up to the height of \nthe Empire State Building, which was a tall building at that time. That \nwas $200 billion. That was 1972. Well, anyway, I passed a resolution in \nthe State senate of the State of Oklahoma to preratify it even though \ntechnically we know that would not work. And so he came in and we \ntalked about it. That is how long we have been working on this.\n  Now since that time in my own personal life we have had four \nchildren. Now they are all grown. Now we have grandchildren.\n  We talked on the floor of this Senate as to the significance of the \ndiscussion that has taken place right now of the fact that we really \nhave an opportunity to make a vote, to take a step that the CBO and \neverybody else says is going to balance the budget, is going to \neliminate the deficit by the year 2002. Many of us would like to do it \nearlier than that. But we are satisfied in knowing that we cannot \ncontinue on the course that we are on.\n  During the national prayer breakfast that took place in February of \nthis year I had the honor of participating in that and of talking to \nmany groups that came in from foreign countries. One was a gentleman \nwho came in from one of the former Soviet Republics. I cannot recall \nthe name of which one it was at this time. But they just recently found \ntheir freedoms in that country.\n  He asked me a question in front of a group. This is during a national \nprayer breakfast discussion. He said, ``Senator Inhofe, in your \ncountry, how much can you keep?''\n  I said, ``No. I don't understand what you are saying.''\n  He said, ``How much money can you keep?''\n  Then after a little while I figured out what he was talking about.\n  What he was really saying is how much do you have to give the \nGovernment in America? He was very proud to announce to us that under \ntheir new democracy, under their new freedom, that they are able to \nkeep 20 percent. In other words, in that particular country, they \nturned around and had to give the government 80 percent of everything \nthey earned on a periodic basis like every month or every 2 months. I \ndo not remember the exact timeframe.\n  And I thought, my goodness, he is so proud of this freedom. Then we \nlooked at a study that no one has refuted, and no one in this Chamber \ntoday will refute it, that if we do not do something to change the \ncourse that we are on, that by the time someone who is born today, like \nmy three grandchildren, during the course of their lifetimes, they will \nhave to pay, not 80 percent, but 82 percent of their lifetime income \njust to support the Federal Government.\n  Now, that is what we are looking at right now. That is why this is \nsignificant. That is why we are at a point we cannot say that we are \njust going to be business as usual. The elections of 1994 were very \nspecific. They had mandates in those elections. All of the postelection \nsurveys have indicated there are about four areas that people want in \nthis country. First, they want less Government involvement in their \nlives; second, a stronger national defense; third, punishing criminals; \nand fourth, which actually came out first, they want to do something \nabout eliminating the deficit, about starting to cut into reducing the \ndebt. \n\n[[Page S 15330]]\n\n  Now, obviously you cannot do that until you stop increasing the \ndeficits. We have a program now, that will accomplish that by the year \n2002.\n  I yesterday took to the floor and talked about some of the new allies \nthat those of us who really want to do something constructive about \neliminating the deficit have, some new allies that are coming along. We \nare seeing right now responsible but liberal editorial boards \nthroughout America are now saying, ``Look. We have heard enough of this \nlie that is being perpetrated by the leadership of the Democrats in \nboth the House and the Senate, trying to draw a connection between tax \nrelief and balancing the budget.''\n  And I suggest to you that the choice is not taking that amount of \nmoney that is going to be coming out in tax relief and putting it \ntoward the deficit because we know if we are going to be honest with \nourselves all that would do is go to more social programs which this \nadministration wants. They do not want cuts. They do not want freezes. \nThey do not want to control growth. They want to increase the social \nprograms. They want business as usual.\n  Mr. President, the times are changed now. This is not the way it \nwould have been 2 years ago or 4 years ago or 6 years ago.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will not yield yet. We are on a timeframe. There are a \ncouple things I want to cover first. The Senator will have an \nopportunity to have his 10 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. I just want to ask a question.\n  Mr. INHOFE. With this timeframe we are looking at now, it is so \ncritical that we ignore the demagogs and those who are trying to ignore \nthis problem.\n  I suggest, as I did yesterday, that one of these newspapers which has \nalways been pro-Democrat, as opposed to Republican, which has been \nliberal in their editorial policy, the Washington Post, had an \neditorial just the other day, September 15. This editorial is called \n``Medagogues.'' In this editorial, they talk about how the Democrats \nare trying to draw a relationship between tax relief and balancing the \nbudget.\n  I suggest that anyone--and it has been  suggested  in  some  of  \nthese  editorials,  not  this  particular one, that if anyone was \nopposed to the tax increase of the Clinton administration of 1993--this \nis back when the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate and this \nwas characterized as the largest single tax increase in the history of \npublic finance in America or anyplace in the world, and that was not \nJim Inhofe, a conservative Republican talking, that happened to be a \nDemocrat on the floor of the Senate talking, that that was the largest \nsingle tax increase in 1993.\n  What did they do? It was a tax increase on, among other people, the \nsenior citizens, a 50-percent tax increase in Social Security, raising \nit from 50 to 80 percent. This is something the American people did not \nwant.\n  So I suggest to you, Mr. President, that if there is anyone out \nthere, including Democrats or Republicans, who opposed that tax \nincrease, they should be for tax relief now. Essentially all we are \ntrying to do is repeal the damage that was done to the American people \nback in 1993.\n  ``Medagogues'' is the name of the editorial:\n\n       What the Democrats have instead is a lot of expostulation, \n     TV ads and scare talk.\n\n  They go on and on.\n\n       But there isn't any evidence that they would ``lose their \n     Medicare'' or lose their choice of doctor under the \n     Republican plan.\n\n  This is something that is very critical, because this is an important \npart of the bill that will be considered.\n  Ten days later, they came out again, and I think this is the first \ntime probably in the history of the Washington Post that they came out \ntwice on the same subject taking the conservative side of an issue. The \nlast two sentences of this editorial are:\n\n       The Democrats have fabricated the Medicare-tax cut \n     connection because it is useful politically. It allows them \n     to attack and to duck responsibility, both at the same time. \n     We think it's wrong.\n\n  I want to conclude, because my time is almost up. I have to be very \ncritical of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. They are \nflooding the airwaves throughout America with propaganda such as this \none that says: ``Inhofe Feasts on Tax Cut for the Privileged While \nChildren Go to Bed Hungry.''\n  Just the other day this was sent out to every newspaper in Oklahoma \ncharacterizing me as some kind of monster abusing the children, abusing \nthe elderly. All we are trying to do is protect America for the next \ngeneration, my grandchildren, which, if we do not do it, will have to \nspend 82 percent of their lifetime income just to support this \nmonstrous Government.\n  So, Mr. President, this is what conservatives are going up against. \nThis is the ridicule we have been subjected to. These are the slings \nand arrows that are happening to us.\n  I can tell you right now, the American people understand the same as \nthey understood they did not want our health care delivery system \nturned over to Government, they understand this is the last opportunity \nwe are going to have in America to actually bring this budget under \ncontrol and, in this case, to eliminate the deficit by the year 2002.\n  I will conclude by quoting one of my favorite people, Churchill, who \nsaid: ``Truth is incontrovertible. Panic may rescind it, ignorance may \nderide it, malice may destroy it, but there it is.'' And the truth is \ngoing to come through. We are going to succeed in this effort. Thank \nyou, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15329-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15330-S15331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            A TAX INCREASE FOR 50 PERCENT OF AMERICAN PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I never will forget in 1981 how the wind \nswept through this Senate and accepted Ronald Reagan's promise that if \nwe just pass this massive tax cut, it would generate so much economic \nactivity and so many taxes that we would balance the budget in 3 years, \nno more than 4 years. That was $4 trillion ago.\n  I am happy to report I was 1 of 11 Senators that did not buy that for \none instant. And, Mr. President, we are getting the same snake oil with \nthis bill.\n  I applaud a lot of people on both sides of the aisle who have \ncommitted themselves to dealing with the problem the American people \nhave said is No. 1. But there is a time to pass tax cuts, and the time \nto do it is after we balance the budget, not before.\n  But having said that, Mr. President, let me add that I would not vote \nfor this tax bill if we had a $300 billion surplus this year. I would \nnot vote for this tax bill if you held a gun to my head, because it \nbetrays every value I hold dear about this Nation. The budget \nresolution that we passed in June said CBO will certify, not project, \ncertify a balanced budget by the year 2002. And that once they certify \nit, then the Finance Committee can report out a $245 billion tax cut. \nThe problem with that is not only has CBO not certified, they have only \nprojected, but once this tax bill passes--and it is going to pass, Mr. \nPresident, make no mistake about that--but once it passes, the money \nwill be gone and unavailable to help meet unexpected obligations like \nrecessions, wars, trade wars, earthquakes, hurricanes, or floods.\n  A flood 3 years ago cost somewhere between $10 and $20 billion. We \nare still paying for Hurricane Hugo, which also cost billions.\n  But here is the reason I would not vote for the tax bill. Look what \nit does. It has a capital gains provision: 76.3 percent--think of that, \n76.3 percent of the capital gains tax cut which costs almost $50 \nbillion goes to people who make over $100,000 or more. That is about 7 \npercent of the American people, including every single Member of the \nU.S. Congress.\n  You think I am going to vote for a bill that gives 6.4 percent to \npeople who make less than $30,000 a year; 4.6 percent if you make \n$30,000 to $50,000; 6.1 percent if you make $75,000 to $100,000; and 76 \npercent to people who make over $100,000? I would not vote for that \nunder any circumstances. Those people do not need a tax cut.\n  I might also say, my friends in the business community in my State \nsay, ``Senator, we don't need a tax cut, we need to get the deficit \nunder control. Balance the budget and then talk about taxes.''\n  What is even worse--talk about betraying our values--CBO said this \nbill represents a tax increase on 51 percent of the American people. \nThat is how \n\n[[Page S 15331]]\nmany people in America make less than $30,000 a year--51 percent. They \nget a tax increase out of this when you consider the cuts in the EITC, \nstudent loans, and all the others. At the same time, the richest 1 \npercent of the people in the country get $20,000 in tax cuts. Think of \nthat, 50 percent of the people on the lowest rung of the ladder get a \ntax increase, and people making $200,000 a year or more get $20,000.\n  What has happened to the country? Why do we do things like that? It \nbetrays everything I believe in. During the Depression when I was \ngrowing up in a family poor as Job's turkey, we looked to the \nGovernment to help us, not hurt us. It was the Government we turned to \nfor sewer systems and water systems and paved streets and rural \nelectrification. Today, we are saying, let them eat cake.\n\n  Who wants the tax cut? Seventy percent of the people in this country, \nin a USA Today poll, said reduce the deficit. One-third as many, 24 \npercent, said give me a tax cut. There is no clamor for it.\n  On the earned income tax credit, President Reagan, Majority Leader \nDole, Senator Domenici, and many others on the Republican side of the \naisle have said that is a wonderful program. So what are we going to \ndo? We are going to cut it.\n  Mr. President, it is not just the tax bill that is so horrendous \nabout this thing. There are all kinds of things in there. We continue \nto give away western lands to the biggest corporations in America, the \nmining corporations. And there is $18 million, over a 7-year period, in \nhere against the mining companies. They get off scot-free--essentially \nscot-free.\n  And then there is ANWR. Open up ANWR up on the north slope. That is \ngoing to be a tough one, Mr. President. That is going to be debated \nheavily here, because that is the same thing as an asset sale. When you \nsell an asset--as any businessman will tell you--that is a one-time \nbonanza for you. If you put that one-time bonanza into your operating \nbudget, you will be in big trouble the next year.\n  Mr. President, we are selling our petroleum reserve in Elk Hills, our \nnaval petroleum reserves. We are selling 40 million barrels of oil out \nof our strategic petroleum reserve. We are selling everything in the \nworld we can lay our hands on, with no thought of what you do for an \nencore, once you sell those assets. Until a few months ago, Congress \ncould not count the sale of an asset as a revenue raiser. Why? Because \ncounting the revenue from an asset sale fails to show the loss of value \nof the asset. It was only this year that Congress changed the budget \nlaw to allow asset scoring and count it toward balancing the budget. \nNow that we have changed the scoring process, we are selling everything \nwe can get our hands on and counting that against the deficit.\n  Let me go back to the earned income tax credit for a moment. The EITC \nhelps reduce the poverty rate. Look at this chart. In 1993, 15.1 \npercent of the people lived in poverty. By 1994, the poverty rate had \ndropped to 14.5 percent. And if you consider the actual number of \npersons living in poverty, it was down almost one million people. So \nwhat are we going to do? Cut the earned-income tax credit, even as the \nprogram is working. There is the proof.\n  The other day at this Million Man March, the point was made over and \nover again that fewer and fewer black people are enrolling in college. \nSo what are we going to do? We are going to cut education funds by 30 \npercent--the most massive cut in the history of the country in \neducation. It is going to make it much more difficult to get a loan, \nand then more difficult to pay it off.\n  We are torpedoing all the programs that are working. Mind you, there \nare some programs that we need to torpedo, but the EITC and educational \nloans are not among them. I stood on this floor and I fought the B-2 \nbomber, I fought the space station, and I fought the super collider. I \nfought so many fights trying to save money to get spending under \ncontrol here, and I lost most of them. Do you know why? Because the \ncompanies who make those big-ticket items dominate. We are not going to \nsolve our spending problems until we reform campaign financing. The \nspace station is made in 36 States, and that guarantees that it will \ncontinue. It is the most horrendous, outrageous waste of money in the \nhistory of man, and you cannot stop it. But you can sure stop payments \nto old people, who depend on Medicare for their health care.\n  You think of it. A $270 billion cut in Medicare. A $182 billion cut \nin Medicaid, health care for the poorest of the poor. I ask for 1 \nadditional minute.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I object. We were set up for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection has been heard. The Senator has \nspoken for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS.

Mr. President, when we have an arrangement to speak for \n10 minutes, it seems to me that is what we should do.\n  I want to talk a little bit about the opportunity and the time that \nwe now have to come to a decision. We have been talking this whole year \nabout budgets, about balanced budgets. We started out in the beginning \nof the year with a vote on balanced budgets, which lost by one vote. We \nhave worked the whole year long, and now we are down to the place where \nit begins to count. We are down to where we are going to make a \ndecision as to what we do.\n  Mr. President, I listened to my colleague on the other side, and I \nhave heard that speech for 25 years. For 25 years, we have not balanced \nthe budget in this place. Every year we have the same litany of reasons \nwhy we cannot do that. For the first time in that period of time, we \nhave a dedication to doing it. For the first time, we have a pattern to \ndo that. We can balance the budget.\n  The real question is, is it reasonable, is it morally and fiscally \nresponsible to go for 25 years without balancing the amount of money \nyou take in with the amount of money you take out? How long could you \ndo that in your family or in your business? We are beginning to have \nthe same repercussions that you would have there--the repercussion \nbeing that we have a $5 trillion debt, and we will have to vote on that \nthis month, or early next month; that the interest on that debt will \nnow amount to probably the largest single-line item in the budget. So \nwe hear, year after year, the same litany of reasons why we cannot do \nthis, basically, frankly, from the same people who have been here for \n25 years. I do not mean to be critical. It is a tough decision. But \npeople sent us here, this year particularly, to deal with that issue. \nIt is time to do that. We hear the talk about the Reagan years, when we \nreduced taxes and the promise that it would increase the economy. It \ndid in fact increase the economy markedly. The problem was, we did not \nreduce or hold down spending. The constitutional responsibility for \ndoing that lies right here in this Congress. Right here. It is our \nresponsibility to do that.\n  We hear about capital gains tax cuts. These are tax cuts that provide \nan opportunity for investment to create jobs, that give us a prosperous \neconomy and give us a chance for people to work and take care of their \nfamilies. That is what that is about. The earned income tax credit. \nThat will continue to grow. It has been the fastest growing program in \nthe entire budget. It started out, I believe, at about $1.5 billion. It \nhas gone to $25 billion in less than 10 years and is scheduled to go to \n$32 billion. That is a cut? Give me a break. It is not a cut. It is \nalso one of the programs that has been most filled with \ninconsistencies, and indeed fraud in many cases, payments going to \npeople that did not qualify for them.\n  So, Mr. President, it is really time that we take a little look at \nwhat we are doing here. If we do not balance the budget, what happens? \nIf we do not do something about Medicare, what happens? Medicare in the \ntrust fund, in part A, goes broke in 2002. That is the way it is. So we \nhave to do something about it. A child born today owes $187,000 in \ninterest on the Federal debt. That is where we are. That is why we have \nto do something about it. By the year 2015, all of our spending will be \non entitlements and the national debt interest. All of our tax revenues \nwill be taken for that reason. \n\n[[Page S 15332]]\n\n  So what do we need to do? Obviously, we need to balance the budget. \nWe need to preserve, protect and strengthen Medicare. We need to reform \nwelfare. And we need to--to the extent that we can do it after the \nbudget is balanced--reduce the taxes on American families so they can \nspend more of their own money.\n  In this proposition, the tax cutting comes after the balanced budget \nis certified. That is the system. That is the plan that we have here. \nThe benefits include lower interest rates for businesses, for families, \nand less expensive homes, cars, and student loans. The Senator talked \nabout education. Student loans will be at a lower interest rate. There \nwill be a higher standard of living. Some estimate there will be as \nmany as 6 million more jobs. So we have to do this.\n  The best opportunity that we have had will be before us in the next 2 \nweeks. That is what the voters said to us last November. That is their \nexpectation. That is our expectation--those of us, particularly, who \nhave just come this year. We came with the commitment to fundamentally \nchange the direction in which we are going. We came with a commitment \nto change the things the Senator was talking about--deficits for 25 \nyears. The administration does not have a budget that will give us a \nbalanced budget. The first budget was defeated 99-0. The second was not \nvoted on. By CBO's own estimates, at the end of 10 years, it will still \nhave a $200 billion deficit.\n  So we can talk about the same things we have talked about forever. We \ncan talk about all the reasons why this cannot be done. We can make \nexcuses. But the real question is, is it fiscally and morally \nresponsible to move toward a balanced budget in 7 years? If the answer \nis yes, then the opportunity arises before us in this next 2-week \nperiod.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will take advantage of this \nopportunity and that, for the first time in a very long time, we will \nhave changed the course of irresponsible spending and moved into a time \nof a responsible balanced budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15331-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15332-S15333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WHY AMERICANS NEED TAX REFORM\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I have been sitting here listening earlier \ntonight to some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talking \nabout the numbers and problems associated with trying to balance this \nbudget over the next 7 years, and while they have been laughing and \ntelling jokes, not just tonight, but for the last 30 years, they have \nburied the American taxpayer $5 trillion in debt. It would be funny, \nmaybe, if it were not so serious.\n  They talk about the Social Security trust fund and that Republicans \nare spending every dime to balance this budget over the next 7 years. \nBut what they fail to tell you is that they have endorsed this same \npractice for years. In fact, this year alone, the budget that the \nPresident of the United States that they passed in 1993 spent every \ndime of the surplus out of the Social Security trust fund, which, by \nthe way, under law, can only be invested in U.S. securities, backed by \nthe Federal Government. So that money goes to the Treasury, and it has \nbeen spent by the Congress ahead of us, by the Democratic majority. It \nhas been spent away. So when they talk about the Republicans using \nevery dime from the Social Security trust fund, they should look at \ntheir votes in 1993, as their President tried to mask the deficit in \nthe budget by using those trust fund dollars.\n  In fact, the deficit touted today by this President of $170 billion \nactually is using $68 billion of Social Security trust fund money from \nthis year. Otherwise, he would have to report a deficit of about $240 \nbillion. This Congress has inherited the troubles created over the last \n30 years. It would have been a lot easier, especially politically, if \nwe could have just continued this huge giveaway. But it would have been \nat the expense of the next generation. It was time to stand up and look \nthis problem in the face and make some of those tough decisions.\n  The Democrats talked about the drastic cuts. Just a few moments ago, \nmy good friend from Arkansas talked about fewer dollars for education. \nWell, these are the first signs of the problems we are facing today \nbecause of the last 30 years and the spending spree that this Congress \nhas been on.\n  The Democrats have pre-spent those dollars that could be used today \nfor education, and if we do not get this budget under control today, \nnext year those problems are even going to be worse, and we are going \nto be talking about other programs that are not going to have the \ndollars because they are going to pay interest and other expenses.\n  So we do have to make some very serious decisions, Mr. President. \nOtherwise, our next generation, and the generation after, are going to \nhave to pay for the mistakes we have made, and we should not leave \nthem, financially or morally, that way. It is wrong to do that. This is \nthe first good attempt to put a balanced budget in place that is going \nto make sure that we do not leave our children with our debts.\n  Mr. President, as we begin debating the tax policy, including a $245 \nbillion tax cut, I believe that the time has come to also begin some \nserious discussions about how best to reform our badly outdated Tax \nCode itself.\n  Since 1913, when Congress first gained the power to impose taxes on \nincome, the Tax Code has been manipulated and expanded so many times by \nCongress that it has become the greatest barrier between the American \npeople and their Government.\n  Every segment of society has a reason to complain about the Tax Code. \nFor individuals and families, the cost of complying with the Tax Code \ntoo often becomes the difference between making it in America, and just \nmaking do.\n  I have spoken several times on the Senate floor about a young \nMinnesota family, the Wolstads, who represent the very frustrations \nfelt by millions of Americans when it comes to the topic of taxes.\n  Natalie Wolstad wrote to me about the enormous tax burden her family \nis forced to bear, a burden she and her husband did not fully \nappreciate until they met 1 day with their realtor, and learned they \nsimply could not afford to purchase a new home on their own.\n  Countless other Minnesota families have sent me letters sharing \nsimilar stories of their own.\n  They were trying to decide, ``Where are we spending our money \nfoolishly?'' When they finally looked at their pay stubs, they were \nseeing how much money was being taken from them in taxes.\n  Yes, the Tax Code is tough on families, and it is equally hard on \nAmerica's job providers--small businesses and large.\n  When nearly 2,000 entrepreneurs gathered in Washington this summer \nfor the third White House Conference on Small Business, they came with \nhundreds of ideas on how to make Government more responsive to the \npeople who create the jobs on Main Street.\n  Although their suggestions covered an enormous range of concerns, one \npoint generated near-universal agreement: something must be done about \nthe complex and costly Federal tax system.\n  If Congress is truly serious about answering the calls of help from \nthe American people and reforming the tax system, there are three \ndistinct problems which must be addressed.\n  First, taxes are too high. That is something President Clinton \nacknowledged this week, when he admitted that the recordbreaking tax \nincrease he pushed through Congress in 1993 was too much for the \nAmerican people.\n  Under the headline in the paper ``Tax Rise,'' ``too much,'' President \nClinton concedes. But he did take time to blame the Republicans for it. \nThat is at a time when the Democrats controlled every branch of \nGovernment--the House, the Senate, and the White House. I welcome the \nPresident's realization, but I wish it had come before he signed the \n$255 billion tax hike into law.\n  The first step toward building a better Tax Code is to look at the \nrole of the Federal Government and let the people start keeping more of \ntheir own money, which they work for.\n  After all, it does not belong to the Government in the first place. \nAnd who \n\n[[Page S 15333]]\nis in a better position to make a family's spending decisions and set \ntheir financial priorities--Washington, or the family itself?\n  Clearly, that responsibility belongs with the family.\n  We have the opportunity to take that first step in the next few \nweeks, by passing a $245 billion tax cut which includes the $500 per \nchild tax credit I authored and have fought for over the last 3 years.\n  I welcome President Clinton's support for tax relief, and urge him to \njoin our efforts. By letting taxpayers keep what is rightfully theirs. \nwe send a strong message that our efforts to balance the budget will \nalways make taxpayers the first priority--not the last.\n  The second area we must address when discussing reform of the Tax \nCode is simplification--and simplification must be at the heart of any \nplan Congress considers.\n  There is nothing simple about our tax system anymore.\n  The IRS manages a library of 437 separate tax forms and mails out 8 \nbillion pages of tax instructions every year.\n  The distinguished House majority leader, Representative Armey of \nTexas, points out that American workers and businesses spent 5.4 \nbillion hours in 1990 just preparing their taxes--more time than it \ntakes to build every car, truck and van manufactured in the United \nStates each year.\n  This Congress has made shrinkage and simplification its primary \ngoals, and there is nothing that needs it more than our current tax \nsystem.\n  Today's Tax Code may be good business for tax lawyers and \naccountants, but it is not good policy for the average American \ntaxpayer.\n  Tax reform must include tax simplification.\n  The final consideration in building a better Tax Code is making it \nfairer and more equitable for the taxpayers. Far too often, the current \nsystem is not.\n  The Government continually manipulates the Tax Code--not just to fund \nGovernment objectives, but to micromanage the economy and the \nactivities of the taxpayers.\n  If the Government wants to encourage a particular behavior, it offers \na tax benefit.\n  If it wants to discourage a particular behavior, it sets a tax \npenalty.\n  The social engineers have had a field day with the Tax Code. Fairness \nseems to have been left by the wayside, and families are paying the \nprice.\n  Look how they have been manipulated through the tax system.\n  Families, who in 1947 paid just 22 percent of their personal income \nin the form of taxes, today send nearly 50 cents of every dollar they \nearn to Federal, State, or local government.\n  As someone who ran for Congress because of high taxes and what they \nare doing to this Nation, I am incensed that middle-class American \nfamilies are being asked to bear the brunt of our enormous tax burden, \nand then listen to some Senators say that we have to increase taxes \nmore.\n  In fact, families with children are now the lowest income group in \nAmerica--below elderly households, below single persons, below couples \nwithout children.\n  In 1950, the average American family sent $1 out of every $50 it \nearned to Washington--today, the average family sends $1 out of every \n$4 to feed the Federal Government.\n  The marriage penalty targets families by taxing them at a higher rate \nthan it does single filers.\n  And if the dependent exemption had kept up with inflation, it would \nbe more than $8,000 today instead of just over $2,000.\n  The message we're sending through our tax policy is that families are \njust not as important today as they were in 1950.\n  That message must change.\n  We have the opportunity and responsibility in this Congress to repair \nthe fractured relationship between the Government and its owners--the \ntaxpayers.\n  It is time we started to talk seriously about cutting taxes, \nsimplifying the system, and making it more equitable.\n  A recent Forbes magazine cover story called tax reform a ``broad \npolitical movement, gaining in popularity the way a hurricane gathers \nforce as it heads for land.''\n  The questions we should be asking ourselves are not will we ever \nbreak form the past and will we ever have a Tax Code that treats all \nAmericans equitably, but rather when.\n  Mr. President, the answer to that question is now, and the Senate \nFinance Committee has taken an enormous step toward reaching that goal \nwith its $245 billion tax cut package.\n  By cutting taxes for families and job-providers, simplifying the way \nthose taxes are collected, and ensuring a process that's fair, \nreforming the tax system will go a long way toward making government \nmore accountable to the people.\n  Washington needs to be reminded that the money it collects is not \ntheirs by right--it is collected for use at the will of the taxpayers. \nAnd Congress needs to be reminded daily that it represents the \ntaxpayers.\n  The success of our efforts to reform the tax system won't be measured \nsolely by how much of their own dollars Congress allows families and \njob providers to keep. It will also be measured by how equitable the \nsystem is, and how the taxpayers fare under it.\n  If we can successfully accomplish all of that, then we will have \nheard the message of last November and delivered on the solemn promises \nwe made to the American people.\n  Mr. President, it is time that we get behind this effort. It is time \nthat we balance the budget and stop passing our deficits on to our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15332-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15333-S15334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BUDGET FANTASY VERSUS REALITY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to continue discussing the same \nsubject that the Senator from Wyoming and the Senator from Minnesota \nhave been discussing, and to do so by, first of all, focusing on some \nof the myths that have been created by the President and by some of his \nsupporters here in the Senate. I am talking about the difference \nbetween the budget fantasy and the reality that faces us here today. It \nis almost an ``Alice in Wonderland'' exercise where words take on \nmeanings that are only in the eye of the beholder and have no \nrelationship to actual reality.\n  Frankly, they are the last desperate attempts by proponents of big \nGovernment to cling to the status quo, which means more spending, \nhigher taxes, and greater regulation. That is really what this exercise \nin opposition to a balanced budget and tax cuts is all about.\n  Many of the Democrats cannot believe, let alone accept, that the \nAmerican people overwhelmingly rejected their approach to governing in \nthat way in last fall's election. Rather than attempting to fulfill the \nmandate which the American people gave us, they are now cynically \npandering to the mandates while doing everything they can to undermine \nit.\n  In this topsy-turvy ``Alice in Wonderland'' change, the meaning-of-\nwords situation they have created, spending cuts are increases; \nspending increases are cuts. For example, claiming that a Medicare \nspending increase of $2,000 per person over the next 7 years is \nactually a cut when, in fact, it is a $2,000 increase.\n  Tax cuts, they say, are spending increases. Tax relief for families \nbecome tax cuts for the rich. A volunteer in AmeriCorps is actually \npaid by the taxpayers $20,000, $30,000, or $40,000 a year. Tax \npayments, the President says, are contributions. Preserving Medicare is \nslashing Medicare. And, of course, bankrupting Medicare is saving it.\n  President Clinton is even now so bold as to blame Republicans, not a \nsingle one of whom supported his budget in 1993, for forcing him to \nraise taxes. It is like ``the old devil made me do it'' skit that we \nused to see on TV. He says he wishes he had not increased the taxes. I, \ntoo, wish he had not increased taxes. But at least our attempt to \nreduce taxes by $245 billion is a beginning, a partial rollback of this \ntax increase which he now wishes he had not imposed upon the American \npeople.\n  Here are some examples of increases that the Democrats claim are \ncuts.\n  The Republican Party has said all year that we would not balance the \nbudget at the expense of Social Security. The budget reconciliation \nbill will \n\n[[Page S 15334]]\nnot touch Social Security retirement benefits or cost-of-living \nadjustments, COLA's. Social Security will increase 43 percent, from \n$336 billion this year to $482 billion 7 years from now.\n  Medicare--we are going to increase Medicare spending, not cut it. \nMedicare will grow from $178 billion in 1995 to $274 billion in 2002, a \n54-percent increase. Spending per beneficiary will rise from an average \nof $4,800 today to more than $6,700 in the year 2002, almost a $2,000 \nincrease, as I said before.\n  Student loans--we have heard a lot about that. Student loan volume \nwill grow from $24 billion in 1995 to $36 billion in the year 2002, a \n50-percent increase. The maximum Pell grant will be raised to $2,440 \nnext year, the highest level it has ever been.\n  By the way, we could send a whole lot more needy kids to school with \nPell grants, eight or nine for every single AmeriCorps volunteer that \nwe pay a salary to.\n  Here are some examples of cuts that the Democrats claim are actually \nincreases.\n  Defense spending declines from $270 billion in 1995 to $264 billion \nin 1996. That is $6 billion less. Defense spending is not going up. It \nis going down.\n  Here is an example of spending increases that many of the Democrats \nnot only call cuts but claim are tax increases as well. Only in \nWashington can such distorted logic have any semblance of credibility.\n  Talking first about the earned income tax credit, we will spend more \non the EITC program every year between now and the year 2002. Spending \nwill rise from $19.8 billion in 1995 to $22.8 billion in the year 2002. \nThe maximum credit for families with one child will rise from $2,094 in \n1995 to $2,615 in the year 2002. For families with two children, it \nrises from $3,100 next year to $3,888 in the near 2002, and the \nexamples go on.\n  The Democrats not only call that a cut, but a tax increase on low-\nincome families. If you are eligible, you get a check from the \nGovernment to offset any income tax liability you might have under that \nprogram, plus any excess to which you are entitled. Eighty-four percent \nof the program costs are cash grants. The program is run through the \nTax Code because it is more efficient. It requires less bureaucracy. \nBut it is just not possible that you can be hit by a tax increase if \nyou get back all of your tax payments plus more. It cannot be a tax \nincrease.\n  Here are some examples of tax cuts that they claim are spending \nincreases. They claim that allowing individuals and businesses to keep \nmore of what they earn is a subsidy that is equivalent to direct \nspending. But as Llewellyn Rockwell, Jr., pointed out in a column in \nthe Washington Times on September 18 of this year, I am quoting:\n\n       A subsidy means the Government is giving money to you that \n     originally belonged to somebody else. Dairy farmers, for \n     example, are subsidized. That means they get money that the \n     tax man extracted from the taxpayers.\n\n  ``Next word: deduction. That's when you were allowed to count some of \nyour income as off limits to the tax man. You can take a deduction for \nmortgage interest. A portion of your own money stays in the bank.''\n  Democrats claim the tax relief for families is a tax cut for the \nrich. The fact is over 70 percent of the tax cuts included in the \nFinance Committee bill go to families with incomes of less than $75,000 \na year.\n  Let us talk about the AmeriCorps for a moment. The GAO estimated that \nthe program cost nearly $27,000 for each ``volunteer,'' and I put \nquotation marks around that word ``volunteer'' since they are paid that \nsalary. In fact, that salary is more than the average American earns in \na year. Paying people makes them employees, in my view, not volunteers.\n  For the average of $20,000 to $30,000 cost per year for each student \nin AmeriCorps, as I said, eight needy students could get Pell grants at \n$2,400 apiece. The fact is Americans aged 18 and up volunteer 19.5 \nbillion hours of their time, which is a 50-percent increase in the \nnumber of hours since 1981. We do not need to pay people to be \nvolunteers under AmeriCorps.\n  Another one of these Alice in Wonderland meaning changes is calling \ntaxes contributions. Referring to tax increases he would be proposing, \nPresident Clinton, in an address to the public from the Oval Office on \nFebruary 15, 1993, said:\n\n       We just have to face the fact that to make the changes our \n     country needs more Americans must contribute today so that \n     all Americans can do better tomorrow.\n\n  I have an idea, Mr. President. Let us just call these contributions \nvoluntary and we will see how much in the way of contributions are \nreceived. There is nothing voluntary about the income tax.\n  On Medicare, President Clinton says, ``The Republican plan would \ndismantle Medicare as we know it''--the Washington Post, September 16, \n1995--despite the fact that six Medicare Board of Trustees, five of \nwhom are Clinton administration appointees, issued a report in April, \nwith which we are all familiar, which stated that ``The Medicare \nProgram is clearly unsustainable in its present form and will become \ninsolvent within the next 6 to 11 years.''\n  Mr. President, the reality is clear. Medicare benefits will be cut \noff completely unless we act now. If Medicare goes bankrupt, which \ncould happen as early as the year 2002, according to the trustees, by \nlaw no payments could be made to Medicare beneficiaries for hospital \ncare, doctor services, or any other covered benefit.\n  Even the Washington Post has condemned the duplicity of those who \nwould oppose solving this Medicare problem. In a lead editorial on \nSeptember 25, 1995, the Post wrote:\n\n       The Democrats have fabricated the Medicare tax connection \n     because it's useful politically. It allows them to attack and \n     duck responsibility, both at the same time. We think it's \n     wrong.\n\n  The editorial, by the way, was entitled, ``Medagogues, Cont'd.''\n  It is no wonder, Mr. President, that the American people are \nfrustrated and angry. We need to keep the promise we made to the \nAmerican people to balance the budget by the year 2002.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has certified that our budget will do \njust that. We have abided by the Congressional Budget Office, the \nagency that the President praised for its accuracy in budget \nforecasting in 1993. But while we have abided by the CBO's \nscorekeeping, the same entity the President praised 2 years ago, the \nPresident himself has changed the numbers to make his alternative \nbudget balance by the year 2005. He has used the numbers from his own \noffice rather than the Congressional Budget Office. As former CBO \nDirector Robert Reischauer put it, ``He lowered the bar and then \ngracefully jumped over it.''\n  Let me close by saying that it is unfortunate that the President \nwould change the numbers in order to get his budget balanced rather \nthan face the tough realities we have had to face in putting together a \nbudget which we know will balance by the year 2002. I think we owe it \nto our children and grandchildren to do that, not to hand them the debt \nthat we have accumulated over the years we have been here.\n  We have a historic opportunity this year. Not since 1969 has Congress \nhad a chance to vote on a balanced budget. And I do not think we can \nmiss this opportunity. It is not just because of the politics of it. It \nis because of the children and grandchildren who are going to follow us \nand who do not deserve to have to pay off the debts that we have \naccumulated.\n  So I am very hopeful that we can support the budget that will be \npresented, the reconciliation bill that will be before us next week. I \nthink if we do that the American people will say thank you for keeping \nthe commitment that you made to us in 1994.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona for his excellent statement and the other Senators who \nhave spoken on our side of the aisle tonight on the subject of the \nbalanced budget process, the reconciliation bill which will be coming \nbefore the Senate next week, and the effort that has been made to put \ntogether a plan to achieve a balanced budget by the year 2002. This is \na plan that is workable. It is defensible in every respect. It shows a \nnew awareness and sense of responsibility for managing the fiscal \npolicy of \n\n[[Page S 15335]]\nthis country in a more commonsense fashion, getting us to a point where \non an annual basis we can operate the Federal Government within a \nbudget that is in balance; that we do not overspend; that our \nprojections are sound and based on reality and facts, not fiction.\n  So I think the statements that have been made this evening are very \npersuasive as we approach this point when we will be taking up the \nreconciliation bill. We have already considered a number of \nappropriations bills that have reduced spending from last year's levels \nin accordance with the directions of the budget resolution. So we are \nwell on our way to achieving success in this very ambitious undertaking \nand very important undertaking.\n  I thank the Senators who have participated in this special order and \nam convinced that the American people are going to support our efforts, \nnot just because of the speeches made here but because we are doing the \nright thing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15334-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the global marketplace changes \nconstantly as the economy and consumer preferences fluctuate. To be \ncompetitive, businesses must keep pace with marketplace trends. As a \nresult, prestigious business schools across the Nation continuously \ndevelop and update new curricula in response to our changing world.\n  Management practices, in particular, are beginning to depart from \ntraditional business school teachings. After years of educating future \nbusiness leaders about the art of managing businesses to maximize \nprofits, professional schools are beginning to direct attention toward \nthe management of not-for-profit organizations. Nonprofit groups are \ngrowing rapidly, becoming larger and more influential. Consequently, \nemphasis on the unique skills associated with nonprofit management is \nbecoming increasingly important.\n  John Whitehead, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, renowned \nentrepreneur, philanthropist, and expert in the world of nonprofit \nmanagement, is paving the way for scholars to study the art of managing \nnonprofit organizations. Mr. Whitehead is founder of the John C. \nWhitehead Fund for Not-for-Profit Management at Harvard Business \nSchool. He is dedicated to teaching students about the important role \nnot-for-profit organizations play in a traditionally for-profit \nbusiness world.\n  A recent article appeared in the New York Times describing Mr. \nWhitehead's achievements and his devotion to teaching nonprofit \nmanagement. This article details Mr. Whitehead's recent contributions \nto the Harvard Business School and offers a fascinating account of his \nentrepreneurial ventures. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \narticle be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, John Whitehead is a skilled businessman \nand a generous philanthropist. His contributions to the study of \nnonprofit management will help those currently running nonprofit \norganizations and future managers maximize efficiency and attain group \ngoals. Not-for-profit management strategies deserve greater attention \nboth in the academic and business world. I applaud Mr. Whitehead for \nhis dedication to the mission of nonprofit groups and wish him well as \nhe continues to promote better, more-effectively managed nonprofit \norganizations.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  How to Succeed in Nonprofits by Really Trying--Harvard Is Given $10 \n                   Million To Teach Management Skills\n\n                         (By Karen W. Arenson)\n\n       When John Whitehead was co-chairman of Goldman Sachs from \n     1976 to 1984, it was held up as the epitome of the well-\n     managed Wall Street firm. It made money and it ran smoothly.\n       Now Mr. Whitehead is trying to bring some of those same \n     management skills to the nonprofit world. In what he calls \n     the third stage of his life, after Goldman Sachs and service \n     as Deputy Secretary of State, he has presided as chairman or \n     president over several venerable institutions, from Harvard-\n     University's Board of Overseers and the Brookings \n     Institution, to the Trustees Council of the National Gallery \n     of Art and the Greater New York Councils/Boy Scouts of \n     America.\n       But he is not content simply to bring his own management \n     counsel to the boardrooms of a Rolodex of nonprofit \n     organizations. He has a broader aim: to improve the whole art \n     of managing nonprofit organizations. To that end, he is \n     giving $10 million to the Harvard Business School to endow \n     the John C. Whitehead Fund for Not-for-Profit Management.\n       His goal is to encourage several developments: research in \n     nonprofit management techniques, teaching of these \n     techniques, and more emphasis on training business school \n     students and managers of nonprofit groups.\n       ``I became fascinated by nonprofits,'' Mr. Whitehead said. \n     ``Their reach is much bigger than I realized. One out of \n     every 10 workers in the United States works for a nonprofit. \n     And if you add in the volunteer time, it's even greater.''\n       ``But I came to realize that while people who run \n     nonprofits are fully committed, they are not very good \n     managers, and nonprofits are not very well run,'' Mr. \n     Whitehead said.\n       Sometimes they are not on the up-and-up either, as Mr. \n     Whitehead has learned the hard way. Earlier this year, after \n     he had planned his gift to Harvard, he and other prominent \n     businessmen were embarrassed to learn that they had foolishly \n     lent their names to the New Era for Philanthropy, a charity \n     based near Philadelphia that was essentially a giant Ponzi \n     scheme. New Era for Philanthropy filed for bankruptcy \n     protection in May, and it and its president, John G. Bennett \n     Jr., have been charged with fraud.\n       But the more common problem, one he has seen much of since \n     he became involved in the nonprofit world during his years at \n     Goldman Sachs, is a lack of management expertise. That is \n     something he can offer, although he is quick to add: ``Just \n     to show that I don't know everything. I went on the board of \n     a regional theater that went out of business.'' He declines \n     to name the theater.\n       He describes himself as a sucker for getting involved in \n     nonprofit groups, and said he has a particular affinity for \n     the ones that need help, ``not just the big prestigious ones, \n     but some of the little, weak ones.'' The list, he says in an \n     embarrassed tone, is too long to enumerate, because someone \n     might think he does not have time for so much.\n       But he is disciplined in his approach, spending the first \n     hour of each day in his Park Avenue office working on \n     business for AEA Investors Inc., a private investment company \n     of which he is chairman. The rest of the day, sometimes \n     starting with a 7:30 breakfast meeting and going through a \n     late dinner, is devoted to his menagerie of nonprofit \n     institutions.\n       ``He does so many things, but the remarkable thing is that \n     he does it all so effectively,'' said William Boardman Jr., \n     director of university capital giving at Harvard. ``His very \n     special capacity is to focus and not to waste time, and he's \n     very insightful.''\n       Mr. Whitehead has given one other $10 million gift, to \n     Haverford College, ``my other first love,'' where he was an \n     undergraduate and other nonprofit groups say he has been \n     generous.\n       He described his own philosophy that good citizens need to \n     be generous in both time and money. Having had the ``good \n     fortune to make all this money,'' he said, ``I say somewhat \n     facetiously that by giving it back, it will come out even at \n     the end.''\n       When he started discussions with John H. McArthur, dean of \n     the Harvard Business School, a couple of years ago, he \n     discovered that several faculty members there had been \n     talking about doing more on nonprofit management. Mr. \n     Whitehead held out the prospect of a large gift if they could \n     develop a productive plan.\n       The group did more than plan. Research has begun to build. \n     Courses have been added (elective courses on Social \n     Entrepreneurship and on Field Studies in Social Enterprise). \n     Case studies are being written. An eight-day advanced \n     management program for executives who run nonproit programs \n     attracted 50 participants last spring (at a subsidized price \n     of $3,000), and another session will be held next year.\n       Satisfied that the commitment was there, Mr. Whitehead told \n     the school he was ready \n\n[[Page S 15336]]\n     to make the gift. Even though Mr. McArthur is stepping down today, to \n     be succeeded as dean by Kim Clark, Mr. McArthur has promised \n     the nonprofit initiative would remain a priority, and that he \n     will stay involved with it.\n       Despite the new attention, it is unlikely that nonprofit \n     management will ever be a main theme for the school. The \n     M.B.A. class of 1996, for example, has only 40 students out \n     of 807 who came out of government, education or nonprofit \n     jobs. Even though 10 percent of the class of 1995 cited \n     working with a nonprofit group as their career goal after \n     graduation, the school sent only 11 students into those \n     fields. ``The financial pressures are very high,'' Mr. \n     Whitehead said.\n       But Mr. Whitehead said he did not worry that nonprofit \n     management would be a stepchild at the business school. He \n     said the new course on social entrepreneurship was over- \n     subscribed last spring, when more than 10 percent of the \n     second year class signed up for it, instead of the 60 that \n     had originally been set as the limit.\n       ``Usually elective courses start small and build their \n     reputations,'' Mr. Whitehead said, ``But this was very \n     successful. I was just delighted.''\n       He spoke of the growing interest among business students, \n     who know they are likely to serve as directors of nonprofit \n     groups, as he and so many other business executives do now; \n     and the growing recognition that they should know more when \n     they do.\n       ``I believe more of this kind of program, and more \n     scholarship, will help,'' he said.\n       That is not to say that Mr. Whitehead sees such programs as \n     curing all ills. He does not think that better education \n     would have stopped the scandal involving the Foundation for \n     New Era Philanthropy.\n       New Era persuaded sophisticated executives like Mr. \n     Whitehead to funnel money they wanted to contribute to other \n     charities through New Era, saying that it would be matched \n     after six months. The participation of top business leaders \n     like Mr. Whitehead helped attract other donors.\n       ``New Era was a real tragedy,'' said Mr. Whitehead, who \n     stands to lose up to $1 million in the bankruptcy. ``I doubt \n     that a program like this would have lessened the problem. If \n     you have a dishonest guy, there is not much you can do. I \n     hope we will all be able to put it behind us.''\n       Although the management of nonprofit institutions is a \n     relatively new academic specialty, Harvard is by no means the \n     first university to turn its attention to the subject. There \n     are now more than three dozen centers for the study of \n     nonprofit enterprises at universities around the country, \n     from Yale and Duke to the New School for Social Research and \n     the University of San Francisco, and at least a dozen offer \n     some focus on management.\n       In addition, there is already one other school at Harvard, \n     the John F. Kennedy School of Government, that focuses on \n     nonprofit enterprise, and sends about a third of its \n     graduates into jobs in nonprofit institutions. It even offers \n     the only course on nonprofit management at Harvard.\n       While the two schools talked about the possibility of a \n     joint program, Mr. Whitehead's money was ultimately directed \n     to the business school.\n       ``They both have a role to play,'' he said, ``My interest \n     is in teaching managers business skills. The Kennedy School \n     teaches them about the policy issues. There is a different \n     kind of emphasis, and there is room for both.''\n       Those connected with the business school program, the \n     Initiative on Social Enterprise, which was established in \n     1993, concede that there is much to learn before there is a \n     discipline that offers the depth and breadth of business \n     management. They talk of the overlap between the two fields--\n     and the differences. And they talk about building new \n     intellectual capital.\n       V. Kasturi Rangan, a business school professor who is one \n     of the leaders of the social enterprise initiative, talked \n     about the crossover in his own field of marketing:\n       ``Nonprofit management offers its own challenges, but the \n     trick is to bring the core disciplines into these \n     challenges,'' he said. ``We don't have Marketing 1 for \n     toothpaste, and marketing 2 for computers. marketing is \n     marketing.''\n       He added, however, that nonprofit groups face a dual \n     customer problem that is unique to them, because they need to \n     concern themselves both with the clients who receive their \n     services, and with the donors who pay for the services with \n     their charitable contributions. The usual marketing \n     discipline, coming out of consumers' choices that weigh \n     benefits against costs, doesn't apply when consumers and \n     payers are separate, he said. So a nonprofit group needs to \n     develop special internal measures to know whether its \n     products are appropriate.\n       It is analysis like this that excites Mr. Whitehead and \n     makes him feel that his money will be well spent.\n       ``This is fun,'' Mr. Whitehead said. ``This is what keeps \n     me going.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           JOHN C.

A bill to provide for the protection of the flag of the \nUnited States and free speech, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n            the flag protection and free speech act of 1995\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator \nBennett and Senator Dorgan, I am introducing a bill to outlaw the \ndesecration of the American flag.\n  Flag burning is a despicable act. And we should have zero tolerance \nfor those who deface our flag. Make no mistake about it--I am disgusted \nby those who desecrate our symbol of freedom, under which so many men \nand women, including my father, have gone into battle in order to \npreserve our way of life.\n  Many patriotic Americans believe that we need a Constitutional \namendment to ban flag burning. The Supreme Court has rejected laws \nwhich have attempted to ban flag burning, finding such laws to be in \nconflict with the first amendment's protection of free speech. So, the \nsupporters of the Constitutional amendment argue that the only way to \nget it done right is to change the Constitution.\n  Flag burners must be punished for their vile behavior. But the \nprecedent of amending the Bill of Rights is a dangerous one. I fear \nthat if we amend the first amendment this year, soon the fifth \namendment's protection of private property rights or the second \namendment's protection of the right to bear arms, will be under \nassault.\n  So, I have been searching for an alternative which will result in the \nswift and certain punishment for those who commit the contemptible act \nof defacing the flag, but leave the first amendment untouched.\n  This bill achieves those purposes. The deviants who burn the flag do \nso to provoked or incite patriotic Americans. And, it is well \nestablished that fighting words or speech which incites lawlessness is \nnot protected by the first amendment. My bill provides for imprisoning \nand fining those who damage a flag intending to incite a breach of the \npeace. It also punishes anyone who steals a flag belonging to the \nFederal Government or a flag displayed on Federal property.\n  This bill will get the job done without tampering with the first \namendment. There have been well-respected conservative voices who have \ncautioned against amending the first amendment to ban flag burning, \nincluding George Will, Charles Krauthammer, Cal Thomas, Bruce Fein. But \nperhaps the most compelling words have come from Jim Warner, a patriot \nand hero who fought in Vietnam and survived more than 5 years of \ntorture and brutality as a prisoner or war:\n\n       We don't need to amend the Constitution in order to punish \n     those who burn our flag. They burn the flag because they hate \n     America and they are afraid of freedom. What better way to \n     hurt them than with the subversive idea of freedom? Spread \n     freedom. [When a] flag in Dallas was burned to protest the \n     nomination of Ronald Reagan, . . . he told us how to spread \n     the idea of freedom when he said that we should turn America \n     into a ``city shining on a hill, a light to all nations.'' \n     Don't be afraid of freedom, it is the best weapon wee have.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will study this bill and consider it, as we \napproach the significant debate on a Constitutional amendment to ban \nflag desecration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1335\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Flag Protection and Free \n     Speech Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Flag of the United States is a unique symbol of \n     national unity and represents the values of liberty, justice, \n     and equality that make this Nation an example of freedom \n     unmatched throughout the world;\n       (2) the Bill of Rights is a guarantee of those freedoms and \n     should not be amended in a manner that could be interpreted \n     to restrict freedom, a course that is regularly resorted to \n     by authoritarian governments which fear freedom and not by \n     free and democratic nations;\n       (3) abuse of the flag of the United States causes more than \n     pain and distress to the overwhelming majority of the \n     American people and may amount to fighting words or a direct \n     threat to the physical and emotional well-being of \n     individuals at whom the threat is targeted; and\n       (4) destruction of the flag of the United States can be \n     intended to incite a violent response rather than make a \n     political statement and such conduct is outside the \n     protections afforded by the first amendment to the Unites \n     States Constitution.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide the \n     maximum protection against the use of the flag of the United \n     States to promote violence while respecting the liberties \n     that it symbolizes.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES AGAINST \n                   USE FOR PROMOTING VIOLENCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 700 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 700. Incitement; damage or destruction of property \n       involving the flag of the United States\n\n       ``(a) Actions Promoting Violence.--Any person who destroys \n     or damages a flag of the United States with the primary \n     purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or \n     a breach of the peace, and in circumstances where the person \n     knows it is reasonably likely to produce imminent violence or \n     a breach of the peace, shall be fined not more than $100,000 \n     or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.\n       ``(b) Damaging a Flag Belonging to the United States.--Any \n     person who steals or knowingly converts to his or her use, or \n     to the use of another, a flag of the United States belonging \n     to the United States and intentionally destroys or damages \n     that flag shall be fined not more than $250,000 or imprisoned \n     not more than 2 years, or both.\n       ``(c) Damaging a Flag of Another on Federal Land.--Any \n     person who, within any lands reserved for the use of the \n     United States, or under the exclusive or concurrent \n     jurisdiction of the United States, steals or \n\n[[Page S 15339]]\n     knowingly converts to his or her use, or to the use of another, a flag \n     of the United States belonging to another person, and \n     intentionally destroys or damages that flag shall be fined \n     not more than $250,000 or imprisoned not more than 2 years, \n     or both.\n       ``(d) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to indicate an intent on the part of Congress to \n     deprive any State, territory or possession of the United \n     States, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico of jurisdiction \n     over any offense over which it would have jurisdiction in the \n     absence of this section.\n       ``(e) Definition.--As used in this section, the term `flag \n     of the United States' means any flag of the United States, or \n     any part thereof, made of any substance, in any size, in a \n     form that is commonly displayed as a flag and would be taken \n     to be a flag by the reasonable observer.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter \n     33 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by striking \n     the item relating to section 700 and inserting the following \n     new item:\n\n``700.

A bill to enable processors of popcorn to develop, finance, \nand carry out a nationally coordinated program for popcorn promotion, \nresearch, consumer information, and industry information, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n     THE POPCORN PROMOTION, RESEARCH, AND CONSUMER INFORMATION ACT\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Popcorn \nResearch, Promotion and Consumer Information Act which will allow the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture to issue an order establishing a popcorn \npromotion program. This will be similar to other agricultural promotion \nprograms for dairy, beef, pork, eggs, and potatoes, to name a few.\n  Americans consume 17.3 billion quarts of popped popcorn annually, or \n68 quarts per person. It is one of the most wholesome and economical \nfoods available to the consumer. My home State of Indiana leads all \nStates in popcorn production, with more than 77,000 acres harvested \nlast year. Following Indiana, major popcorn producing States are \nIllinois, Nebraska, Ohio, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky, and \nMichigan.\n  In the past, the popcorn industry has united to promote and market \nits product. Total popcorn sales, as a result of these efforts, have \ngrown throughout the past several years, but great potential exists to \naccelerate this trend with a larger, industry-wide, cooperative effort.\n  Under a popcorn promotion program, popcorn processors would pay a \nsmall assessment on each pound of popcorn marketed. The Secretary of \nAgriculture would then select a Popcorn Board, made up of \nrepresentatives from the industry to administer the program, with \noversight by USDA. The funds collected would be used for research, \npromotion and consumer information projects with the goal of increasing \nconsumption of popcorn.\n  The entire popcorn industry would benefit from a popcorn promotion \nprogram. These programs have been extremely successful for other \ncommodities. Furthermore, they operate at no cost to the Federal \nGovernment, because all Government expenses are reimbursed from the \nprograms funds. I urge my colleagues to support this self-help \nagricultural initiative.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1336\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Popcorn Promotion, Research, \n     and Consumer Information Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) popcorn is an important food that is a valuable part of \n     the human diet;\n       (2) the production and processing of popcorn plays a \n     significant role in the economy of the United States in that \n     popcorn is processed by several popcorn processors, \n     distributed through wholesale and retail outlets, and \n     consumed by millions of people throughout the United States \n     and foreign countries;\n       (3) popcorn must be of high quality, readily available, \n     handled properly, and marketed efficiently to ensure that the \n     benefits of popcorn are available to the people of the United \n     States;\n       (4) the maintenance and expansion of existing markets and \n     uses and the development of new markets and uses for popcorn \n     are vital to the welfare of processors and persons concerned \n     with marketing, using, and producing popcorn for the market, \n     as well as to the agricultural economy of the United States;\n       (5) the cooperative development, financing, and \n     implementation of a coordinated program of popcorn promotion, \n     research, consumer information, and industry information is \n     necessary to maintain and expand markets for popcorn; and\n       (6) popcorn moves in interstate and foreign commerce, and \n     popcorn that does not move in those channels of commerce \n     directly burdens or affects interstate commerce in popcorn.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of Congress that it is in the \n     public interest to authorize the establishment, through the \n     exercise of the powers provided in this Act, of an orderly \n     procedure for developing, financing (through adequate \n     assessments on unpopped popcorn processed domestically), and \n     carrying out an effective, continuous, and coordinated \n     program of promotion, research, consumer information, and \n     industry information designed to--\n       (1) strengthen the position of the popcorn industry in the \n     marketplace; and\n       (2) maintain and expand domestic and foreign markets and \n     uses for popcorn.\n       (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) maintain and expand the markets for all popcorn \n     products in a manner that--\n       (A) is not designed to maintain or expand any individual \n     share of a producer or processor of the market;\n       (B) does not compete with or replace individual advertising \n     or promotion efforts designed to promote individual brand \n     name or trade name popcorn products; and\n       (C) authorizes and funds programs that result in government \n     speech promoting government objectives; and\n       (2) establish a nationally coordinated program for popcorn \n     promotion, research, consumer information, and industry \n     information.\n       (d) Statutory Construction.--This Act treats processors \n     equitably. Nothing in this Act--\n       (1) provides for the imposition of a trade barrier to the \n     entry into the United States of imported popcorn for the \n     domestic market; or\n       (2) provides for the control of production or otherwise \n     limits the right of any individual processor to produce \n     popcorn.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Legal Services Corporation Act to limit \nfrivolous lawsuits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n        the legal services corporation act amendment act of 1995\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I introduce a bill to bring the \nLegal Services Corporation in line with the obligations of every other \nattorney in America; that is, to allow the Legal Services Corporation \nto be sanctioned when its attorneys bring frivolous or meritless cases.\n\n[[Page S 15342]]\n\n  The Legal Services Corporation was created to provide for the \neveryday legal needs of the poor. Unfortunately, the LSC has digressed \nfrom its original function. Rather than taking care of the day to day \nneeds of American families, the LSC has used its resources to challenge \nFederal programs, lobby government, and pursue costly class action \nlawsuits.\n  In 1974, President Nixon cited three major objectives when he signed \nlegislation to create the Legal Services Corporation. One was ``that \nthe lawyers in the program have full freedom to protect the best \ninterests of their clients in keeping with the Canon of Ethics and the \nhigh standards of the legal professions.'' Achieving that goal is \nprecisely what this bill intends to do.\n  The high standards of the legal professions include adhering to the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 11, which applies to all \nattorneys, allows for sanctions against an attorney for any action \ndesigned to cause unnecessary delay or needlessly increase the cost of \nlitigation, or when the plaintiff's action is frivolous or without \nlegal foundation. If the LSC is providing legal services with Federal \nfunds, one would assume it would be subject to these basic rules.\n  Under current law, however, the Legal Services Corporation is \nprotected from the rule 11 standard. The LSC can only be sanctioned if \nit is proven that an action was brought solely to harass another party, \nor that it maliciously abused the legal system. This standard is \nvirtually impossible to prove and therefore lacks any deterrent effect. \nFurthermore, only actions are sanctionable--the LSC is completely \nprotected from sanctions for baseless motions, pleadings, or other \ndocuments.\n  If the Legal Services Corporation is going to provide federally \nfunded legal services, it should live under the same laws as every \nother attorney in the United States. When an attorney enters any \ncourtroom in the Nation, advocating a case without merit, he can be \nsanctioned by the court. It should not be any different for the Legal \nServices Corporation.\n  The language of this bill would alter the Legal Services Corporation \nAct so that it parallels the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nSpecifically, it would allow courts to sanction the LSC according to \nthe standards set forth in rule 11. Under the bill, sanctions would be \nallowed for any action, motion, pleading or other document that: First, \nis brought for improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary \ndelay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; or second, is \nfrivolous or not warranted by existing law.\n  This new standard is not designed to preclude or replace rule 11 \nsanctions against attorneys. Rather, it would provide an additional \nsource of funds to compensate those parties forced to defend against \nbaseless legal actions.\n  in a society where litigation too often takes the place of \nnegotiation, where the cost of a defense determines the outcome of a \ncase, and where one lawsuit can bankrupt a law-abiding citizen, it is \nimperative that all parties play on the same legal field, including the \nLegal Services Corporation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BROWN:\n  S. 1338. A bill to improve the U.S. Marshals Service, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               united states marshals service legislation\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I introduce a bill to improve the \nU.S. Marshals Service by eliminating the political appointment of U.S. \nMarshals.\n\n  Since 1789, U.S. Marshals have been appointed by the President and \nconfirmed by the Senate. For nearly 150 years this political \nappointment process served as the only control Washington had over its \nprimary law enforcers. The distance between the bureaucracy of \nWashington and the ever expanding Territories of the United States gave \nU.S. Marshals such as Wyatt Earp and Lloyd Garrison, nearly autonomous \ncontrol in their jurisdictions.\n  But the days of the gun-slinging Federal Marshal are long past. Today \nthe executive office of the Marshals Service in Washington calls the \nshots, trains, and promotes the deputies, and operates under the \nwatchful eye of the Department of Justice and Congress. The one area in \nwhich the Service does not have control is over the appointment of U.S. \nMarshals.\n  Under the current system, U.S. Marshals are appointed to 4-year terms \nby the President. Appointees need not have served in the U.S. Marshals \nService or even have had previous professional law enforcement \nexperience. In fact, of the 94 U.S. Marshals, only 30 have previously \nserved in the Marshals Service.\n  According to a 1994 U.S. Marshals Service Reinvention Proposal \nreported by the Department of Justice, the appointment process has \nbecome a burden upon the operations of the Marshals Service. The \nproposal states that:\n\n       Disagreement between Marshals and headquarters often put \n     career deputies and staff in conflicting situations. The \n     Marshals controlled day-to-day assignments while headquarters \n     controlled the deputies' career advancement and duty \n     stations. The traditional independence of the Marshals \n     clashed with the growing central control of headquarters. \n     Headquarters began bypassing the Marshals by establishing \n     program units in the field to oversee witness security, \n     fugitive investigations, asset forfeiture programs, and high \n     level judicial protection activities.\n\n  Mr. President, my bill would eliminate some of these problems by \nputting experienced law enforcement personnel into the office of U.S. \nMarshal. The bill would require the Attorney General to select U.S. \nMarshals from the ranks of the Marshals Service rather than from a \npolitical party. The U.S. Marshals Service already has an extensive and \ncomplex merit based promotion system to evaluate, select and promote \nthe most qualified individuals for positions in every level of service. \nThis bill would extend that type of merit based selection to the office \nof the U.S. Marshal, so that the most qualified and experienced \npersonnel are in a position to contribute to the U.S. Marshals Service \nrather than hinder its operations.\n  Removing the political appointment process from the Marshals Service \nis not a new idea. The reform debate first began in 1955 when the \nCommission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government \nrecommended an end to the political appointment of U.S. Marshals. \nDuring the 104th Congress, the idea took hold in the House of \nRepresentatives. Both the House Balanced Budget Task Force and the \nBudget Committee recommended ending the political appointments. Vice \nPresident Gore's National Performance Review also recommended selecting \nMarshals by merit and estimated a savings of over $36 million.\n\n  With such broad based support why are we waiting? The answer lies in \nthe Senate. For the past 150 years the Executive branch has allowed the \nSenators affiliated with the President's party to select the U.S. \nMarshals for the judicial districts within their States. Each time the \nidea of appointing Marshals based on merit was raised, it was quashed \nin the Senate by those unwilling to relinquish the power of \nappointment.\n  Mr. President, if we really are for a leaner, less intrusive, and \nmore effective government, we must begin by promoting the most \nqualified personnel to the most important positions. Let us take a real \nstep to improve the way government works--let us end the political \nappointment process for the U.S. Marshals.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1339. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to restrict \nthe mail-order sale of body armor; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                the james guelff body armor act of 1995\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I introduce the James Guelff \nBody Armor Act which would ban the mail order sale of bullet-proof \nvests to all individuals except law enforcement or public safety \nofficers including paramedics. This legislation would require that the \nsale, transfer, and receipt of bullet-proof vests to anyone other than \na law enforcement or public safety officers be conducted in person. \nThis Act will make it more difficult for criminals to obtain this body \narmor which hinders law enforcement's ability to disarm and capture \nthem.\n\n  For those who may not have heard the story of Officer James Guelff, I \nwould like to provide just a few details about this tragic story.\n  On November 13, 1994, Officer James Guelff, a 10-year veteran of the \nSan Francisco Police Department, was shot to death in a fire-fight by a \nheavily \n\n[[Page S 15343]]\narmed gunman wearing a bullet-proof vest on a major street corner in \nthe middle of San Francisco.\n  Captain Richard Cairns was the commanding officer on the scene. \nEarlier this year, Captain Cairns participated in a roundtable \ndiscussion with me about the violence of assault weapons.\n  This is how Captain Cairns described the scene:\n\n       (The assailant) was firing as fast as you could pull the \n     trigger. He had semi-automatic assault weapons. He had an AK \n     223 rifle, with 30 round clips. He had a Steyr AUG which is a \n     sophisticated weapon, that he didn't get to. The officers \n     managed to keep him away from that. He had an uzi that \n     jammed, and he had two other semi-automatic pistols, and he \n     had thousands of rounds of ammunition that were in magazines. \n     And they were all in 30-round magazines already. He didn't \n     have to stop and load magazines. We ended up having 104 \n     officers at the scene and he probably had more ammunition \n     than all 104 officers put together. And our officers did run \n     out of ammunition and they got more ammunition from other \n     responding units to try and keep him down. He was finally \n     killed by the SWAT teams that got there, who got above him . \n     . . \n\n  Captain Cairns continued:\n\n       He had a bullet proof vest, he had a Kevlar Helmet on and \n     he was hit by our officers twice in the helmet and six times \n     in the vest. He was finally killed by a shot that came \n     through his shoulder and into his chest and killed him. \n     Officer Guelff was hit several times and then killed with a \n     bullet through the left eye out of the assault rifle. Officer \n     Guelff fired off six of his rounds and when he went to re-\n     load--the suspect fired on him and killed him.\n\n  That story, simply put, is the reason this legislation is being put \nforward today.\n  California is not the only State to experience assailants--including \nheavily-armed gang members--who are wearing bullet proof vests and \nother body armor.\n  In Colorado, a man entered a grocery store where his wife worked, \nkilled her, the store's manager, shot a bystander and then fatally shot \na sheriff's sergeant before being physically tackled from behind and \nbrought to the ground. Gunfire from law enforcement was to no avail \nbecause of his body armor.\n  In Long Island, NY, an armed high school student after being pushed \nout of his girlfriend's house by her father, shot 12 rounds into the \nhouse before a sheriff's investigator shot the young man in the \nshoulder, just avoiding his bullet-proof vest, killing him. The sheriff \nwho shot the gunman commented after the incident that the bullet-proof \nvest the young man was wearing was `` * * * better than anything we've \ngot now, other than what's in the SWAT locker.''\n  How are law enforcement officers to protect the public when the \ncriminals have better body armor than do the police?\n  States and localities have already begun the effort to control the \nsale of body armor. The State of Michigan, for instance, has a law \nwhich increases the sentence of a criminal who wears body armor during \nthe commission of a crime. And, in Baltimore, MD, the city council \nreacted quickly and severely to a billboard advertising the sale of \nbullet-proof vests as ``Life Insurance for the 90's'' with a 1-800 \nnumber printed at the bottom by introducing a city ordinance which bans \nthe sale of bullet-proof vests to anyone unless they have the \npermission of the police commissioner.\n  Not only have States and localities begun to control the sale of body \narmor, at least three Nation-wide stores have already pulled bullet-\nproof vests from their shelves. Those stores that responded to the \nrequests of law enforcement officials to cease the sale of body armor \nare The Sharper Image, Wall-mart and Sam's Club.\n  There were over 200 rounds of ammunition fired by the gunman that \nkilled Officer James Guelff before other police officers were able to \ninjure the assailant. I cannot say that Officer Guelff would still be \nalive if this criminal had not been wearing a bullet-proof vest.

A bill to require the President to appoint a Commission on \nConcentration in the Livestock Industry; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                the livestock market report act of 1995\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today several colleagues and I will \nintroduce the Livestock Concentration Report Act of 1995. This \nlegislation addresses the deep concern of cattle, hog and sheep \nproducers from across the nation that the livestock industry does not \noperate in a free and open market. The bipartisan support from \ncolleagues from Vermont to Washington is indicative of the importance \nof this issue.\n  Livestock producers, especially cattle producers, are receiving the \nlowest prices in recent memory. Producers can barely make ends meet, \nlet alone make a profit. The farmer's share of the retail beef dollar \nhas also plunged from 63 percent in 1980 to only 40 percent today. \nProducers face economic ruin at a time when the four largest meat \npackers in the country control 87 percent of the cattle slaughtered and \nenjoy record profits.\n  Our legislation calls for a thorough examination of the livestock \nmarkets to ensure they operate in a free and competitive manner. We ask \nthe President to establish a Commission on Concentration in the \nLivestock Industry. This body will consist of six producers, two \nantitrust experts, two economists, two corporate financial officers, \nand two corporate procurement experts. The members will be appointed by \nthe President, and the Commission will be chaired by the Secretary of \nAgriculture.\n  The Commission will review the ongoing USDA Study on Concentration in \nthe Red Meat Packing Industry to ensure the results are representative \nof current market conditions. Producers are concerned that the data in \nthe study is out-of-date and will not provide insight into today's \nmarket. Additionally, the Commission will review the adequacy of price \ndiscovery in the livestock markets to ensure forward contracting and \nformula pricing practices do not unduly bias livestock markets. The \ncauses of the wide farm-to-retail price spread will also be examined. \nThe Commission will report its findings within 90 days of the release \nof the USDA study.\n  I am very appreciative of Secretary Glickman's support throughout \nthis process. USDA is currently pursuing a case against IBP, Inc., the \nlargest meat packer for alleged anti-competitive \n\n[[Page S 15344]]\nprocurement practices. The Secretary has made this issue a top \npriority, and I look forward to working with him on the implementation \nof this Commission.\n  This action is crucial for our Nation's livestock producers. Free and \nopen markets are one of the foundations of our Nation and our economy. \nWe as consumers all suffer if markets, especially food markets, do not \noperate freely. I hope this commission can get to the bottom of the \nproblems that exist in the livestock market and provide answers for us \nin Congress about the steps we can take to ensure a fair shake for \nhard-working livestock producers and the Nation's consumers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1340\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Reg. 875), and for which funds were appropriated by \n     Public Law 102-142.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Wellstone, and Mr. Simon):\n  S. 1342. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs to make loans to refinance loans made \nto veterans under the Native American Veterans Direct Loan Program; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n            the native american veterans direct loan program\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto amend section 3762 of title 38, United States Code. Section 3762 was \nestablished under the Veterans Home Loan Program Amendments of 1992 and \nauthorizes a 5-year pilot program to provide direct home loans to \nnative American veterans who live on U.S. trust lands. I am pleased \nthat Senators Rockefeller, Inouye, Wellstone, and Simon are cosponsors \nof this measure.\n\n  My bill would allow the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA] to \nrefinance direct loans made under this unique initiative, known as the \nNative American Direct Home Loan Program. Under my bill, credit \nstandards for underwriting direct loans to Native American veterans \nwould be the same as those for VA guaranteed loans. The underwriting \nwould be performed by the VA and would allow qualified veterans to \nrefinance existing loans.\n  The Native American Direct Loan Program was established to ensure \nthat veterans who reside on reservations or other trust lands would \nhave the same access to VA loan benefits enjoyed by other veterans. \nUnder the 5-year pilot program, VA is authorized to provide direct \nloans of up to $80,000 for most areas of the United States, although \nhigher limits were established for certain high-cost regions.\n  Until the program was adopted 3 years ago, Native American veterans \nwho lived on trust lands were denied access to traditional VA \nguaranteed loans. The inability to take title to trust lands in the \nevent of default, cultural misunderstandings, and the generally poor \neconomic conditions that exist on reservations, dissuaded potential \nlenders from approving mortgages for housing on such lands.\n  During the guaranty program's half-century of existence, not a single \nNative American veteran was able to utilize his or her home loan \nentitlement for housing on trust lands. In contrast, over 13 million \nother veterans received more than $350 billion in VA guaranties during \nthat period. It was to redress this inequity that Congress enacted \nPublic Law 102-547.\n  Despite the complexities of creating a program that must address the \nneeds of hundreds of different tribal entities, each with its own \ncultural, political, and legal systems, VA has successfully entered \ninto agreements to provide direct VA loans to members of 30 tribes and \nPacific Island groups, and negotiations are ongoing with approximately \n20 more tribes. To date, approximately 45 loans have been closed, 3 of \nthem with American Indians, the balance with Hawaiian Natives and \nPacific Islanders. In addition, the VA has a commitment to close 36 \nmore loans, including American Indians residing on allotted lands.\n  Although the VA has made significant progress in implementing the \nprogram, a serious, unanticipated shortcoming has come to light. \nAccording to the VA, the Department has no statutory authority to offer \nrefinancing to veterans receiving loans under the program. Thus, native \nAmericans who receive loans under the program cannot take advantage of \ninterest rate reductions to ease their financial burden. \n\n[[Page S 15345]]\nThis is in stark contrast to other veterans who use the regular \nguaranty program. In the period between October 1993 and August 1995, \nfor example, the VA refinanced over 25,000 interest reduction loans \nwith a face value of more than $2 billion.\n  Mr. President, this situation runs contrary to the intent of Congress \nin enacting the Native American Direct Home Loan Program three years \nago. In creating the program, Congress intended to ensure that, to the \nmaximum extent possible, Native American veterans would have the same \nopportunity as other veterans to achieve the American dream of home \nownership. Insofar as refinancing is an important element of other VA \nhome loan programs, it is just and reasonable that veterans who receive \nbenefits under the direct loan program be accorded an opportunity to \nrefinance.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am offering today would correct this \noversight by providing VA with specific refinancing authority under the \ndirect loan program. My bill also includes a provision for a special \nfee that would cover all refinancing costs thus making the bill revenue \nneutral.\n  Mr. President, I believe this legislation will significantly enhance \nVA's ability to provide native American veterans with equal access to \nservices and benefits available to other veterans. It would reduce the \ncosts of home ownership for those presently receiving benefits under \nthe program, possibly reducing the risk of default and the costs \nassociated with foreclosure. Perhaps most importantly, it would \nencourage eligible Native American to come forward to take advantage of \nthe program's benefits.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I hope that the measure I am offering today \nwill be supported by colleagues from both sides of the aisle.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HELMS:\n  S. 1343. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide that eligible organizations assure out-of-network access; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n     out-of-network access legislation\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, three summers ago I had a close but \nfortunate encounter with some remarkable medical doctors in my home \ntown of Raleigh. My heart surgery and the very effective subsequent \nrehabilitation made it clear that I had been cared for by some of the \nmost capable people in the medical profession.\n  I was free to choose the surgeon who performed the operation. Senior \ncitizens enrolled in Medicare should have the same choice, and the bill \nI'm introducing today will enable senior citizens who join HMO's to \npreserve their right to choose their doctor.\n  Mr. President most Americans, whether their health is insured by \nprivate firms or by Medicare, enjoy their freedom to decide which \nmedical professional will provide their care and treatment. In \nreforming Medicare, Congress must make sure that senior citizens can \nchoose their doctors and other medical providers.\n  One of the many reasons for my having opposed the Clinton health plan \nwas the well founded fear that the American people would have been \ndenied their right to chose their medical care. The enormous \nbureaucracy of the Clinton plan made that apprehension a certainty--\nwhich is why the American people rejected it.\n  Now, Mr. President, the Senate is considering major reforms to save \nMedicare, and prevent its being pushed over the cliff. Medicare must be \nreformed before it goes bankrupt--otherwise the Medicare trust fund \nwill be flat broke when the 21st century rolls around a few years \nhence.\n  Americas's senior citizens depend on the health care coverage \nprovided by the Medicare system, and those of us in Congress have a \nduty to make sure they will not be forced to give up their right to \nchoose their doctors.\n  It is vital to their future security that our senior citizens retain \nthis right to choose. The power to choose will place citizens firmly in \ncontrol of their health care. Their right to choose will encourage \nefficiency and cut costs without sacrificing quality care and \ntreatment.\n  Mr. President, all of us know full well that reform of the present \nMedicare System is imperative. The provisions of the legislation \nallowing senior citizens to join health maintenance organizations, and \nother types of managed care plans, will surely lower the costs of \noperating the vast Medicare System. And citizens who belong to a \nMedicare-supported HMO may gain coverage for prescription drugs, \neyeglasses and hearing aids--coverages not presently provided by \nMedicare.\n  Without some moderating legislation, however, senior citizens could \nvery well find themselves locked into coverage that limits them to \nservices provided by HMO-affiliated doctors, other professionals and \nhospitals. No longer would senior citizens have the freedom to choose \ntheir own doctor.\n  So, Mr. President, these are the reasons why I am today introducing \nthe Senior Citizens' Health Freedom Act to guarantee all Medicare-\neligible Americans who choose to enroll in an HMO the same freedom to \nchoose their doctors that every member of Congress enjoys.\n  As much as I support the Republican Medicare plan now under \ndiscussion, I cannot dismiss my reservations about the absence of \ndoctor choice in the plan as it presently stands.\n  Mr. President, consider if you will the predicament of a patient who \nrequires heart surgery, and whose HMO will not approve the cardiologist \nwith whom the senior has built up a longstanding relationship. Should \nthe patient be required to wait for a year's time to change to a plan \nthat will cover the cardiologist that the patient knows and trusts? My \nbill will enable women being treated for breast cancer to rest assured \nthat they can continue to see the specialists familiar with them and \ntheir conditions. For this reason, more than a hundred patient advocacy \ngroups have voiced their support for this bill.\n\n  We must provide a safety valve to protect seniors who find themselves \nin that position. A point of service option would enable patients to \nsee physicians and specialists inside and outside the managed care \nnetwork. If senior citizens are satisfied with the care they receive \nwithin the network, they will feel no need to choose outside doctors \nand specialists. Without such options, however, these senior citizens \nwill be locked into a rigid system which may or may not give them the \nhealth care they need from people they most trust to provide it.\n  Mr. President, we heard from the CBO last February that a built-in \npoint of service feature would not increase the cost of Medicare. In \ntestimony before the Senate Budget Committee, CBO stated that ``the \npoint of service option would permit Medicare enrollees to go to \nproviders outside the HMO's panel when they wanted to, and yet it need \nnot increase the benefit cost to HMO's or to * * * ''\n  The fastest growing health insurance product is a managed care plan \nthat includes the point of service feature. The marketplace has \nresponded to patient's demand. Requiring HMO's to include point of \nservice is not intrusive, but rather advances a developing trend. In \nfact, in 1993, 61 percent of all HMO's offered a point of service \noption.\n  Building a point of service option into all health plans under \nMedicare will not interfere with the plan's ability to contain cost, \nnor will it limit their efforts to encourage providers and patients to \nuse their health care resources wisely. It simply will ensure that \nhealth plans put the patient's interest first.\n  Moreover, the actuarial firm of Milliman and Robertson concluded that \ndepending on the terms of the plan and a reasonable cost sharing \nschedule, there would be no increase in cost to the HMO. In fact, there \ncould actually be a savings.\n  Mr. President, according to polls I have seen, patients are willing \nto pay a little more for the ability to go out of network to be assured \nof seeing the doctors of their choice. As many as 70 percent of \nAmericans over 50 years old declared in one poll that they would be \nunwilling to join a Medicare managed plan that denied them the freedom \nto choose their own physicians.\n  So the best incentive to get senior citizens to join HMO's is to make \nsure they can choose their own doctors.\n  As we prepare to enact this historic revision of the Medicare \nProgram, let us not overlook the steps that are necessary to protect \nthe security of our senior citizens. Let us never deny them the right \nto take an active part in their health care and treatment.\n\n[[Page S 15346]]\n\n  We can save Medicare. We can extend its benefits while lowering the \ntowering costs that beset us today. And with the legislation I \nintroduce today, we can also preserve a basic American freedom to \nchoose.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of patient \nadvocacy groups supporting this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\nOrganizations Supporting Patient Access to Specialized Medical Services \n                        Under Health Care Reform\n\n       Allergy and Asthma Network Mothers of Asthmatics, Inc.\n       American Academy of Allergy and Immunology.\n       American Academy of Child and Adolescent Pyschiatry.\n       American Academy of Dermatology.\n       American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive \n     Surgery.\n       American Academy of Neurology.\n       American Academy of Ophthalmology.\n       American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.\n       American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.\n       American Academy of Pain Medicine.\n       American Academy of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation.\n       American Association for Hand Surgery\n       American Association for the Study of Headache\n       American Association of Clinical Endocrinologist.\n       American Association of Clinical Urologists.\n       American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons.\n       American Association of Neurological Surgeons.\n       American College of Cardiology.\n       American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.\n       American College of Gastroenterology.\n       American College of Nuclear Physicians.\n       American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists.\n       American College of Osteopathic Surgeons.\n       American College of Radiation Oncology.\n       American College of Radiology.\n       American College of Rheumatology.\n       American Diabetes Association.\n       American EEG Society.\n       American Gastroenterological Association.\n       American Lung Association.\n       American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine.\n       American Pain Society.\n       American Pediatric Medical Association.\n       American Psychiatric Association.\n       American Sleep Disorders Association.\n       American Society for Dermatologic Surgery.\n       American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.\n       American Society for Surgery of the Hand.\n       American Society for Anesthesiologists.\n       American Society for Cataract and Refractive Surgery.\n       American Society for Clinical Pathologists.\n       American Society for Dermatology.\n       American Society for Echocardiography.\n       American Society for General Surgeons.\n       American Society for Hematology.\n       American Society for Nephrology.\n       American Society for Pediatric Nephrology.\n       American Society for Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, \n     Inc.\n       American Society for Transplant Physicians.\n       American Thoracic Society.\n       American Urological Association.\n       Amputee Coalition of America.\n       Arthritis Foundation.\n       Arthroscopy Association of North America.\n       Association of Subspecialty Professors.\n       Asthma & Allergy Foundation of America.\n       California Access to Specialty Care Coalition.\n       California Congress of Dermatological Societies.\n       Congress of Neurological Surgeons.\n       Cooley's Anemia Foundation.\n       Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.\n       Eye Bank Association of America.\n       Federated Ambulatory Surgery Association.\n       Joint Council of Allergy and Immunology.\n       Lupus Foundation of America, Inc.\n       National Association for the Advancement of Orthotics and \n     Prosthetics.\n       National Association of Epilepsy Centers.\n       National Association of Medical Directors of Respiratory \n     Care.\n       National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias.\n       National Hemophilia Foundation.\n       National Kidney Foundation.\n       National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n       National Osteoporosis Foundation.\n       National Psoriasis Foundation.\n       Orthopaedic Trauma Association.\n       Pediatric Orthopedic Society of North America.\n       Pediatrix Medical Group?

A bill to repeal the requirement relating to specific \nstatutory authorization for increases in judicial salaries, to provide \nfor automatic annual increases for judicial salaries, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             judicial cost-of-living increases legislation\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation to \naddress the need of providing annual, automatic cost-of-living \nincreases for the Federal Judiciary. This legislation would achieve two \ngoals. First, it would repeal Section 140 of Public Law 97-42 (28 \nU.S.C. Sec. 461 note) a provision which was enacted in a continuing \nappropriation resolution in 1981. Second, it would delink Federal \njudges from Members of Congress and executive schedule employees of the \nexecutive branch with respect to receiving cost of living adjustments \nand would guarantee that Federal judges would automatically receive \nsuch annual adjustments, assuming economic conditions so justified.\n  Let me share with my colleagues some of the history relating to \nSection 140, and the reasons why I think it should be repealed. The \nFederal Salary Act of 1967 established a commission on executive, \nlegislative and judicial salaries, which was popularly referred to as \nthe ``Quadrennial Commission.'' The purpose of this commission was to \nreview executive schedule positions (federal judges, Members of \ncongress, and high ranking officials in all branches) and to make \nrecommendations on how salaries should be adjusted.\n  In 1975 Congress enacted the Executive Salary Cost-of-Living \nAdjustment Act, which provided, for the first time, for annual cost-of-\nliving adjustments for executive schedule officials. This statute was \ndesigned to give Federal judges, Members of Congress, and other high \nranking officials the same annual adjustment that was given to other \nFederal employees. In October 1975, these executive schedule officials \nreceived a cost-of-living adjustment; however, from 1977-1981, Congress \nwithheld cost-of-living adjustments for these officials. In the case of \nUnited States v. Will, 449 US 200 (1980), the Supreme Court issued a \nruling which resulted in an increase in the salaries for Federal \njudges.\n  Two years later, Congress adopted an appropriation for Fiscal Year \n1982, which provided in Section 140 that judges would not automatically \nreceive an increase under the Executive Salary Cost-of-Living \nAdjustment Act, ``except as specifically authorized by act of \nCongress.'' The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 restored cost-of-living \nadjustments and amended the Adjustment Act, to provide for a method of \ncomputing annual pay adjustments for Federal judges and other executive \nschedule employees.\n\n  Cost-of-living adjustments were provided for Federal judges in \ncalendar years 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993. There have been no cost-of-\nliving adjustments for Federal judges in 1994, 1995, nor it would \nappear in 1996. With regard to 1996, it appears that the Treasury, \nPostal Service and General Government Appropriations bill will again \ndeny a cost-of-living adjustment for Federal judges since we are \nproposing to deny ourselves such an adjustment and under current law, \nadjustments for Federal judges are linked to adjustments for Members of \nCongress.\n  Having reviewed this history, it is my belief that Congress should \ntake action to not only repeal Section 140, which currently bars cost-\nof-living adjustments in pay for Federal judges, except as specifically \nauthorized by Congress, but to also delink such adjustments from those \nof Members of Congress and other executive schedule employees of the \nexecutive branch.\n  Delinkage will remove Federal judges from the highly charged \npolitical atmosphere surrounding cost-of-living adjustments. This \nlegislation does not seek to raise judicial pay, but is in an \n\n[[Page S 15347]]\nattempt to avoid a diminution in judicial compensation by allowing \nsalaries to keep pace with increases in the cost of living.\n  Remember, judges are not like Members of Congress or high ranking \nexecutive schedule employees of the executive branch of the Federal \nGovernment. Members of Congress come and go, and likewise, executive \nschedule employees are high ranking political employees such as Cabinet \nsecretaries, deputy secretaries, assistant secretaries, and deputy \nassistant secretaries, etc. They, too, being short-term employees, come \nand go from the private sector to the public sector.\n  Federal judges are different in this regard. They make a lifetime \ncommitment to public service as Federal judges. They should be able to \nplan their financial futures based on the reasonable expectation that \ntheir compensation will at least keep even with annual cost-of-living \nincreases.\n  I think it is imperative to remove the judicial pay process from the \npolitical arena. In the middle of the 1980's, this issue was widely \ndiscussed on television talk shows and various news programs, and it \nwas very damaging to attracting top quality individuals to serve as \nFederal judges. We also know that there were a number of resignations \nin the Federal judiciary in the 1980's, because it was becoming very \ndifficult to attract top individuals to serve on the Federal bench.\n  I believe that we must continue to attract and retain judges from all \nwalks of life who have demonstrated superior legal skills whether they \nhave served as State judges, private practitioners, academicians, \nprosecutors, or public defenders. If we fail to deal with this matter, \nwe will soon attract only those judges who are independently wealthy \nand do not have to worry about providing for their families on a \nFederal judiciary salary.\n  I think this is unwise, and I hope that Congress will have the \ncourage to repeal section 140 of Public Law 97-92 and further delink \ntheir cost-of-living adjustments from Members of Congress and executive \nschedule employees, thereby removing this matter from the political \nprocess once and for all.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1344\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The \n     definitions of several terms are revised to make them \n     simpler. In addition to revising definitions, the bill would \n     add definitions of the terms ``health care'' and \n     ``residential care'' to section 1701, and transfer \n     definitions of terms into section 1701. For example, the \n     definition of the term respite care is moved from section \n     1720B.\n\n                       Definition of health care\n\n       The term ``health care'' is at the heart of the reformed \n     eligibility system established by other provisions of the \n     draft bill. The definition of the term first states that it \n     means the most appropriate care and treatment of the patient, \n     furnished in the most appropriate setting. The definition \n     further states that the term ``health care'' includes all of \n     the generally accepted modes of health care that VA furnishes \n     to veterans. Thus, the term is defined as including hospital \n     care, nursing home care, domiciliary care, outpatient care, \n     rehabilitative care, home care, respite care, preventive \n     care, and dental care. The definition also states that health \n     care includes pharmaceuticals, supplies, equipment, devices, \n     appliances and other necessary materials. The intent of that \n     language is to include all of the different types of medical \n     equipment, prosthetic and orthotic devices, and other \n     supplies the Department now furnishes to veterans, many of \n     which are included in the current definition of the term \n     ``medical services.''\n\n   Definition of hospital care, nursing home care and outpatient care\n\n       Section 1701 would also include specific definitions of the \n     various terms used in the definition of health care. Included \n     are definitions of hospital care, nursing home care, and \n     outpatient care. Each of those three terms are defined simply \n     and it is intended that they carry the same meanings that are \n     commonly understood in the medical community.\n\n                     Definition of domiciliary care\n\n       A new definition of the term ``domiciliary care'' is added \n     to section 1701. It provides that such care is applicable \n     only to veterans with no adequate means of support. That \n     language is intended to continue in effect one of the \n     eligibility requirements for domiciliary care that is now \n     included in 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1710(b).\n\n                   Definition of rehabilitative care\n\n       The definition of the term ``rehabilitative care'' remains \n     unchanged from existing law.\n\n                        Definition of home care\n\n       The bill would add a definition of the term ``home care'' \n     to section 1701. The definition intentionally limits home \n     care to health services and does not include health-related \n     services such as homemaker or social support services. The \n     definition also includes language stating that the term does \n     not include care or services that any other person or entity \n     has a contractual or legal obligation to furnish. The purpose \n     of that language is to ensure that VA not be required to \n     furnish home care to a veteran who resides in a board and \n     care facility, a residential care facility, a nursing home, \n     or other institution where the institution has a legal or \n     contractual responsibility to provide the type of care \n     included in home care.\n\n                     Definition of residential care\n\n       The bill would add a definition of the term residential \n     care to section 1701 referring to the new type of residential \n     care which would be authorized in section 1730. The \n     definition is patterned on the definition of the term \n     ``community residential-care'' that is now included in 38 \n     U.S.C.Sec. 1730(f). The term would be defined as the \n     provision of room and board and such limited personal care \n     and supervision of residents as the Secretary determines, in \n     regulations, is needed for the health, safety and welfare of \n     residents. The definition of ``community residential-care'' \n     now in 1730 would be deleted. In lieu of that, the new \n     definition would provide that community residential care is \n     simply residential care furnished in a non-VA facility.\n\n       Definition of respite care and preventive health services\n\n       Section 101 would add a definition of the term ``respite \n     care'' to section 1701 that is essentially the same as the \n     definition of that term now included in 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1720B. \n     Section 101 would also revise the definition of preventive \n     health services to make it somewhat shorter and more concise \n     then the existing definition.\n\n\n               Section 102--Basic Health Care Eligibility\n\n       Section 102 of the draft bill would completely revise 38 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1710. The revised section 1710 would become the \n     basic eligibility provision for most of the conventional \n     health care benefits VA furnishes, including hospital, \n     nursing home, domiciliary, and outpatient care.\n\n                    Authority to furnish health care\n\n       Subsection (a) of the revised section 1710 would provide \n     that the Secretary ``shall'' furnish certain veterans with \n     needed health care, subject to specified conditions and \n     limitations, and ``may'' furnish such care to other veterans. \n     Those veterans to whom the Secretary ``shall'' furnish care, \n     those with so-called mandatory eligibility, would generally \n     be the same as those who currently have mandatory eligibility \n     for VA hospital care under the current 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1710(a)(1). Those veterans are commonly referred to as \n     category A veterans, and include veterans having service-\n     connected disabilities, former prisoners of war, World War I \n     veterans, and nonservice-connected veterans with incomes \n     below the statutorily established income threshold commonly \n     referred to as the means test threshold. Subsection (a)(1) of \n     the revised section 1710 specifically provides that the \n     requirement that the Secretary ``shall'' furnish health care \n     would not apply to dental care, nursing home care, home care, \n     respite care and domiciliary care. Those veterans to whom the \n     Secretary ``may'' furnish health care under the bill would \n     be the so-called category C veterans, generally those \n     having no service-connected disabilities who have incomes \n     above the means test income threshold.\n       Because ``health care'' is defined in section 1701 as \n     including outpatient care, the revised section 1710 would \n     have the effect of completely eliminating the currently \n     existing requirements that VA furnish outpatient care to many \n     veterans only if it is needed as pre-hospital care, post-\n     hospital care, or to obviate the need for hospital care. \n     Additionally, the changes would permit the Department to \n     furnish needed prosthetic and orthotic devices to any veteran \n     eligible for health care regardless of whether care is \n     furnished on an inpatient or outpatient basis.\n       Subsection (a) of the revised section 1710 would also make \n     the provision of all health care subject to the \n     prioritization scheme described in subsection (d) of the \n     revised section 1710. Finally, subsection (a) would include \n     language explicitly providing that the Department shall \n     furnish care only to the extent that Congress appropriates \n     funds for that purpose in advance of delivering the care.\n\n Authority to furnish nursing home, domiciliary, respite and home care\n\n       Subsection (b) of the revised section 1710 would provide \n     that the Secretary ``may'' furnish needed nursing home care, \n     home care, respite care, and domiciliary care to any veteran, \n     subject to the limits of available resources, and subject to \n     the same priority scheme described in subsection (d). Under \n     current law, all veterans have so-called discretionary \n     eligibility for nursing home care, and that is unchanged. \n     However, the language making the provision of nursing home, \n     domiciliary, respite and home care subject to available \n     resources, and subject to a priority scheme is new.\n\n          Priorities for the purpose of furnishing health care\n\n       Subsection (c) of the revised section 1710 would require \n     the Secretary to furnish health care benefits in accordance \n     with specified priorities. The provision would apply to \n     nearly all health-care benefits VA furnishes. Subsection (c) \n     would set up five priority groups. It further provides that \n     the Secretary could, by regulation, establish additional \n     priorities within each statutory priority group.\n\n                           Priority group one\n\n       The first priority group includes veterans with compensable \n     service-connected disabilities and former prisoners of war. \n     In addition, this group includes two smaller categories of \n     veterans, those discharged from the military for a service-\n     related disability, but who for various reasons have not \n     sought service-connection, and those injured as a result of \n     care rendered by VA who are receiving benefits under 38 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1151.\n\n                           Priority group two\n\n       The second priority group includes veterans who receive \n     certain specialty care under one of the following four \n     special treatment authorities.\n       1. Veterans receiving care for disabilities which may \n     possibly be associated with exposure to herbicides (such as \n     Agent Orange) in Vietnam, to radiation during nuclear weapons \n     testing, or as a result of the bombing of Hiroshima and \n     Nagasaki, Japan, or to environmental hazards or other toxins \n     in the Persian Gulf. A revised section 1712 would be the \n     basic authority for this care.\n       2. Veterans receiving readjustment counseling. Section \n     1712A is the basic authority for this care.\n       3. Veterans receiving increased pension or compensation \n     benefits because they are housebound or in need of aid and \n     attendance, who obtain medication from VA based on \n     prescriptions written by their private physicians. A revised \n     section 1719 would be the authority for the Department to \n     furnish the medication.\n       4. Veterans receiving sexual trauma counseling. A revised \n     section 1720 would provide authority for this counseling.\n     \n[[Page S 15354]]\n\n\n                          Priority group three\n\n       The third priority group includes veterans with service-\n     connected disabilities rated 0%, veterans of the Mexican \n     Border period, veterans of World War I, and veterans \n     receiving increased pension based on the need of regular aid \n     and attendance or by reason of being permanently housebound.\n\n                          Priority group four\n\n       The fourth priority group includes nonservice-connected \n     veterans with incomes below the current means test income \n     thresholds who also sign a declaration that their family net \n     worth does not exceed $50,000. The income thresholds are the \n     same as those now in effect, which are set forth in 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1722. For calendar year 1995, they are $20,469 for a \n     single veteran, $24,585 for a veteran with one dependent, and \n     $1,368 for each additional dependent. If the veteran's net \n     worth exceeds $50,000, or the veteran refuses to sign a \n     declaration that it is less than that amount, the veteran is \n     included in priority group five described below. This fourth \n     priority group also includes veterans receiving screening, \n     counseling, and treatment for sickle cell anemia under 38 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1751.\n\n                          Priority group five\n\n       The fifth priority group includes nonservice-connected \n     veterans with incomes above the current means test income \n     thresholds. It also includes nonservice-connected veterans \n     with incomes below that level, but who have family net worth \n     in excess of $50,000, or who refuse to sign a declaration \n     that net worth is less than that amount.\n\n              Care furnished by other Government entities\n\n       Subsection (d) of the revised section 1710 is identical to \n     subsection (g) in the current section 1710, which provides \n     that VA is not obligated to provide care to veterans, such as \n     those who are incarcerated, to whom another governmental \n     entity is legally obligated to furnish care.\n\n                               Copayments\n\n       Subsection (e) of the revised section 1710 retains the \n     currently existing copayment structure with one substantive \n     change. Generally, veterans with incomes above the means test \n     income thresholds must agree to pay copayments amounting to \n     the Medicare deductible for each 90 days of care, and must \n     pay per diem amounts of $10 for each day of hospital care and \n     $5 for each day of nursing home care. The first substantive \n     change has to do with the outpatient care copayment. \n     Currently, veterans required to pay a copayment must pay 20% \n     of the average cost of an outpatient visit. Subsection (e) \n     would change that to provide that veterans pay 20% of the \n     estimated cost of the care. The change would be made to bring \n     copayments more in line with the actual cost of furnishing \n     care.\n\n         Furnishing inpatients with dental and outpatient care\n\n       Two provisions now included in section 1710(c) would be \n     deleted from the revised section 1710. The first provision \n     permits the Department to furnish dental care to inpatients \n     when needed to continue safe and effective treatment of other \n     disabilities for which the veteran is receiving care. That \n     provision has been simplified and included as subsection (a) \n     of the revised section 1715, which is the section concerned \n     with dental care. The second provision pertains to furnishing \n     outpatient care to inpatients. It has been deleted because it \n     would be unnecessary with the other changes in law the bill \n     would make it simplify eligibility for outpatient care.\n\n\n   SECTION 103--AGENT ORANGE, RADIATION, AND PERSIAN GULF TREATMENT \n                              AUTHORITIES\n\n       Section 103 would completely revise the current 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1712, which now provides the Department with authority \n     to furnish outpatient care. Much of the language in the \n     current section 1712 is unnecessary given the changes in \n     basic eligibility for outpatient care and would be deleted. \n     Language in the current section that must be retained is \n     transferred to other sections in chapter 17. Finally, the so-\n     called Agent Orange, Radiation, and Persian Gulf treatment \n     authorities would be moved from the current section 1710(e) \n     to the revised section 1712.\n\n            Deletion of current outpatient eligibility rules\n\n       Subsection (a) of the current section 1712 now includes all \n     of the eligibility requirements that pertain to outpatient \n     medical services. Under the proposed eligibility scheme, \n     encompassed in the revised section 1710, which would \n     authorize the Secretary to furnish all needed health care, \n     including outpatient care, there is no need for any of those \n     existing requirements. Accordingly, section 103 of the bill \n     would delete them. The rules in question are those which \n     provide that the Secretary shall furnish outpatient medical \n     services to certain veterans, and may furnish such services \n     to other veterans. They are also the requirements which limit \n     outpatient care in certain cases to that needed as pre-\n     hospital care, post-hospital care, or to obviate the need for \n     hospital care. A priority scheme now set forth in subsection \n     (i) of section 1712 would also be deleted as unnecessary \n     because the proposed new section 1710 includes priority \n     provisions. Finally, the copayment provisions applicable to \n     VA's furnishing outpatient care, now set forth in subsection \n     (f) of section 1712, have been moved to the proposed new \n     subsection (e) of section 1710.\n\n                  Outpatient dental care requirements\n\n       The current section 1712 also includes eligibility \n     requirements which pertain to VA provision of outpatient \n     dental services. The draft bill would make no changes in \n     those requirements. However, the bill would move all of the \n     dental provisions now included in section 1712(b), (c), (d), \n     and (e) to a new section 1715, which would be entitled \n     ``Dental care.''\n\n           Privately prescribed medications and immunizations\n\n       Two other provisions included in the current section 1712 \n     would also be retained, but moved to another section. First, \n     subsection (h) of the existing 1712 authorizes the Secretary \n     to fill prescriptions written by non-VA physicians for \n     veterans who are receiving increased pension or compensation \n     benefits because they are housebound or in need of aid and \n     attendance. Second, subsection (j) of the current section \n     1712 authorizes the Secretary to provide immunizations to \n     veterans as part of national immunization programs \n     administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. \n     The provisions of subsections (h) and (j) would be moved to a \n     new section 1719, which would be entitled ``Medications \n     prescribed by non-VA physicians; immunization programs.''\n\n               Agent Orange, radiation, and Persian Gulf\n\n       In place of other provisions deleted or transferred from \n     section 1712, the draft bill would insert in section 1712 \n     provisions now set forth in subsection (e) of section 1710. \n     The provisions provide authority for VA to treat disabilities \n     which may possibly be associated with exposure to herbicides, \n     such as Agent Orange, during service in Vietnam, exposure to \n     ionizing radiation from nuclear testing or in post-War Japan, \n     and exposure to environmental hazards and contaminants in the \n     Persian Gulf area. The provisions would be transferred from \n     the current section 1710, generally without substantive legal \n     change.\n       The revised section 1712 would, however, extend the time \n     period during which VA would have authority to provide the \n     treatment under that section. Under current law, the \n     Department's authority to provide care for those exposed to \n     herbicides in Vietnam or to ionizing radiation expires on \n     June 30, 1995. The draft bill would extend the herbicide \n     treatment authority through December 31, 1996, and would make \n     the ionizing radiation authority permanent. The Department \n     currently may provide care for those exposed to toxic \n     substances or environmental hazards in the Persian Gulf \n     through December 31, 1995. The draft bill would extend that \n     authority through September 30, 1997.\n\n\n  SECTION 104--MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND BEREAVEMENT COUNSELING FOR \n                                FAMILIES\n\n       Section 104 would add a new section 1712C entitled ``Mental \n     health services and bereavement counseling for \n     family members.'' Under current law, those services are \n     authorized via the definition of medical services. All of \n     the details and limits on the Department's furnishing the \n     services are presently contained in the definitions of \n     ``hospital care'' and ``medical services'' in the current \n     section 1701. Those definitions would be revised under \n     this bill, as discussed above, and written much more \n     simply. The content of the old definitions related to \n     mental health services and bereavement counseling for \n     family members is being transferred to the new section. \n     The counseling and other services would be furnished under \n     the new section 1712B, not as a form of health care under \n     the proposed new section 1710. However, there would be no \n     substantive change in existing authority to furnish the \n     services.\n\n\n   Section 105--Special Authorities Related to Furnishing Prosthetic \n          Devices, and Aids for the Blind and Hearing Impaired\n\n       Section 105 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1714, which \n     currently authorizes VA to furnish veterans who receive a \n     prosthetic appliance from VA with proper fitting of the \n     device, and training in it use. It further authorizes guide \n     dogs and devices and appliances for the blind. Section 105 \n     would retain those existing provisions in section 1714, and \n     add other provisions, now located in other parts of chapter \n     17, to the section. The proposed new section 1714 would not \n     include any authority that does not already exist in chapter \n     17 of title 38.\n\n                    Devices for the hearing impaired\n\n       Section 1717(c) currently contains authority for VA to \n     furnish devices to assist veterans in overcoming the handicap \n     of deafness. Section 105 would transfer that language to \n     section 1714, where it more logically belongs.\n\n                      Repair of prosthetic devices\n\n       Section 1719 currently authorizes VA to repair or replace \n     prosthetic appliances and other medical equipment and devices \n     damaged by a fall or accident caused by a service-connected \n     disability. Section 105 would transfer that language to \n     section 1714.\n\n                   Acquisition of prosthetic devices\n\n       Language now included in 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1712(d), which \n     authorizes the Secretary to purchase or manufacture medical \n     equipment, prosthetic devices, and similar appliances, would \n     be transferred to section 1714.\n\n\n                        Section 106--Dental Care\n\n               Abolition of authority to furnish tobacco\n\n       Section 106 would completely revise 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1715. \n     Currently, that section authorizes the Secretary to furnish \n     tobacco to veterans receiving hospital or domiciliary care. \n     Because it is Departmental policy that tobacco ordinarily not \n     be used in health-care facilities, section 106 would repeal \n     the authority to furnish tobacco. In its place, section 106 \n     would place in section 1715 all of the \n\n[[Page S 15355]]\n     eligibility requirements governing VA's provision of dental care, which \n     are now contained in subsection (c) of section 1710, and \n     subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section 1712.\n\n                         Inpatient dental care\n\n       Language currently in subsection (c) of section 1710 \n     permits the Department to furnish dental care to inpatients \n     when needed to continue safe and effective treatment of other \n     disabilities for which the veteran is receiving care. That \n     provision has been simplified and included as subsection (a) \n     of the revised section 1715. Additionally, subsection (a) \n     would authorize the Secretary to furnish inpatients with any \n     other dental care for which they would be eligible to receive \n     on an outpatient basis.\n\n                         Outpatient dental care\n\n       Currently, VA has very detailed eligibility requirements \n     governing the provision of dental care on an outpatient \n     basis. Those requirements are set forth in subsections (b), \n     (c), and (d) of section 1712. Section 106 of this bill would \n     transfer the language now in section 1712 into section 1715, \n     virtually unchanged. No substantive legal changes in the \n     eligibility requirements for outpatient dental care are \n     intended.\n\n\n       Section 107--Home Improvements and Structural Alterations\n\n                    Deletion of home care provisions\n\n       Section 107 would revise 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1717. Section 1717 \n     currently authorizes the Department to furnish home health \n     services as a form of outpatient medical services. The \n     section further provides that the department may furnish \n     certain veterans home improvements and structural alterations \n     as a form of home health services. Section 107 would delete \n     the references to home health services. The language is \n     unnecessary because home health care is included in the new \n     definition of ``health care'' in the revised section 1701, \n     and such care would be furnished pursuant to section 1710. \n     However, the language regarding the furnishing of home \n     improvements and structural alterations would be retained in \n     section 1717.\n\n              Home improvements and structural alterations\n\n       The current language in section 1717 pertaining to home \n     improvements and structural alterations would be revised \n     somewhat so that it provides stand alone authority for the \n     improvements and alterations. The improvements and \n     alterations would not be a form of outpatient care, as is now \n     the case. Rather, section 1717 would be the authority for the \n     benefit. All of the existing limits on furnishing home \n     improvements and structural alteration would be retained \n     without change.\n\n        Invalid lifts and therapeutic and rehabilitative devices\n\n       Section 1717 currently contains authority for furnishing \n     certain veterans with invalid lifts and therapeutic and \n     rehabilitative devices. That authority is now \n     largely duplicative of other authority to furnish the \n     items as a form of medical services. Section 107 would \n     delete the authority as it is unnecessary. The definition \n     of ``health care'' in the revised section 1701 would \n     include the lifts and devices, and the Secretary's \n     authority to furnish health care would provide authority \n     to furnish such items.\n\n                     Aids for the hearing impaired\n\n       Section 1717(c) currently contains authority to furnish \n     devices to assist veterans in overcoming the handicap of \n     deafness. Section 105 of the draft bill would transfer that \n     authority without change to the proposed new section 1714.\n\n\n    Section 108--Privately Prescribed Medications and Immunizations\n\n       Section 108 would completely revise 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1719. \n     That section currently authorizes VA to repair or replace \n     prosthetic appliances and other medical equipment and devices \n     damaged by a fall or accident caused by a service-connected \n     disability. Section 105 of the draft bill would transfer that \n     authority to section 1714. In its place, section 108 would \n     insert two authorities now included in section 1712. The \n     first is authority for the Secretary to fill prescriptions \n     written by non-VA physicians for veterans who are receiving \n     increased pension or compensation benefits because they are \n     housebound or in need of aid and attendance. The second is \n     authority for the Secretary to provide immunizations to \n     veterans as part of national immunization programs \n     administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. \n     Those two authorities are currently included in subsections \n     (h) and (j) of section 1712.\n\n\n                Section 109--Community Nursing Home Care\n\n       Section 109 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1720, VA's authority \n     to contract for nursing home care. The changes would permit \n     VA to directly admit a nonservice-connected veteran to a \n     contract community nursing home. Under current law, only \n     service-connected veterans may be admitted directly. \n     Additionally, section 109 would delete obsolete language in \n     section 1720 which authorizes VA to furnish veterans with \n     adult day health care. That special authority to furnish \n     adult day health care expired in 1991. More importantly, the \n     definition of the term ``health care'' which would be added \n     to section 1701 would include adult day health care.\n\n\n                     Section 110--Residential Care\n\n       Section 110 would revise 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1730, which now \n     authorizes a community residential care program under which \n     VA refers veterans to board and care homes that the veterans \n     pay for with their own resources, often VA monetary benefits \n     such as compensation or pension. The draft bill would add a \n     new subsection (a) to section 1730 to authorize VA to furnish \n     such care to certain veterans. The authority to provide the \n     care would be completely discretionary, and quite limited. \n     The Secretary could authorize transfer of a veteran into such \n     care only if the veteran is actually receiving VA hospital \n     care in a VA facility, and the residential care is an \n     alternative to continued hospital care. Moreover, such a \n     transfer could be authorized only when the veteran has no \n     resources to pay for the services. During the period of time \n     that a veteran is receiving residential care, VA officials \n     would be undertaking efforts to assist the veteran in \n     securing alternative funding, such as public assistance, for \n     the care of the veteran. Care would be furnished on a \n     contract basis, and could continue for no more than 90 days \n     in any year.\n       The amendments made by section 110 would not alter the \n     existing community residential care referral program. \n     Veterans who qualify for that program could not qualify for \n     the proposed new program under which VA pays for the care \n     because they would have alternative arrangements for payment \n     for the care. Thus, they could not meet the eligibility \n     requirements of the new program.\n\n\n               Section 111--Sharing Health Care Resources\n\n       Section 111 would amend three sections in chapter 81 of \n     title 38 that authorize VA's program to share health-care \n     resources. The provisions would expand VA's ability to obtain \n     health-care resources to serve the needs of veterans in the \n     changing health care environment. Changes to these sections \n     would facilitate the successful implementation of the \n     reformed eligibility system that other sections of the draft \n     bill would establish. The amendments would allow VA to more \n     easily acquire services for veterans, and would permit VA to \n     provide health care services to other providers in the \n     community when it would be beneficial to both parties, and \n     when there would be no diminution of services to veterans.\n\n                        Basic sharing authority\n\n       Subsection (b) of section 111 would amend 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 8153, VA's basic sharing authority, to allow VA to share \n     a wider array of resources with a wider array of other care \n     providers than is now the case. It would delete language in \n     that section which lists the different types of providers \n     with whom the Department may share, and in lieu thereof, \n     would authorize sharing with ``health care providers.'' It \n     would also allow VA to share any ``health care resource.''\n\n                              Definitions\n\n       Section 111(c) would add to 38 U.S.C. Sec. 8152, a \n     definition of the term ``health-care providers'' which would \n     include insurers, health care plans, and any organization, \n     entity, or individual that furnishes health care resources. \n     VA currently lacks authority to share with insurers and with \n     individuals such as physicians or other solo providers. It \n     would also add a definition of ``health-care resources.'' The \n     term would be defined to include health care as defined in \n     section 1701, as well as any other health-care service, and \n     any other health-care support or administrative resource. \n     Under existing law VA is limited to sharing ``specialized \n     medical resources.''\n       Finally, section 111(a) would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 8151, \n     which states the purpose of VA's sharing program, so that \n     it conforms with the changes which would be made by \n     subsections (b) and (c).\n\n\n              Section 112--Authorization of Appropriations\n\n       Section 112 would add a new section 1720D to subchapter II \n     of chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code, authorizing \n     appropriations of such sums as are necessary to carry out the \n     subchapter.\n\n\n                   Section 113--Conforming Amendments\n\n       Section 113 would amend fourteen different sections in \n     chapter 17 to make conforming changes needed as a result of \n     other amendments made by the bill. The section would repeal \n     two currently existing sections. Section 1720B, which \n     authorizes respite care, would be repealed. Respite care \n     would be provided as a form of health care. The bill would \n     also repeal section 1704, which requires VA to submit an \n     annual report on the provision of preventive health services. \n     Finally, the current section 1720D, which authorizes a sexual \n     trauma counseling program, would be redesignated as section \n     1720B.\n\n\n                     Section 120--Means Test Reform\n\n       Section 120 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1722 to simplify \n     administration of VA's health care benefits ``means test.'' \n     VA uses the means test to determine both a veteran's priority \n     for receiving VA health care and whether a veteran must agree \n     to pay certain copayments in exchange for care.\n\n                           Income thresholds\n\n       The draft bill would first amend subsection (a) of section \n     1722. It would abolish use of the term ``unable to defray the \n     expenses of necessary care.'' The subsection would simply \n     state that for purposes of the eligibility provisions and \n     priority provisions of section 1710, certain income \n     thresholds shall apply. The thresholds would be unchanged \n     from those currently in effect for distinguishing between \n     category A (higher priority veterans) and category C (lower \n     priority veterans) veterans. As under existing law, the \n     thresholds would be increased each year by the \n\n[[Page S 15356]]\n     same percentage that rates of pension are increased.\n\n                               Net worth\n\n       Section 120 of the bill would strike language in the \n     currently existing section 1722(d) which provides for \n     consideration of net worth in making the determination of \n     whether a veteran is unable to defray the cost of care. That \n     language is unnecessary due to language included in the \n     proposed new section 1710(c)(1)(D), and its elimination will \n     make administration of the means test much easier and less \n     costly. The language in section 1710(c)(1)(D) would provide \n     that a nonservice-connected veteran eligible for health care \n     on the basis of low income must sign a declaration that \n     family net worth does not exceed $50,000. If the veteran does \n     not sign such a declaration, that veteran would have lower \n     priority, and would be required to make copayments. The \n     $50,000 figure is used because that is the figure VA now uses \n     under the existing net worth test to trigger a review of a \n     veterans net worth to determine whether a part of net worth \n     should be used to help defray the costs of care.\n\n\n          Section 121--VA Retention of Third Party Collections\n\n                        Third party collections\n\n       Section 121 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1729, the section \n     which allows VA to recover the cost of care it provides to \n     veterans from third parties, particularly insurance \n     companies. Under current law, VA returns to the Treasury all \n     amounts that it collects from third parties, less the costs \n     of collection. Each year, the President's Budget anticipates \n     that VA will collect a certain amount, referred to as the \n     baseline. As an incentive to collect even more, section 121 \n     would amend subsection (g) of section 1729 to permit VA to \n     retain 25 percent of the amounts it collects over and above \n     the baseline amount. The provision further provides that VA \n     must use the additional amounts it would retain for improving \n     the quality of health care furnished by VA facilities.\n\n\n             section 201--manufactured housing loan program\n\n       Section 201 would terminate VA's authority to guarantee a \n     loan for the purchase of a manufactured home. Any such loan \n     closed after September 30, 1995, would not be eligible for \n     guaranty. An exception would be made for a loan to refinance \n     an existing VA guaranteed manufactured loan with a new loan \n     at a lower interest rate. Under existing law, which remains \n     unchanged a veteran may not receive cash under an interest \n     rate reduction refinancing loan.\n       Section 201 would also repeal the requirement that the \n     Secretary's annual report to the Congress contain information \n     about VA manufactured home loans, and make other technical \n     and conforming amendments.\n\n\n                         section 202--loan fees\n\n       Section 202 would make technical and conforming amendments, \n     consistent with the termination of the manufactured housing \n     loan program as proposed by section 201 of this bill, to \n     Section 3729 of title 38, United States Code, relating to the \n     fee veterans and other borrowers and assumers pay to VA for \n     housing loans. No change would be made in the amount of \n     existing fees.\n       These amendments would take effect October 1, 1995.\n\n\n          section 203--contracting for portfolio loan services\n\n       Section 203(a) would add a new section 3736 to title 38, \n     United States Code, which would authorize VA to contract with \n     a private firm to service VA portfolio loans. The term \n     ``portfolio loans'' includes loans made by VA e.g., in \n     connection with the sale of VA acquired properties, known as \n     ``vendee loans,'' and direct loans to Native American \n     veterans. It also includes guaranteed loans of which VA took \n     an assignment, a procedure commonly referred to as \n     ``refunding.'' VA would permit the contractor to retain a \n     portion of the interest collected on the loans as payment for \n     services rendered. This would permit VA to have the contract \n     bid for ``basis points'' in a manner similar to servicing \n     contracts used in the private sector.\n       VA would be permitted to let a servicing contract for up to \n     15 years. Current Federal contract law generally limits \n     contracts to a 5-year term.\n       This section would also provide that, for budgeting \n     purposes under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, the \n     cost of a servicing contract authorized by this section would \n     be treated as a cost of the loan or loan guaranty, and not as \n     an administrative expense.\n       Section 203(b) would make a conforming amendment to the \n     table of sections for chapter 37 of title 38.\n\n\n       section 210--electronic signatures for education benefits\n\n       Section 210 would amend several provisions of title 38, \n     United States Code, to clarify that claimants for VA \n     education benefits, State approving agencies, and schools may \n     transmit documents with their signature electronically to \n     permit VA to award benefits. These electronic documents, \n     submitted in the regular course of business, would be \n     accepted as the legal equivalent of a signed, written, paper \n     document. As such, they could be used to make benefits \n     determinations in an expedited manner with reduced errors.\n\n\n section 211--electronic funds transfer for education benefits payments\n\n       Section 211 would amend section 5120(d) of title 38, United \n     States Code, to authorize VA to implement, under an agreement \n     with the Treasury, a system requiring that payment of \n     educational assistance allowances under all education \n     benefits programs administered by VA would be made by \n     electronic funds transfer. The amendment defines ``electronic \n     funds transfer'' (EFT) to include the various electronic \n     systems and devices prevalent today for such purposes, as \n     distinguished from transactions originated by cash, check, or \n     other paper instrument.\n       VA would be required to develop a plan for phasing in the \n     conversion from a paper instrument to an EFT system for \n     education benefits payments, and would be given discretionary \n     authority to prescribe regulations needed to implement the \n     EFT system. Such regulations may include authority to modify \n     any provision of the EFT system designated by the Secretary, \n     as well as to waive or modify the system's application in \n     circumstances where it would be impractical.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                Secretary of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Al Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are transmitting a draft bill, ``To \n     amend title 38, United States Code, and various other \n     statutes, to reform eligibility for Department of Veterans \n     Affairs health-care benefits, improve the operation of the \n     Department, and improve the processes and procedures the \n     Department uses to administer various benefit programs for \n     veterans; and for other purposes.''\n       In 1993, the Administration, led by Vice President Gore, \n     launched its effort to improve Federal Government operations \n     through the ``reinventing government'' program. This year, in \n     phase II of that effort, VA examined its basic missions, \n     reviewed its major programs, and developed several exciting \n     initiatives to enable the Department to better serve \n     veterans, and serve them in a cost-effective manner. Several \n     of those initiatives can be implemented only through \n     enactment of legislation. This draft bill would provide the \n     needed changes in law.\n\n\n                     health-care eligibility reform\n\n       Perhaps the single most important need in the VA health-\n     care system at this time is the need for reform of the \n     eligibility system. Currently, the process required for a \n     veteran to receive care from VA can be confusing and \n     frustrating. Complicated and irrational statutory eligibility \n     rules sometimes cause absurd outcomes. Existing law \n     discourages VA from effectively managing care, and often \n     promotes the use of expensive and unnecessary inpatient care.\n       VA designed the eligibility reform proposal in the draft \n     bill to achieve several important objectives.\n       First, the eligibility system should be one that both the \n     persons seeking care and those providing the care are able to \n     understand.\n       Second, the eligibility system should ensure that VA is \n     able to furnish patients the most appropriate care and \n     treatment that is medically needed, cost effectively and in \n     the most appropriate setting.\n       Third, veterans should retain eligibility for those \n     benefits they are now eligible to receive.\n       Fourth, VA management should gain the flexibility needed to \n     manage the system effectively.\n       Fifth, the proposal should be budget neutral.\n       Sixth, the proposal should not create any new and \n     unnecessary bureaucracy.\n       The draft bill would provide that the Department ``shall'' \n     furnish a specified core group of veterans with needed \n     ``health care.'' This would include hospital care, outpatient \n     care, disease prevention services, pharmaceuticals, medical \n     equipment, and prosthetic equipment and devices. Persons in \n     the core group would generally be those veterans now commonly \n     referred to as category A veterans: those with service-\n     connected disabilities, former prisoners of war, World War I \n     veterans, and nonservice-connected veterans with incomes \n     below the current means test income threshold. The Department \n     would retain authority to furnish the core group veterans \n     with other types of health care, including nursing home care. \n     VA would also retain authority to furnish all health care to \n     veterans not included in the core group. The Department would \n     furnish all care in accordance with five priority groups set \n     forth in the bill. Finally, the bill would continue in place \n     the current copayment structure, and would retain, \n     essentially unchanged, the so-called Agent Orange, Radiation, \n     and Persian Gulf treatment authorities.\n       The most significant change in the proposal would be the \n     complete elimination of the complicated and archaic \n     eligibility rules governing the provision of outpatient care. \n     The bill would also permit wider use of cost-effective \n     preventive health measures, and use of residential care when \n     that would alleviate the need for hospital care. These key \n     features will allow VA to provide the right care at the right \n     place and the right time for the right price.\n\n\n                          Health-Care Sharing\n\n       Today's competitive health-care environment demands that \n     all types of service providers cooperate and work together \n     for each to survive. The VA health-care system is an integral \n     part of the larger health-care industry and must be able to \n     work with partners in both the private and public sectors. \n     However, current law imposes undue limitations on VA's \n     ability to obtain needed health-care \n\n[[Page S 15357]]\n     resources to serve veterans. Similarly, VA is unable to fully share, \n     even when it is mutually advantageous to do so, its resources \n     with others in the community who could benefit from the \n     Department's expertise. To remedy that situation, the draft \n     bill includes provisions to expand VA's ability to share \n     resources with other community health-care providers.\n       The draft bill would amend existing law to permit the \n     Department to share all types of health-care resources with \n     all types of health-care providers in the community. It would \n     define ``health care resource'' to include conventional \n     health-care services such as hospital care, nursing home \n     care, outpatient care, rehabilitative care, and preventive \n     care. Additionally, it would include other health-care \n     support or administrative services essential to the operation \n     of a health-care system. The draft bill would also more \n     broadly define the term ``health care provider'' to include \n     insurers, health-care plans, and health-care management \n     organizations, as well as individuals such as physicians or \n     other solo providers. The expanded sharing authority is \n     essential for the reform of the entire VA health-care system.\n\n\n             VA Retention of Increased Medical Collections\n\n       Current law permits the VA to recover the cost of care it \n     provides to veterans from third parties, particularly \n     insurance companies. Funds collected are turned over to the \n     Treasury. The Department currently does an excellent job of \n     collecting these funds. However, as an additional incentive \n     to VA medical centers to increase collections, the draft bill \n     would authorize the Department to retain a portion of amounts \n     it collects over the amounts anticipated in the budget each \n     year. Providing an incentive such as this is a classic \n     example of how to ``reinvent'' Government.\n\n\n             Termination of Manufactured Home Loan Program\n\n       The draft bill would repeal the authority for VA to \n     guarantee loans to purchase manufactured homes. The number of \n     veterans obtaining manufactured home loans has declined \n     significantly over the years, from a high of 13,502 in fiscal \n     Year 1983 to only 24 in Fiscal Year 1994. Manufactured home \n     loan foreclosure rates are significantly higher than those \n     for site-built homes. The cumulative foreclosure rate for \n     manufactured home loans is 38.7 percent compared to 5.58 \n     percent for site-built homes. The high foreclosure rates in \n     the manufactured home loan program have adversely affected \n     the financial solvency of the loan guaranty program, and \n     resulted in substantial debts being established against \n     veterans whose loans were liquidated and homes repossessed. \n     Due to this low volume, there is virtually no lender interest \n     in using the VA manufactured home loan program. However, VA \n     is required to maintain expertise in consumer installment \n     finance, which differs in many respect from real estate \n     finance.\n       This provision will not affect the ability of veterans to \n     obtain VA guaranteed loans to purchase, construct, or improve \n     conventionally-built homes, or refinance existing liens on \n     such homes.\n\n\n                Contracting for Portfolio Loan Servicing\n\n       The draft bill would permit VA to contract for servicing of \n     its loan portfolio in a manner which is consistent with \n     private sector loan servicing. VA believes it is in the best \n     interests of the Government to contract out this function. \n     Several provisions of existing law, however, preclude VA \n     from privatizing this function in the most effective \n     manner.\n       Current law limits Federal contracts to a term of 5 years. \n     This is too short a term for the servicing of loans that bear \n     a 30-year maturity. The draft bill would permit the servicing \n     contract to have a 15-year term. Second, current law requires \n     a contract servicer to remit immediately to the Government \n     all money collected. The bill would allow the contractor to \n     retain a portion of the loan payments collected as its fee as \n     is customary in the private sector. Finally, the draft bill \n     would clarify the budget treatment of the cost of this \n     contract under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 as a \n     cost of the loan rather than as administrative overhead, \n     which more accurately reflects private sector accounting \n     practices.\n\n\n    electronic signatures and electronic funds transfers--education \n                                benefits\n\n       In the modern world, information is commonly transmitted \n     electronically. Yet statutes are often slow to catch up with \n     technology. This draft bill would amend various laws to \n     modernize administration of VA's education benefit programs. \n     The bill would clarify that claimants for VA education \n     benefits, State approving agencies, and schools may transmit \n     documents with their signature electronically to permit VA to \n     award benefits. The bill would also authorize VA to \n     implement, under an agreement with the Treasury, a system \n     requiring that payment of educational assistance allowances \n     under all education benefits programs administered by VA \n     would be made by electronic funds transfer.\n       The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) requires that \n     all revenue and direct spending legislation meet a pay-as-\n     you-go requirement. That is, no such bill should result in an \n     increase in the deficit; and if it does, it will trigger a \n     sequester if it is not fully offset. Outlay savings in this \n     bill would equal its increase in direct spending, resulting \n     in a net zero PAYGO effect. Thus, considered alone, this bill \n     meets the pay-as-you-go requirement of OBRA.\n       We are advised by the Office of Management and Budget that \n     there is no objection to the transmittal of this draft bill \n     to the Congress and its enactment would be in accord with the \n     program of the President.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jesse Brown.\n\n

SENATE RESOLUTION 185--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n                      REPAYMENT OF LOANS TO MEXICO\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 185\n\n       Whereas the United States has provided Mexico with \n     approximately $12,500,000,000 in loans to Mexico;\n       Whereas these loans were not authorized by the United \n     States Congress;\n       Whereas the taxpayers of the United States should not be \n     responsible for any losses incurred from these loans; and\n       Whereas certain loans to Mexico will become due and payable \n     on October 30, 1995: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That, it is the sense of the Senate that no \n     further loans should be made to Mexico without specific \n     authorization from the United States Congress, and that, all \n     loans made to Mexico should be repaid in full and on time, \n     and that such debts should not be extended, rescheduled, or \n     reduced in any manner.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I am submitting a sense of the \nSenate regarding Mexico.\n  From day 1, I have been opposed to the Mexican bailout. It was never \nthe sole responsibility of the United States to help Mexico pay its \ndebtors.\n  These economic problems were of Mexico's own making, driven by \npolitics, corruption, and poor economic policy.\n  Nevertheless, the President, without the approval of the Congress, \nwent ahead and loaned $12.5 billion to Mexico.\n  This was a terrible mistake. We cannot continue to be the world's \nbanker. We cannot continue to loan money to countries that have no \nintention of repaying it.\n  I might add that the Clinton administration has proposed the creation \nof an international bailout fund to deal with future problems like \nMexico. I cannot think of a worse idea. Once the Congress establishes a \nfund--any fund--it will be used. Has money ever been appropriated by \nthe Congress and not used? The answer is no. That is why I have \nintroduced a bill, S. 1222, to stop the creation of this new \ninternational bailout fund.\n  Mr. President, returning to the Mexico issue, I would suggest that \nthe first priority of this Congress and administration should be \ngetting our own economic house in order before we can afford to engage \nin international bailouts, like Mexico.\n  This means getting Federal spending under control. I have to wonder \nif we keep putting ourselves deeper and deeper in debt--who will bail \nus out.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that the loans to Mexico will never \nbe repaid. The American taxpayer will bear the burden of the Mexico \nbailout.\n  I think this is very wrong--and I intended to do everything I can to \nstop it--starting today.\n  Mr. President, last week, Mexico repaid $700 million of the nearly \n$12.5 billion in loans that they owe to the United States. This was a \ngreat public relations move for Mexico--but for those that read between \nthe headlines there was something very troubling.\n  Mexico owes the United States $2 billion on October 30, 1995. Mexico \nwas making payment of $700 million towards that loan.\n  Instead of paying that loan off in full, however, Mexico apparently \nintends to have the balance of what is owed by October 30--$1.3 \nbillion--rolled over past that deadline.\n  This short term swap of $2 billion was extended to Mexico on February \n2, 1995. It came due in May, but was rolled over in May for 90 days. It \nwas rolled over in August for another 90 days. Now, its falling due \nagain for a third time.\n  I think it is time that Mexico pays up--and on time.\n  Mr. President, for this reason, I am introducing a sense of the \nSenate that loans to Mexico be paid on time and in full.\n  The principle needs to be established early on in this relationship \nthat these loans should be repaid in full and repaid on time.\n  If not, these so called loans will quickly become foreign aid. The \nCongress did not vote for foreign aid. The American taxpayer cannot \nafford more foreign aid. And the loans to Mexico shouldn't become \nforeign aid.\n  Further, if Mexico can't make this small repayment in full and on \ntime--only $2 billion of the $12.5 billion--how will it ever repay the \nremaining balance.\n  The bulk of the United States loans to Mexico don't come due until \n1997. They won't be fully repaid until the year 2000. But if Mexico \ncan't repay its short term loans on time--then I do not have any hope \nthat the loans coming due in 1997 through 2000 will ever be repaid.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, Mexico made a great public relations \nmove by repaying some of its loans last week. But the real story may be \nthat they will never pay anymore. The real test will come shortly, by \nOctober 30 when Mexico should pay the United States $1.3 billion.\n  We need to be firm. We need to stand our ground now. Mexico must pay \nthe United States back. This is what this sense of the Senate calls \nfor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15358-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15358-S15359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 186--RELATIVE TO THE SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. DOLE (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, over the last week there has been \nsubstantial criticism levied against the health care fraud and abuse \nprovisions contained in the House Medicare and Medicaid reform \nproposals. Unfortunately, some of the headlines and attacks imply that \nall Republican Budget Reconciliation legislation is soft on fraud and \nabuse.\n  Headlines such as ``GOP Medicare Bill Seen to Favor Fraud,'' and \n``GOP Plan to Ease Medicare Fraud Rules `Terrible,' May Go,'' and \n``Beneath Surface, Health Care Plan Is Offering Boons'' are leading the \npublic to believe that all Republican Medicare proposals are going \nlight on those who are ripping off Medicare while honest Medicare \nproviders and some beneficiaries are being asked to make sacrifices to \nsave Medicare.\n  As the author of fraud and abuse provisions in the Senate \nreconciliation bill that was recently marked up by the Finance \nCommittee, I feel that I must set the record straight, at least as it \nconcerns the Senate version.\n  I commend the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate leadership for \nits strong commitment to tough antifraud measures. Many law enforcement \nofficials have indicated to me that the Senate bill contains the \ntoughest and most comprehensive--but fair--health care antifraud bills \nto come out in decades. It pains me to see headlines stating that \nRepublican efforts on health care fraud fall short.\n  Let me tell you about what my Senate colleagues and I have \nincorporated in the Senate budget reconciliation bill. My legislation:\n  Creates an antifraud program to coordinate Federal, State, and local \nlaw enforcement efforts to combat fraud and abuse;\n  Appropriates a mandatory $200 million in fiscal year 1996 for \nantifraud investigators and auditors with a 15-percent increase every \nyear thereafter for 7 years;\n  Makes it mandatory for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nexclude individuals from receiving payment from Medicare and Medicaid \nwhen convicted of felonies relating to health care fraud and allows the \nSecretary to exclude individuals convicted of a criminal misdemeanor \nrelated to a health care offense;\n  Sets minimum periods of exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid \npayments;\n  Allows the Secretary to exclude individuals who have direct or \nindirect ownership or control interest of 5 percent or more in an \nentity--or is an officer or managing employee--if the entity is already \nexcluded from Medicare or Medicaid;\n  Allows the HHS Secretary to impose intermediate sanctions on a \nMedicare HMO if the HMO fails to carry out the contract such as in \nquality of care \n\n[[Page S 15360]]\nareas. These penalties range from $10,000 to $100,000 depending on the \nviolation. Suspension of continued enrollment or payments can also be \nused as sanctions;\n  Establishes a national health care fraud and abuse data collection \nprogram for reporting final adverse actions against health care \nproviders, suppliers, or practitioners. The information in the data \nbase is required to be available to Federal and State government \nagencies and health plans according to procedures that the Secretary \nwill set by regulation;\n  Increases civil monetary penalties from $2,000 to $10,000 for a \nnumber of current fraud and abuse violations;\n  Adds new prohibited practices to the current law for which civil \nmonetary penalties can be assessed such as: incorrect coding; medically \nunnecessary services; and persons offering remuneration--including \nwaiving coinsurance and deductible amounts--to induce the individual to \norder from a particular provider or supplier receiving Medicare or \nMedicaid;\n  Allows the HHS Secretary to impose civil monetary penalties of up to \n$10,000 per violation for criminal anti-kickback violations;\n  Establishes enhanced fraud and abuse guidelines to enable the \nprovider community to better comprehend anti-kickback requirements;\n  Amends the criminal code to include:\n  A new health care fraud statute;\n  Forfeiture of property that is obtained from the proceeds traceable \nto health care fraud;\n  Injunctive relief on activities related to health care fraud;\n  Grand jury disclosure for health care fraud proceedings;\n  Criminal penalties for false statements;\n  Criminal penalties for obstruction of a criminal investigation;\n  Criminal penalties for theft or embezzlement;\n  Criminal penalties for laundering of money used in health care fraud \noffenses; and\n  Subpoena authority to the Attorney General for health care fraud \ncases.\n  Extends the authority of the State Medicaid fraud units by allowing \nthe units to investigate other Federal fraud abuses at the approval of \nthe relevant Federal agency; and allowing investigation and prosecution \nin the case of patient abuse in non-Medicaid board and care facilities.\n  This legislation has received the enthusiastic endorsement of law \nenforcement and prosecution agencies. At a hearing of the Senate \nSpecial Committee on Aging that I chaired this past March, FBI Director \nLouis Freeh testified:\n\n       The legislation . . . addresses for the first time in a \n     comprehensive way not only the problem, but some of the \n     important solutions which we in law enforcement look to . . . \n     Aspects of the bill--the establishment of a fraud and abuse \n     database, the coordination that would be required in \n     antifraud efforts between the Department of Justice and HHS, \n     the establishment of an antifraud account--are tremendously \n     innovative and helpful tools . . . A straightforward health \n     care fraud statute would simplify prosecution of these cases \n     and greatly enhance the ability of law enforcement to attack \n     this problem.\n\n  At that same hearing that I convened on health care fraud and abuse, \nthe HHS Inspector General June Gibbs Brown testified:\n\n       We strongly support the bill . . . which proposes a number \n     of innovative ways to address health care fraud and abuse . . \n     . strengthening existing legal remedies for addressing fraud \n     and abuse, amending current criminal laws, as well as \n     enhancing administrative sanction authorities available to \n     the Department such as civil monetary penalties and program \n     exclusions which would aid in the fight against health care \n     fraud and abuse.\n\n  The health care fraud provisions contained in the Senate bill have \nreceived endorsements and support from the National Association of \nAttorneys General and the Medicaid fraud control units. In addition, we \nworked very closely with the Department of Justice to create a fair, \nworkable proposal that cracks down on fraud while not penalizing honest \nhealth care providers.\n  Once more, the Senate provisions save billions of taxpayers dollars \nwithout cutting services or raising taxes. Specifically the antifraud \nprovisions yield over $4 billion in savings.\n  In addition, many of my colleagues both Republican and Democratic \nhave supported and encouraged this bill for a long time including the \nmajority leader, the chairmen of the Budget Committee, the Banking \nCommittee, the Veterans' Committee, and the Appropriations Committee. I \nam also pleased to point out that several of my colleagues from the \nother side of the aisle have cosponsored this antifraud legislation, \nincluding Senators Pryor, Nunn, Bradley, Graham, and Moseley-Braun.\n  Mr. President, that is why I stand before the Senate today to respond \nto this onslaught directed at the House provisions. We in the Senate \nhave worked too hard and too long to come up with a strong health care \nantifraud and abuse bill, that not even the most partisan among us \ncould attack. We must not, Mr. President, let ourselves get wrapped up \nin the criticism that is being directed at the House provisions.\n  It is my understanding that the House has made some changes to its \nearlier proposals in order to toughen its response to health care \nfraud. Specifically, provisions have been added to toughen criminal \nsanctions against fraudulent health care providers. While I am very \npleased that the House leadership took this step, I still have strong \nconcerns regarding some remaining provisions in the House bill that \ncould severely weaken our efforts to combat health care fraud.\n  I thank my colleagues for all their longstanding support on this \nissue and for letting me have the opportunity to set the record \nstraight. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15359-4", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15360-S15361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LUNCH OF STONES\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today on Capitol Hill a number of \nreligious organizations concerned with hunger in the United States are \ngathering to highlight what I believe is one of the great injustices \nbeing perpetrated in the name of welfare reform in this Congress.\n  Most of my colleagues, I believe, had the best of intentions when \nthey voted for H.R. 4, the welfare reform package. But I am very \nconcerned with the impact of the final welfare reform package on the \nnutritional safety net for children, families, and senior citizens. \nQuite simply, under either the House or Senate versions of this bill, \nmore children will go hungry.\n  The majority of the savings in the Senate version of welfare reform \nhave come out of nutrition programs, whose main beneficiaries are \nchildren. H.R. 4 contains a little bit of reform. But even the Senate \nversion contains a whole lot of cuts--more than $30 billion in total \ncuts, including more than $20 billion in reduced nutrition benefits to \nchildren alone. Less than one-half of 1 percent of the bill's savings \ncome from antifraud provisions, according to CBO estimates. Over half \nof the savings come from across-the-board cuts, and another 12 percent \nof the savings come from households with high utility costs.\n  Under the Senate bill, by 2002, a working-poor family of four \nsupported by a full-time minimum wage worker would lose $324 a year in \nfood stamp benefits from the across-the-board benefit reductions, \naccording to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. An elderly SSI \nrecipient, typically a poor woman living alone, would lose $228 a \nyear--that's a 32-percent reduction.\n  The Senate bill also contains an optional block grant that will allow \nStates to cancel the national nutritional safety net, divert funds away \nfrom food, and slash benefits during a recession.\n  Wrongheaded as it is, however, the Senate version is actually \npreferable in many ways to the House version of H.R. 4. The House bill \nrepeals school lunches, school breakfasts, WIC, the Child and Adult \nCare Food Program, and other programs for children. These are among the \ngreat success stories of public policy in the 20th century. \nConservative House Republicans seem to say, ``If it works--but it does \nnot fit our ideology--break it.'' I am pleased that many moderates of \nboth parties are rebelling against this position.\n  The House bill would replace real food with junk food in school \ncafeterias. It would reduce food stamp benefits so they no longer pay \nfor a decent diet. It would end scientifically based nutritional \nsupplements for pregnant women. It would cancel the guarantee of free \nmeals for poor schoolchildren.\n  This is bad public policy, and it is immoral. If we are going to turn \nschool lunches into junk-food bonanzas and \n\n[[Page S 15361]]\nshrivel food stamps down to a meaningless few pennies per meal, we \nmight as well feed our children stones.\n  Today, the Christian citizens' group Bread for the World and other \nreligious and antihunger groups are gathering on Capitol Hill to ponder \nJesus' question in the New Testament (Matthew 7:9): ``Is there anyone \namong you who, if your child asks for bread, will give a stone?'' To \nsymbolize this concern, they are holding a ``lunch of stones.'' Members \nof these groups, which include the Salvation Army, the Second Harvest \nNational Network of Food Banks, Lutheran Social Services, the NETWORK \nCatholic social justice lobby, and other national religious and \ncharitable leaders, will be visiting offices on Capitol Hill. These \ngroups represent tens of thousands of concerned citizens who donate \ntheir time and effort to improving the diet and health of children, \nfamilies, and senior citizens.\n  These dedicated citizens and I urge Members of this Congress to \nprotect the national nutritional safety net that Republicans and \nDemocrats together have constructed over the last 25 years. The safety \nnet ensures that, even during recessions and natural disasters, \nchildren in need receive food assistance so they do not go hungry. I \nurge my colleagues to listen carefully to the concerns voiced in the \n``lunch of stones.''\n  I also want to caution my colleagues against some of the phony \narguments being bandied about on this topic. None of these gigantic \ncuts will reform welfare. And these cuts are not necessary to balance \nthe budget--the President has put forward a plan to balance the budget \nwithout such gigantic cuts in nutrition programs. I believe these cuts \nare, quite simply, mistakes and errors in judgment. Right now there is \nstill time to correct these errors, before more children must go \nhungry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15360-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO THE HOCKING BROTHERS\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nHocking brothers from Idaho who served together courageously during \nWorld War II.\n  They were a family of 10 children, 4 girls and 6 boys, and lived in \nMoore, ID in 1929. In 1935 they moved to Mackay, ID. Mackay was \nconsidered home for all of them. Presently, one brother lives in each \nof the following Idaho cities or towns: Mackay, Arco, Blackfoot, \nLewiston, and Deary. All of the brothers who are able are active \nfishermen and hunters. Two sisters and the oldest are now deceased. The \noldest brother Pat Hocking, was not in the service as he had five \nchildren and worked at the Naval Gun Rellning Plant in Arco, ID. The \nremaining five brothers served in one branch or another of the military \nservice.\n  Jean Hocking was drafted before the war and was stationed for 38 \nmonths of continuous service in Kodiak, AK in the U.S. Army Coast Guard \nArtillery and the U.S. Army Ski Troopers from 1941 to 1945. He was one \nof the very first men drafted from Custer County. Jean's camp was \nlocated on a mountain and everything had to be hauled up the mountain \nby hand. Jean's commanding officer was so disciplined that Jean did not \nhave even 1 day off while he was there. He was always on alert or \npatrol. One day they were on patrol skiing down the mountain when \nJean's ski tip got stuck in the snow toward the bottom of the mountain \nthat he suffered a broken leg. He was so afraid of his commanding \nofficer that he did not seek treatment and hobbled around on his broken \nleg. Jean was given a military disability and was in Walter Reed \nHospital for 6 months after his discharge.\n  Clayton Hocking served in the U.S. Army Air Corps 9th Engineering \nSquadron S.A.C. from 1942 to 1967. He served all over the Pacific and \nretired as a well-decorated staff sergeant. Clayton received a \nPhillipine Liberation Medal with one Bronze Service Star, a Good \nConduct Medal, a World War II Victory Medal, and an Asiatic Pacific \nMedal. He is currently in a rest home in Arco, ID.\n  Frank Hocking served in the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marines from 1942 \nto 1945. Frank served both the Navy and the Marines as the Marines had \nno medical corps. So the Navy furnished the Marines with a Medical \nCorps. The first place Frank was shipped to overseas was to New \nCaledonia. While there Frank went to town one day. As he was walking \ndown the street, he literally ran into his brother Clayton. Frank had \nnot seen Clayton since joining, and had no idea where Clayton was \nstationed. Frank and Clayton were able to visit each others camps while \nthere. After leaving New Caledonia, Frank went to New Zealand where he \njoined the Second Marine Division and trained before the battle of \nTarawa. He was on the first wave who landed on Tarawa in the Gilbert \nIslands of the South Pacific. The Marines were told they had to take \nthe well-fortified Japanese defenses of the island in 6 hours or they \nwouldn't be able to take it. It took them 4 days to take the island. \nThe battle cost 1,000 Marines lives and 2,300 men were wounded. \nJapanese losses totaled about 8,500. The taking of the island of Saipan \nof the Marianas Islands was another major battle. Frank was one of the \noriginal two Marine divisions that tried to take the island from the \n30,000 Japanese defenders. Frank was on the island from June 15 to July \n7 when the remaining Japanese resistance tried the largest suicidal \ncounterattack in the war. The loss of Saipan was so devastating to the \nJapanese that Prime Minister Tojo Hideki and his entire cabinet \nresigned after word of the defeat reached them.\n\n  Bill Hocking served in the 20th Air Force Division on Guam of the \nSouth Pacific from 1944 to 1946. He was the first aerial gunner on a B-\n17. Later, he became a belly gunner on the B-29's. The most memorable \nevent in Bill's military career happened when three B-29 planes were \nflying in formation when Bill's B-29 caught on fire. He and the whole \ncrew were forced to bail out into the ocean between Guam and Tokyo. \nWhen he bailed out, he just about drowned when he got so tangled in his \nparachute shroud that he couldn't even upright his one-man life raft. \nHe had to lay there holding on to his upside down raft. When he finally \ngot into the raft, he couldn't see any of the rest of the crew as they \nwere all scattered. One guy in the crew happened to have a whistle and \nhe kept blowing it. They all paddled toward the sound and that is how \nthey all got back together. They were always concerned about sharks so \nthey used shark repellent. The crew was adrift for 3 days before being \npicked up by the ship. That episode made Bill a member of the \nCaterpillar Club. A patch was given as special recognition for \nsurviving a bail out.\n  Glen Hocking served in the 90th Naval Construction Battalion Combat \nFleet Action from 1945 to 1946. Glen was 17 years old when he enlisted \nto follow in his older brothers' footsteps. He was told that his outfit \nwas training to invade Japan. They were on their way to Japan when the \nbomb dropped on Hiroshima. He saw all the devastation over there. He \nwas there for 9 months occupation duty. Glen came away from service \nwith the Asiatic Pacific Area Campaign Medal and World War II Victory \nMedal.\n  These five brothers all came home alive, but still felt the \nsacrifices of war. Two of their cousins did not make it home. There \nwere killed in the line of duty. This is one of the many family stories \nthat make up the heroism and valor that led the United States and our \nallies to victory in World War II. The five Hocking brothers fell very \nblessed and lucky to have all come home. We are very blessed that they \nand many others were there to serve their country and to fight for \ndemocracy and the freedom all Americans hold dearly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15361-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15361-S15362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PUBLIC FORUM IN GREENLEAF, WI, WITH SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE, DAN \n                                GLICKMAN\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on July 31 of this year, in an \nextraordinary gathering on a 200-acre dairy farm in Greenleaf, WI, 300 \nfarmers, rural business people, and others in the agricultural sector \ncame together to convey to Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman the \nimportance of reforming an archaic agricultural program, known as the \nFederal Milk Marketing Order System. This program, created in the late \n1930's has discriminated against the Wisconsin dairy industry for years\n  Those who attended this forum represent different segments of our \ndairy industry which have divergent political views and affiliations, \nbut they all \n\n[[Page S 15362]]\nagreed on one fundamental issue--Federal orders must be reformed. For \nan industry that is made up of individuals whose only shared \ncharacteristic is their independence and staunchly self-reliant nature, \nthis type of unanimity is rare. They wanted their message to be heard \nby one of the few people with the power to make Federal milk marketing \norders both consistent with milk markets of the 1990's as well as \nequitable to all those affected by them.\n  The current program for regulating the pricing and sale of milk \nprovides higher prices for fluid milk to producers distant from the \nUpper Midwest. While that scheme might have made sense when Wisconsin \nwas the primary dairy producing State in the United States, but in \n1995, it defies logic. This system not only creates an artificial \nincentive for greater milk production, but has led to increased \nproduction of manufactured dairy products driving down prices \nthroughout the Nation and increasing Government surpluses. Federal milk \nmarketing orders are a perfect example of excessive Government \nregulation creating a system which is completely out of sync with \ncurrent marketing conditions and which discriminates against Wisconsin \nand Upper Midwest dairy producers.\n  Mr. President, Secretary Dan Glickman listened for over an hour to \nfarmers frustrated not only by the existence of this system, but also \nby its institutional resilience. I commend him for that. It is the \nfirst time in a long time that Wisconsin dairy farmers have felt that a \nSecretary of Agriculture actually cared about what they had to say. Dan \nGlickman came not to talk to lobbyists, not to talk to politicians and \nnot to talk to Government officials, but to listen to those whose \nlivelihood depends, in part, on the decisions he makes.\n  This was a unique forum in that average farmers spoke directly to the \nSecretary. It linked 54 of Wisconsin's 72 counties to the meeting via \nsatellite. While the time did not allow all those who attended to \nspeak, those producers who did represented the diversity of my home \nState's agricultural sector--dairy, soybeans, corn, wheat, alfalfa, and \nspecialty products such as mink. Each, in turn, talked about what is \ngood and what is bad about our current Federal policies. Primarily, \nthough, they talked about dairy policy.\n  At the outset of our meeting, the Secretary conceded that \ndiscrimination exists within the Federal order program benefiting some \nregions more than others. In response, he pledged his support to try to \nchange the existing number and administration of current milk marketing \norders. He further pledged his support to try to consolidate those \norders, make periodic adjustments in price differentials, and to \npotentially create multiple price-setting base points. While I am not \nentirely pleased with the Secretary's choice to attempt these changes \nthrough the administrative process, I am pleased with his admission \nthat the system is broken.\n  Mr. President, as the Congress moves toward final action on the \nbudget reconciliation and moves toward the 1995 farm bill, I think it \nis important that the Secretary heard the message of Wisconsin farmers. \nI hope that my colleagues will hear that message as well.\n  Action on these items, the Secretary conceded, will be a challenge in \nthat other regions will fight to maintain their current artificial \nadvantages. Despite the deregulatory rhetoric of many in the 104th \nCongress, the Secretary's prediction is proving to be true based on \nrecent action by the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  The legislation reported by the Agriculture Committee fails to \naddress needed reform of this system, despite the tremendous budget \nsavings and consumer benefits that could result from such action. That \nis a disappointment, Mr. President. Instead, Mr. President, the \ncommittee chose to take the easy road by cutting support prices, \ninstead of making the difficult choices associated with milk marketing \norder reform.\n  And indeed, as the Secretary pointed out at Greenleaf, these are very \ndifficult decisions. They are so difficult that the House of \nRepresentatives, unable to reach agreement on reform, is moving on a \npath toward total deregulation of the dairy industry, including the \nelimination of Federal milk marketing orders.\n  Mr. President, total deregulation of the dairy industry, is not my \nfirst choice. I would rather work with my colleagues to achieve \nreasonable and responsible reform of Federal orders. However, for the \nlast 3 years, many dairy farmers in Wisconsin have been telling me that \nif they cannot get reform, if other regions of the country will not \ncompromise, deregulation would be a farsight better than the raw deal \nthey are getting now.\n  Mr. President, I want to work with my colleagues during the budget \nreconciliation process and the farm bill deliberations to reach \nagreement on Federal orders. However, if others are unwilling to move \ntoward a level playing field, dairy farmers in their States may end up \nwith nothing at all.\n  Mr. President, in Greenleaf, WI, the Secretary of Agriculture heard \nloud and clear that Upper Midwest dairy farmers are fed up with the \ncurrent program that regulates milk markets. I urge my deregulation-\nminded colleagues to listen to what the Upper Midwest is saying on this \nissue as well. It is time to do the right thing--reform Federal milk \nmarketing orders or end them.\n  I want to publicly thank the many people who took part of the day to \ntravel to this small community to make their voices heard to Secretary \nGlickman. I ask to include the names of the participants at the \nconclusion of my remarks. I hope the seriousness of the situation \nexperienced by these farmers and their families will be taken into \naccount as these issues are debated in the days and weeks ahead.\n\n  Participants in the Forum With Secretary Glickman at Greenleaf, WI, \n                             July 31, 1995\n\n       Mark Mayer, Frank Dillon, Rodney R.

Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly this \nmorning on a matter of great importance; namely, world population. \nWorld Population Awareness Week will be held this year from October 22-\n29, and is designed to foster awareness of the environmental, economic, \npolitical, and social consequences of rapid worldwide population.\n  Let us reflect a moment on the implications of the current population \ngrowth rate. In 1830, the world's population reached 1 billion. Today, \nthe world's population is nearly 6 billion. Unless something is done, \nworld population in 2020 will reach 8 billion and by 2035 it will reach \n12 billion.\n  Current levels of population growth are unprecedented. This year \nalone, the world's population will grow by almost \n\n[[Page S 15363]]\n100 million people. This is like adding a new country the size of \nNigeria to the world every year, or a city the size of New York City \nevery month. Virtually all this growth takes place in the poorest \ncountries and regions across the world--those who can least afford to \naccommodate such rapid population growth.\n  Rapid population growth is one of the world's most serious problems, \nposing a long-term threat to U.S. national interests in the areas of \nsecurity, trade, and the environment. There are many developing \ncountries in the world which are finally taking steps to institute the \nkind of free market reforms that offer them their best hope for long-\nterm sustainable development. But high population growth rates threaten \ntheir economic development accomplishments.\n  Moreover, the environmental implications of such population growth is \nstartling. A child born today can expect by the year 2000 a world where \nalmost one-half of the world's forests will be gone and one-fifth of \nthe world's plant and animal species will be extinct. Ground water \nsupplies are dwindling; rivers and lakes are fouled with pollutants \nfrom industries, municipalities, and agriculture. Currently, at least \n1.7 billion people, nearly one-third of the planet's population, lack \nan adequate supply of drinking water. The developing world already \nproduces 45 percent of all gases contributing to global warming.\n  Rapid population growth, especially when overlaid with sharp social \nor economic divisions, places great strains on political institutions. \nTo the extent population pressures contribute to weakening economic and \npolitical structures, they adversely affect international stability and \npeace. And this directly affects our own national security interests \naround the world.\n  I am very pleased that the theme of World Population Awareness Week \nthis year is gender equality and the implementation of the Cairo \nProgram of Action, which was approved by more than 180 countries, \nincluding the United States, at the International Conference on \nPopulation and Development last year. This is especially significant \nbecause the goals and objectives of the Cairo Program of Action include \nproviding universal access to family planning information, education, \nand services; as well as eliminating poverty and illiteracy among girls \nand women who are disproportionately denied access to education, \nincreasing women's employment opportunities, reducing infant mortality, \nand eliminating all forms of gender discrimination.\n  Several Governors throughout the United States, from the State of \nWashington to my home State of Maine, have issued proclamations \nrecognizing World Population Awareness Week. I submit for the Record \nthe proclamation of this important event issued by Gov. Angus S. King, \nJr., Governor of the State of Maine.\n  The proclamation follows:\n\n                              Proclamation\n\n       Whereas, world population is currently 5.7 billion and \n     increasing by nearly 100 million each year, with virtually \n     all growth added in the poorest countries and regions--those \n     who can least afford to accommodate current populations let \n     alone massive infusions of humanity; and\n       Whereas, the annual increment to world population is \n     projected to exceed 86 million through the year 2015, will \n     three billion people--the equivalent of the entire world \n     population as recently as 1960--reaching their reproductive \n     years within the next generation; and\n       Whereas, the environmental and economic impacts of this \n     level of growth will almost certainly prevent inhabitants of \n     poorer countries from improving their quality of life, and, \n     at the same time, have deleterious repercussions for the \n     standard of living in more affluent areas; and\n       Whereas, the 1994 International Conference on Population \n     and Development in Cairo, Egypt crafted a 20-year Program of \n     Action for achieving a more equitable balance between the \n     world's population, environment and resources, that was duly \n     approved by 180 nations, including the United States.\n       Now, therefore, I, Angus S. King, Jr., Governor of the \n     State of Maine, do hereby proclaim October 22-29, 1995 as \n     ``World Population Awareness Week'' throughout the State of \n     Maine, and urge all citizens to support the purpose and \n     spirit of the Cairo Program of Action, and call upon all \n     governments and private organizations to do their utmost to \n     implement that document, particularly the goals and \n     objectives therein aimed at providing universal access to \n     family planning information, education and services, as well \n     as the elimination of poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, \n     social disintegration and gender discrimination that have \n     been reinforced by the 1995 United Nations International \n     Conference on Social Development and endorsed by 118 world \n     leaders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15362-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15363-S15364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DEDICATION OF THOMAS J.

Governor Rowland, \n     Senator Lieberman, members of Congress, and distinguished \n     United States senators and former senators who have come \n     today; Chairman Rome, members of the Diplomatic Corps; to all \n     of you who have done anything to make this great day come to \n     pass; to my friend and former colleague, Governor O'Neill, \n     and most of all, to Senator Dodd, Ambassador Dodd, and the \n     Dodd family: I am delighted to be here.\n       I have so many thoughts now. I can't help mentioning one--\n     since President Hartley mentioned the day we had your \n     magnificent women's basketball team there, we also had the \n     UCLA men's team there. You may not remember who UCLA defeated \n     for the national championship--(laughter)--but I do remember \n     that UCONN defeated the University of Tennessee. And that \n     made my life with Al Gore much more bearable. (Laughter.) So \n     I was doubly pleased when UCONN won the national \n     championship. (Applause.)\n       I also did not know until it was stated here at the outset \n     of this ceremony that no sitting President had the privilege \n     of coming to the University of Connecticut before, but they \n     don't know what they missed. I'm glad to be the first, and I \n     know I won't be the last. (Applause.)\n       I also want to pay a special public tribute to the Dodd \n     family for their work on this enterprise, and for their \n     devotion to each other and the memory of Senator Thomas Dodd. \n     If, as so many of us believe, this country rests in the end \n     upon its devotion to freedom and liberty and democracy, and \n     upon the strength of its families, you could hardly find a \n     better example than the Dodd family, not only for their \n     devotion to liberty and democracy, but also for their \n     devotion to family and to the memory of Senator Tom Dodd. It \n     has deeply moved all of us, and we thank you for your \n     example. (Applause.)\n       Tom Dodd spent his life serving America. He demonstrated an \n     extraordinary commitment to the rule of law, beginning with \n     his early days as an FBI agent then federal attorney. He was \n     equally passionate in his opposition to tyranny in all its \n     forms. He fought the tyranny of racism, prosecuting \n     civil rights cases in the South in the 1930s, long before \n     it was popular anywhere in the United States, and helping \n     to shepherd the landmark Civil Rights of 1964 into law. He \n     fought the tyranny of communism throughout his years in \n     elected office. And while he bowed to none in his devotion \n     to freedom, he also stood bravely against those who \n     wrapped themselves in the flag and turned anti-communism \n     into demagoguery.\n       Tom Dodd was in so many ways a man ahead of his time. He \n     was passionate about civil rights, three decades before the \n     civil rights movement changed the face of our nation. In the \n     Senate, he pioneered programs to fight delinquency and to \n     give the young people of our country a chance at a good \n     education and a good job. And that is a task, my fellow \n     Americans, we have not yet finished doing. He saw the dangers \n     of guns and drugs on our streets, and he acted to do \n     something about that. Had we done it in his time, we would \n     not have so much work to do in this time.\n       Tom Dodd's passion for justice and his hatred of oppression \n     came together, as all of you know, most powerfully when he \n     served as America's executive trial counsel at the Nuremburg \n     War Crimes Tribunal. It was the pivotal event of his life. He \n     helped to bring justice to bear against those responsible for \n     the Holocaust, for the acts that redefined our understanding \n     of man's capacity for evil. Through that path-breaking work, \n     he and his fellow jurists pushed one step forward the \n     historic effort to bring the crimes of war under the sanction \n     of law.\n       Senator Dodd left many good works and reminders of his \n     achievement. Some bear his name--the children who have \n     followed in his steps and served the public, who carried \n     forward his ardent support for an American foreign policy \n     that stands for democracy and freedom, who maintain his \n     commitment to social justice, to strong communities and \n     strong families. They have also upheld their father's \n     tradition of loyalty. And as one of the chief beneficiaries \n     of that lesson, let me \n\n[[Page S 15364]]\n     say that I am grateful for it, and again, grateful for its expression \n     in this remarkable project which will help the people of \n     Connecticut and the United States to understand their \n     history.\n       I am delighted that this center will bear the Dodd name \n     because it is fitting that a library, a place that keeps and \n     honors books and records, will honor Tom Dodd's service, his \n     passion for justice and his hatred of tyranny. Where books \n     are preserved, studied and revered, human beings will also be \n     treated with respect and dignity, and liberty will be \n     strengthened.\n       Dedicating this research center today, we remember that \n     when the Nazis came to power, one of the very first things \n     they did was burn books they deemed subversive. The road to \n     tyranny, we must never forget, begins with the destruction of \n     the truth.\n       In the darkest days of the war, President Roosevelt, with \n     those awful bonfires fresh in his memory, reflected upon how \n     the free pursuit of knowledge protects our liberty. And he \n     put it well when he called books ``the weapons for man's \n     freedom.'' I am glad that Tom Dodd will be remembered here, \n     in this place, in this building, with this center, in the \n     state he loved, with the very best arsenal for the freedom he \n     fought to defend his entire life.\n       Thank you very much. (Applause.)\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 Remarks of Senator Christopher J. Dodd\n\n       Mr. President, Governor Rowland, President Hartley, \n     colleagues distinguished guests, members of my family, \n     friends: On behalf of my family--allow me to express my \n     thanks to you, Mr. President, for your presence here today. \n     You honor my father, my family, my State and our University. \n     You are the first sitting American President to ever visit \n     this University in the 114 year history of this institution, \n     we are grateful.\n       We are grateful as well to those of you with whom my father \n     worked over the years--his colleagues--his staff--his \n     constituency and friends for being here to join with us in \n     the celebration of his life of public service.\n       For nearly 40 years my father served his State and Nation. \n     It was a full life--a life of engagement with the great \n     issues of his time.\n       We are here to dedicate a new home for his papers and \n     artifacts of the past. In so doing, we preserve delicate \n     fragments of history which this and future generations should \n     find instructive.\n       We are also here today to remember the achievements of \n     those who came before us--who made and recorded the history \n     on which our present world is built. My father is one such \n     person. Today we commemorate--and celebrate--his faith, his \n     love of country, and his life of service.\n       Today we recall not only my father's accomplishments, but \n     the achievements of his generation. It is now 50 years since \n     the end of World War II, a war which tore apart a western \n     civilization. It is 50 years since thousands of young \n     Americans fought and died to defend tyranny. It is 50 years \n     since the effort to rebuild that civilization began with the \n     Nuremberg Trials--truly the trial of the century.\n       Many recall the stern justice rendered at Nuremberg against \n     those who committed the atrocities of Nazism. But we should \n     also remember that 3 of the accused at Nuremberg were \n     acquitted. In those verdicts of acquittal, as well as in the \n     verdicts of guilt, the United States and her allies helped to \n     reassure the world that justice could, indeed, would prevail \n     over evil and chaos.\n       After Nuremberg, my father's generation rebuilt Europe and \n     Asia. The Marshall Plan, NATO, the United Nations--these were \n     extraordinary acts of collective sacrifice, vision, and \n     political courage in the fact of significant opposition here \n     at home.\n       In remembering the achievements of that generation, it is \n     fitting that we here today are joined by President Bill \n     Clinton. In 1995, President Clinton has not forgotten the \n     lessons of 1945.\n       Like my father's generation, Mr. President, you understand \n     that no nation which proclaims the virtue of freedom can \n     ignore the deprivation of others.\n       Mr. President, you understand that though the Soviet Empire \n     no longer threatens our world, the job of securing the peace \n     is still far from complete.\n       Over the past 2\\1/2\\ years you have demonstrated over and \n     over and over again the role we must play in the cause of \n     freedom and justice.\n       Ireland, Haiti, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, and \n     most recently, in Bosnia, have profitted from our principled, \n     patient insistence that all men and women have a right to \n     shape their own destiny.\n       At the same time, there remain many parts of the world that \n     still desperately need our engagement and example.\n       Abroad and at home, you Mr. President, carry within your \n     heart the same wise and generous spirit that guided the \n     generation of my father. You have proven yourself to be a \n     worthy inheritor of their unbending faith in a future where \n     people can live not in fear but with hope. For that, Mr. \n     President, you have earned our everlasting gratitude.\n       On behalf of the Dodd family, the University of \n     Connecticut, and our Constitution State, we thank you for \n     honoring us with your presence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15363-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15364-S15365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JOHNETTA MARSHALL\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nKentuckian who for many years has displayed a great deal of courage in \nstanding up for what she believes. Louisville native Ms. Johnetta \nMarshall has traveled the world to fight for the rights of others, and \nnow she's being recognized here at home as the new president of the \nNational Older Women's League, a not-for-profit organization that \npromotes health, housing, and Social Security issues for women over the \nage of 50.\n  Recently, Ms. Marshall traveled to China to march for equality of the \nsexes at the United Nation's Fourth World Conference of Women. While \nthat trip ended peacefully, some of her journeys have taken a violent \nturn. One such incident occurred in the Deep South in the late 1950's \nwhen Ms. Marshall was pelted with rocks while marching for civil \nrights. She recently recounted in a story for Louisville's Courier-\nJournal, that while in Meridian, Mississippi, ``we had to go in the \nback way at hotels and ride the freight elevator. They made us a dining \nroom in the bedroom rather than have us eat with the rest of the \nguests.'' While this kind of treatment may have disparaged some, it \ngave Ms. Marshall a reason to continue her fight for civil rights.\n  One of the highlights of Ms. Marshall's career came in March of this \nyear, when she was named president of the Older Women's League. \nMarshall, who served as a member of the board of directors for 6 years, \nis truly dedicated to the cause and she hopes to put the organization \nin the public spotlight during her tenure as president. The executive \ndirector of the Older Women's League, Deborah Briceland-Betts, says \nmembers of the group are delighted that Marshall is now leading them. \nAnd they hope she will continue her extraordinary commitment to find \ncreative and effective ways to improve the lives of midlife and older \nwomen and their families.\n  Not only is Ms. Marshall a national leader in the fights for the \nrights of others, she also worked on behalf of interests in the \nBluegrass State. For nearly 20 years, Ms. Marshall was executive \ndirector of Louisville's Opportunities Industrialization Centers, Inc., \nwhich was responsible for training welfare recipients for jobs. She \nalso served as regional coordinator of the Prichard Committee for \nAcademic Excellence in Lexington, and during that time she worked hard \nto promote education reform. She was also the director of Senior \nServices, Inc., executive director of Kentucky's Opportunities \nIndustrialization Center, past president of the Louisville Section of \nthe National Council of Negro Women, and was the first African American \nwoman chair of the March of Dimes' Kentuckiana chapter. And in the \n1960's and 1970's, she investigated racism in Ohio, Tennessee, and \nKentucky as a member of the Presbyterian Church task force.\n  As you can tell from her list of accomplishments, Ms. Marshall has \nhad a long and distinguished career, and it does not look like it will \nslow down anytime soon. Even with the demanding pace of her public \nadvocacy, she still always found time for her real love, her six \nchildren whom she successfully raised as a single mother.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to \nthis outstanding Kentuckian. I also ask that an article from the \nOctober 10 Courier-Journal be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n       [From the Courier-Journal, Louisville, KY, Oct. 10, 1995]\n\nA Pioneering Spirit--Louisville Native Has Marched in the South and in \n                       China for Rights of Others\n\n                         (By Lawrence Muhammad)\n\n       Johnetta Marshall won't tell her age but ``pioneer'' is \n     definitely a title that fits her.\n       The Louisville native was pelted with rocks while marching \n     for civil rights in the Deep South in the late 1950s and \n     early '60s. More recently, she marched for sex equality under \n     the watchful eyes of government police at the United Nation's \n     Fourth World Conference of Women in China.\n       In the '60s, in Meridian, Miss., she recalled, ``we had to \n     go in the back way at hotels and ride the freight elevator. \n     They made us a dining room in the bedroom rather than have us \n     eat with the rest of the guests.''\n       Decades later, Marshall attended the China conference as \n     the new president of the Washington, D.C.-based Older Women's \n     League. Carrying a banner and chanting, she and other \n     conferees marched onto the conference grounds and into \n     workshops.\n\n[[Page S 15365]]\n\n       Although no one in her group had trouble with Chinese \n     authorities, she said, ``there were people with video \n     cameras. . . . We wanted them to see the banner. But there \n     was no harassment.''\n       Marshall, who lives in Jeffersontown, was named president \n     of the Older Women's League in March. It's a nationwide, not-\n     for-profit organization that promotes health, housing and \n     Social Security issues for women over the age of 50.\n       The appointment caps a career of distinguished service.\n       For nearly 20 years until it closed in 1988, Marshall was \n     executive director of Louisville's Opportunities \n     Industrialization Centers Inc., once a nationwide non-profit \n     group with headquarters in Philadelphia that trained welfare \n     recipients for jobs.\n       She was also the first chairman of the Kentucky Minority \n     AIDS Council.\n       Sam Robinson, president of the Lincoln Foundation and also \n     a founding member of the AIDS council, recalled suggesting \n     Marshall to the group because of her work with the National \n     Council of Negro Women and the National Association for the \n     Advancement of Colored People. ``And when we were ready to \n     elect officers, everybody looked to her for leadership,'' \n     Robinson said.\n       Lead she has, also serving stints as a Presbyterian Church \n     organizer, propagating racial fairness among Southern members \n     during the 1960s and '70s; as director of Senior Services \n     Inc. in Louisville; as past president of the National Council \n     of Negro Women's Louisville section; and as the first \n     African-American woman to chair the March of Dimes' \n     Kentuckiana chapter, among other posts.\n       Last month in China, Marshall led a 32-member delegation to \n     the Non-governmental Organizations Forum on Women in Huairou. \n     It was an unofficial gathering held in conjunction with the \n     U.N. conference in Beijing.\n       Marshall and her group, co-sponsored by the American \n     Society on Aging, met officials of the China National \n     Committee on Aging and China Research Center on Aging and \n     toured hospitals and welfare homes for the elderly. It was an \n     effort to promote concerns of older women that past world \n     forums had inadequately addressed, Marshall said.\n       For example, women over 65 are disproportionately poor, \n     spend more on home repairs, more frequently develop breast \n     cancer and suffer more chronic ailments than older men, \n     according to an Older Women's League study done in 1993.\n       The study also showed 60 percent of married women are \n     widowed and living alone by 75, and 30 percent require home \n     care, double the percentage for men.\n       ``Back in the civil-rights days, women were suffering, and \n     there have been some improvements, but not enough,'' Marshall \n     said. ``Women can work side by side with men, and maybe have \n     better skills, but men get more pay. And if you happen to be \n     an older women, you are counted out completely.''\n       Marshall clearly would not be counted out. Leading the \n     local Opportunities Industrialization Center, she smashed the \n     gender barrier in the early 1980s to head the group's \n     executive directors association, a male-dominated network of \n     about 85 OIC insiders.\n       ``For Johnetta to run for that position, and win it, was \n     akin to Shannon Faulkner entering The Citadel,'' said Gene \n     Blue, president of the Phoenix, Ariz., OIC. ``She became a \n     spokes-person who accompanied the founder, Dr. Leon Sullivan, \n     at congressional hearings. She had to overcome significant \n     male egos to preside over all these dudes at meetings and \n     workshops, which usually got loud and emotional.''\n       Blue recalled one particular meeting, where ``one of the \n     most vociferous, a senior executive from a major city, had \n     the floor and was waxing eloquent. Finally Johnetta, without \n     even raising her voice, said firmly, `OK, that's enough. Sit \n     down.' Now, it took most of us by surprise that she would \n     tell this guy to shut up. But she did, and he sat down.''\n       Marshall is widely know as a nurturer too. She grew up in \n     Louisville's Limerick neighborhood, daughter of concrete \n     finisher John Marshall who died when she was 10, and Emma \n     Marshall, who supported the family with domestic work. \n     Marshall had wanted to be a surgeon, but being black and \n     female in the segregated 1930s and '40s, it was difficult to \n     aspire to so lofty a vocation.\n       A divorcee, she raised six children on her own, has four \n     grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. The fruits of her \n     labors are plentiful among her children: Samuel is a San \n     Francisco stockbroker; Charles, a geriatric doctor in Los \n     Angeles; and John, a supervisor of correctional officers in \n     Los Angeles County, Glenna is a Louisville graphic artist; \n     Marilyn, a bookkeeper in Atlanta; and Jo, a computer systems \n     engineer in Louisville.\n       Marshall also served as a role model for scores of other \n     people's children at the Presbyterian Community Center at 760 \n     S. Hancock St.\n       ``She'd ask questions like, `How are you doing at home? How \n     are you doing at school?' '' said Ernest ``Camp'' Edwards, \n     63, an associate executive presbyter for the Presbytery of \n     Louisville. ``I was sort of mischievous, throwing stuff on \n     the floor and blaming somebody else, so she always preached \n     that I should be accountable for my own behavior and not \n     blame others.\n       ``That really stuck with me over the years,'' Edwards said. \n     ``She has a kind of presence and talks to you so that it \n     makes a difference. I'm a social worker by profession, and, \n     because of her, I decided to work with people. She was a \n     `significant other.' and I decided I could be a significant \n     other.''\n       Charles Hammond, the 52-year-old mayor of Fairfield, \n     Calif., first met Marshall at the community center when he \n     was 14. It was ``where we virtually lived after we got out of \n     school, and she was one of our youth directors. They \n     basically kicked our behinds and kept us in line. We'd have \n     our dances and she'd give us rules--no cursing, no smoking, \n     treat the ladies like ladies * * * But she always had time \n     for us. There was never a question that went unanswered. And \n     that's what we admired about her. Seven days a week, any time \n     you looked around, there she was, just like our mothers.''\n\n\n               Johnetta Marshall's advice for single moms\n\n       Johnetta Marshall successfully raised six children along. \n     Some now have families of their own, and all pursue rewarding \n     careers.\n       ``It wasn't easy then,'' said Marshall, ``and even though \n     women have more advantages now, it is lots more difficult.''\n       She offered this advice for today's single mothers: \n     ``Recognize that you are only one person, that you can never \n     by a mother and a father. Just be the best role model you \n     can.\n       ``As the mother, you instill in your children some ideals \n     by the way you live. Always be honest and frank with the \n     children. Don't let them think you can give them the moon \n     when you can only give them a piece of the earth.\n       ``And don't give up. You can do it.''\n\n\n                     About the Older Women's League\n\n       Founded in 1980, the Washington, D.C.-based Older Women's \n     League promotes issues of health care, Social Security and \n     housing for women over 50.\n       There are 20,000 members nationwide and chapters in every \n     state.\n       Annual dues start at $15; sterling, silver and platinum \n     memberships also are available.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15364-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH WEEK\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in honor of National School Lunch \nWeek I want to talk about one of the great public policy success \nstories of this century--the National School Lunch Program. Passed by \nCongress and established by President Truman in 1946, this program by \nlaw has the mission ``to safeguard the health and well-being of the \nNation's children.'' By fighting hunger and promoting good nutrition \namong children, we can help them grow and mature into healthy, \nproductive adults.\n  The program has been a resounding success in meeting this mission. \nAny parent or teacher can tell you that a hungry child cannot learn. \nMore and more scientific evidence has made it clear that hunger and \nmalnutrition can undermine a child's progress in school. Hunger remains \na serious problem in this country, and school meals are an important \npart of the effort to fight it.\n  Today, the National School Lunch Program serves over 25 million \nstudents in 92,000 schools across the country. More than 90 percent of \nall public schools participate in the program. For almost 50 years, it \nhas provided complete and nourishing meals to children, nearly half of \nthem from low-income families. The school lunch program has reduced \nmalnutrition and improved the health and well-being of children.\n  Since 1946, we have learned a great deal about the relationship \nbetween diet and health. We have learned that it is not enough to \nprovide children with calories. They need the right kinds of food to \nkeep them healthy. Too much fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium \ncan increase the risk of heart disease and some forms of cancer. Low-\nincome and minority groups are at greatest risk for those problems. \nThose risks begin in childhood. Good eating habits established in \nchildhood are critical to staying healthy throughout one's life. I am \nvery proud of the bipartisan legislation we passed last year to improve \nthe nutritional content of school meals.\n  Mr. President, let me sum up by reiterating how important these \nprograms have been, and how important they are today. Just as they were \n50 years ago, school meals remain a critical part of this country's \neffort to promote our most precious resource--the health and well-being \nof our children. We have worked hard to build a program that is ready \nto meet its statutory health mission well into the 21st century. As we \nconsider proposals to block-grant or cut these programs, let us not \nforget how successful they have been in the past and how important it \nis to maintain them at the Federal level to fulfill our national \nresponsibility to fight hunger and promote good nutrition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15365-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S 15366]]\n\n\n                            MEREDITH MILLER\n\n Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues \nthe happy news that the Roger Williams National Memorial is celebrating \nthe 30th anniversary of its authorization.\n  I want to take this chance to tell you about Roger Williams, a \nFounding Father that you will not encounter here, except in the rotunda \nof the Capitol. He was the founder of Rhode Island and a champion of \nDemocracy and religious liberty.\n  There is no national memorial to Roger Williams here, unlike the \nmonuments to other national heroes like Washington, Jefferson, and \nLincoln. Our national memorial is in Rhode Island, where he lived and \nleft us a philosophical legacy of incomparable worth.\n  Roger Williams was banished for his beliefs from the Massachusetts \nBay Colony in 1635, but survived both banishment and subsequent efforts \nto take over the settlement he named Providence.\n  ``The air of the country is sharp,'' Roger Williams said of \nProvidence, ``the rocks many, the trees innumerable, the grass little, \nthe winter cold, the summer hot, the gnats in summer biting, the wolves \nat night howling.''\n  Thirteen householders in the population of 32 in the first year \nformed the first genuine democracy--also the first church-divorced and \nconscience-free community--in modern history.\n  I cannot emphasize enough how unique and utopian the vision of Roger \nWilliams was in the midst of the 17th century. He was almost alone in \nbelieving that all citizens should be free to worship as their \nconscience dictated.\n  Roger Williams was a determined and dedicated man. In 1672, when he \nwas nearly 70, he rowed all day to reach Newport for a 4-day debate \nwith three Quaker orators. Both his settlement and his ideas have \nsurvived and prospered.\n  For most of his life, Roger Williams was a deeply religious man. Even \nwithout a church to call his own, his ideas flourished in Providence \nand remain alive today.\n  Documents, such as our Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence \ncan be traced directly back to the hardfought freedoms earned by Roger \nWilliams and his followers.\n  I encourage my colleagues to visit the statue of Roger Williams in \nthe Rotunda of the Capitol. When you do, remember that even the \nprinciples of democracy and religious liberty did not come easily. \nRoger Williams gave them form and substance more than 350 years ago.\n  These principles also founded the basis of our belief that all people \nare created with equal rights and should not be denied opportunities to \nsucceed because of their race, gender, or religion.\n  I sponsored the Senate legislation that authorized the creation of \nthe Roger Williams National Memorial and I have watched it take shape \non the site of his original settlement in Providence, RI.\n  This anniversary comes at an important time. One purpose of the \nmemorial is to emphasize the linked principles of tolerance and \nfreedom. As recent events have demonstrated, we need to focus on these \nprinciples.\n  I am delighted to share with my colleagues today the news that the \nNational Park Service is planning new initiatives to strengthen the \nimpact of the Roger Williams National Memorial and its vital message.\n  If you have any doubts about the significance of Roger Williams in \nour history, consider how his philosophy has resonated through our \nother Founding Fathers and found its way into our most sacred \ndocuments.\n  Just a few examples, culled from his writings, should help to sound \nhis call for freedom:\n  ``The sovereign, original, and foundation of civil power lies in the \nPeople.''--The Bloody Tenent of Persecution for Conscience Discussed \n(1644).\n  ``The civil state is humbly to be implored to provide in their high \nwisdom for security of all the respective consciences.''--The Hireling \nMinistry None of Christs\n  ``No person in this colony shall be molested or questioned for the \nmatters of his conscience to God, so he be loyal and keep the civil \npeace.''--Letter to Major John Mason (1670)\n  ``And having in a sence of God's merciful providence unto me in my \ndistresse called the place Providence, I desired it might be a shelter \nfor persons distressed for conscience.''--Early Records of Providence\n  We owe a tremendous debt to Roger Williams as the first champion of \ntrue religious freedom and for translating principles of democracy and \ntolerance from concepts into substance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15366-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15366-S15367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SPECIAL INTERESTS HIT STUDENT LOANS\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, Roger Flaherty, now an editor at the \nChicago Sun-Times, has followed the Federal student loan program for a \nnumber of years. I would urge my colleagues to consider what he has to \nsay about the role of special interests in the current budget debate.\n  I ask that an article that appeared in the Chicago Sun-Times on \nSeptember 27, 1995, be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Sept. 27, 1995]\n\n           Special Interests Hit Direct Loan Program Head-on\n\n                          (By Roger Flaherty)\n\n       When I was younger, I walked side by side one day with \n     Wilbur Mills, the Arkansas Democrat then always described as \n     ``chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee,'' \n     asking about tax reform. In a moment of candor, he said, ``If \n     you want to reform the tax system, you've got to end all \n     deductions.''\n       Why not do it? I asked. Mills responded with a dismissive \n     look--sort of sneer and condescension--and turned to another \n     reporter. So I learned that Washington people don't do as \n     they think or say. We should keep that in mind as the \n     Congress plows into a fall agenda that promises more moves to \n     ``get government off our backs.''\n       Like tax deductions, government-run programs are bad until \n     they are good for you or your friends. You usually hear this \n     truism about defense contracts and farm subsidies.\n       But there's one I've observed closely in recent years--the \n     student loan program. Several years ago, along with Sun-Times \n     reporter Leon Pitt, I uncovered enormous abuses by for-profit \n     trade schools that were using student loans like government \n     vouchers they could squander any way they chose. They \n     enrolled students into programs they were unable to complete \n     or that were so poor in quality as to be useless. When \n     students dropped out, within hours sometimes, the schools \n     kept the loan money in violation of the law. The United \n     States was being defrauded of billions of dollars.\n       But when reformers tried to tighten loan rules, school \n     industry lobbyists fought them, arguing the reforms were an \n     assault on free enterprise. It was a strange argument, \n     considering that these schools generally received more than \n     90 percent of their income from government loans and grants.\n       Well, that odd assertion is again being made in Congress, \n     where conservative Republicans under the guise of getting \n     government off our backs are attacking the direct student \n     loan program. The program, which is scheduled to be phased in \n     over several years, operates successfully at several Illinois \n     institutions, including the University of Illinois. The \n     program allows loans to be made directly from the federal \n     treasury through college financial aid offices.\n       This is bad, congressional opponents say, because it \n     furthers big government and hurts \n\n[[Page S 15367]]\n     business. How ingenuous can you get? Under the old loan system still \n     being used by most schools, a student applies to a bank for a \n     loan. Checking his or her qualifications is a loan guarantee \n     agency, commonly run by state governments, but also by \n     private enterprise. The agencies then issue a guarantee of \n     repayment to the banks. The federal government pays banks \n     subsidies to forgive part of the interest payments and pays \n     fees to the guarantee agencies for their services.\n       If a student defaults on a loan, the bank is reimbursed--\n     making student loans the safest loans a bank can make. Loan \n     guarantee agencies are paid fees to hound defaulters. Is this \n     not big government? Can this be free enterprise?\n       There's more. The old system created a secondary loan \n     business, including the huge public-private Sallie Mae \n     association based in Washington, and smaller ones, like one \n     operated by the Illinois Student Assistance Commission. These \n     groups make money by buying loans from banks and packaging \n     them in large blocks for resale. They were created by \n     Congress and the states to free money for more student loans, \n     but as was said of some missionaries to Hawaii, Sallie Mae \n     and its emulators came to do good and ended up doing well. \n     They are big businesses with highly paid executives.\n       The direct loan program, a plan advanced by Sen. Paul Simon \n     (D-Makanda), eliminated this entire pyramid. No government \n     subsidy or risk-free lending for banks, no government \n     payments to loan-guarantee agencies, no Sallie Maes with \n     executives paid from profits extracted from government loan \n     subsidies.\n       But odds are increasing that Congress this fall will stop \n     the direct loan program in its tracks, led by the same people \n     who claim they are trying to get government off our backs. \n     And so far, it seems to be going down like a cold, sweet Coke \n     on a hot summer's day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15366-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL RIGHT TO WORK ACT\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to add my name as a \ncosponsor to S. 581, the National Right to Work Act. As a strong \nsupporter of the right to work, I feel this legislation is vital.\n  We have spent the first part of this Congress fighting for freedom--\nthe freedom from Government intervention, the freedom of speech, the \nfreedom to choose your health care and even the freedom to succeed. \nThis bill, though it does not add a single letter to Federal law, \nguarantees the freedom to work free of union imposition.\n  Why is this important? Americans have always been independent. No \nmatter where they came from, they came to America to see their hard \nwork pay off. And they are not afraid of hard work. This is especially \ntrue of Montanans.\n  But when a worker is forced to pay union dues in order to get a job \nor keep a job, they have lost part of their freedom. They may get some \nbenefits from joining a union--I am not saying there is no role for \nunions here--but they lose the freedom to choose.\n  Mr. President, Congress created the law which allows union officials \nto force dues in any State back in 1935. Now we need to correct that. \nAll we need to do is to repeal that portion of the National Labor \nRelations Act [NLRA] which authorizes the imposition of forced union \ndues contracts on employees.\n  Nearly every poll taken on this issue over the last few decades has \nshown that about 8 out of 10 Americans are opposed to forcing workers \nto pay union dues. It is tough to get 8 out of 10 Americans to agree on \nanything. I think this is a call for action.\n  And if you look at job creation in States that have implemented right \nto work laws, it is hard to ignore the results. Hundreds of thousands \nof manufacturing jobs have been created in right-to-work States. And in \nforced-unionism States, hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost.\n  I have supported this bill in the past and I truly believe that this \nis the year to finally make this change. Working men and women in \nMontana want the freedom to work and they are not alone. I urge my \ncolleagues to listen to what their constituents are saying as well. If \nyou do, you will feel compelled to join me and the other cosponsors in \nsupporting the National Right to Work Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15367-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15367-S15368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUED FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR AMERICORP\n\n Mr. PELL. Mr. President, this month marks the start of a new \nclass of AmeriCorps members who are dedicated to serving this Nation. \nAs AmeriCorps celebrates its first successful year and the new class \nbegins its service, I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate \nmy support for continued Federal funding of this important national \nservice initiative.\n  Over the past year, 20,000 AmeriCorps members worked in schools, \nhospitals, national parks, and law enforcement organizations to meet \nthe most crucial needs of individual communities. AmeriCorps clearly \nhelps to provide a more promising future for Americans by expanding \neducational opportunities for the young whole simultaneously improving \nthe public services in hundreds of communities.\n  In my own State of Rhode Island, AmeriCorps has been particularly \nsuccessful due to the efforts of Lawrence K. Fish, chairman of the \nRhode Island Commission for National and Community Service. Mr. Fish \nchallenged higher education institutions in Rhode Island to grant \nscholarships to AmeriCorps members. Many of our colleges and \nuniversities answered Mr. Fish's challenge and have begun lending their \nsupport in the form of college scholarships. His endeavor to expand \nAmeriCorps has offered more students access to an otherwise \nunaffordable education. Mr. Fish's exemplary work in Rhode Island \nserves as the quintessential example of building the natural bridge \nbetween public service and educational opportunities. In this regard, I \nask that an opinion editorial by Lawrence Fish from the Providence \nJournal of October 11 be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n           [From the Providence (RI) Journal, Oct. 11, 1995]\n\n                      The Challenge of AmeriCorps\n\n                         (By Lawrence K. Fish)\n\n       Not surprisingly, the debate in Washington over continued \n     funding of the Corporation for National Service has become \n     laser-focused on the politics of embarrassing President \n     Clinton, and not on the people for whom AmeriCorps has been a \n     ringing success.\n       And the reason is not surprising. It is that Washington, to \n     the frustration of just about everyone outside the District \n     of Columbia, just can't resist playing an inside-the-Beltway \n     version of Gotcha! From the politicians to the pundits to the \n     press, the emphasis remains on the politics of issues, not on \n     the substance of issues or their impact on real people.\n       For whom has AmeriCorps been successful? It's been a \n     success here in Rhode Island to the 250 AmeriCorps members \n     who have signed up for this domestic Peace Corps and whose \n     efforts, mostly in education, have made better, dramatically \n     better, the lives of thousands of our neighbors. Giver and \n     receiver have been enriched by the effort, and for that, \n     Rhode Island is a better place.\n       Let me try to explain why AmeriCorps' success here in Rhode \n     Island ought to serve as a model for programs in the 49 other \n     states, and why that success and our promise for the future \n     stand as far more compelling points in the debate than \n     political oneupmanship.\n       AmeriCorps members have served in cities and towns from \n     Woonsocket to Newport, bringing with them a wealth of desire, \n     experience and cultural diversity. They have gotten results--\n     good results that are measurable. You can see the results on \n     paper and you can see them on the faces of children getting \n     their first ``A's'' and in adults reading for the first time.\n       Rhode Island's AmeriCorps program has been very \n     successful--and has been recognized as such. For the second \n     straight year, after a very competitive process that pitted \n     us against 49 other states, we received more AmeriCorps \n     funding on a per capita basis than any other state. In \n     this our second year Rhode Island will field 250 \n     AmeriCorps members in eight programs that will touch the \n     lives of thousands of our neighbors. Once again, they will \n     work predominantly in education, because that's where many \n     believe the greatest need is.\n       Linking public service and education, we approached the \n     leaders of the state's colleges, universities and technical \n     schools to see if they would accept our AmeriCorps challenge \n     to inaugurate a public-private partnership from which they \n     will get the lessons of service and commitment from \n     AmeriCorps veterans and to which they will provide a quality \n     education.\n       The Rev. Philip Smith of Providence College was the first \n     to meet the challenge, and Vartan Gregorian of Brown was \n     close behind. They were followed almost immediately by our \n     other higher-education leaders--Bob Carothers of URI, Sister \n     Therese Antone of Salve Regina, Bill Trueheart of Bryant, \n     Roger Mandle of RISD, Jack Yena of Johnson and Wales and Ed \n     Liston of CCRI. I mention them to dramatize that AmeriCorps \n     runs cost-effective, successful, nonpartisan programs.\n       I accompanied the presidents of seven of the state's public \n     and private colleges and universities to Washington for \n     meetings on Capitol Hill and in the White House. There we \n     outlined the Rhode Island Challenge to \n\n[[Page S 15368]]\n     Higher Education, a challenge to provide scholarships to AmeriCorps \n     members that complement the stipends they receive for their \n     year of service. The result is a win/win for both sides: \n     Higher education gets the kind of committed students who are \n     potential campus leaders; and AmeriCorps members pass through \n     another gateway to opportunity.\n       The foundation for the Rhode Island Challenge to Higher \n     Education was laid a year ago. Rhode Island's bipartisan \n     congressional delegation, each member of which played a role \n     in the passage of the legislation that brought about \n     AmeriCorps, joined other dignitaries at Slater Junior High \n     School in Pawtucket in AmeriCorps's debut. The setting, a \n     junior high school in the heart of one of our older, \n     struggling cities, provided a fitting backdrop for the Rhode \n     Island AmeriCorps members and the educational programs they \n     would serve.\n       In the year since, AmeriCorps members have farmed out \n     across the state, serving as teachers' assistants in public \n     schools, tutors in after-school mentoring programs, and \n     teaching English as a Second Language and GED classes to \n     adults. And they've had an impact, all because they are 100 \n     percent behind keeping their end of a bargain to make \n     AmeriCorps work the way in which Congress and the President \n     intended.\n       Rhode Islanders would have been proud to have joined me and \n     some of the presidents in the White House Cabinet Room \n     recently when we introduced the Rhode Island Challenge to \n     Higher Education to President Clinton. From the smallest \n     state to the other 49 came the challenge for their colleges \n     and universities to match our commitment of scholarships to \n     AmeriCorps members.\n       Our hope, and that of AmeriCorps members around the country \n     and others committed to public service, is that our Challenge \n     to Higher Education can help overcome the cynicism that has \n     come to mark the debate in Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15367-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

The plaintiff developer responded to the \nGovernment's request for proposals by offering to build the SEC a new \nheadquarters building in Silver Spring, MD. The plaintiff alleges in \nthis lawsuit that the Government violated procurement law in connection \nwith the SEC headquarters procurement.\n  The Government has determined that the group of individuals who may \nhave relevant information about this case includes two employees on \nSenator Sarbanes' staff. In addition to his interest in this matter \narising out of the SEC's potential selection of a site in Maryland for \nits headquarters building, Senator Sarbanes is the ranking minority \nmember of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, which \nhas oversight jurisdiction over the SEC.\n  Senator Sarbanes would like the Senate to authorize the employees in \nhis office to testify in response to the Government's request. This \nresolution would authorize them to testify with representation by the \nSenate legal counsel.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any \nstatements relating to the resolution appear at the appropriate place \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Without \nobjection, the preamble is agreed to.\n  So the resolution (S. Res. 186) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S.

I will just say this.\n  I think, for the first time, the President of the United States, \nPresident Clinton, indicated today that he was prepared to negotiate \nwith the leaders of the Congress concerning a balanced budget in 7 \nyears. It is the first time he suggested 7 years. He also mentioned \ncapital gains, taxes, and other matters. That may be the beginning, at \nleast a glimmer of hope that we might be able to come together in some \nnegotiation with the President of the United States, myself, and the \nSpeaker of the House, Speaker Gingrich. And I hope that is a sincere \noffer by the President of the United States, that we can properly \npursue it at the appropriate time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/19/senate-section/article/S15369-6", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
