The clerk will report the bill.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1977) making appropriations for the Department \n     of the Interior and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 1996, and for other purposes.\n       Pending:\n       Domenici amendment No. 2296, to restore funding for \n     programs within the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 5 minutes of the 15 minutes that I have to the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain].\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the proposed cuts we are talking about \nwill devastate Indian country. They strike at reservation services and \nreservation programs. They strike at Indian families and individual \nhouseholds. They strike at the practical ability of tribal governments \nto govern.\n  Let me quote from a letter I received from the Quinault Indian Tribe \nin Washington State, regarding the proposed cuts in H.R. 1977:\n\n       These provisions . . . will mark the beginning of a new era \n     of broken promises and hostility toward Indian nations which \n     is unbecoming to the Senate and to a great Nation like the \n     United States.\n\n  I would like my colleagues to understand the practical effect on just \nthree tribes of these cuts.\n  The Pine Ridge Reservation of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, located in the \npoorest county in our country, a place 10,000 members of the Oglala \nSioux Tribe call home. Nearly 67 percent of its residents live in \npoverty, compared to the national average of 13 percent. Nearly one-\nthird of the people living on the reservation are unemployed. The \nmedian income of households and families on the Pine Ridge Reservation \nis \n\n[[Page S11970]]\nunder $11,000, which is less than one-third the national average for \nAmerican households and families.\n  The Oglala Sioux Tribe had an $8,191,000 tribal priority allocation \nbase of funding in fiscal year 1995. Under this cut, they would \ndirectly reduce the Oglala Sioux funding base to $5,996,000, a $2 \nmillion cut.\n  In the case of the Quileute Tribe in Washington, they would receive a \ncut from $547,000, to $393,000. I might mention that nearly 90 percent \nof the Quileute Tribe families with children under the age of 6 are \nliving in poverty, and one out of three are unemployed.\n  The San Carlos Apache Tribe would receive a cut of some $1.6 million \nout of a $6 million tribal priority. And this is what the United States \nmeant when we promised the San Carlos Apache in a solemn treaty that we \nwould legislate and act to secure their permanent prosperity.\n  Mr. President, let me quote the respected jurist, U.S. Supreme Court \nJustice Hugo Black, who addressed this Nation's treatment of American \nIndians in his dissent in the case called F.P.C. versus Tuscarora:\n\n       It may be hard for us to understand why these Indians cling \n     so tenaciously to their lands and traditional tribal way of \n     life . . . the lands of their reservation are [not] the most \n     fertile, [nor] the landscape the most beautiful, [nor are] \n     their homes the most splendid specimens of architecture. But \n     this is their home--their ancestral home. There, they, their \n     children, and their forebears were born. They, too, have \n     their memories and their loves. . . . There may be instances \n     in which Congress has broken faith with the Indians. . . . I \n     regret that [we will] . . . break faith with this dependent \n     people. Great nations, like great men, should keep their \n     word.\n\n  Mr. President, we have broken our bond with these people. We have \ndenied them the full benefits derived from their lands and resources. \nWe have denied them authority over their own affairs. And under this \nbill, we would deny them the funds they desperately need to address the \nwidespread poverty and hopelessness that are a part of everyday life on \nthe reservation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time for Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 3 minutes to Senator Inouye.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I have only a few observations to add to \nthe other statements that have been made by the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee and the chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Last evening, the chairman of the Interior Subcommittee informed the \nMembers of this body that the policy which guided the subcommittee's \naction in distributing 45.6 percent of the reductions in the Interior \nDepartment's budget to the Bureau of Indian Affairs is one that is \naimed at speeding up the process of Indian self-determination and self-\ngovernance by sharply reducing funds that go directly to tribal \ngovernments for the provision of basic government services for \nreservation citizens--services such as fire protection, law \nenforcement, the assurance of health and safety, and the protection of \nthe general welfare of tribal communities.\n  Our colleagues will recognize that this initiative is not dissimilar \nfrom that which is being proposed in the area of welfare reform--which \nis the idea of moving responsibilities out of the Federal Government \nand placing those responsibilities closest to the people--empowering \nlocal communities to address the challenges which confront citizens at \nthat level.\n  But, Mr. President, I believe we must examine carefully what is being \nproposed under the auspices of self-governance and self-determination, \nbecause in the context of reform, we have not and are not asking other \nAmericans to experience a 26-percent reduction in the programs upon \nwhich they have come to rely.\n  Rather, we talk about cutting the budget for Federal programs by 5 to \n7 percent over the next 5 to 7 years.\n  In stark contrast, we would tell the Indian people that the programs \nwhich support the very infrastructure of their governments must be \nreduced by 26 percent in just 1 year.\n  In stark contrast to the reform measures that we have been debating \nin recent days, we would tell the Indian people that we are going to \nshore up and protect the Federal bureaucracy that absorbs 90 cents of \nevery dollar we appropriate for Indian programs and instead, we are \ngoing to drastically reduce the ability of tribal governments to \naddress the needs of their citizens at the local level.\n  Mr. President, this is not a proposal that will empower tribal \ngovernments.\n  This is a proposal that will devastate the ability of Indian \ngovernments to serve the most basic needs of their citizens.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I understand all too \nwell the constraints and the competing demands that are placed on each \nof our subcommittees and I understand the challenges with which the \nchairman and former chairman of the Interior Subcommittee are faced. In \nthe last few days, representatives of the Interior Department have \nspread horror stories around this body about the impact on each \nMember's State if funds are taken from any of the six accounts we \npropose to use as offsets.\n  One Member is told that the Minerals Management Service office in \nAlaska will be closed. Another Member is told that the wildlife refuges \nin his State will be closed. There is a story for every Member--and it \nis always that all of the Interior programs in his or her particular \nState will be the programs that bear the brunt of our proposed \nreductions.\n  Unfortunately, these are the kind of desperate and dishonest tactics \nthat are employed when resources become scarce. But I would ask my \ncolleagues, Mr. President, to examine the relative reductions to other \nprograms in Interior, and to understand that a 26-percent cut in the \nprograms that go directly to the Indian tribal governments is a \nreduction of a size and proportion that we have not asked any of the \nother Interior programs to bear. It is a matter of simple equity that \nbrings us to this threshold today.\n  Mr. President, we do have a responsibility to preserve and protect \nthis Nation's resources, but we also have a responsibility that we, as \na nation, undertook long ago--when we encouraged the Indian nations, by \nforce and solemn commitments, to give us their lands. This \nresponsibility--this trust responsibility--for Indian lands and \nresources, and to assure the survival of the Indian people--is no less \nsacred.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici and the \ndistinguished vice-chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator \nInouye, in a colloquy on their amendments to H.R. 1977, the fiscal year \n1996 Interior appropriations bill and the Earth Resources Observation \nSystem [EROS] Data Center.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Inouye and I would be happy to \ndiscuss the amendment with the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, before discussing the EROS Data Center, I \nwould like to take this opportunity to commend my colleague on the \nBudget Committee and my colleagues on the Indian Affairs Committee for \noffering their amendment to the Interior appropriations bill. I \nstrongly support their efforts to restore $200 million to the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs tribal priority allocations account, nonrecurring \nprograms, and other recurring programs.\n  The existing level of funding for the Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA] \nand tribal programs is extremely inadequate. The objective of the BIA \nis to encourage and assist Indian people to manage their own affairs \nunder the trust relationship to the Federal Government. To carry out \nthis objective, the BIA is responsible for assisting Indian tribes in \nthe development and implementation of effective programs for their \nself-sufficiency and advancement.\n  Historically, the BIA has never been funded at a level that meets the \nneeds of Indian people. The reductions in the BIA tribal priority \nallocation account recommended by the Interior Appropriations Committee \nwill have the potential to further decrease and eliminate many \nimportant programs such as tribal courts, law and order, social \nservices, roads, and housing needs that are so important to tribal \nself-sufficiency.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his kind remarks \nand completely agree that the funding \n\n[[Page S11971]]\ncontained in the fiscal year 1996 Interior appropriations bill for the \nBIA and tribal programs is simply inadequate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, my support for the BIA restoration \namendment is based on an understanding that the offsets will not be \ntaken from the EROS Data Center, which is funded from the U.S. \nGeological Survey's [USGS] national mapping, geography, and surveys \naccount.\n  The EROS Data Center is a data management, systems development, and \nresearch field center of the National Mapping Division of the USGS. \nLocated near Sioux Falls, SD, EROS is a state-of-the-art facility that \nreceives, processes, and distributes data from Landsat satellites. \nToday, the center holds the world's largest collection of images of the \nEarth, including more than 3 million images acquired from Landsat, \nmeteorological and foreign satellites.\n  As my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on \nInterior know, the EROS Data Center works closely with USGS, the \nInterior Department, and other Federal agencies including the \nDepartment of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration [NASA]. The center, for instance, manages the National \nSatellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive and participates in NASA's \nMission to Planet Earth Program. As a unique hub of high technology \nresearch, EROS is particularly important to South Dakota because it \nprovides opportunities for scientists, educators, and students in our \nState and assures them a role in the rapidly changing area of \nsupercomputing and on the information superhighway.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand the Senator's strong \nsupport for the EROS Data Center and would like to assure him that it \nis our intent that the offsets for our amendment will not be taken from \nthe national mapping, geography, and surveys account of USGS.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I concur with the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. The Senator from South Dakota is correct. It is my intent \nthat the important work done by the EROS Data Center will not be \naffected by our amendment. It is my intent that the offsets from the \nU.S. Geological Survey will not come from the national mapping, \ngeography, and surveys account to support the amendment that restores \nfunds for the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I want to thank my colleague from the Budget Committee \nand my colleague from the Committee on Indian Affairs for this \nclarification and assurance. I commend them for offering this important \namendment.\n\n\n                         transfer of hatcheries\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to ask the authors of the \namendment about an offset item in the amendment. Regarding the \nreduction in funding to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, it is my \nunderstanding that, consistent with the committee report, the 11 fish \nhatcheries proposed by the administration for transfer to States and \ntribes will be operated during fiscal year 1996, and that the working \ngroup to be formed to plan the future of the hatcheries will carry out \nits mission. Is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Before the Senators respond, I would also like to ask the \nauthors of the amendment about the reduction in funding for the Natural \nResources Science Agency. It is my understanding that, consistent with \nthe committee report, it is the intent of Congress that the Northern \nPrairie Science Center at Jamestown, ND will be maintained at its \npresent level of funding. Also, I understand that funding provided for \nthe Water Resources Research Institutes and for National Cooperative \nMapping by the U.S. Geological Survey will not be reduced by this \namendment. Am I correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senators from North Dakota are correct. The \namendment's reduction in funding to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, \nthe Natural Resources Science Agency, and the U.S. Geological Survey \nshould not negatively impact the programs mentioned by the Senators.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is also my understanding that it is the intent of the \namendment's sponsors that, of funds provided for other Bureau of Indian \nAffairs recurring programs, not less than $2.5 million will be provided \nto implement the Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act of \n1990.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Senator's understanding is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the appropriations bill for the Department \nof the Interior cuts spending on Bureau of Indian Affairs programs by \n16 percent and strips it of major responsibilities for natural \nresources management. Even more damaging is the fact that tribes will \nbe faced with a one-third cut in the funds that go directly to tribes \nso that they can provide people with critical education, human \nservices, public safety, and economic development programs.\n  Indian programs have traditionally been the first to see the budget \nax and the last to see funding. This is wrong. It's asking some of our \npoorest communities and most vulnerable citizens to foot the bill for \nbalancing the budget--while saying, ``We have plenty of money for tax \ncuts for the wealthy and for star wars.''\n  The statistics on Indian poverty are staggering. About one out of \nevery three Indians lives in poverty--and so do half of the children \nunder age 6 who live on reservations. The average employment rate on \nreservations is about 45 percent, and the per capita income is \napproximately $4,500.\n  Tribes are in desperate need of resources, for educating children, \nfor protecting abused and neglected children, for combating alcoholism \nand drug abuse, for fighting crime, for building roads, homes, and \nwater and sewer systems. And we--the Federal Government--have a special \ntrust responsibility to provide those resources to tribes.\n  This appropriations bill falls far short of meeting the fundamental \nobligation of the United States toward the Indian nations. In North \nDakota, the funding cuts contained in this bill will mean tribal \ngovernments will be faced with cutting employees who run the courts, \nwho prevent child abuse, who teach children. The cuts mean that, on \nreservations where there are waiting lists for housing, understaffed \npolice departments, decrepit schools, and unpaved roads, there will be \neven fewer dollars to meet critical needs.\n  One of these needs that will continue to go unmet under this \nappropriations bill is particularly troubling to me--and that is the \nneed to fight and prevent child abuse on Indian reservations. Many of \nyou have heard me speak on the floor about Tamara, a young woman from \nFort Yates, ND, who at age 3 was placed in a foster home by a \ncaseworker who was juggling 150 cases. She was placed in a foster home \nwhich had not been inspected. This was a home where the norm was heavy \ndrinking and all-night parties. After one such party--if you can call \nit that--this 3-year old girl was so severely beaten that her hair was \npulled out by its roots. Her arm and nose were broken.\n  I wish every Member of this body could someday look into Tamara's \neyes, so that he or she may see what happens when the Federal \nGovernment says, ``No, we don't have enough money to help tribes hire \nsocial workers.''\n  The BIA requested $5 million to help prevent child abuse on Indian \nreservations. The Appropriations Committee killed all of this funding--\nall of it. I hope that every Member of this body will think long and \nhard about the effect of passing legislation in which our priorities \nbecome so skewed, so wrong-headed, that we are willing to cut out \nfunding that could very well save the life of a small child who is \nliving in fear and in pain.\n  I am pleased to offer my support for the amendment offered by \nSenators Domenici, McCain, and Inouye. This amendment will provide \ncritical funding for Indian programs. I understand from the managers of \nthe amendment that no less than $2.5 million of the restored funding \nwould be set aside for child abuse and treatment programs under the \nChild Protection and Family Violence Prevention and Family Violence \nPrevention Act of 1990. I thank them for their efforts to protect \nIndian children, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting \nthis critical amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, Members have on their desks a brief \noutline of what this bill does with respect to the agencies within the \nDepartment of the Interior and the other responsibilities of this \nsubcommittee. The entire \n\n[[Page S11972]]\nthrust of the argument for this bill has been aimed not at reductions \nin Indian programs, but at reductions of the appropriations for the \nBureau of Indian Affairs, a Bureau, I may say, criticized by most of \nthese same Members over the years as one of the least efficient and \nleast responsive in the entire Federal Government.\n  But the total reductions for the Bureau of Indian Affairs itself are \n16 percent. The total reduction for Indian programs are 8 percent. By \ncomparison, the Forest Service is reduced 22 percent, the various \nendowments by 39 percent, the Fish and Wildlife Service by 11 percent, \nterritorial affairs by 23 percent. It is just simply not the case that \nIndian programs have been singled out for disproportionate reductions.\n  I stand here, as does my colleague from West Virginia, to share with \nMembers that frustration at the fact that, because of what we have \ndecided to do in order to balance the budget, under the leadership of \nthe Senator from New Mexico, we have, overall, 11 percent fewer dollars \nfor our responsibilities. I want to emphasize once again, we have \nreduced Indian programs by only 8 percent, and they are not the \nprograms the Senator from Arizona was talking about. These are not the \nprograms that provide for education, or for health, or for housing, or \nfor the relief of poverty. These are the moneys that go through the \nBureau of Indian Affairs to give to Indian governments, which raise no \nmoney on their own--unlike every other form of local government in the \nUnited States.\n  In order to see to it, at a time of starkly declining budgets for all \nof these agencies, that the Bureau of Indian Affairs, for all practical \npurposes, has no reduction, so that the total reduction for Indian \nprograms is a mere 2 percent, this amendment would devastate \nresponsibilities of the Government of the United States, which it \nliterally cannot delegate to anyone else--the management of all of the \nlands owned and operated by the Bureau of Land Management. The Bureau \nof Land Management, quite accurately, tells us that it has already \ntaken a $50 million reduction from the President's budget request and \nthat its outreach programs, its recreational programs will, of \nnecessity, have to go if this additional huge reduction is imposed upon \nit because it cannot abandon the land itself.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service, which is reduced $41 million from the \nPresident's proposal by our budget, and for which this amendment asks \nanother $30 million reduction would, of necessity, come out of its \nrecreation, its people-oriented activities. I read a list last night, \nthat the Fish and Wildlife Service sent to us through the Department of \nthe Interior, of more than 50 wildlife refuges that will close, as far \nas public access is concerned, because all that will be left is what is \nnecessary for the preservation of habitat. They cover most of the \nStates of the United States--as many as four or five in States like \nNorth Carolina and Oregon and Texas, and at least one in almost every \nother State. Of course, that is going to happen. This is a lot of \nmoney.\n  There has been a colloquy submitted between the distinguished \nDemocratic leader and the chairman of the Budget Committee with respect \nto the National Geological Survey and the EROS Data Center in Sioux \nFalls, SD. I can tell you, Mr. President, that Sioux Falls, SD, EROS \nData Center is No. 1 on the list for the National Geological Survey for \nclosure if this amendment is agreed to. It does not do much good to say \nit is not the intention of the sponsors to close it. It will close if \nthis amendment becomes law.\n  We have been in the process of distributing reductions which were \nforced on us--not ones which we asked for--in a field in which the \nFederal Government is solely responsible. We have been able to have no \nreductions at all only in the operations of the National Park Service \nand the cultural institutions here in Washington, DC, like the \nSmithsonian and National Gallery of Art, for which we are solely \nresponsible, and the Indian Health Service, which is actually \nincreased,\n the only significant item in this bill which is increased. Yet, these \nsponsors put on blinders. They do not tell you about the $1.8 billion \nworth of programs for Indians in other appropriations bills. They do \nnot talk about Indian education or the Indian Health Service. They \nspeak only about the BIA, and within that only one program within the \nBIA.\n\n  If they wish to refocus the amounts of money to the BIA within this \nappropriation, I am certain that the Senator from West Virginia and I \nwould be more than accommodating. But this does not attack the welfare \nand income maintenance programs of the Indians at all. And this bill, I \nmust repeat, reduces Indian programs considerably less than it reduces \nthe average of all other programs in this bill. It is extremely \nunfortunate, but it is the only fair way in accomplishing a goal.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First of all, I ask unanimous consent to be included as an original \ncosponsor of the Domenici amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I told my colleague from New Mexico that I did not \ncome to the floor last night to speak on this amendment because I \nwanted to get a clear understanding of the offsets which are contained \nin the amendment.\n  Mr. President, frankly, some of the offsets are troubling to me. \nEspecially those which pertain to the National Biological Service, the \nBureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the \nMinerals Management Service. As a strong environmentalist, I wish we \ndid not have to make any tradeoffs in these areas at all because they \nare all important. But I think this is a matter of simple justice and \nequity. I believe the Domenici, McCain, and Inouye amendment is \nextremely important.\n  Mr. President, as I look at the proposed cuts, I am troubled that \nmost of these cuts really are not in Federal bureaucracy but instead go \nright down to the tribal programs at the reservation level.\n  Mr. President, the statistics all translate into personal and human \nterms. It is unconscionable to have deep cuts in programs at the tribal \nlevel; be they education programs or health-care programs. It is one \nthing to talk about all these statistics in a cut and dried way. But \nwhen you travel in Minnesota, New Mexico, Arizona, or any number of \nother States, and you visit with people in the Indian nations, it is \njust staggering to observe the poverty, including the horrifying \npoverty of children.\n  Mr. President, it strikes me that this amendment is about simple \njustice and fairness. This amendment deserves the support of all \nSenators. It is just that simple.\n  Mr. President, we cannot turn our gaze away from a history that none \nof us can be proud of. We cannot turn away from the dire poverty that \nstill is out there in Indian country. We cannot turn away, Mr. \nPresident, from the impact these cuts are going to have on the lives \nsome of the poorest Americans.\n  Therefore, I rise to strongly support this amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank the manager.\n  Mr. President, we had debate on this amendment for an hour and a half \nlast night. Senator Gorton and I have both spoken in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The amendment being voted on this morning proposes to reduce six \ndifferent accounts within the Interior Department in order to increase \nfunding for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The reductions proposed by \nthis amendment would:\n  Double the reduction already imposed on the operations of the Bureau \nof Land Management, which will affect the conduct of the grazing, \nmining, and timber programs;\n  Increase the cut on Fish and Wildlife Service operations to more than \n$100 million below the fiscal year 1995 level, which will affect the \ndelivery of services at national wildlife refuges--of which there are \n500--and fish hatcheries;\n\n[[Page S11973]]\n\n  Reduce the Geological Survey by $46.5 million, which will lead to \nadditional job termination beyond the 400 positions being eliminated \nthis year, and affect earthquake, volcano, and landslide monitoring as \nwell as mapping and streamflow measurements;\n  Cut $45 million from the Natural Resources Science Agency, which \nwould eliminate existing natural resource evaluation, monitoring, and \ninvestigation; and\n  Reduce the royalty management function whereby the Interior \nDepartment ensures that moneys owed the Federal Government due to \nmineral extraction are paid.\n  Mr. President, the proponents of the amendment have contended that \nthe recommendations contained in the pending bill disproportionately \naffect Indian programs. In fact, this is not the case. Senators should \nremember that this bill is reduced $1.1 billion below the fiscal year \n1995 enacted level. Cuts are real throughout the bill, not just in the \nIndian program.\n  The potential consequences of the committee's recommendations are \nwhat most concern the sponsors of the amendment. Mr. President, \nconsequences are what happen when we impose reductions on discretionary \nspending. And as I said last night, this is just the tip of the \niceberg. Further reductions in discretionary spending are called for \nnext year. The budget resolution has told us that programs have to be \ncut. Our task is to do so responsibly.\n It is not an easy chore. Rather, it is an unpleasant one. It is one \nthat each Senator probably thinks he or she can do better than the next \nSenator. But each appropriations bill is a series of compromises and a \nbalancing of authorities, and this Interior bill is no different.\n  Mr. President, in recent days, this body has been debating an \nappropriate funding level for national defense. As was said during that \ndebate, military spending is the only portion of the discretionary \nbudget that will increase in fiscal year 1996. Mr. President, if the \nsenate were willing, it could impose a reduction of less than 3 percent \non the amount of growth in the Defense budget and fully achieve the \nobjectives of the pending amendment.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I cite the following facts:\n  First, total funding in this bill is down 11 percent versus last \nyear. Indian programs are down 8 percent, which is below the average \nfor the bill.\n And, if the amendment is agreed to, the funding for Indian programs \nwill be down to 2 percent below last year. It will drop from 8 percent \nto 2 percent below last year.\n  Second, funding for the land management operations for nearly one-\nthird of the land base of this country is down 14 percent, a reduction \n75 percent greater than that applied to the Indian programs.\n  Third, the committee recommendations protect the most fundamental of \nIndian programs--Indian health and elementary and secondary education \nfor Indian children on reservations. Protecting these critical \nfunctions resulted in cuts in other Indian programs in this bill.\n  Fourth, the House imposed less of a reduction on the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, but they did so by constraining programs of interest to \nnumerous Senators, including land acquisition, low-income \nweatherization assistance, zero funding for the National Museum for the \nAmerican Indian, and termination of the Bureau of Mines.\n  Mr. President, this bill adds, I believe, $12 billion in spending \nauthority and $3.5 billion of that $12 billion is allocated to Indian \nprograms.\n  I find it unpleasant to oppose the amendment that was offered by \nthese three distinguished Senators and others. But I feel as manager \nthat I must do so. I urge Senators to reject the amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, there is a chart on the desk of each \nMember which is the only chart and set of figures which covers this \nbill as a whole. It indicates that land management agencies are reduced \n14 percent, science agencies by 5 percent, cultural activities by 15 \npercent, the Department of Energy by 10 percent, Indian activities by 8 \npercent and other Department of the Interior functions by 14 percent, \nfor a total of 11 percent.\n  To concentrate on one aspect of one of those sections to the \nexclusion of all others is not to paint an appropriate picture for \nMembers in dealing with a very difficult bill at a very difficult time. \nIt is simply an error for the Senator from Minnesota or the Senator \nfrom Arizona to say that this preserves the bureaucracy in the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs. The largest account in the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nto be cut is central office operations, considerably larger than these \nself-government functions.\n  The bottom line is that this amendment by its own terms will be \ndevastating to primary responsibilities of the Government of the United \nStates. They will probably be modified adversely to affect the National \nPark Service. It would have to be in order to become law, ultimately. \nAnd, Mr. President, this does not affect the poverty-oriented programs \nfor Indian tribes. It simply affects the bureaucracy of the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs and of the governments of the various Indian tribes \nthemselves. Overall, however, these reductions for Indian programs in \nthis bill are less than those for land management agencies, for \ncultural activities, for the Department of Energy, for territorial \nadministration, or for the main office of the Department of the \nInterior itself. This is a fair bill that will be distorted unfairly, \nunwisely, and unsustainably by this amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to make a few observations \non the amendment offered by my colleagues on the Committee on Indian \nAffairs. I strongly support this amendment because it seeks to restore \nfunds that go directly to tribal governments for basic, necessary \ngovernmental functions, such as public safety and law enforcement, \neducation, human services, and community development each vital \nelements of any government, whether it is a State, local, or tribal \ngovernment.\n  I appreciate the work of the distinguished chairman and ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Subcommittee. I know they have tried to \ncraft a spending bill that equitably distributes the reductions taken \nas a result of an overall reduction of nearly 11 percent from fiscal \nyear 1995 levels.\n  Howeer, I remain greatly concerned with the reductions reported by \nthe committee for those programs administered through the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs.\n  H.R. 1977, as reported by the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, \nreduces spending for BIA administered programs by approximately $255 \nmillion from fiscal year 1995 enacted levels, and $207 million below \nthe level passed by the House earlier last month.\n  While the committee report indicates that every effort was made to \nlimit reductions for Indian-related programs, I would respectfully ask \nmy colleagues to take a closer look at overall spending for each of the \nmajor spending categories for Indian programs. Depending on how one \nreads the numbers, one could come to the conclusion that Indian \nprograms are reduced by a modest 8 percent.\n  While this may be the case if you add in all Indian-related \ncategories such as the Indian Health Service, Indian Education, and \nothers, it is also true that programs administered through the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs will suffer a reduction of nearly 38 percent in \nfiscal year 1996.\n  Further, and most importantly, Mr. President, is the fact that these \nreductions will immediately, and most definitely have hurtful impacts \non many Indian people and Indian communities. Unlike the proposed \nreductions to the other Interior agencies such as: the National \nEndowment for the Arts, 33 percent; the National Endowment for the \nHumanities, 33 percent; and the Institute for Museum Services, 27 \npercent.\n  Cuts in these programs, I suspect, will not force people to go \nhungry, lose their homes, or reduce an already depressed standard of \nliving.\n  Mr. President, I need not remind my colleagues of the living \nconditions that exist on many Indian reservations and in many Indian \ncommunities, nor do I need to remind my colleagues of the history of \nIndian people on this continent and the unique relationship that has \nevolved between Indian tribes, the Congress, and the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n[[Page S11974]]\n\n  We, as Members of Congress, have a compelling trust responsibility to \nIndian people, the origins of which are grounded in the Constitution \nand through treaties, agreements, and Executive orders that were \nnegotiated with individual Indian tribal nations.\n  Because Congress and the executive branch have, for many years, \nendorsed the concept of tribal self-determination, and tribal self-\ngovernance, efforts have been made so that tribal governments are \nempowered to administer a greater number of Federal programs with the \nflexibility to determine how best to serve their local communities. \nWhile the Federal Government speaks of ``self-determination'', our \nactions--such as these cuts--continue to force dependency.\n  In keeping with the concept of empowering our local communities, the \namendment before us today seeks to restore $200 million to the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs ``Tribal Priority Allocation'' line item. These funds \ngo directly to Indian tribes for the operation of all tribal \ngovernmental programs and are not funds that are siphoned off by the \noperation and administration overhead costs of the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs.\n  According to the committee report, ``Tribal Priority Allocations'' \nare proposed to be reduced by nearly $343 million from budget estimate \nlevels. Again, what causes me great concern is that the proposed \nreductions are not to construction programs or economic development \nprograms, but to funding that goes directly to local Indian \ncommunities.\n  Like all Members of this body, I am well aware of our current \nbudgetary constraints and the necessity for each of us to step up and \nmake sacrifices, however, I believe we should do so in the framework of \nthe budget resolution this Congress adopted earlier this year, Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 13. In that resolution the Senate directives in \nall spending categories that provide a direction of where we need to \nreduce spending in order to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002. \nIn function 300, the category for natural resources and environment, \nthere were several recommendations that were made with respect to \nagencies of the Department of the Interior. One recommendation assumes \na 10-percent reduction in the operating budgets of the Forest Service, \nNational Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of \nLand Management.\n  In addition, the committee recommendation assumes the devolution of \nthe National Biological Survey. While that would also have negative \nimpacts in my home State, that cut is preferable to forcing real people \ninto even deeper poverty and deprivation.\n  Further, the bill as passed out of the House recognizes the need to \ntrim the Federal bureaucracy. That is reflected through reduced \nspending for the various land management agencies. I support those \nprinciples.\n  I tend to believe that in order to maximize the taxpayer dollar, we \nshould not continue to feed the Federal bureaucracy, but should promote \nfunding that will go directly to local communities, in this instance, \nIndian communities.\n  As debate continues on this amendment, I would ask my colleagues to \ngive their strong support for this amendment. Supporting this proposal \nis to further empower local communities to maximize taxpayer dollars \nand to reduce spending on Federal bureaucracy.\n  It is also the right and moral thing to do. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for \nthe amendment being offered by Senators Dominici, Inouye, and McCain.\n  The Interior appropriations bill as it is now written would single \nout native American programs for deep, deep budget cuts. While we must \nall do our fair share to bring down the budget deficit, these programs \nthat are so important to our Indian people of my home State of Montana, \nare being singled out unfairly.\n  For instance, as Senator Domenici pointed out last night, 47 percent \nof the savings in this bill come from the Indian programs. And, under \nthe Senate bill in its present form, BIA programs would be slashed by \nabout half a billion dollars--a reduction of over 30 percent from last \nyear's appropriation.\n  In a word, this is unfair.\n  But it is also unwise. While the leadership of Montana's tribal \nnations have worked hard--and effectively--to improve conditions on our \nseven reservations, enormous needs remain.\n  We need to do more to educate our Indian youth. But this legislation \ncuts Indian education.\n  We have a trust responsibility to provide for the health and welfare \nof our Native Americans. But this legislation takes a meat axe to those \nprograms.\n  And, while we should be doing everything possible to encourage \neconomic development on our Indian reservations--places with some of \nthe highest unemployment in America--community development programs \ntake a huge hit in this legislation.\n  I believe our Indian people are willing to do their fair share to \nbring down the deficit. But it is wrong to single them out for such \nunfair treatment. For this reason, I urge the adoption of this \namendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support the efforts of \nSenators Domenici, Inouye, and McCain to restore funding to the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs, but I am very concerned about the offsets for the \namendment.\n  Unfortunately, the managers of the bill, the distinguished chairman \nof the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Gorton, and the \nranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Byrd, have made clear their \nbelief that passage of the amendment in its current form would result \nin cuts to the U.S. Geological Survey that could force the closure of \nthe EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, SD, a state-of-the-art facility \nthat receives, processes, and distributes data from Landsat satellites. \nToday, the Center holds the world's largest collection of images of the \nEarth, including more than 3 million images acquired from Landsat, \nmeteorological, and foreign satellites.\n  While I strongly support the goal of the Domenici amendment--to \nrestore BIA funding for key tribal programs--in light of the statements \nby the bill managers that the offsets in the amendment could eliminate \nEROS funding, I cannot support the amendment as currently drafted.\n  The amendment represents the right thing to do, but the wrong way to \ndo it. It is my hope we can go back to the drawing board and work out a \ncompromise that restores this essential funding for Indian priorities \nwithout robbing EROS funding. I will be doing all I can to accomplish \nthat goal.\n  There should be no misunderstanding about the need for the \nrestoration of BIA funding. The existing level of funding for the \nBureau of Indian Affairs [BIA] and tribal programs is extremely \ninadequate. While the Bureau of Indian Affairs received a slight \nincrease in the President's fiscal year 1996 budget request, the \nRepublican-controlled Congress appears intent on drastic cuts. The \nHouse of Representatives cut the administration's request by $100 \nmillion, and the Senate Appropriations Committee reduced it by $500 \nmillion. At the same time, we are considering an Armed Services \nCommittee-reported defense bill that proposes spending $7 billion more \nthan the Pentagon has requested. This is yet another clear indication \nof misplaced priorities.\n  The objective of the BIA is to encourage and help Indian people \nmanage their own affairs under the Federal trust relationship. \nHistorically, the BIA has never been funded at a level that meets the \nneeds of Indian people. The reductions in the BIA tribal priority \nallocation account recommended by the Interior Appropriations Committee \nhave the potential to further decrease and eliminate many important \nprograms such as tribal courts, law and order, social services, roads, \nand housing needs that are so important to tribal self-sufficiency.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts of Senators Domenici, Inouye, \nand McCain to address the problem associated with the offsets. Again, \nwhile I feel I cannot support the amendment as currently drafted, I \nhope that, before the fiscal year 1996 appropriations bill becomes law, \nwe can restore funding for Indian programs without forcing the closure \nof EROS.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today in reluctant opposition to \nthe amendment offered by my colleague, Mr. Domenici. I am proud of the \nnative American heritage which is so much a \n\n[[Page S11975]]\npart of South Dakota's history. However, the Domenici amendment would \ninadvertently threaten the future of the EROS Data Center in Sioux \nFalls, SD, which will carry South Dakota into the 21st century and will \nbring new jobs to our state.\n  South Dakota can trace its native ancestry back more than 9,000 \nyears. Today, South Dakota is home to nine Sioux or Lakota Indian \ntribes: the Cheyenne River Sioux, the Crow Creek Sioux, the Flandreau \nSantee Sioux, the Lower Brule Sioux, the Oglala Sioux, the Rosebud \nSioux, the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux, the Standing Rock Sioux and the \nYankton Sioux. South Dakota's Indian reservations are the very poorest \nareas in the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I recognize the importance of Federal funds to the \nsurvival and growth of the Indian tribes. These funds also are part of \nthe longstanding Federal policy of self-governance. During my 20 years \nin Congress--both in the House and the Senate--I have strongly \nsupported legislation to authorize and fund programs for native \nAmericans. In fact, I recently coauthored a proposal which would allow \ntribes to run their own welfare programs.\n  Though, I support the intent and the goal of the Domenici amendment, \nI must object to the means used to fund the goal. The funding offsets \ncould result in the elimination of the EROS Data Center--which in many \nways, represents the future of technology in South Dakota.\n  The Earth Resources Observation Center, commonly known as EROS, was \nestablished in Sioux Falls, SD in the early 1970's. South Dakotans are \njustifiably proud of the EROS Data Center. For 20 years, it has been \nthe Nation's primary center for managing and distributing land remote \nsensing data. Its excellent track record for making this information \navailable has made EROS famous among scientists throughout the world.\n  The National Satellite Archive houses the world's largest collection \nof space- and aircraft-acquired imagery. It currently holds more than 8 \nmillion aerial photos and over 2 million satellite images of the Earth.\n  EROS facilities house the scientists, researchers, and technicians, \nas well as the high performance computer systems and advanced \ntelecommunications networks, needed to process and distribute the data. \nResearchers use the data to better understand the Earth, determine the \nextent and distribution of natural resources, monitor land surface \nchanges, and evaluate environmental conditions.\n  What makes EROS unique is the availability of its information. The \nimages collected at EROS provide very important information for \nagriculture, mining, urban planning, and other global change research. \nIn fact, in South Dakota, many native Americans are utilizing Landsat \ndata provided by EROS to manage land and resources on their \nreservations. EROS enjoys an internationally renowned reputation--a \nreputation that is well-deserved. The economic future of South Dakota \ndepends upon the advanced technologies of facilities such as EROS.\n  Balancing the budget requires that we make difficult choices. This \ncertainly is one such choice. But a balanced budget is the key to \ngrowth for both the native American and scientific communities. Without \nbalanced budgets, interest on the Federal debt will continue to \nskyrocket, squeezing out funds for legitimate programs, such as the \ntribal priority allocation.\n  I would be pleased to work with my colleagues during the upcoming \nHouse-Senate conference to find a way to fund Indian programs without \nunnecessarily cutting other programs which are vital to South Dakota. \nIt is my hope that we can work to this end.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do I have 4 minutes, 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first of all, for all Senators, let me \nsuggest that the chart which Senator Gorton, my good friend, has just \nalluded to, in this Senator's opinion, does not state the case right.\n  What we really should focus on here is Department of Interior \nfunding, and not the entire bill. There are a lot of other things in \nthis bill, some by accident, some by precedent and design, but the \nDepartment of Interior, of which the Bureau of Indian Affairs is 26.6 \npercent in budget terms--I say to the Senator from Mississippi who is \nobserving this chart, the fact is that within the Department of \nInterior--that is all of the Department of Interior--a 26-percent \nportion it is getting cut 45.6 percent.\n  There are 550 Indian and Alaska Native governments in the United \nStates; about 250 of them are villages in Alaska. This source of \nfunding that we attempt to replenish has been cut $270 million. What \nthis amounts to is economic termination of Indian self-determination \nand self-governance policies. If you take 27 percent away from the \ngovernments that we say should have self-determination, take it away \nfrom them, have we not made a de facto decision that Indian government \ncannot run, that it is going to be there with seriously reduced \nresources?\n  Nothing else in the Department of Interior comes close to getting cut \n27 percent. As a matter of fact, many Senators do not even know because \nmany States have no Indian people, but these are little, tiny villages \nin some instances and they may get $350,000 to run their government, to \noperate their own local welfare assistance program--not the American \nsystem, theirs. They get it for fire protection, for police protection. \nAnd we are saying to them, the United States of America is cutting its \noverall budget for all kinds of things; you little governments, the \nsmallest governments in America and the poorest, you take a 27-percent \nhit. And we will go through all this kind of arithmetic and say it is \nonly a reduction of 8 percent for Indians. But 8 percent for all the \nIndian programs has little to do with the Department of Interior \nfunding which we believe has inappropriately taken 27 percent out of \nIndian governments.\n  How are they going to operate? Self-determination is eloquently \nspoken to in the Chamber. How do you have self-determination when you \njust gut little Indian governments all over the place; you say you used \nto get $350,000 to run it. We are going to take 27 percent away, but be \nself-determined. Get on with running your own government, but do it \nwith a third fewer resources.\n  Really, it is not going to work. It amounts to deciding by \nappropriations that Indian government is going to have to retreat, \nperhaps disappear in some cases. Frankly, in the final analysis it will \nnot work.\n  Now, having said that, Mr. President, this bill does some good \nthings, the overall bill does in fact help Indians--not the Interior \nDepartment allocation of funds which we are debating. The overall bill \ndoes some wonderful things except it takes too much out of the tiny \nIndian governments. The bill also has Indian health in it. That is not \nthe Department of Interior. The only source of health protection on \nreservations is the Indian Health Service of the Department of Health \nand Human Services, but it is funded in this bill.\n  So what we have done, what the chairman and ranking member said is \n``Let us keep Indian health solid.'' It is a $2 billion program for all \nthe Indians of America. That has nothing to do with the program that \nfunds tribal government operations--general assistance to the \nindividual tribal governments that serve Indians under their tribal \ngovernment. They provide small child welfare programs, services for \nIndian families within the rubric of a tribe, police protection, \nresource protection and other vital functions for maintaining tribal \nlife.\n  Mr. President, the chairman's chart is deceiving. I wish I had a \nsimple one that just said, out of the Department of Interior programs \nfor Indian tribal governments--known as the Tribal Priority Allocation \nProgram--there is a 27-percent reduction. The small Indian governments \nare cut 27 percent. Overall, the BIA represents 26 percent of all \nInterior Department functions, yet the BIA cuts in this bill account \nfor 45 percent of the Interior Department's reduction for the next \nfiscal year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GORTON. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 47 seconds \nremaining.\n\n[[Page S11976]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Indian programs even in the Department of the Interior \nare not cut 27 percent but 16 percent. But the point is from the \nperspective of the country as a whole, how much money is being reduced \nfrom Indian programs? In this bill, 8 percent; for everyone else, more \nthan 12 percent. Indians are doing almost twice as well in this bill \nalone as are all of the other functions in this bill combined. Because \nof the budget resolution, there has to have been a reduction. These \nreductions are taken fairly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask for 30 seconds to clarify a \nmistake that I made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. Indian tribal \ngovernment funding is cut 27 percent. That is what we are attempting to \nreplenish. I mistakenly said all Indian programs within the Bureau are \ncut 27 percent. But the tribal priority allocations are the program \nthat helps them directly to govern, and this is the program that is cut \n27 percent.\n  Thank you for giving me 30 seconds.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2296 to H.R. 1977. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was rejected.\n  Mr. BYRD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we have now dealt with two of the most \ncontentious amendments to this bill. We have now finished, I believe, \ndebate on mining patents and on grazing, and the principal, but though \nnot the only amendment on Indian programs. I have been prepared to go \nto a series of amendments on the endowments at this point. But the \nobjection to the committee amendment on the endowments was lodged by \nSenator McCain, who is now chairing a markup in the Indian Affairs \nCommittee.\n  There is also an amendment on an African-American museum by Senator \nSimon, who has to attend that same committee session. I trust that it \nwill be relatively short. We would be prepared to take another \namendment on another subject.\n  But, Mr. President, what I would like to announce is, of course, the \nmajority leader and the managers of this bill would like to have a full \ndebate but, at the same time, would like to finish the bill today. So I \nrequest that Members on my side try to get to me or to my staff within \nthe course of the next hour and give us notice and, if they can, copies \nof the amendments they propose to lodge. I believe the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia will make the same request. We would like to \nbe in a position, within an hour or so, to get a unanimous-consent \nagreement at least as to the amendments that are available for \nconsideration, so that we can see how to manage our time for the rest \nof the day.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I share the viewpoint expressed by the \ndistinguished manager of the bill. I hope that our floor staffs will do \nwhatever they can to contact the Senators' offices and let them know \nthat amendments should be called up.\n  There is a desire and a need to complete action on this bill today. \nThe sooner Senators will come to the floor and offer their amendments, \nthe sooner we will be able to achieve that goal.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have a brief statement on another \nmatter. If it is the desire of the managers to consider an amendment I \nwill withhold. But if there is not, I would like to proceed briefly on \nanother matter.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is perfectly satisfactory, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/09/senate-section/article/S11969-5", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11976-S11978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               THE UNHOLY ALLIANCE TO DISMANTLE MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as Congress prepares for the summer \nrecess, it is important for the American public to understand what is \nat stake in the Republican Medicare cuts and who wants those deep cuts \nadopted.\n  Medicare is part of Social Security. Without Medicare, no senior \ncitizens has retirement security. Medicare is a promise of health \nsecurity for every senior citizen. If Republicans break the promise of \nMedicare, they are breaking the promise of Social Security.\n  For the Nation's elderly, this is more than a partisan political \nissue. The vast majority of senior citizens cannot afford to pay more \nfor health care. They already pay an average of 21 percent of their \nlimited income for Medicare premiums and for health costs that Medicare \ndoes not cover. Those who are older and sicker pay even more. Senior \ncitizens today are paying a higher proportion of their income for \nhealth care than senior citizens paid before Medicare was enacted. And \nMedicare was enacted because senior citizens were already paying too \nmuch.\n  Paying such a high percentage of income for health care would be a \nheavy burden for almost any part of our population. But is especially \nhard for senior citizens. The median income for elderly households is \nonly $17,750. Eighty-three percent of Medicare expenditures are for \nsenior citizens with incomes less than $25,000; and almost two-thirds \nare for those with incomes below $15,000.\n  Deep cuts in Medicare hurt not only senior citizens, but their \nfamilies as well. Children and grandchildren of senior citizens will \nface unexpected additional serious financial burdens, just at the time \nthey are trying to make ends meet for their own families.\n  Cuts in Medicare will also damage the overall health care system. The \nsystem as a whole will suffer because these deep Republican cuts will \nhurt hospitals and other providers, especially rural hospitals, public \nhospitals, and academic health centers.\n  The Republican strategy is clear. They will refuse to put anything \nspecific on the table until after the recess--and then try to pass it \nquickly before the public realizes what is happening.\n  It is wrong to try to slam dunk Medicare through Congress and it will \nnot work--because the key elements of the Republican program are \nalready clear. First, there will be heavy additional costs for senior \ncitizens in the form of \n\n[[Page S11977]]\nhigher premiums, higher copayments, and higher deductibles. Second, \nthere will be a program of shrinking vouchers to push as many senior \ncitizens as possible into private insurance.\n  The reasons for the Republican cuts are also clear. They are taking \n$270 billion out of Medicare to pay for $245 billion in tax cuts for \nwealthy individuals and corporations. Despite its success, they still \nsee Medicare as a mindless big-government program. They still want to \ndismantle it, as they have for the past 30 years.\n  Worst of all, to get their way, Republicans have entered into an \nunholy alliance with private insurance companies, who see immense \nprofits for themselves if Medicare is dismantled.\n  Two weeks ago a new coalition was formed to try to persuade senior \ncitizens to buy into the Republican cuts in Medicare. Its membership \nmakes clear that Republican Medicare policy is driven by an unholy \nalliance of right-wing extremists, big businesses who know their tax \ncuts depend on Medicare cuts, and private insurance companies eager to \nget their hands on Medicare.\n  The insurance companies in this coalition are of two kinds. They \ninclude large companies with heavy investments in managed care, and \nthey include smaller companies, some of whom are well-known for \nprofiteering from abusive practices in the individual insurance market, \nsuch as ``cherry-picking'' and harsh exclusions for pre-existing \nconditions.\n  The American people should be aware of the immense profits that those \ninsurance companies can reap if these Medicare cuts are enacted. If all \nsenior citizens are pushed into private insurance policies, the premium \nrevenues of private insurance companies over the next 7 years will \nincrease by a staggering $1.25 trillion. Their profits will increase by \n$38 billion, up by two-thirds from their current level.\n  If the number of senior citizens in managed care alone increases to \njust 25 percent of the total from the current level of 8 percent, \ninsurance company profits will rise $10.2 billion over the budget \nperiod.\n  During this recess, the Republicans and their allies in the insurance \nindustry and corporate America will be conducting a massive campaign of \ndisinformation and fear, as they try to convince the American people \nthat deep cuts in Medicare are needed to save it. The anti-Medicare \nalliance is wasting its breath and wasting its money. Their greed is \ntoo transparent for senior citizens to be fooled.\n  The American people will not support a program that coerces senior \ncitizens into giving up their family doctor. They will not support a \nraid on Medicare to finance tax cuts for wealthy corporations and \nwindfall profits for the insurance industry.\n  Medicare is a contract between the Government and the people. \nDemocrats intend to honor that contract and keep the promise of \nMedicare.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an analysis of the membership of the so-\ncalled ``Coalition to Save Medicare'' by Citizen Action be printed in \nthe Record, along with a staff analysis of the potential increases in \nrevenues and profits of private insurance companies under the \nRepublican budget.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                               Citizen Action,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 1995.\n\n The ``Coalition To Save Medicare''--It's Really the Coalition To Raid \n                                Medicare\n\n       On Thursday, August 3rd at 10:30 a.m., Speaker of the House \n     Newt Gingrich and Majority Leader of the Senate Bob Dole will \n     address the so-called Coalition to Save Medicare as part of a \n     rally for proposals to cut $270 billion from Medicare over \n     the next seven years.\n       But when you scratch the surface of this collection of big \n     corporations and insurance companies and look at the reality \n     behind their nice-sounding rhetoric, their true agenda is \n     revealed--to raid Medicare and the families who depend on it \n     of $270 billion to pay for billions in new corporate tax \n     breaks, loopholes and increased profits.\n       Citizen Action has prepared this press background to \n     provide the public and press with information on who is \n     behind the so-called ``Coalition to Save Medicare'' and how \n     the members of this coalition will benefit by cutting and \n     gutting Medicare.\n       The Coalition to raid Medicare--\n       What they really think about Medicare, in their own words.\n       ``There are several reasons the Chamber is opposed to \n     [Medicare]. One of these is that social security medicare is \n     not needed . . . The national Chamber recommends that \n     [Medicare] and similar proposals be rejected.''--Statement of \n     Karl Schlotterbeck for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on H.R. \n     3920, Medicare Care for the Aged, January 22, 1964, U.S. \n     Congress, House Committee on Ways and Means.\n       ``It is the recommendation of the National Association of \n     Manufacturers that Congress reject any proposals to establish \n     compulsory medical care for the aged under the social \n     security system.''--Statement from the National Association \n     of Manufacturers on Health Services for the Aged Under the \n     Social Security Insurance System, 87th Congress, 1st Session, \n     1961, U.S. Congress, House Committee on Ways and Means.\n       ``Reform entails phasing out Medicare for those young \n     enough to invest privately and to accumulate enough funds to \n     provide for their own medical care upon retirement.''\n       ``The only viable long-term solution to the Medicare crisis \n     lies in encouraging all Americans to save today for their \n     future health care needs. Only private solutions can reduce \n     the future Medicare cost burden. . . .''--Citizens for a \n     Sound Economy Economic Perspective: Medicare's Self-\n     Destruction, January 22, 1993.\n       The Coalition to Raid Medicare . . . for tax breaks and \n     higher profits.\n       A review of the organizations which make up the Coalition \n     to Save Medicare reveals that this is really a Coalition to \n     Raid Medicare of $270 billion over 7 years in order to pay \n     for billions in tax breaks for corporations and increased \n     profits for insurance companies.\n       Much of the $148.5 billion in tax breaks for corporations \n     will go to members of the National Association of \n     Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n       In the 1980's, before Congress passed tax reform in 1986, \n     many members of the National Association of Manufacturers and \n     the U.S. Chamber of Commerce paid zero federal income tax \n     because of tax breaks, shelters and loopholes. Many of these \n     companies could return to the days when they paid nothing \n     even in years of record profits . . . if the $270 billion in \n     cuts to Medicare proposed by Gingrich and Dole are enacted \n     (Citizens for Tax Justice, Return of the No Tax Corporation, \n     1995).\n       Most of the 12,500 corporations which belong to the \n     National Association of Manufacturers and the 215,000 \n     businesses affiliated with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce will \n     benefit greatly from the corporate tax breaks and loopholes \n     promised them by Gingrich and Dole in return for campaign \n     contributions, and paid for by devastating cuts to Medicare. \n     (Amounts based on estimates by the Joint Tax Committee of the \n     U.S. Congress)\n       Repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax--cost $22.1 \n     billion over 7 years.\n       Increased Corporate Write-Offs and Deductions--cost $47.8 \n     billion over 7 years.\n       Capital Gains Tax Breaks, Indexed to Inflation--cost $78.6 \n     billion over 7 years.\n       Total: $148.5 billion over 7 years.\n       The Alliance for Managed Care, Healthcare Leadership \n     Council, and the Council for Affordable Health Insurance will \n     be the beneficiaries of Medicare provisions which compel \n     millions of seniors to enroll in managed care networks or \n     face higher out of pocket costs. This could mean billions in \n     higher profits for these companies.\n       The Alliance for Managed Care is made up of four of the \n     largest managed care companies in the U.S.--Atena, CIGNA, \n     Prudential and MetraHealth. The Healthcare Leadership Council \n     is made up of the country's largest hospital corporations, \n     insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies. The Council \n     for Affordable Health Insurance is made up of some two dozen \n     medium sized insurance companies.\n       As large and mid-sized corporations, the members of the \n     Alliance for Managed Care, the Healthcare Leadership Council \n     and the Council for Affordable Health Insurance will also \n     share in the $148.5 billion in new corporate tax breaks.\n       Why Would Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole Help the Coalition's \n     Big Corporations and Insurance Companies Raid Medicare?\n       Since 1989 through the first quarter of 1995, the major \n     PACs affiliated with the Coalition to Raid Medicare have \n     given thousands of dollars to fuel the campaigns of Newt \n     Gingrich and Bob Dole:\n       The major PACs affiliated with the Coalition to Raid \n     Medicare have given $257,351 to Newt Gingrich since 1/89.\n       The major PACs affiliated with the Coalition to Raid \n     Medicare have given $222,600 to Bob Dole since 1/89.\n       The major PACs affiliated with the Coalition to Raid \n     Medicare have given a whopping $18,347,830 to Republican \n     members of Congress since 1/89, compared to $14,041,861 to \n     Democratic members over the same period.\n       These numbers vastly understate the amount of campaign cash \n     contributed by the Coalition to Raid Medicare to Gingrich and \n     Dole because there are literally thousands of companies and \n     individuals associated with NAM and the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce that are not included in the amounts above.\n       Also not counted are thousands in contributions to GOPAC--\n     Newt Gingrich's leadership PAC, and to Bob Dole's leadership \n     PAC and presidential campaign.\n       The Coalition to save Medicare--but not for senior \n     citizens.\n       Given that the vast majority of the 35 million Americans \n     who depend on Medicare today are senior citizens, it may come \n     as a surprise that the Coalition to Raid Medicare \n\n[[Page S11978]]\n     has only one member that purports to advocate for the interests of \n     senior citizens--the Seniors Coalition. The Coalition to Raid \n     Medicare has even named Jake Hansen, chief lobbyist for the \n     Seniors Coalition, a cochair of the group.\n       But the seniors Coalition is a sham . . . here's the \n     reality behind the Seniors Coalition and Jake Hansen:\n       The Seniors Coalition--Expert Advocates for the Interests \n     of Seniors?\n       ``Hansen confirmed that the coalition's three-member board \n     was still largely made up of experts in direct mail fund-\n     raising: two board members are experts in direct mail fund-\n     raising, the third in printing'' (Milwaukee Journal, May 16, \n     1993).\n       The Seniors Coalition was founded in 1989 by arch-\n     conservative direct mail guru Richard Viguerie and Dan and \n     Fay Alexander, a couple under investigation by the U.S. \n     Attorney, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the FBI to \n     determine if they used ``the non-profit, tax exempt group for \n     their personal gain.''\n       The Fay's teenage daughter Susan Alexander served as \n     president of the Seniors Coalition for its first three years \n     because, according to the New York Times, ``Mr. Alexander \n     said this was because it was hard to find outsiders of any \n     stature to serve on the board in view of his criminal \n     record'' (New York Times, Nov. 12, 1992 and National Journal, \n     Sept. 4, 1993).\n       The Seniors Coalition has been investigated by the Attorney \n     General of New York as part of a network of organizations \n     involved in ``a pattern of fraud and abuse,'' (New York \n     Times, Nov. 12, 1992). The organization was fined by the \n     Pennsylvania State Attorney General and forced to contribute \n     $9,000 to a legitimate senior's charity organization, the \n     Pennsylvania Alzheimer's Association (PR Newswire, Oct. 30, \n     1993). The Seniors Coalition is barred from soliciting in the \n     state of Maryland for failing to disclose financial data as \n     required by law (Washington Post, Oct. 6, 1992).\n       Hansen was hired in 1990 as the organization's lobbyist \n     after serving as, among other things, director of the NCPAC-\n     related ``Anybody But Church'' effort which targeted pro-\n     senior Senator Frank Church for defeat in 1980. Hansen later \n     directed a coalition which opposed the ``Catastrophic \n     Medicare Coverage Act of 1988'' and whose scare tactics \n     included dire direct mail warnings that Medicare \n     beneficiaries would pay higher taxes to cover AIDS patients \n     under Medicare, a claim he later was forced to admit was a \n     gross exaggeration (St. Petersburg Times, ``Scare Tactics \n     Used Against Catastrophic Coverage Law,'' Oct. 22, 1989).\n       A few things you should know about who else is behind the \n     Coalition to raid Medicare.\n\n\n                      citizens for a sound economy\n\n       In addition to being a longtime foe of Medicare (see page \n     5) and one of six members of a 1993 anti-health care reform \n     coalition called Citizens Against Rationing Health (CARH), \n     among Citizens for a Sound Economy's most generous backers is \n     David Koch, chairman of CSE's foundation, and cochairman of \n     Koch Industries, ``the nation's second largest, privately \n     held company, with its hands in everything from refining to \n     ranching'' and ``the silent giant in the oil and gas \n     industry'' (Houston Chronicle, Dec. 27, 1992). Between 1986 \n     and 1990, the three charitable foundations controlled by Koch \n     Industries contributed $4.8 million to CSE (Milwaukee \n     Journal, May 16, 1992).\n       The Board of Directors is made up largely of corporate CEOs \n     and conservative activists, suggesting that the \n     organization's true name should be Corporations for a Sound \n     Economy. Koch Industries and the rest of CSE's board stand to \n     gain millions in new tax breaks and loopholes at the expense \n     of cuts to projected Medicare spending.\n\n\n                        national taxpayers union\n\n       In 1993, the National Taxpayers Union was an integral part \n     of a coalition called ``Citizens Against Rationing Health \n     (CARH), a far right organization whose mission was to defeat \n     health care reform, and affiliated with arch-conservative \n     Floyd Brown (creator of the infamous Willie Horton TV spot in \n     the 1988 Presidential race) and Richard Viguerie, the far-\n     right direct mail guru (see Seniors Coalition, above).\n\n\n                council for affordable health insurance\n\n       The Council for Affordable Health Insurance is made up of \n     some two dozen small and mid-size insurance companies who are \n     responsible for the worst type of practices that rob \n     Americans of health care security, including: cherry-picking, \n     dropped coverage, exclusion for pre-existing conditions, \n     redlining, refused claims and exorbitant rate hikes. A chief \n     goal of the Council for Affordable Health Insurance: \n     ``Preserving medical underwriting and eliminating proposals \n     that would force insurers to cover all that seek coverage'' \n     (Health Manager's Update, April 1, 1992).\n       The history of the member companies of the Council for \n     Affordable Health Insurance does not suggest they are well-\n     prepared to be part of an effort to ``preserve and strengthen \n     Medicare'' as part of the Coalition to ``Save'' Medicare, as \n     some examples demonstrate:\n       The Golden Rule Insurance Co. of Lawrenceville, IL sought \n     an annual rate hike of 86 percent in one year for individual \n     major medical coverage (Indianapolis Business Journal, April \n     10, 1989).\n       The Life of American Insurance Co. of Houston, TX was rated \n     one of the 15 worst insurance companies in Texas for two \n     years running (Houston Business Journal, May 20, 1991).\n       The American Chambers Life Insurance Co. of Naperville, IL \n     dropped coverage in 1993 for infants stricken with congenital \n     abnormalities (St. Louis Post Dispatch, Feb. 28, 1993).\n       The GEM Insurance Co. of St. Lake City, UT has repeatedly \n     denied coverage for preexisting conditions, which millions of \n     seniors citizens on Medicare will have (BNA Pensions & \n     Benefits Daily, April 13, 1992).\n                                                                    ____\n\n    Fact Sheet--Insurance Industry-Republican Alliance to Dismantle \n                    Medicare: A Question of Profits\n\n             (From the Office of Senator Edward M. Kennedy)\n\n       Powerful special interests with a stake in the Republican \n     plan to cut Medicare and force senior citizens into private \n     insurance recently formed the so-called ``Coalition to Save \n     Medicare.'' Two major groups of insurers are among the \n     charter members: the Alliance for Managed Care and the \n     Council for Affordable Health Insurance. The Alliance for \n     Managed Care consists of the four largest insurance companies \n     in the U.S.--Aetna, CIGNA, Prudential, and Metrahealth, all \n     with major investments in managed care. The Council for \n     Affordable Health Insurance is composed of small and mid-\n     sized insurance companies who sell group and individual \n     insurance policies. Its membership includes companies such as \n     the Golden Rule Insurance Company, which are well-known for \n     profiting from abusive practices in the individual insurance \n     market, such as ``cherry-picking'' and the use of broad pre-\n     existing condition exclusions.\n     Insurance Company Revenues and profits\n       If all senior citizens leave conventional Medicare to buy \n     private insurance polices, insurance company premium revenue \n     would increase by $1.25 trillion over the next seven years--a \n     66-percent increase.\\1\\ If 50 percent buy private insurance \n     polices, the revenue increase would be $625 billion.\n       Private insurance company profits would increase by $38 \n     billion over the budget period if all senior citizens join \n     private insurance plans. Profits would increase by $19 \n     billion if 50 percent join.\\2\\\n       If insurance companies achieve the same return as the \n     Golden Rule Insurance Company is able to reach on its \n     individual insurance business, insurance industry profits \n     would increase by $76 billion if all senior citizens join, an \n     increase of 133 percent.\\3\\\n     Profits for Managed Care Insurance Companies Like Those in \n         the Alliance for Managed Care\n       If the number of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed \n     care increases to 25 percent of all beneficiaries, profits of \n     managed care companies would rise by $10.2 billion over the \n     budget period.\\4\\\n       If the number of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed \n     care increases to 50 percent, profits of managed care \n     companies would rise by $26.3 billion over the budget period.\n     Profits for Companies Offering Medical Savings Accounts\n       The Golden Rule Insurance Company is an industry leader in \n     promoting medical savings accounts.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2303.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   .\n       Section 1864 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b)--\n       (A) in paragraph (2), by striking ``twenty'' and inserting \n     ``40'';\n       (B) in paragraph (3), by striking ``ten'' and inserting \n     ``20'';\n       (C) in paragraph (4), by striking ``if damage exceeding \n     $10,000 to the property of any individual results,'' and \n     inserting ``if damage to the property of any individual \n     results or if avoidance costs have been incurred exceeding \n     $10,000, in the aggregate,''; and\n       (D) in paragraph (4), by striking ``ten'' and inserting \n     ``20'';\n       (2) in subsection (c) by striking ``ten'' and inserting \n     ``20'';\n       (3) in subsection (d), by--\n       (A) striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (2);\n       (B) striking the period at the end of paragraph (3) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (C) adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) the term `avoidance costs' means costs incurred by \n     any individual for the purpose of--\n       ``(A) detecting a hazardous or injurious device; or\n       ``(B) preventing death, serious bodily injury, bodily \n     injury, or property damage likely to result from the use of a \n     hazardous or injurious device in violation of subsection \n     (a).''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end thereof the following:\n       ``(e) Any person injured as the result of a violation of \n     subsection (a) may commence a civil action on his own behalf \n     against any person who is alleged to be in violation of \n     subsection (a). The district courts shall have jurisdiction, \n     without regard to the amount in controversy or the \n     citizenship of the parties, in such civil actions. The court \n     may award, in addition to monetary damages for any injury \n     resulting from an alleged violation of subsection (a), costs \n     of litigation, including reasonable attorney and expert \n     witness fees, to any prevailing or substantially prevailing \n     party, whenever the court determines such award is \n     appropriate.''.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the amendment I send to the desk today for \nthe Senate's consideration is one that is the result of what I think \ncan best be known as ecoterrorism and the reaction that this Congress \nand this Senate some years ago had to that very problem. The issue is \nknown as tree spiking.\n  Mr. President, for some years individuals and interest groups that \nhave opposed the legitimate, lawful timber sales on our public lands \nhave oftentimes actually gone onto the land and into the trees and \nspiked them, sometimes with metal spikes, hoping that the sawyer who \nwent in to cut the tree would hit it with his saw blade and stop. And \nin some instances the chains came loose from those saws and killed or \nmaimed the individual sawyer. That happens to be a Federal property, a \nFederal tree.\n  Now they are using porcelain spikes because, of course, metal spikes \ncould be detected by a metal detector. They use porcelain spikes. They \ncannot be detected. Either the sawyer hits the spike or as the tree got \nto the mill and as the tree went through the process of being cut, \noftentimes the saw blade at the mill, the large band saw hit this \nporcelain spike and shattered and sent flying metal shrapnel all over \nthe mill and has killed or maimed additional workers.\n  So, some years ago, the Congress said that is every bit as much an \nact of terrorism as it would be to put a bomb in front of a Federal \nbuilding. So, therefore, we passed laws requiring certain penalties as \na result of that. That occurred in 1988. My predecessor, Jim McClure, \nhad passed Public Law 100-690.\n  What I do today is to close a loophole in that law that the courts \nargued existed as it related to the cumulative damages and the ability \nof the courts to prosecute an individual who was found guilty of tree \nspiking. The closure of the loophole in the current law, which caused \nthe courts to throw it out, needs to happen. I am provoked into doing \nthis because of recent reports in my State, again, by unnamed groups \ncalling themselves fictitious names, announcing that they have spiked \ncertain timber sales. Of course, their desire is to keep those timber \nsales from being sold by the U.S. Forest Service or it to be bid. As a \nresult of that, that causes tremendous difficulty.\n  In the last 10 years, there have been 44 incidents of tree spiking. \nThere have been 21 cases of major machinery damage, and there has been \nthe loss of a life. That is why we acted in 1988 as we did, and why I \nam asking the Senate today to close the loophole by including the \nthreshold of $10,000 of preventive costs required to prosecute a case \nin Federal court. The difference is between actual cost and preventive \ncost, because the court said it was the costs of the loss of a piece of \nequipment or, in the case of the loss of a life, of course, that was a \ndifferent issue.\n  What happens is oftentimes the Forest Service--but especially private \ncompanies who have brought these sales--spend a lot of money trying to \ndetect if these sales of trees have been spiked. And that costs \nconsiderably more than $10,000, but it could never be used as an \naccumulative cost in the court's deliberation.\n  So my amendment allows these cumulative or preventive costs to be \nincluded in the threshold, and, of course, it also allows for the judge \nin his penalties greater flexibility in bringing the penalties down on \nthe individual if the individuals are found guilty.\n  I hope the Senate will join with me in agreeing that this is a \nFederal law that not only deserves to be preserved but deserves to be \nstrengthened because those kinds of incidents still go on today, and \nthey are every bit an act of terrorism whether they are the spike in \nthe trees or the bomb in front of the Federal building. They are \nFederal properties and they can, and have, cost life.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to say the Senator from Idaho \nbrings up an important point and one with a great deal of merit. If it \nwas simply up to me, I would accept the amendment and go on. But I \nbelieve that we should recognize that it is clearly possible that this \nmight be a contentious amendment and that there may be Members who \ndisagree with the points made by the Senator from Idaho.\n  So at this point, I would really like to put the Senate on notice \nthat the amendment has been presented and ask that, if there are any \nobjections to the amendment, they be communicated to either me or to \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  I hope that we can lay this amendment aside also and go on to \nsomething else until we find out whether or not anyone wants to debate \nagainst this amendment or to have a rollcall on it.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I do not want to impede progress here. I \nsimply rise to give a thank you to our distinguished chairman, the \nmanager of the bill. I want to thank the distinguished Senator for the \napproach he has taken to resolving a very, very complicated issue \nregarding Federal fish hatcheries.\n  The State of Arkansas has developed the Federal fish hatchery system \nto the extent that trout fishing now in our State is one of the major \nbusinesses that we have. It brings hundreds of thousands of tourists, \nfisherpersons, into our State.\n  We also have the unique situation of mitigation that arose when the \nFederal Government dammed up some very beautiful rivers and streams \nsome time back. And the mitigation aspect is that, if the Government \ndams up those streams and basically makes unavailable other types of \nfish, they will make available a substitute--in this case, trout.\n  It has worked out very well for the Federal Government. It has worked \nout exceptionally well for our State system. And we collect millions of \ndollars \n\n[[Page S11980]]\nin taxes and revenues from this. It is a win-win for everyone.\n  In recent months the Federal Government, the Department of the \nInterior, Fish and Wildlife, in an attempt to cut some costs have \nthought about closing some of these fish hatcheries. I know the \ndistinguished occupant of the chair probably has some of the same \nproblems that we have in the State of Arkansas.\n  My colleague, Senator Bumpers, and I held a town meeting near one of \nthese hatcheries. In fact, it was on April Fool's Day, April 1. Truly, \nwe had an overflow crowd. I must say that 99 percent of the people who \nattended this town meeting on the possibility of closing these \nhatcheries were extremely bewildered that it was even under \nconsideration to close these fish hatcheries. They are money-making \noperations for our State. They certainly create revenues for the \nFederal Government.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I want to thank my friends for working out \nwhat we think is a temporary solution to the closing of the fish \nhatcheries by making available in this legislation what I consider to \nbe a moratorium, at least until next March, on the closing of any fish \nhatcheries in our country.\n  During that time, we will work with the distinguished chairman. We \nwill do everything possible to negotiate and with our ultimate bottom \nline of convincing those in authority, Fish and Wildlife Service, \nMembers of the House and Senate on committees that appropriate the \nmoney for these fish hatcheries, to show them what a win-win situation \nthis Federal fish hatchery program has been.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator and look forward to working with \nhim over the next several months.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas is most gracious \nand is the kind of Senator with whom it is a pleasure to work. He makes \nme want to agree with him.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for about \n7 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/09/senate-section/article/S11979-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to return to a topic which has \nbeen talked about and discussed on the floor this morning but which \neven more intensely will be talked about a lot over the next 3 weeks; \nthat is, our Medicare system.\n  It is a system, a program that, as a physician, I have been involved \nin in a very intimate way--as a physician with patients--every day for \nthe last 15 years of my life. I have taken care of and worked, in a \ndoctor-patient relationship, with individuals who rely on Medicare,\n who expect to have Medicare help them, be with them for the remainder \nof their lives and for that next generation. But shortly after coming \nto Washington, just 8 months ago now, there became very clear to me a \nmessage which most Americans do not understand--my patients did not \nunderstand, Tennesseans do not understand, and Americans do not \nunderstand, but it is something about which people in Washington say, \n``Well, it is not that big a deal,'' but it is a big deal for the \nAmerican people. And that is that Medicare is going broke and will be \nbankrupt in 7 years unless we act and act now and not just tinker with \nthe system and make some little fine-tuning.\n\n  That is not going to do it. We will be in the same situation next \nyear. And what is different this year and the next short-term 2 years \nis that within 18 months we are going to be spending more in the \nMedicare trust fund than is coming in, and in 7 years that trust fund \nwill be bankrupt.\n  We are not going to be talking about less Medicare; we are going to \nbe talking about no Medicare for our senior citizens.\n  The story is told so clearly, and it is in this little booklet. This \nlittle booklet I want every American, all of our Senators, all of our \nCongressmen and Congresswomen to read. It is the report of the Medicare \ntrustees, the Medicare board of trustees which consists of three \nmembers of the President's Cabinet. It says in very clear terms--and \nlet me quote from it--``The Medicare program is clearly unsustainable \nin its present form.''\n  It says, and I quote, ``We strongly''--the Medicare trustees, \nbipartisan, including three members of the President's Cabinet--\n``recommend that the crisis presented by the financial condition of the \nMedicare trust funds be urgently addressed on a comprehensive basis, \nincluding a review of the program's financing methods, benefit \nprovisions and delivery mechanisms.'' It is said right here in this \nbook Medicare is going to be bankrupt unless we do something.\n  Based on these facts, the Medicare trustees urged that the program be \naddressed and addressed immediately, and the gravest danger to this \nprogram and to the Nation's seniors who depend on it is continuation of \nthe status quo and doing nothing.\n  My second point is that Republicans are responding to this urgent \ncall. It is being addressed straight up front, in very direct fashion. \nNo longer can the trust fund tolerate growth of 10.5 percent. The plan \nthat we have put on the table is to allow it to still grow but allow it \nto grow at 6.4 percent. Thus, we are not cutting Medicare. It is not a \ncut in Tennessee when you are going to spend more next year and the \nyear after that and the year after that, yet we see propaganda coming \nout from across the aisle and from the White House saying each county \nis being cut.\n  Each county is going to receive more in Medicare next year and not \nless. In 1995, Medicare will spend $178 billion. In 2002, under the \nRepublican plan, that spending will exceed $273 billion--a 54-percent \nincrease.\n  What does it boil down to on an individual basis? It means that this \nyear in Medicare we are spending about $4,800 per individual; 7 years \nfrom now we are going to be spending $6,700. That is an increase of 40 \npercent between now and the year 2002.\n  So let us get our terminology straight. Let us shoot straight with \nthe American people so that we can engage in a dialog that will truly \nbe beneficial to the current generation to preserve Medicare, to \nprotect Medicare and to strengthen the program so that it will be there \nnot just for this generation but that next generation.\n  I think the message really needs to be made very clear to the \nAmerican people that, No. 1, Medicare is going bankrupt, and No. 2, \nthat there is something we can do but it has to be a dialog.\n  Over the next several weeks, we as Republicans are going to continue \nto listen--to listen to the providers, to listen to the senior \ncitizens, to listen to all Americans, bring everybody to the table so \nthat we together in a bipartisan way can work to solve what is a \nsignificant challenge, but it is a challenge we must face because \nwithout that the Medicare Program will be bankrupt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know that the distinguished manager of \nthe bill is waiting for other matters to be brought up. I am just going \nto speak very briefly on a matter that will be coming up this morning.\n  There will be a debate on what level of funding we have for the \nNational Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the \nHumanities. There is no question in my mind that some would like to \neliminate both of them. Some have said this will be a trophy on their \nwall if this new Congress were to eliminate the National Endowment for \n\n[[Page S11981]]\nthe Arts and eliminate the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n  It will not be stated quite that way. There will not be a vote up or \ndown on the floor of the Senate or the floor of the House to eliminate \nthem this year because this would not pass. What it would be is a case \nof dramatically cutting their budgets this year, dramatically cutting \ntheir budgets next year and then, like the Cheshire cat in ``Alice in \nWonderland,'' it will disappear, only the smile will be there--and not \neven that. In fact, something other than a smile will be there. There \nwill be the disappointed faces of the people in the Northeast Kingdom \nof Vermont, in the little towns of Vermont that have had art brought to \nthem in a way that they never could have otherwise except for the \nNational Endowment for the Arts.\n  These are the towns, Mr. President, when Vermont celebrated its \nbicentennial, where the Vermont Symphony Orchestra, an orchestra that \nhas received grants from the national endowments, was able to perform \nin every one of the communities of Vermont. Some of these communities \nare 38 people. Victory, VT, has 38 people. Burlington, VT, our largest \ncommunity, has 38,000. It is 1,000 times larger and still one of the \nsmallest communities in the country. But at the very least, at the very \nleast, a soloist was at each one of them, and some of them the whole \nsymphony orchestra was there.\n  This might not seem like much for those of us who are literally able \nto walk from here to the Kennedy Center or Constitution Hall or a \nnumber of other places to hear wonderful symphonies or watch great \nplays or listen to some of the noted historians or writers of our \ncountry. But we sit here, making nearly $135,000 a year, able to walk \ndowntown and see anything we want. While these small towns in the \nNortheast Kingdom, with a per capita income that is one of the lowest \nin the country, if they are going to see it, it will be with the help \nof the national endowments, either the arts or the humanities.\n  The same can be said in all 50 of our States. Historians who have \nwritten, educators who have gotten their views to a wider audience \nthrough the National Endowment for the Humanities. Art that was \navailable at one time in this country only to the monied and \nintellectually gifted elite, is now available to all of us. Suddenly \nthose who considered themselves the elite, find that perhaps they were \nnot as knowledgeable as those who had been closed off from the arts \nbefore.\n  We are, as I said, in other areas, the most wealthy, powerful Nation \non Earth. Are we going to be the only major Nation on Earth that does \nnot give support to its arts, does not give support to its humanities? \nI have heard Americans stand up so many times and say, ``I am an \nAmerican. We know what is best.'' And we look at people from other \ncountries, whatever country you want to fill in, and say, ``Boy, if \nthey only had the advantages we do.''\n  But so many times, these people have the advantages of much more \nancient cultures. They have the advantage of the arts and the \nhumanities that are helped by their governments, by their countries. \nThis is not a case where we are talking about the Government somehow \nsponsoring or directing the arts and humanities. It is all of us, \nbecause all of us are the Government--260 million Americans. And we can \nsay to our elected representatives, we want as much of the great arts \nand the great humanities and the great thinkers and the great geniuses \nof our country available to all of us as Americans. Whether we live in \nthe Northeast Kingdom of Vermont or in metropolitan New York City or in \nLos Angeles or in a tiny town in Oklahoma, we can all have it \navailable, at least to the extent possible. And in areas where we are \ngoing into wider access, with the Internet on through, we should be \nencouraging even more.\n  Now, Mr. President, does that mean that every single artist ever \nhelped, every single writer ever helped, every single musician ever \nhelped is going to be somebody I agree with, or the distinguished \nPresiding Officer or the distinguished manager of the bill agrees with? \nAbsolutely not. Absolutely not, just as I suspect that during the era \nof DeMedici, there are those who said that the Michelangelos and the \nDaVincis and the others of the era did things that they did not agree \nwith.\n  I think some of the people who even today criticize some of the great \nAmerican novels of our country, those of Mark Twain and others--we know \nthe reaction in Ireland to James Joyce's writings. We know the reaction \nin other parts of the world to writings that are now considered \nclassics. We think of the scandal of the Goya nudes. We think of the \nscandals and the reaction against paintings of people like Van Gogh, \nwho died in poverty. Yet, now we look at them and say what great steps \nforward. And ``Guernica,'' Picasso's great cry against the evils of \nfascism, when that first came out people said, ``That is terrible.'' \nNow whenever displayed, everybody lines up to see it.\n  So what I am saying, Mr. President, is our country is marked as much \nnot just by our strength and our manufacturing, not just by our \nstrength of the military, not even by the strength of the security of \nour unprotected but impregnable borders; our strength is also in our \nideas, our art, and our accessibility of them to all of us. Not to some \nivory-towered intellectual elite, because we are a country that has \nnever put great stock in that. We are a country that puts great stock \nin our people, all our people. We must continue to make the arts and \nhumanities available to all our people.\n  I see my distinguished colleague from Vermont and I tell him that \nwhen I started speaking, there was nobody seeking recognition. I \nthought perhaps we could start this up. So I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the remarks of the Senator from Vermont \nare totally appropriate. We are in the process of what I hope will be a \nsuccessful attempt to work out changes in the appropriations bill to be \nadopted. I greatly appreciate the remarks that we have just heard.\n  I must say, Mr. President, I feel like the Grinch. I am here managing \na bill in which almost every account gets less money than it does for \nthe current year. And the arguments for each of these programs, taken \nin isolation of course, is a persuasive argument, one that persuades me \nexcept for the fact that there is no free lunch. Every extra dollar for \na program A must be taken out of program B. And most of the B's that \nhave been sought so far have been functions which are only funded by \nthe Federal Government, rather than grant functions, subsidies to the \nprivate sector, and the like. Nevertheless, I have every hope that we \nare going to be able to reach an accommodation on this.\n  The junior Senator from Vermont, who was equally interested in the \nissue, is here. And so I have invited him and the Senator from Rhode \nIsland to speak to these arts questions while we try to settle an \namendment which will be proposed later and which perhaps under those \ncircumstances can be accepted without further debate.\n  If the Senator from Vermont will withhold for just a moment, I have a \nunanimous-consent request with respect to the committee report. I will \nask that we take up and adopt the committee amendment that deals with \nthe endowment so that an amendment to that will be in order when we get \nit settled.\n  First, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a statement clarifying several provisions in the committee \nreport accompanying this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Senate Report 104-125 Clarifications\n\n       On page 38, the amount provided for Resource Valuation does \n     not include an increase of $600,000 for the marine minerals \n     program. The amount provided for marine minerals is the same \n     as the budget request, which is a $600,000 increase over \n     fiscal year 1995.\n       On page 46 of the report, there are a couple of corrections \n     to the table for Central Office operations. For the Assistant \n     Secretary for Indian Affairs, the Budget estimate column \n     should reflect ``0'', the Committee recommendation should be \n     ``2,168,000'', and the Change column should be \n     ``+2,168,000''. For Other general administration, the Budget \n     estimate column should be ``45,164,000'', the Committee \n     recommendation should ``$34,187,000'', and the Change column \n     should be ``-11,759,000''. The totals for General \n     Administration are correct as shown in the \n\n[[Page S11982]]\n     table. The general reduction of $24,700,000 for Central Office \n     operations is shown in the change column only. The general \n     reduction of $24,700,000 should be reflected in the Committee \n     recommendation column as well. The total for Central Office \n     operations in the Committee recommendation column is correct \n     and does include the $24,700,000 reduction.\n       On page 47 of the report under ``Other recurring \n     programs'', the Committee has assumed a reduction of \n     $2,373,000 for facilities operations and maintenance from the \n     budget request and $2,000,000 from the fiscal year 1995 \n     level.\n       On page 48 of the report under ``Nonrecurring programs'', \n     there should be no reduction mentioned for pay cost \n     absorption. The reduction for pay costs was taken as part of \n     the resources management and trust activities transferred to \n     the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians and are \n     reflected in the totals for that office.\n       On page 49 of the report, it is the intent of the Committee \n     that none of the reductions for Central Office operations be \n     applied against the two offices transferred to the Office of \n     the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs.\n       On page 80 of the report, a reduction of $4,000,000 is \n     indicated for fossil energy environmental restoration. This \n     reduction is to be taken from low priority projects that do \n     not present imminent threats to health and safety.\n       Also on page 80 of the report, except for $295,000 provided \n     for technical and program management support, the funds \n     provided for Cooperative Research and Development are to be \n     divided equally between the Western Research Institute and \n     the University of North Dakota Energy and Environmental \n     Research Center.\n       On page 82, with respect to funds provided for program \n     direction, no funds are to be reallocated between the various \n     facilities to implement Strategic Alignment Initiative \n     without prior approval of the Committee, consistent with the \n     reprogramming guidelines, which apply to organizational \n     changes.\n       On page 86 of the report, the second paragraph and third \n     paragraphs should be reversed in order.\n       On page 94, the amount provided for facilities and \n     environmental health support is $900,000 above the House \n     level and $1,201,000 above the budget request.\n       On page 138 of the report, there are a couple of \n     corrections to the table for Central Office operations.

Second, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we \nlay aside the pending amendment and take up the committee amendment \nfound on page 95, lines 19-21.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 95, lines 19 through 21, strike the following: ``, \n     subject to passage by the House of Representatives of a bill \n     authorizing such appropriation,''.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is the committee amendment dealing \nwith the endowment. The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], had objected \nto our taking that up last night. He has now withdrawn that objection \nif we adopt it under the same circumstances that we have adopted the \nother committee amendments. As a part of the overall text, it will be \nopen to amendment. So I do not believe there is any debate on it. I \nurge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The committee amendment on page 95, lines 19-21, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as has been pointed out by the \ndistinguished Senator from the State of Washington, we are in the \nprocess of trying to work out a solution to the very difficult \nquestions of the fundings of the National Endowment for the Arts and \nthe National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute for Museum \nServices.\n  This is critically important because we must make sure that these \nvery fine institutions survive. I am hopeful that we will reach an \nagreement, which will not make us all happy obviously, but which will \nallow us to go forward to reauthorize the endowments and to proceed on \nto conference, where we will at least know from both sides that the \nendowments will survive as will the museums services.\n  So I think that is all of our desires. This is a very volatile issue \nand yet an extremely important one. I note, for instance that this \ntopic of funding for the arts and humanities has made the cover of Time \nmagazine, and the article asks the question as to whether or not this \ninstitution, the Congress, will support the Endowments and recognize \nthe importance of that to our Nation.\n  Let me give us all a little bit of a briefing on where we have gone \nthis year relating to the concerns that have been expressed by Members. \nThey are primarily related to grants that have been approved by the \nendowments which are considered by the American public as being less \nthan acceptable, and concerns as they relate to the issue of \npornography.\n  This has been a plaguing matter, and we have tried to relieve the \npublic of anxiety over the years. To a large extent, we have prevailed \nin the sense that very few items, if any, have come to our attention in \nrecent years that in any way have offended the public.\n  But under the leadership of Senator Kassebaum in our committee this \nyear, we took up the Endowments and reauthorized them. In doing so, we \nalso changed the law such that the chance of having the American public \noffended by grants for projects that they consider less than acceptable \nis totally eliminated.\n  How have we done that? First of all, we have addressed the issue of \nindividual grants, where many of the problems have been. Individual \nartists are chosen by peer groups to be awarded a grant, and sometimes \nthe grantee, the person who gets the grant, does not necessarily come \nforth with the kind of art that was anticipated by the peers. Thus, we \nget into great disputes and embarrassments. As this body knows, we have \ndisplays on the floor showing the kind of art that was referred to and \nthe offensive aspects of it.\n  Under the leadership of Senator Kassebaum, we eliminated any \npossibility of that happening again. The individual grants to artists \nare limited only to the area of literature. That, in my opinion, goes a \nlittle too far, and it may end up being changed. Still, that action \ncertainly responds to those concerns that have been raised.\n  In addition to that, there have been problems with subgrants and some \nseasonal support grants where the NEA itself has no knowledge of what \nis going to be done with funds designated to an institution or for a \nseason of productions. Many times it is just administrative expenses \nthat have been supported by the national endowment. Yet, on the stage, \nif something occurs which is offensive and because there was a small \namount of money that was spread throughout the whole budget of the \ninstitution which allowed this to occur on the stage, the national \nendowments have taken the rap and gotten a bad name. Such examples have \nbeen eliminated from having the possibility of receiving funds.\n  There still will be grants available to individuals at the State \nlevel, and there will be a large number of challenge grants. All these \nthings that are presently allowed under the national endowments, all \nthe good works which have not proven to be offensive to anyone, will \nstill will be able to go forward.\n  On the other hand, unfortunately, due to these unfortunate matters, \nwe have seen efforts to totally do away with the endowments. With that \nin mind, and without knowing for certain as to how this will come out \nin the House and the Senate--the thing we want to do today, the most \ncritical \n\n[[Page S11983]]\nthing, is to make sure that the endowments continue as strongly as \npossible this next year.\n  We have in the committee, under the leadership of Senator Kassebaum, \nas I mentioned, changed the endowments significantly and have taken \nsteps to prevent those kinds of embarrassing matters from occurring in \nthe future. These changes were made to protect the public and protect \nthe endowments, and those changes that I mentioned before have now been \nincorporated into the text of the subcommittee appropriations bill.\n  So as well as appropriating funds to the endowments, we have changed \nthe current law to prevent the kinds of grants that have, in the past \ncaused a great deal of trouble.\n  Many of us would like the endowments to receive more money, and in \ntaking the action that we will today, I hope to assure that there will \nbe more money available to those agencies, as compared to what the \ncommittee has recommended. This is not the first time we have \nconfronted this type of crisis situation of severe budget cutting. \nFourteen years ago we faced such a crisis and an attempt to eliminate \nthe Endowments. We survived and survived with about half the funding. \nUnfortunately, that is nearly where we find ourselves today. For the \nendowments to exist, there is a great deal of pressure to try and make \nsure we do not end up having to account for or explain questionable \ngrants as we have had to in the past.\n  So I am hopeful we will reach a resolution which will be acceptable \nto Members and that we will not run the risk of losing the Endowments.\n  There are a number of Senators who have been helpful. At this time, I \nwould like to yield the floor so that Senator Pell, one of the great \ndefenders and also creators of the endowments, could make his remarks.\n  I want to, again, pay my respects to the incredible work that he has \ndone in the area of the arts and humanities and the museum services \nover the years. He kept them alive and strong and has defended them \nwith all the vigor possible.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Vermont \nfor his very nice words and say it was just about 30 years ago that the \nSenator from New York, Mr. Javits, and I were able to get this \nlegislation through. Those 30 years have gone very quickly. Many things \nhave happened, but I think judgment, in connection with the arts and \nhumanities, has been borne out.\n  The debate reminds me of a story I know concerning Winston Churchill. \nIn the darkest days of the Second World War when the outcome of the \nbattle, the conflict, was still unknown, a young staff assistant on the \nPrime Minister's staff found, to his shock, that the Government was \nfunding the British Arts Council throughout the war. He went dashing \noff to Mr. Churchill, informed him that he found more funds for the war \neffort and how extraordinary it was that scarce resources were going \nfor such a purpose when the empire was in the midst of a life-and-death \nstruggle. I am told Winston Churchill turned to the young man and \nreplied, ``I remind you, sir, it is exactly this for which we are \nfighting.''\n  I think this thought should remain in our minds as we discuss this \nissue. I think we should also bear in our mind whether we, as a Nation, \nwant to be remembered as Athens was or Sparta was. Athens was noted for \nits diversity of culture; Sparta noted for its armaments, weapons, and \nwarmaking ability. I think we would prefer to be remembered as an \nAthens and it is exactly that for which this legislation needs us.\n  Rather than being a subsidy for the rich, one of the primary missions \nof the NEA has been to encourage the spread of American culture beyond \nthose individuals, communities, and regions rich enough to afford it.\n  Uncharacteristically among Federal programs, endowment dollars \nmultiply and foster national support for the arts. The early endowment \ngrants drew matching grants of about $1.5 billion in private, State, \nand local patrons. It is true that without the NEA and the NEH we would \nstill have our history, literature and art. But these things would be \nreserved for those who can afford it. I think it is unfair to our \ncitizens and for some individuals to assert that only wealthy Americans \nare interested in the development of the arts. I know as one Senator, I \nbelieve and the evidence supports the fact that Americans from every \nwalk of life, from every economic level, strongly desire to seek access \nto cultural events in their own home communities.\n  From an economic viewpoint, the dollars sent by the arts endowment to \ncommunities around our Nation have been a very successful investment. \nFor every dollar the endowment invests, there is created a tenfold \nreturn in jobs, services, and contracts.\n  The arts, fostered by the national endowment, encourage national and \ninternational tourism, attract and retain businesses in our \ncommunities, stimulate real estate development, increase the production \nof exportable copyright materials and, most important, contribute to \nour tax base.\n Governors and mayors from around the Nation can attest to the manner \nin which the endowment-supported projects have breathed new life into \nthe downtown areas of their towns and cities. New businesses and \ntourists congregate in those areas which have developed a cultural \nlife. San Antonio, Cleveland, Greenville, Oklahoma City, and Birmingham \nare among the cities studies have shown the enormous economic \ncontribution of the arts.\n\n  Rather than being a subsidy for the rich, this has as its primary \nmission the encouragement of American culture beyond any small circle \nof those able to afford it. It is true that without the NEA and the NEH \nwe would still have a history, literature, and art, but it would be \nreserved for those who could afford it.\n  All told, I can think of no legislation that would, for less money, \nadd more to the quality of life for our citizens and our communities.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this legislation, and that as \nthe years go on we will have increased it and emphasized it. It has \nbeen 30 years since we started, 30 years since on the Senate floor some \nof us have advocated it. I hope that 30 years from now, down the road, \nwe will continue to spend money on the arts and we will be known as not \nonly a great Nation and a superpower, but known as the Athens of the \nworld, the leader in the arts, humanities, literature, poetry, \npainting, and the like.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to my friend \nSenator Pell, who through the years has been such an extraordinary \nsupporter of the arts--music, theater, visual arts, the performing \narts. He is an extraordinary man, a gentle man, and a gentleman. And I \nalso pay tribute to Senator Jeffords, who must just be listed as \ntotally consistent, totally steady, totally fair as he pursues this \ngreat interest of his.\n  As for me, I, too, have found the arts and music and history and the \nvisual and performing arts to be a very important part of my life. If \npolitics is your sole reason for existence, it is a very barren \nexperience, a rather barbaric experience. For me, the arts and music \nare the salvation, the softening of the edges of what we do here. And \nso, throughout the years, I have tried my level best to support these \nprojects and programs, and I do thank Senator Pell and Senator \nJeffords.\n  I think this is an excellent amendment, restoring a total of $17 \nmillion in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and for the \nInstitute of Museum Services, which is a very small agency that does \nvery big work.\n  I think we have to commend Jane Alexander, a remarkably astute, \nbright, effervescent lady who knows what the problems of the NEA are \nand has sought to correct them, and has done a magnificent job of that. \nAlso Sheldon Hackney of the National Endowment of the Humanities knows \nthe problems, perceives them, intelligently looks at them, and has to \nsuffer, along with Jane Alexander, the slings and arrows of an \noutrageous fortune, especially when he proposes something, I think, as \nvital as having a ``National Conversation,'' which would be well worth \n\n[[Page S11984]]\ndoing, so that instead of the subterranean dealings with issues such as \nimmigration and racism and homosexuality, we would discuss those things \nin a national conversation, where people could come into a civil \nsurrounding and talk instead of just saying the most evil thing and \nwriting the most outrageous columns--doing all the divisive things that \nare done in this remarkable arena.\n  I think this is an excellent step. I am proud to cosponsor it. The \namendment is budget neutral. We would offset the funds, as indicated in \nthe amendment, by striking at administrative costs. Many smaller \nprograms are exempted from this reduction, as is the Park Service and \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs. We realize those two offices have taken \nsome pretty good shots. It is all there. Many of my colleagues who \nsupport the arts may be feeling the pressure in this year of budget \nconstraint. But even if we pass this important amendment, the arts \nendowments will have taken a very tough hit, a full 30-percent cut--the \ndeepest in the bill.\n  Without this amendment, State grants at the NEA will be reduced by 30 \npercent, and ``national significance'' grants will be slashed by more \nthan 50 percent. I believe that is a very high, very inequitable \nreduction that does not accurately reflect the usual thoughtful \nsentiment of this body.\n  I understand all of the difficulties. I commend Senator Gorton, a \nsteady, thoughtful person, who listens to all of us, hears our pleas, \nwhich finally turn into plaintive wails or peals for assistance from on \nhigh; and Senator Byrd, who listens so patiently and wisely to all of \nthis, and has, for so many years. He is absolutely tireless and is \nexceedingly fair in his work.\n  The fact is, in my State, direct Federal grants from the arts \nagencies provide critical funding for marvelous institutions that are \nseen and visited by people all over the United States. There are the \nBuffalo Bill Historical Center in Cody; the Grand Teton Music Festival, \nin its 7 weeks of performance in the beauty of Jackson Hole, where we \nhave previously hosted the New York Philharmonic in residence for 2 \nweeks during our centennial year; the University of Wyoming Art Museum; \nthe Mountain Man Museum; the Nicolaysen Museum, and in Southwest \nWyoming; Green River; Rock Springs, all are receiving funding. There \nare hundreds of smaller programs that we do not see, and these \nendowments enrich the lives of so many Americans, particularly those in \nrural communities or ``frontier'' communities such as Wyoming.\n  The State art grants that find their way to small towns are also used \nat schools and local festivals. One found its way into the use of an \n``art mobile'' at the University of Wyoming--my vital wife Ann was so \nvery active in that--where you take original art, such as etchings, \nwater colors, oils, out ``on the road'' to tiny towns where young \npeople walk up and say, ``What is an etching? How do you do that?''\n  And you say, ``Well, you take a copper plate and either do it in dry \npoint, or you do this by pouring acid in there and that eats those \nlines out, and then you put ink in there and place paper there, and you \npress it and pull it, and that is an etching.''\n  And they say, ``I did not know that!''\n  They might also say, ``What is dry point?'' ``What is gouache?'' \nThose things may mean nothing to some but to a kid, they may fire the \nimagination. That is what we should do.\n  People in rural areas simply do not have any access to the many \nprivately-funded cultural institutions that exist in larger cities. \nIndeed, it illustrates the bizarre irony of the argument that the \nendowments are ``welfare for the rich.''\n  Just let me conclude with a few of the programs that are supported by \nthe Wyoming Arts and Humanities Council. I will leave it up to my \ncolleagues to decide whether these programs provide ``welfare for the \nrich'':\n  An Arapaho language immersion program for preschoolers on the Wind \nRiver Indian Reservation;\n  A performance of the Bear Lake Music Festival Orchestra at Evanston \nHigh School;\n  A presentation of Handel's ``Messiah'' in Afton, WY, in the Star \nValley;\n  A theater production for people with physical and mental handicaps in \nRiverton;\n  ``Fiddler on the Roof'' presented in Sundance, WY;\n  Operating support for the famed drum and bugle corps, ``The Casper \nTroopers'';\n  Concert performances by ``The Grizzlies'' in Meeteetse, Torrington, \nSaratoga, and Encampment;\n  A ``Young Author's'' contest at Saint Stephens Indian School;\n  A fellowship for research on Shoshone Indian history;\n  A ``Centennial Singers'' performance in Baggs, WY;\n  A performance of the Utah Symphony in Wind River;\n  Musical workshops and a concert at the Chugwater Attendance Center;\n  Fellowship to research child development at the former Heart Mountain \nJapanese Relocation Center;\n  Lectures by biblical archaeologists presented by the UW religious \nstudies committee;\n  Operating funds for the ``Traveling Western Art Exhibit'' in Green \nRiver;\n  A Wyoming territorial park exhibit of the first women to serve as \nmembers of common law juries;\n  Support for the children's theater in Thermopolis;\n  A jazz festival in Powell;\n  To bring a visiting artist to Pinedale;\n  A guest lecture on ``The Oregon Trail'' in Medicine Bow;\n  A folk dance performance in Dubois; and\n  Over 100 grants to elementary and secondary schools for arts in \neducation.\n  A program at the former Heart Mountain Japanese Relocation Center. \nThat ought to be studied. This is where our fellow citizens were placed \nbehind barbed wire in 1943. They were not aliens, they were not \npermanent resident aliens; they were U.S. citizens put behind wire. \nThat is where I first met Congressman Norm Mineta. We were together in \nthe Boy Scouts--he behind the wire, and me in the town of Cody. \nInteresting times. The two of us have shared much together in talking \nabout it and remembering it.\n  The people who attend these events are not ``highbrow elitists.'' \nThey are genuine, hard-working, sensible folks whose lives are truly \nbrightened and improved by the work of the NEA and NEH. And today these \nfolks are provided enlightenment in a sea of the present shallowest, \ncoarsest television pop culture of the ages.\n  People certainly do actively participate in the arts. In the past 4 \nyears, more than 3 million people have attended NEA or NEA-supported \nevents or facilities in Wyoming alone. That is not too bad in a State \nwith only 476,000 people!\n  Yes, yes, there is always going to be the emotional debate regarding \nobscenity. We have all seen the grotesque--stupefying, actually--and \nexplicit photographs and listened to the very real concerns of many \nMembers of the Congress. But in nearly 30 years, with nearly 100,000 \ngrants, only a small handful of those projects have been controversial \nin any way. That is a pretty good track record, a handful of decisions \nin 30 years. I believe we could find a greater number of mistakes or \noversights in many more Federal agencies, or perhaps even in the \nCongress itself! We just might have made a mistake or two here in 30 \nyears. But that never receives the same level of intense scrutiny. In \ndirecting our displeasure, we should attack the cancer, not kill the \npatient.\n  The arts are an integral part of our society and serve as a unifying \nforce. We are all concerned about the economy and appropriate use of \ndollars. But this is a measure that I hope will pass.\n  I thank again Senator Gorton. I thank all those involved--Senator \nByrd. The Interior appropriations bill is all about conserving our \nNation's resources. I deeply believe the money we spend on our culture \nis no less important than the money we spend on our natural resources, \nour forests, our animals--the flora, the fauna--and our energy. This \nbill provides a great deal of taxpayers' money to conserve those \nnatural riches. We should make a similar Federal commitment to \nstimulate and preserve fully our Nation's varied cultural treasures and \nriches.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank particularly the managers of the bill \nfor their extraordinary patience and courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  \n[[Page S11985]]\n\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, a technical point. I ask unanimous consent \nthe last committee amendment adopted on the National Endowment for the \nArts be considered as original text for the purpose of amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I simply want to pay tribute to the \nchairman of the subcommittee, the Senator from Washington, for the \nexpert and patient way in which he has dealt with this issue. It is my \nbelief the amendment that is going to be offered by the Senator from \nVermont is a salutary one. It is one I support and intend to vote for. \nIt is my understanding that it enjoys wide support in the body and \nwill, in all probability, be agreed to.\n  I want to repeat my own commitment to some kind of national presence \nwith respect to the arts. Senator Hutchison and I have introduced a \nbill that would create a single endowment, combining the National \nEndowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, \nin an effort to get more efficiency out of the overhead money connected \nwith these efforts. But I believe, for the same reasons the Senator \nfrom Wyoming has outlined, that cutting off all significant national \npresence in this area would be a mistake, and it would hit most \nheavily, ironically, in the more rural areas.\n  In the State of Utah we have a long history of commitment to the arts \nand involvement with the arts. It goes all the way back to Brigham \nYoung, the first Governor of the Territory of Utah, who, in their days \nof poverty, led the original settlers of Utah to build a theater and to \nrecognize the importance of the arts that early in their lives. That is \na tradition I am proud of and that I want to perpetuate here.\n  I simply want to make the point that Federal arts funding is not \nsufficient to sustain any of the groups that depend upon it. They all \nrequire much more private funding than they get from the Federal \nGovernment. The thing the Federal funding does is give, if you will, a \n``Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval'' to the fundraising efforts of \nthe locals, who are trying to support arts in the community. \nParticularly in rural areas, which abound in my State, there would be a \ndevastating effect on the fundraising efforts of local people if the \nimprimatur that comes from the NEA were to disappear.\n  For that reason I intend to vote for this amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to do likewise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to speak today more broadly \nabout the future of the National Endowment for the Arts as opposed to \nspeaking specifically on this amendment. I had earlier thought about \npossibly offering an amendment of my own which, if agreed to, would \nhave accomplished the objective of moving us in the direction of \nprivatization of the endowments--both the arts endowment as well as the \nhumanities endowment. For a variety of reasons, I have decided to \nwithhold at this time. If we do bring our bill to the floor, which has \npassed the Labor Committee, to authorize the endowments, I will \nprobably offer my amendment in that context where I think it would be \nmore appropriate. I also may, at a later date, bring it as a \nfreestanding amendment somewhere else, if I believe circumstances \nwarrant that.\n  I would like reflect here, today, a different viewpoint, to some \nextent, than that which we have heard; specifically, the viewpoint that \none can be pro-art, and a supporter of arts, and a believer that the \narts are important to this country, while not necessarily supporting \nthe notion that the Federal Government and taxpayer dollars ought to be \nused to support the endowment, or a similar national entity supporting \nthe arts.\n  I have given a lot of thought to this, because I do not come at this \nfrom the perspective of feeling we should diminish the role of the arts \nin our society. But as I talked to constituents and watched the debate \nand read the articles that have been referenced here, I have \nincreasingly come to the conclusion we are headed in the direction, \nultimately, that will be a lose-lose for America and specifically for \npeople who support the arts.\n  There are, obviously, a lot of arguments against the notion of \nFederal support in general. There is the philosophical question of \nwhether or not the Government has an appropriate role in supporting the \narts. I do not wish to address that today. There is obviously quite a \nlot of division on that.\n  But we are in an era of limited budget availability for all programs, \nand while certainly a case has been made by some that the arts, as a \npriority, should be high on the list, it is hard in an era where we are \nlimiting the growth of many important programs--whether it is Medicaid \nor Medicare or school lunches or anything else--that those priorities \nshould not come first.\n  In addition--and quite visibly in recent months, of course--we have \nhad questions once again raised about the funding of art projects or of \nartists or of entities which sponsor what clearly becomes objectionable \nexpressions of art. And whether it was the eating performances or the \nmore recent Horizons project in California, I think American taxpayers \nare rightfully upset when they see their dollars being used to \nsubsidize in part or in full what at least is claimed to be art but \nwhich, at least to them, is in fact objectionable and in some cases \nperceived to be obscene.\n  These issues will not go away. I think we, as the Congress, should \ntry to look at the long-range perspective here, not just the question \nof whether or not there are $99 million or $112 million next year in \nthe endowment's war chest. The fact is, these problems will continue. I \ndo not think halfway measures will work.\n  Consider where we are headed. Where we are headed now is in a \ndirection in which we both provide less funding than in the past for \nthe endowments, but with more strings, more hoops to jump through, more \nrestrictions on the kind of support that is going to be provided. It is \nmy belief that this approach will continue to make the money available \nto the arts scarcer--at least that from the Federal Government. And I \nbelieve we will continue to increase the amount of regulations on the \nendowments in the years ahead, because I think we are probably no more \nthan one or two additional objectionable projects away from a complete \nelimination of funding.\n  I think that is a lose-lose situation. It is a ``lose'' in the sense \nthe Federal support, or national support, for the arts will end in its \nentirety. And it will happen so suddenly there will not be an adequate \ntime of transition to deal with that cessation of support.\n  And the reason it will happen is because we cannot, in my judgment, \nin Congress ever successfully arbitrate the dispute which on the one \nhand has constituents calling and complaining to us that we should not \nbe providing taxpayer funds for what they consider to be obscenity or \nobjectionable art and on the other hand please the people who are \nbeneficiaries of this, be they the artists or museums or others who say \nwe should not censor the arts.\n  When Government gets into the middle of providing support and then \nplacing strings on the various grants that are given, we inevitably \nhave, I think, an impossible fine line to try to walk: the line that \nseparates obscenity on the one hand and censorship on the other.\n  So it is my view that all the intermediate steps, whether it is just \ngiving the money back to private institutions rather than individual \nartists or just giving the money to State councils or putting a lot of \nboards and regulations into place, all of these I think are going to \nappease for a short period of time only. And then another project will \ncome along that people find so objectionable that I think the \ngrassroots will rise up and cause a majority of people in the Congress \nto say ``enough is enough.'' Indeed, on the House side, I guess that is \nwhere they have already arrived.\n  So what I will be offering, as I say, at some point is an amendment \nthat I brought before our committee, the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, an amendment on a reauthorization bill which called for a \nprivatization of the national endowments, a privatization over a \nsufficiently lengthy period of time--5 years--that would give the \nendowments an opportunity to make the transition from Government \nfunding to private funding. It would proceed on a slow enough pace I \nthink for the entities to be able to develop \n\n[[Page S11986]]\nthe kind of financial resources necessary to continue to be national \nentities but to no longer be ones which had either, A, direct taxpayer \nsupport; or, B, a lot of Government censorship as part of their day-to-\nday regimen.\n  I know that some people question whether or not this is feasible. But \nthe fact of the matter is that today the role in terms of the funding \nthat we provide--that is, the Congress provides--the arts is a very \nsmall percentage of the total amount of funding that the arts receive \nannually. Indeed, it is less than 2 percent. Our $145 or $147 million, \nwhich was this year's funding level, is just a thimbleful of support \ncompared to what comes from private sources. Mr. President, over $9 \nbillion in support of the arts comes from private sources.\n  It seems to me that it is very likely and very feasible that a \nnational entity which would continue to provide the sort of national \nimprimatur that we have heard discussed here today would be able to \nraise the kinds of resources necessary to maintain a level of activity \nat least as vigorous as we currently have. Indeed, I would suggest that \na national entity, if it received as much support from the artists and \nthe arts community that we have seen evidenced in this debate, would be \nable to have even more resources available to support the causes that \nsuch a national entity decided to back.\n  So, Mr. President, without belaboring the issue at great length \ntoday, I will be coming back to this Chamber at some point with an \namendment which will outline a 5-year plan of privatization. I think \nthe net effect of that will be a win-win: a win in the sense that there \nwill remain a national entity providing the imprimatur of support for \nworthy arts projects across America; a win for the taxpayers in the \nsense that those who wish to continue supporting it could make \ncharitable contributions and receive tax deductions for those \ncharitable contributions, but the taxpayers who do not support the \nprogram will no longer be forced directly to support such an entity; \nand I think a win for the American people in general and for the arts \ncommunity in particular because I believe when it is over and that \nprocess is in place, that there will be more, not less, support \navailable from a national source to give those worthy projects the \nbacking they need to remain in existence.\n  Mr. President, I will be bringing this to the floor sometime in the \nnear future. I look forward to discussing it further with interested \ncolleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I want to explain what we are doing \nhere.\n  Our main concern and main desire and the purpose of this amendment is \nto ensure that the endowments go forward and that we will have in \nconference comparable bills which ensure the existence of the endowment \nand the Museum Services Institute. That is the essence of the amendment \nthough we may have a change in just how the offsets are crafted for the \nincrease in funding--but the level of the endowments will be raised to \n$110 million each.\n  Also, there are two amendments that were added at the request of \nSenator Helms dealing with pornography and dealing with the \ninappropriate depiction of religious items which will be made a part of \nthe agreement.\n  I am hopeful that by doing this we can lay to rest the fear that many \nhave that this Congress and the Senate in particular is going to step \nback from its commitment to the arts. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. And I hope with the near unanimity that we have on this \namendment it would indicate appropriate guidance with respect to what \nis a proper utilization of money from the arts endowment, an issue that \nSenator Helms has addressed with his language and idicate as well that \nthere is a desire to continue the operation of the endowments. The \nendowments will be operating at a greatly reduced level, though our \namendment today will put them at a significantly higher level than the \nHouse has offered. We will have to discuss that issue further in \nconference.\n  I should also like to point out how important the continuation of the \nendowments is. I will later make a part of the Record an article in the \nSmithsonian from May of this year: ``Deep in the North Country They \nDanced Their Hearts Out,'' which highlights the important ways \nendowment funds have been put to use.\n  Also, as I mentioned, Time magazine had on its cover this week an \nindication of how incredibly important it is for this Nation to stand \nbehind its commitment to the arts, for a nation without art and without \na commitment to the arts, is really a nation without soul. And it is \nimportant that that is demonstrated by Congress, in particular.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Jeffords, \nSimpson, Bumpers, and others in offering this amendment to strengthen \nthe National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities.\n  The debate over funding for the National Endowment for the Arts [NEA] \nand the National Endowment for the Humanities [NEH] is not about making \ntough budget choices. This is a debate over whether reason will prevail \nover hysteria.\n  The Federal deficit is out of control and Congress must continue to \nmake tough choices to get our fiscal books in order. But we are not \ngoing to balance the budget by eliminating Federal funding to the arts \nand humanities.\n  Opponents of Federal support for the cultural agencies have singled \nout a tiny fraction of the total grants provided across country as \nobjectionable. I, too, have found several of the projects which \nreceived funding personally disturbing.\n  But since when does Congress eliminate an entire agency for a few bad \ngrants? The Department of Defense would have been abolished long ago if \nit had been held to a similar criteria that a few bad contracts were \njustification for closing down the Pentagon.\n  Federal cultural agencies have unfortunately become political symbols \nfor groups that objected to that tiny fraction of grants. I strongly \nbelieve, however, that they are a worthy investment--even in these \ntimes of fiscal restraint.\n  Promoting the arts and humanities is much more than awarding grants. \nThese agencies promote programs that foster the healthy artistic and \ncultural weave that binds our diverse society together.\n  I need to look no further than my home State of Vermont to see why we \nmust maintain adequate Federal funding for NEA and NEH. It is easy to \nreview lists of the grant awards that have been made in Vermont or any \nother State. Such a shallow approach belittles the work done by these \nagencies. These grants keep our culture vibrant and remind all of those \nwho they touch how fortunate we are to live in these United States.\n  Let me highlight some of the programs in Vermont and show how the \nbenefits far exceed the minor investment we make to promote the arts \nand humanities.\n  The Folklife Center is one recipient in Vermont of a challenge grant \nfrom the NEA. The center enriches Vermonters of all ages by displaying \nthe beauty and importance of the artisans and their crafts of basketry, \nquiltmaking, stonework, slate and granite carving.\n  Arts programs benefit the entire community.\n  The Catamount Film and Arts Co. in a very rural part of Vermont, \nknown as the Northeast Kingdom, has earned a national reputation for \nexcellence in programming and community service. The $5,000 that they \nreceive from the NEA enables them to present over 25 live performing \narts events each year.\n  Over 5,000 Vermonters visited the Rutland Region Ethnic Festival last \nyear thanks to support from the NEA. Everyone enjoyed entertainment and \na variety of foods from around the world.\n  Through a grant from the NEH, the Mother Goose Program promotes \nliteracy throughout Vermont by encouraging parents to read with their \nchildren. A special part of this program is dedicated to teen parents.\n  Mr. President, every program in this appropriations bill is being \ncut. That is reality. This amendment brings parity to the arts and \nhumanities.\n  With the additional funds provided in this amendment, both NEA and \nNEH are funded at $110 million. This amendment is not perfect. Even at \nthis level, NEA would be reduced by 32 percent and the NEH by 36 \npercent from this year.\n  I would certainly like to see funding for the NEA and NEH at a much \nhigher level. More than the numbers involved, however, this amendment \nis a show of the Senate's commitment to continuing strong Federal arts \nand humanities programs now, and in the future.\n  The NEA and NEH are extremely important to my home State of Vermont. \nAnd I am pleased to be working with my colleague from Vermont, Senator \nJeffords, to strengthen these institutions. Senator Jeffords has been \ntireless in his support for the arts and humanities.\n  The amendment we are offering is about more than the State of \nVermont, it is about our country as a whole.\n  These agencies and the grants they award preserve and perpetuate our \nnational cultural heritage. They deserve our support and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment which \nwould restore a minimal amount of funding to our Nation's cultural \nendowments and the Institute of Museum Services. I am a cosponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  I proudly stand here in support of the NEA, the NEH, and the IMS. The \ncuts in this bill which devastate the endowments will have serious \nimplications on our local theaters, arts classrooms and on the creative \nvoice of our Nation.\n  Let us not kid ourselves. These cuts are not a result of fiscal \nrestraint. The cost of maintaining the NEA amounts to 65 cents a \nperson. A few days ago, we in the Senate defeated an amendment to the \nDefense appropriations bill that would have eliminated the $7 billion \nincrease over the budget request. Seven billion dollars.\n  Some may say that we need these funds to boost readiness. Mr. \nPresident, some may not know that the Department of Defense spends more \nmoney on military bands than we appropriate for the NEA. In fiscal year \n1995, the Department was appropriated $179.5 million. That is over $10 \nmillion more than was appropriated for the NEA in fiscal year 1995, and \nalmost twice as much as is appropriated for the NEA in this bill.\n  Opponents of the NEA, NEH, and the IMS contend that Government should \nnot fund the arts.\n  Perhaps the entities should be privatized. Mr. President, military \n\n[[Page S11988]]\n  bands play for free, with no private cost share. On the other hand, \nevery Endowment dollar attracts $11 for the arts from State, regional \nand local arts agencies, foundations, corporations, businesses, and \nindividuals.\n  Now, I am not against military bands. But to claim that the NEA \nreceives too much money while the military receives almost twice as \nmuch for military bands reflects skewed priorities.\n  I am a longtime supporter of the Endowments. I fully believe that the \narts and humanities reflect and shape what we are as a nation.\n  It is not just the Lincoln Centers, the New Jersey Performing Arts \nCenters, the McCarter Theaters--it is a schoolchild's first exposure to \ncreativity when he or she writes a poem or a story or draws a picture \nin class.\n  It is their enchantment at hearing their first opera on a fifth grade \nfield trip. It is their joy in performing in their grade school play or \ntheir high school production.\n  It is the joy of millions who see productions from the smallest \ncommunity theaters to Broadway, from the church pageant to the Mark \nTaper Forum in LA; from the band that plays in the local municipal \nFourth of July parade to the Tyrone Guthrie Playhouse in Minneapolis.\n  It is how America is represented to the rest of the world. It is how \nAmerica reaches the rest of the world.\n  These are our Shakespeares, our Maya Angelous, our Mary Cassats, our \nDizzy Gillespies and Count Basies and Lionel Hamptons; our Whitney \nHoustons, and our Jane Alexanders whose achievements will never \nenlighten and enchant and allow generations to dream if we eliminate \nthe funding.\n  In the name of budget cutting we will be killing off a vital part of \nwhat we are. What we spend on the arts now is minuscule compared to the \nreturn. the arts are our past, our present, and our future. They are \nour collective memory and our collective dream.\n  Mr. President, I have heard from hundreds of New Jerseyans on the NEA \nand the NEH. The level of support for the NEA and NEH is overwhelming. \nLet me relay to the Senate selections from a few of those letters:\n\n       I am an eleven year old music student. My father has told \n     me that throughout history, almost all civilized governments \n     have supported the arts.\n       I feel it would be a tragedy for this country, the greatest \n     in human history, to abandon the arts, and allow much beauty \n     to wither away.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       How can we contemplate eliminating these cultural \n     necessities while still pretending to be a great, mature \n     nation? The more we cut, the more careful we must be in order \n     not to lose what is valuable. Wholesale slash-and-burn is no \n     substitute for intelligent government.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       One of the reasons I love living in New Jersey is indeed \n     for the easy availability of the arts here. For a country \n     that prides itself on freedom of speech and a diversity of \n     points of view, it is only fitting that the nation as a whole \n     would act as an arts patron. This is hardly a novel idea--the \n     other industrialized nations subsidize their arts and artists \n     at far higher rates than we do.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Please don't let the NEA die. Let our elected leaders help \n     to leave a legacy to future generations.\n       Help these generations become the enlightened, enriched \n     citizens of tomorrow.\n\n  Mr. President, my constituents say it better than I do. Support this \nmeager increase in funding for the NEA, the NEH, and the IMS. I urge \nadoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my colleague and friend, Senator \nPell, who was the prime sponsor for the legislation establishing these \nprograms 30 years ago. I commend his vision and believe that the record \nof these agencies is a tremendous tribute to him.\n  We have had over the period of recent weeks and months a relentless \nassault on the National Endowment for the Arts and the National \nEndowment for the Humanities. I think many of us across this country \nunderstand the importance of these agencies. They are deserving of our \nsupport because they make an enormous difference in the quality of life \nof our Nation--and, most importantly, in our culture, helping to define \nthe context of our history and our society. If we do not understand the \nhumanities, we really fail to understand the individual aspects of our \nculture, and the unique aspects and values of our society.\n  Although the funding levels for these agencies are modest, the \nachievements of this program have been extraordinary over any careful \nand honest examination of its history. The National Endowment for the \nArts is the principle way that the Federal Government demonstrates the \nNation's appreciation of and respect for the arts. Every great \ncivilization from recorded times has valued the arts and valued the \nhumanities. The legacy of the Endowments is extraordinary. Small \ncommunities and countless neighborhoods have benefited in a variety of \ndifferent ways, further encouraging as the Endowments support programs \nand performances in theater, music, dance, poetry, and painting.\n  We do not have to mention at this time the list of writers and \npainters, those individuals whose creative energy and expression have \nenriched the Nation, achieved the top tier of recognition and \naccomplishment, and look back with pride and gratitude to Endowment \nsupport in their early years of development.\n  The Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, and Senator Leahy, along with \nSenator Pell and others, have been the workhorses in the effort to \nenact this legislation. I think all of us are grateful for all they \nhave done.\n  There are provisions included in this compromise amendment which I \nmyself would oppose if they were offered as individual amendments. I \ncontinue to oppose any attempt to impose content restrictions on the \ngrant-making process and hope that they will not be ultimately agreed \nto. Nonetheless, I also hope that adoption of this amendment is a clear \nindication of support for the arts and that the Endowments are here to \nstay.\n  We will have an opportunity to fight another day to enhance their \naccessibility and availability to millions of our citizens. But clearly \nwith the acceptance of this amendment the NEA and the NEH will continue \nto function and enrich the lives of millions of American citizens.\n  The funding levels approved in the amendment are a significant \nincrease over those approved by the House. I am pleased that we have \nbeen able to improve that level of support and, as I stated earlier, \naffirm our strong support for the continued existence of these agencies \nthat contribute in such a meaningful way, to our American way of life.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator from Texas will yield just \nfor a moment, I compliment the Senator from Vermont and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and others, the Senator from Wyoming, the \ndistinguished chairman and others, who have worked closely, the Senator \nfrom Utah, the Senator from Rhode Island. I commend them very highly. \nIt has been a very, very difficult time getting this far, and I hope we \nwill see next year a chance to increase these funds once again. But I \nthink it is absolutely essential we save these two endowments.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Will my senior colleague yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank my senior colleague from Vermont \nfor the effort he has put in over the years in this matter. We have \nworked very closely on this, and I can assure you that back in Vermont \nit is no political liability to do what we are doing here today as our \nState is very much involved in the arts and maintaining them. I know \nthere are others who wish to speak. I know the junior Senator from \nTexas is here, and so I yield the floor at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to speak in favor of the amendment because I agree with many \nof those who have spoken so far that we are a nation that should be \ncommitted to the American culture, and it should be a priority. I \nshould like to speak from personal experience.\n  I grew up in La Marque, TX, a town of 15,000. Now, obviously we did \nnot have cultural centers in La Marque, TX, but because of the NEA and \nbecause of the commitment that we have in America to making sure our \nyoung \n\n[[Page S11989]]\npeople do have the ability to have access to the arts, I was able to go \n35 miles to Houston, TX, to see the ballet, to see the opera, to see \nthe symphony. And from that, I received an awareness of a very \nimportant performing arts culture that I would not have had as a young \ngirl in a very small town.\n  That is duplicated all over this country. In Abilene, TX, a town of \nunder 50,000, they now have a burgeoning opera helped by the NEA, and \njust this past month they performed ``La Traviata,'' and it was a \nsellout at every performance.\n  Do we have problems with the NEA? Absolutely, we do. We all \nacknowledge that there are problems with the way things have been \nhandled where taxpayers have been required to fund offensive art.\n  Is the answer to do away with the American commitment to our culture? \nAbsolutely not. What we must do is make sure we are funding what is \nuniquely American and what is educational for young people from small \ntowns as well as young people in our inner cities about what is good in \nthe world.\n  An appreciation of the arts is a very important part of overall \neducation. Senator Bennett of Utah and myself came up with a new bill \nto reorganize the NEA. Senator Jeffords and Senator Kassebaum came up \nwith other ways to reorganize the NEA. Each is coming at this in a \ndifferent way but not in such a different way that we will not be able \nto make some changes to improve the NEA, the NEH, and our museum \nservices so that they will be available for more people in our country \nand so that we also will be able to keep the national treasures such as \nwe have in Washington and New York.\n I think we can come up with a fair allocation.\n\n  In our bill that Senator Bennett spoke about earlier today, we make \nsure that the funding goes to organizations of the arts, not to \nindividual artists that might do things that would offend the \nconscience of mainstream America. We also have an outright ban of any \nkind of obscenity, pornography or anything that would violate the \nstandards of common decency. Some people in the arts community like to \nsay, ``Oh, but you cannot define decency. That would be too hard. That \nwould offend our artistic license.''\n  I could not disagree more. There is a standard of common decency. And \nwhen we are using American taxpayer dollars, I think we can easily \ndetermine what should be used for arts appreciation and what is \ninappropriate. Do those people have a right to go out and use private \nfunds to have their interpretation of art? Absolutely. But do we have \nto have Government funding of that? No.\n  I think we can make a clear distinction with American taxpayer \ndollars. So, yes, we have some problems. But we can face those problems \nwithout giving up the commitment to America's culture and to educate \nour children about the importance of appreciating the opera, \nappreciating our art museums, appreciating symphonies, and the ballet. \nBecause I grew up in a town that was close to Houston where we had \nregional art centers, I was able to go to Houston every Saturday \nmorning and participate in the Houston Youth Symphony ballet. So I had \nthe opportunity to perform, to have access to this kind of very \nimportant part of my education.\n  I want to make sure that the young girls and boys growing up all over \nour country have regional centers and that we have a commitment to that \nso that they will grow up to be able to appreciate and understand the \nimportance of arts in our country.\n  I want to end with a quote from John Ruskin, the great British art \nhistorian of the last century, who set down the standard for nations \nwhen he wrote, ``Great nations write their autobiographies in three \nmanuscripts: the book of their deeds, the book of their words, and the \nbook of their art.''\n  Mr. President, I want to make sure that we have the book of art and \nthe book of words along with our great standard of deeds in this \ncountry for our future generations to appreciate. And that is the \npurpose of this amendment and the purpose of Senator Bennett and myself \nworking with Senator Jeffords and Senator Kassebaum to make sure that \nthe NEA does what our standards would require that they do; and that \nis, provide the support for the excellence in the arts for our future \ngenerations to be able to have the access that we would like for them \nto have.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would like to ask the gallery not \nshow any signs of approval or disapproval to any statement.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I want to first compliment the Senators from Vermont \nfor offering this amendment. And I intend to vote for it, but not with \nmuch relish. The reason I am not voting for it with much relish is \nbecause it still leaves the National Endowment of the Arts [NEA] and \nthe National Endowment for the Humanities [NEH] terribly underfunded.\n  There is not anything wrong with this country and there is not \nanything wrong with Congress except our priorities. We can balance the \nbudget by the year 2002. We could educate our children. We could teach \nhumanities and the arts. We could become a much more civilized nation. \nBut you cannot do that and take care of all these other things that are \nmostly political. For example, Congress is proposing to spend $7 \nbillion more on defense than even the Defense Department asked for. And \npeople are almost afraid because they do not want to go home and say \nthey voted against the defense bill, they do not want their opponent to \nsay they are weak on defense.\n  A lot of times I think--and I do not mean this to be demeaning of my \ncolleagues--that one of the reasons people cast irresponsible votes \naround here is because it is easy, it is easy not to have to go home \nand explain a controversial vote. How many times do you read almost \ndaily how people wish Congress would gather up their nerve and do the \nright thing? You know what that means? That means doing things that are \ncontroversial and that you have to give an accounting for.\n  I have cast my share of controversial votes, and it gets me in a lot \nof hot water. For example, I am not going to vote for a school prayer \namendment to the Constitution. I am for prayer in school but not for \ntinkering with the Constitution. I am not going to vote for the flag \ndesecration amendment to the Constitution, where we would allow each \nState to decide what desecration is and the penalty therefor. What kind \nof a Constitution would it be where free speech will be determined by \neach of the 50 States? In one State you get the death penalty for \nspitting on the flag and another you get a $10 fine for burning one in \npublic. What kind of result would that be? And it is controversial. You \nask the ordinary man on the street in America, ``do you favor flag \nburning?'' ``Of course not. Who does?'' ``Do you favor prayer in \nschool?'' People are sure that they are going to get stricken dead if \nthey say no.\n  You know why people vote for those things? Some of them vote for them \nhonestly. They believe in it. And some of them simply do not want to go \nhome and try to educate their electorate. You know being a legislator \nrequires you to also be an educator.\n  And so here we are, on the Interior appropriations bill, giving away \n$15.5 billion in gold and silver last night--corporate welfare galore--\nand cutting the NEA and NEH. Even with this amendment, those two \nprograms are still cut 30 percent. So what does that mean? A little \nState like mine that has a fine symphony is going to have to get out \nand grub it out and try to find some money to make up for what they are \ngoing to lose from the National Endowment for the Arts. The Arkansas \nRepertory Theater, not big but extremely important to a few people, is \ngoing to have to go out and try to find the money or have a lot fewer \nperformances. The very things that are so limited, but which make us a \nmore civilized nation, are what we are choosing to cut.\n  Mr. President, most everybody whoever watched PBS knows who David \nMcCullough is. He wrote that magnificent book on Harry Truman. And here \nis what he said about the NEH. Listen to this poignant quote.\n\n       When I think of what the National Endowment for the \n     Humanities has done to support gifted young documentary \n     filmmakers like \n\n[[Page S11990]]\n     Ken Burns, when I count up the programs in ``The American Experience'' \n     series that have benefited from Endowment funding--38 films \n     thus far, including biographical portraits of such American \n     figures as Eisenhower, FDR, Lindbergh, Duke Ellington, \n     Thurgood Marshall--when I see the magnificent library of \n     America volumes filling shelf after shelf, when I see in \n     libraries and archives the priceless historic documents that \n     have been preserved, all this, the films, the books, the \n     conservation efforts--because of endowment grants,\n      I know absolutely the value of the returns for such \n     government investment.\n\n  Many years ago I read in Time magazine where the University of Texas \nwas offering a dynamite course on the differences in the philosophies \nof Virgil's ``Aeneid'' and Homer's ``Ulysses,'' sort of a comparison \nreally of authoritarian versus nonauthoritarian governments.\n  They had room for 224 teachers for a 9-week course at the University \nof Texas, and they had 4,400 teachers apply for those positions. What a \ndynamite subject for teachers to pass on to their students about the \nbeginnings of our civilization and how we got to where we are now.\n  So I began to try to get money here for that, because that one was \nprivately funded. We finally got the National Endowment for the \nHumanities up to the point that last summer, Mr. President, they had \n3,250 teachers in those summer seminar courses in philosophy, political \nscience, our beloved Constitution, literature, drama, and art, and they \ngo back and they pass that off to 500,000 youngsters.\n  So many children, particularly those who grow up in small towns like \nI did, are lucky to ever be exposed to anything that has any cultural \nenrichment. Turn the networks on tonight and turn on most of the pay-\nper-view movies, and you know what you get. I would hate to be raising \nchildren today. I feel sorry for parents in this environment. I think \nparents ought to have a right to determine what their children are \ngoing to see, and at the rate we are going, they are not going to see \n``Mister Rogers,'' Big Bird, and ``Sesame Street.'' Oh, they must be \nsubversive. Why else would we be cutting PBS funding?\n  I remember when I was a sophomore in high school and we were reading \n``Beowulf'' we had a literature and English teacher, Miss Doll Means. \nShe let us read a paragraph, and we would talk about that paragraph. I \nhad been reading for a full page, and I looked up because I wondered \nwhy she was letting me read longer, and she said: ``You have a nice \nvoice and you read beautifully.'' She did more for my self-esteem in \nabout 3 seconds than anybody, except my father, before or since. It was \nher saying that to me, plus the fact that I had had some success as a \ntrial lawyer, to jump up out of a town of 1,000 people and run for \nGovernor.\n  My father said public service is the noblest of all callings. I do \nnot know what he would think today. I always thought I wanted my \nchildren to follow me in politics. I am not so sure. It was always a \ngiven that we would go into public service, and now with the \natmosphere, poisoned as it is all across America, people becoming \nincreasingly uncivilized--``thank you'' and ``please'' and ``excuse \nme'' are words you hardly ever hear anymore.\n  Mr. President, when I went to World War II, I was stuck overseas at \nthe end of the war. One day, I saw a note on the bulletin board: ``If \nyou're interested in Shakespeare, show up at such and such a barracks \ntonight.'' I thought, I do not know anything about Shakespeare, but it \nbeats sitting around the barracks. So I went. Six marines were there, \nand the teacher who was going to teach us about Shakespeare, as it \nturned out, not only was a Shakespearean scholar, but he was a Harvard \nprofessor. He had a tape recorder, which at that time was unheard of. I \nhad never seen a tape recorder in my life. You could actually speak \ninto a microphone and listen to your voice come back to you.\n  So he said, ``We'll start off with Hamlet's speech to the players,'' \nand he did. He had a booming base voice. He said:\n\n       Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, \n     trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of \n     your players do, I had as lief the towncrier spoke my lines.\n\n  That was pretty common. That has been 50 years ago, and I still \nremember it. He played it back on the tape recorder, and it sounded so \nbeautiful. He said, ``OK, you're first.'' And so I did it, and when he \nplayed it back to me, I could not believe I had an Arkansas twang. It \nwas embarrassing to have to listen to it after Miss Doll Means told me \nI had a wonderful voice.\n  But do you know what? That day, listening to that tape recorder, I \nmade up my mind I was not going to be like everybody else. I was going \nto learn to speak. I knew English because Miss Doll Means taught me how \nto diagram sentences and I knew how to speak because it was genetic; my \nfather was a great speaker.\n  I said, ``I'm not going to be like everybody else and just drift \nthrough life. I am going to try to be distinct.''\n  These are personal stories, but they relate to the subject we are \ndebating today. Think of the 500,000 children that are exposed to these \nteachers who go to these NEH summer seminars. Think of the people who \nwatched ``The Civil War'' series on PBS. Think of the moral stories \nthat children get from ``Mister Rogers'' and ``Sesame Street'', and \nlook at the way people dress and the way they act,\n and you wonder where this country is headed. You read ``The Decline \nand Fall of the Roman Empire'' and see if you see any analogies between \nthen and now. Ask yourself why we spend less money on cultural \nenrichment than any other developed country in the world. I went to the \nSoviet Union in 1971. I was staggered by how much money that poor \ncountry spent on cultural programs, even trying to preserve the history \nof the czars.\n\n  Well Mr. President, while my speech may have been too lengthy, I just \nwant everyone to know that I think the reduction in spending on NEA and \nNEH is a terrible tragedy. I applaud the Senators from Vermont for \ntrying to do something about it.\n  I offered an amendment during subcommittee consideration of the \nInterior appropriations bill to increase funding for the NEH by $15 \nmillion, and we succeeded. I am as proud of that as anything I have \ndone since I have been in the Senate. But it pales in comparison to \nwhat we should be doing.\n  Someday--and it may be too late--we are going to understand that \nfunding for NEA and NEH is not wasted money. It is money that makes us \na greater Nation. It makes us more civilized. It makes us appreciate \nwhere we came from. It is a tragedy that we have to cut it. But I am \nvery pleased to support the amendment to increase the levels of funding \nin comparison to the House bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. ASHCROFT assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to make a couple of \ncomments regarding the pending amendment. I appreciate what Senator \nSimpson stated when he gave quite a list as to how the National \nEndowment for the Arts has helped rural States such as Wyoming. \nCertainly, I can show an equal list of what it has done for the State \nof Idaho. Senator Hutchison, who went into great deal of her own \nexperience and how this has helped. I am receptive to those arguments.\n  I know that we all realize there have been problems with the NEA with \nthings that have been funded that I think no one in this Chamber is \nproud of. In fact, I remember last year there were examples of items \nthat had been the product of perhaps grants from the National Endowment \nfor the Arts that were in the Cloakroom that could not be brought out \nhere because they were obscene. I do not think anybody can understand \nhow we would utilize funds for that purpose.\n  But that was under a different situation. There is a new director now \nat NEA, Jane Alexander. I think many of us who have been watching have \nbeen favorably impressed by her and by those that she has surrounded \nherself with in working on this.\n  I say to those individuals that have this responsibility now, that as \nthey look to the future, if in doubt, do not. If there is any question, \nif there is a gray area as to whether or not that particular project \nshould or should not be funded because it could borderline on something \nthat we would not want to see, that is not a question of censorship; \nthat is a question of sponsorship. That is their responsibility. They \nmust exercise that responsibility, and they must say on different \noccasions, no. Because if they do not, the Senate and the House will \nsay no to the funding of the NEA.\n  But this amendment that is before us now contains language of the \nSenator \n\n[[Page S11991]]\nfrom North Carolina dealing with this question of obscenity, \npornography. I feel it sets the parameters, sets the guidelines.\n  But, again, we have a situation where we have new leadership in the \nNational Endowment for the Arts, and I am supportive of that \nleadership. I say let them continue this effort now under the new \nregime.\n  When I was mayor of Boise, ID, I know there were different occasions \nthat, by use of public funds, not many but some, it serves as a \ncatalyst so that you can increase efforts toward art and culture, \nbecause that defines a society. That is positive.\n  So I do support this amendment that is before us. I do support the \nefforts of Jane Alexander and those individuals that are working with \nher, but to remind them that they are going to have to make the tough \ndecisions because, if not, we certainly will.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I yield to the senior Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague. I want to associate myself with his \nremarks. I also want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee for \nworking out what could have been a very difficult situation and for \nrecognizing, as I think the Senate always has, that there are public \nmoneys for the arts, and there should be.\n  But what my colleague from Idaho just said, we have also recognized \nthat there is a clear difference between censorship and sponsorship and \nthe use of public dollars. Certainly the use of public dollars ought to \nmeet the broad test. And the broad test is, can the general public view \nthese experiences or can they view these acquisitions or these \nsponsorships? I think when you are using public dollars, you have to \nsay yes.\n  While I appreciate some artists' expressions that others do not, I \nthink it is important to recognize that we have the responsibility as \nthe guardians of the public treasury and trust, that all that we do \nmeets the broader test. Where there is an expressive individual who \nchooses to go in another direction, they ought to seek private \nsponsorship and not public sponsorship for such an expression.\n  I agree with my colleague from Idaho, that while our funds are \nlimited and while this amendment represents a substantial cut, it also \nsays very clearly that the Senate, the Congress, wants to continue the \nNational Endowment and all that it does for our communities, and \nespecially for rural States as has been so eloquently expressed by \nsome, where small communities have little to no access to what larger \ncommunities have and the National Endowment has brought them the arts \nin very unique and positive ways. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. To conclude, I thank the managers of the bill because \nI think they have been very helpful in bringing us to the point where \nwe can move forward in the proper fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the \nLeahy-Jeffords amendment to restore funding to the National Endowment \nfor the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the \nInstitute for Museum Services. I believe it is important to note at the \noutset that this amendment will not fully restore funding for any of \nthese agencies. Indeed, these agencies are still will face cuts \napproximately twice that of overall spending in the Interior \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I would like to share with the Senate just a few of \nthe worthy programs in New Mexico that received funding in fiscal year \n1995 from these agencies. This funding includes $6,100 that the Museum \nof New Mexico received from the NEA for a traveling exhibit exploring \nthe 20th century phenomenon of Hispanic women as santeras, or makers of \nsaint icons, called ``The Art of the Santera.'' The making of santos is \na particularly beautiful and respected art form in New Mexico, and this \nexhibit traveled throughout the Southwest. The museum also received NEA \nfunding for a family photography project, which served over 24,000 New \nMexicans in Raton, Aztec, Jemez, Fort Selden, Clovis, and Las Cruces. \nParticipants in these mostly rural communities learned how to preserves \nold family photos, and used the photos to improve their understanding \nof their history and culture.\n  The Museum of Indian Arts and Culture benefited from several NEA \ngrants this year, including $34,000 for the ``Families and \nCommunities'' demonstration and mentoring program. With this funding, \nthe museum will be able to establish eight teams of established and \nyounger Indian artists to conceive, create, and demonstrate their \ntraditional arts. Visitors to the museum will be able to discuss and \ninteract with the teams as they work.\n  Mr. President, both of these award highlight the role the NEA has \nplayed and should continue to play in creating and disseminating \nculture, and facilitating communication and appreciation among the \ndiverse communities living in New Mexico and throughout the Nation. In \nan increasingly balkanized society, we have more than enough issues \nthat drive us apart. Art is a powerful tool we can use in our attempts \nto create ties that bind us back together.\n  The NEA is also an important tool in educating our children. We know \nthat many important skills can be taught to children using the arts. \nYet in my State, and throughout the Nation, schools are struggling to \nfind funding for art education. I believe that the NEA can help \nleverage funding for this important activity. The city of Santa Fe, for \nexample, recently applied for a grant of up to $175,000 for arts \neducation. I am told that this application was instrumental to the city \ncouncil's quick approval of a commitment to match that funding. It is \nlikely that if the city is successful in establishing this program with \nseed money from the NEA, it will find a way to continue the program, \nperhaps with the help of private funding. I believe the experience of \nthe city of Santa Fe is a perfect example of how the NEA has been able, \nwith limited funding, to seed the development of enduring and very \nbeneficial programs.\n  The final NEA grant in New Mexico I would briefly like to highlight \nwas given to the Fund for Folk Culture, a national organization \nheadquartered in Santa Fe. The Fund for Folk Culture has been able, \nwith a $50,000 grant from the NEA, to hire a staff person to administer \n$750,000 in privately donated funds for grants to support folk art \nthroughout the Nation. The NEA funding is needed because of the \ndifficulty the Fund for Folk Culture faces in raising any private \nfoundation money for salaries and administration. Mr. President, this \ngrant is leveraging 15 times the amount of the NEA grant. I challenge \nmy colleagues to point to other Federal programs with this sort of \nleveraging effect.\n  The NEH and IMS also fund outstanding projects in New Mexico. One \nthat I have found particularly interesting is a grant the University of \nNew Mexico has received from the NEH to find, catalog, and microfilm \n2,600 historic newspapers. I am told by the managers of this project \nthat many of the newspapers they are saving through this project are \nliterally coming out of the attics of New Mexicans who had previously \nhad no understanding of the historic resources lurking there. So far, \n300,000 pages have been microfilmed as part of this effort, which is \npart of a nationwide historic preservation project. When complete, the \nproject will be an invaluable resource for both historians and \nresidents of many of the small, rural communities in New Mexico and \nthroughout the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I could continue for some time on the benefits brought \nto my State and the Nation by the National Endowment for the Arts, the \nNational Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute for Museum \nServices. I believe that the examples I have given, however, highlight \nthe central point I wish to make: Far from funding frivolous culture \nfor the elite with public money, the NEA, NEH, and IMS are leveraging \nfunding for educating our children, leveraging large amounts of private \nfunding, and providing access to the arts and humanities for rural and \ndisadvantaged American. This support is, in my opinion, critical to our \nsense of nation, and our ability to bridge the cultural differences \nthat so often tear us apart rather than bring us together.\n  For all of these reasons, I am proud to cosponsor the amendment of my \ncolleagues from Vermont.\n\n[[Page S11992]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we would be hard-pressed to find anyone \nin this Chamber to argue that art does not enrich American life. I \nthink it would be equally difficult to find someone who has not been \ntouched by art in some way at some important point in their lives.\n  There is no dispute that art has played an invaluable role in the \ncultural life of our Nation. Increasingly, however, we are presented \nwith what amounts to a ``yes or no'' proposition: is art important \nenough to fund at the Federal level?\n  I firmly believe the answer to that question is ``yes.'' Americans \nwant the Federal Government to play a role in promoting the arts. And \nthey feel so strongly about this issue precisely because the small \namount of Federal funding received by the NEA each year goes so far \ntoward enhancing the cultural life of our Nation.\n  The matching power of NEA grants is exceptional. Every dollar we \nappropriate at the Federal level generates more than $12 at the State \nand local level. This extraordinary leveraging power has helped \nincrease the number of arts organizations and opportunities around the \ncountry since the NEA's inception since 1965: the number of large \nsymphony orchestras has doubled; the number of dance companies has \nincreased from 37 to over 400; the number of theaters has multiplied by \n8; and the number of State arts agencies has increased from 5 to 50.\n  I am not shy about admitting that a good deal of my support of the \nNEA derives from the benefits it provides my State. South Dakota is a \nrural State, and many communities could not maintain on their own the \nkinds of cultural opportunities they have been able to maintain with \nthe help of the NEA and the South Dakota Arts Council, which also \nreceives funding from the NEA.\n  My hometown of Aberdeen, SD, a city of about 25,000 people, has an \norchestra and a community theater, both of which are made possible in \npart because of NEA dollars. And my hometown is one of the biggest \ncities in South Dakota.\n  The support provided by the NEA is even more important to the many \nsmaller communities of my State: communities like Freeman, which has a \nSwiss choral society; Sisseton, which operates a Heritage Museum; and \nFaith, which has an arts and historical society--all of which operate \nwith assistance from the NEA.\n  This is a big return for a relatively small investment.\n  Mr. President, I am aware of the budgetary constraints under which we \noperate this year. Each year our fiscal decisions get more difficult as \nthe demands of a runaway deficit grow ever larger. In such an \nenvironment, we must look critically at every program, and the arts are \nno exception.\n  But let us be fair, and let us be reasonable. When I am told that it \ncosts each American only 64 cents per year to support the NEA, I have \nto admit that sounds like a good return on our investment. I do not \nbelieve the NEA deserves the level of funding cut it is facing. I do \nnot believe Americans want this small investment--whose corresponding \nbenefits are so great--taken away from them.\n  Unfortunately, the NEA has been an easy political target because of a \nfew controversial grants it has approved. I fully appreciate the \nintensity of public opposition to Federal support for specific projects \nthat many Americans consider offensive, and it is appropriate that the \npublic and their representatives in Congress press this issue \nforcefully.\n  Concern about the NEA's grant application process has been expressed, \nand NEA Chair Jane Alexander has addressed that concern frankly and \nforthrightly. Moreover, I fully expect that dialogue between the \nCongress and Ms. Alexander to continue.\n  Nonetheless, the statistics have been overwhelmingly clear on this \nissue: the number of controversial grants made by the NEA is \nexceedingly small when compared to the total number of NEA-funded \nprojects.\n  I should also add that I think it is unrealistic to expect the NEA to \nbe entirely free of controversy. It never will be, and we should not \nexpect it to be. In her remarks to the Senate Labor Committee during \nher confirmation hearing, Jane Alexander said that--\n\n       * * * the very essence of art, after all, is to hold the \n     mirror up to nature; the arts reflect the diversity and \n     variety of human experience. We are, as Hamlet says, `the \n     abstracts and brief chroniclers of the time,' and, as such, \n     the artist often taps into the very issues of society that \n     are most sensitive.\n\n  And that is the way it should be. We should have constructive debate \non how to improve the grant application process and the operation of \nthe NEA. But the fact that there is occasional controversy should not \nbe used as an excuse to abolish the agency or drastically reduce its \nfunding.\n  Mr. President, I realize we must make significant cuts in the budget \nthis year. The arts, like every other area, will have to carry its \nshare of the burden in this effort. It is my hope, however, that this \ndebate will be fair, enlightened, and reasoned. Americans deserve the \nNEA's positive contributions to our culture.\n                    Amendment No. 2304, As Modified\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I wish to modify my amendment. The \nmodification is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify his \namendment.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n\n       The amendment (No. 2304), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 95, line 9 strike ``$82,259,000'' and insert \n     ``$88,765,000''.\n       On page 96, line 6, strike ``$17,235,000'' and insert \n     ``$21,235,000''.\n       On page 96, line 23, strike ``$96,494,000'' and insert \n     ``$94,000,000''.\n       On page 97, line 6, strike ``$18,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$16,000,000''.\n       On page 3, line 17, strike ``$242,159,000'' and insert \n     ``$240,159,000''.\n       On page 67, line 11, strike ``$385,485,000'' and insert \n     ``$381,485,000''.\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       ``Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none \n     of the funds authorized to be appropriated pursuant to this \n     Act may be used to promote, disseminate, sponsor or produce \n     materials or performances which denigrate the objects or \n     beliefs of the adherents of a particular religion.''\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       ``Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none \n     of the funds made available to the National Endowment for the \n     Arts under this Act may be used to promote, disseminate, \n     sponsor, or produce materials or performances that depict or \n     describe, in a patently offensive way, sexual or excretory \n     activities or organs.''\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this amendment, sponsored by myself and \nSenators Leahy, Simpson, Pell, Bumpers, Kennedy, and Dodd, restores \nfunds to the National Endowment for the Arts. This amendment does \nrestore modest funds to the agency, but still in making this effort, \nthe endowments will still carry the burden of greatly reduced budgets.\n  As I rise today, I must say that I am somewhat disappointed that we \nare not restoring even more funds to these agencies. I am well aware \nthat cuts are inevitable this year, but I do not believe that these \nagencies should be singled out for a disproportionate share of \nreductions. The proposed reduction of 40 percent to the NEA will \ndevastate the Endowment. More importantly, this reduction will have an \nenormously negative impact on communities throughout the Nation, \nespecially rural communities.\n  It is very necessary and appropriate for our Government to support \nthese agencies that encourage learning and support scholarship, \npreserve paintings and writings for future generations, bring the \nbeauty and magic of art to all Americans as well as preserve and \nnurture our cultural heritage. The small contributions we make to these \nagencies go a very long way in preserving our history and investing in \nour future. This mission has been at the heart of both Endowments since \ntheir creation. Federal support has been under attack and criticism \nfrom those who perceive the Endowments as nothing more than Federal \nsupport for the rich and cultural elite. But nothing could be further \nfrom the truth.\n  We can point to many examples of the very real ways in which all of \nour States as well as local communities benefit from Endowment or IMS \nsupported projects. The Endowments and the IMS support projects that \ninvigorate our downtowns. The Shelburne Museum in Vermont attracts \nvisitors from across the State, around the country and from abroad to \nsee the wonders of this renowned folklife center. The Endowments and \nthe IMS enrich the learning experiences of young \n\n[[Page S11993]]\npeople in small communities, through grants to programs such as the \nMusic, Words, Opera in schools throughout the State of Delaware, or the \nArtist in Residence Program which brought the Quantum Brass Quartet to \nBig Sandy, TX. They support projects to protect our most venerable \nworks and texts for all to appreciate and see. A grant to the \nHistorical Society of Iowa will go to preserving Iowa newspapers and a \ngrant to Johns Hopkins University will go toward preparing an edition \nof papers of President Eisenhower. The Endowments make available \nprojects and programs which make learning our history accessible and \nengaging such as the Civil War series, the Baseball series and other \nseries on FDR and on the American Revolution.\n  The agencies have proven effective in nurturing our cultural \nheritage, making the arts and humanities accessible to all the corners \nof the Nation, providing learning opportunities for young and old and \ngenerally encouraging a growth and flourishing of the arts and \nhumanities in this country. We should not take for granted the \nimportance of the work of these agencies, especially in the difficult \ntimes that face our Nation.\n  The benefit to Vermont from these agencies is immeasurable, and \nVermont, while unique in so many ways has that in common with all the \nother States in the country--they are well served by the programs \nsupported by the NEA, NEH, and IMS. The projects and programs that the \nNEA, NEH, and IMS support are important and consequential. We can look \nat specifics, and we must today understand the impact of the cuts we \nare considering today. These drastic cuts will jeopardize both the \nimportant work being done by States in supporting local projects which \nthe strengthen and enhance the education of our young people and \nprovide learning opportunities for those not in school.\n  One cannot minimize the impact that arts has on increasing the level \nof participation, the level of interest, the level of commitment of \nchildren in school. One cannot minimize the value of having \nexceptional, world acclaimed dance companies like Mark Morris Dance \nGroup and the Trisha Brown Company visit and perform to people in small \ncommunities in Vermont, or being able to participate in a cultural \nfestival which brings people in the community together like the one in \nRutland, my hometown, funded in part by the NEA--all in Vermont, all \nthanks to the support of the NEA, NEH, and IMS, and all of which are of \nsignificant importance and value to the people of the State. I am not \nwilling to jeopardize the availability of the Vermont Council on the \nHumanities and their Beginning with Mother Goose Program; the Ethan \nAllen Homestead Trust in Burlington, and the Brattleboro Museum and Art \nCenter, in Brattleboro supported by the IMS; and the Flynn Theater, the \nVermont Council on the Arts in Montpelier and Crossroads Arts Council \nin Rutland supported by the NEA.\n  I would like to share an article with you that appeared in \nSmithsonian magazine which was given to me by the Executive Director of \nthe Vermont Council on the Arts, Nicki Clarke. It is about the Wolcott \nChildren's Ballet, which sprang up in 1980 thanks to the incredible \ncommitment of people in this community. It has continued on a shoe \nstring budget and continues to have an enormous impact on the lives of \nall who are part of it--the young dancers, volunteers, instructors, \nVermonters from Wolcott, Hardwick, and other towns. This ballet school \nhas enriched the community, and made so many lives more full. It has \nreceived some of its much needed support from the Vermont Council on \nthe Arts. Projects such as this are far too important to underestimate \nor ignore.\n  So I ask for your support today of this modest effort to make sure \nthese agencies can continue to do their good works.\n  I will yield to the floor manager soon for his comments. What we have \ndone here, through an error, we took the money from the wrong accounts. \nLooking at all the figures, I did not notice that. I apologize to my \ncolleagues for that error. I think we have now adjusted the amendment \nto take the money from where everybody thought it was coming from.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Smithsonian Magazine \narticle to which I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Smithsonian, May 1995]\n\n         Deep in the North Country, They Dance Their Hearts Out\n\n                    (By Richard and Joyce Wolkomir)\n\n       In an out-of-plumb town hall in Wolcott, in northern \n     Vermont's lumbering country, a child is dancing. It is 9 at \n     night. Under bare light bulbs hung from a tin ceiling, the \n     10-year-old pirouettes to Vivaldi's Four Seasons.\n       ``Releve lent!''\n       Kennet Oberly, director of the 50-dancer Wolcott Children's \n     Ballet, watches with penetrating black eyes as the girl rises \n     on the balls of her feet, practicing a solo sequence. When \n     the troupe takes The Four Seasons on the back roads in a few \n     weeks, 3,000 schoolchildren and hundreds of adults in \n     Vermont's hardscrabble ``Northeast Kingdom'' will see \n     classical ballet. Far from the spotlights, the cheering fans, \n     the megastars and the glittering performances of the nation's \n     premier companies--the American Ballet Theater, say, or the \n     Joffrey--a troupe of children practices in obscurity, \n     striving for perfection. Oberly wants every foot to arch \n     exactly. Every finger must curl just so. ``Arabesque,'' he \n     says. The child elevates one leg behind her, toes pointed.\n       Oberly, bald on top, a mane of black hair spreading over \n     his collar, demonstrates the steps, lithe as an otter. \n     ``Good, Jamie,'' he says. ``Now, pose en arriere.'' A log \n     truck rumbles by, shaking the building. The child falters. A \n     gust spatters the windows with April sleet. Oberly stops the \n     battered tape recorder. Turning toward two visitors, he \n     pivots from the diaphragm, as if he were still onstage in \n     Stuttgart, Tallinn, Helsinki, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Paris, \n     Milan, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco or New York. \n     ``We're getting there,'' he says. ``Almost.''\n       Director and ballerina stoop to the day's final task. They \n     pull up strips of gray duct tape for sticking mats to the \n     floors, which decades of work boots and galoshes have worn \n     too slick for ballet slippers. The child pulls a parka over \n     her pink leotard. Outside, wisps of mist rise from the still-\n     frozen ground. ``Repetition is the mother of learning,'' \n     Oberly says, and switches off the lights.\n       Weeks later, on a Sunday morning in May, a local agitator \n     for good causes, Nola Denslow, is explaining how a classical \n     ballet troupe sprang up here. She is talking over pancakes \n     and maple syrup in the Village Restaurant in Hardwick, five \n     miles east of Wolcott. Many of the diners are wearing billed \n     caps inscribed ``Caterpillar'' or ``John Deere.'' Parked \n     outside are pickups with rifles racked across the rear \n     windows.\n       It began when Nola Denslow knocked--presumptuously--on a \n     stranger's door. She had moved to Vermont with her seven \n     children ``hoping to re-create the romance of rural Mexico,'' \n     where she had once lived. But she found ``any chance to be \n     involved in the arts was limited.'' So in 1980 she dragooned \n     volunteers, raised funds and got Wolcott to transform its \n     boarded-up railroad station into an arts center, offering \n     courses in everything from music to pottery making.\n       But no dance. Then Denslow heard that a retired ballerina \n     and her husband lived on a Wolcott farm. June Gorton had been \n     an early member of the Balanchine Company and had assisted \n     Jerome Robbins in choreographing\n      The King And I. Denslow quickly was knocking at the Gortons' \n     door, which was opened by a gray-haired woman with a \n     dancer's regal posture.\n       Teaching dance would be a tremendous service, Denslow said. \n     ``Absolutely not!'' June Gorton said. ``I don't dance \n     anymore.'' ``I'm really sorry,'' Denslow said, merciless in a \n     good cause. ``A lot of kids in this town should have this \n     opportunity.'' The next day, Denslow's telephone rang. ``I'll \n     do it.'' June Gorton said.\n       She taught virtually for free. Her husband, Robert, built \n     sets. But eventually the arts center's federal funding \n     evaporated. Wolcott had to decide: road salt or watercolors? \n     The vote was 50 to 49 for road salt. ``When people realized \n     it was lost, a gasp went through the town meeting,'' says \n     Denslow. The Gortons announced they would fund the Wolcott \n     Children's Ballet themselves. Classes moved to the Wolcott \n     Town Hall.\n       For many youngsters, the ballet had become indispensable. \n     Girls who had never heard classical music in their lives \n     discovered that, onstage, they could excel. ``Once, they were \n     rehearsing with the Vermont Symphony Orchestra, which had a \n     formidable conductor at the time,'' recalls Denslow. One \n     little dancer, normally a mouse, turned to the baton-waving \n     maestro on the podium and commanded: ``Increase the tempo, \n     please!''\n       In 1991 a cerebral hemorrhage partially paralyzed June \n     Gorton. From her wheelchair she continued to take an active \n     interest in the ballet, but she could no longer teach. \n     Finding another director with June's qualifications, who \n     could work for almost nothing, would be impossible. But the \n     children were addicted. And so Wolcott took a deep breath and \n     decided to raise money to hire a director. A Utah dancer \n     agreed to come, despite the tiny salary. The ``studio'' \n     awaiting her had wavy floors; sets and costumes were all \n     homemade. She stayed only a year. And \n\n[[Page S11994]]\n     then--by a fluke--Kennet Oberly and his wife, Larissa Sintsova, a \n     principal dancer with the Estonian National Ballet, arrived \n     from Tallinn.\n       Oberly's father, a physicist, developed the lens coating on \n     the camera Neil Armstrong used on the moon. His mother, a \n     theater director, was a founding member of Washington, D.C.'s \n     Arena Stage Theater.\n       ``When I was 5, in 1962, a touring group of West Side Story \n     came to Boston, where we lived, and it electrified me--the \n     energy, the music,'' Oberly remembers. ``But what really got \n     me was the guys jumping around in sneakers, knife fighting, \n     smoking and climbing chain link fences--I thought it would be \n     neat to get up there and smoke and climb chain link fences.'' \n     ``Wait until you're 8,'' his mother told him. When the family \n     moved to Pittsburgh Kennet told his mother: ``Now I'm 8.'' He \n     became the only boy in a ballet class of 30 girls. ``This was \n     not what I'd intended,'' he says.\n       Still, by age 12 he was so promising that be became a \n     student at the Harkness Ballet in Manhattan. By age 14 he had \n     joined Germany's Stuttgart Ballet. Oberly danced next with \n     the Boston Ballet, the Houston Ballet, the European troupe of \n     Maurice Bejart, returning to the Boston Repertory Ballet in \n     1978. Then, for eight years he worked in Des Moines with \n     Ballet Iowa, rising from dancer to artistic director.\n       He was ballet master of the Finnish National Ballet when \n     the Estonia Theater invited him to revive works by the 19th-\n     century Danish choreographer August Bournonville. While \n     working with the Estonian ballet, Oberly married ballerina \n     Larissa Sintsova. He had taught at a ballet camp in Vermont, \n     and they decided to take over a dance school in Burlington. \n     But the deal fell through. When they heard that the Wolcott \n     Children's Ballet needed a director, ``I took the plunge,'' \n     says Oberly.\n       His salary is about $20,000. But raising even that much is \n     formidable for the Children's Ballet. ``We're having a cash \n     crisis right now.'' Oberly says, shrugging, as he pets Masha \n     the cat, in his still mostly unfurnished house on one of \n     Hardwick's steep back streets. Sintsova teaches at the \n     Children's Ballet for free. ``You can't look at it as a \n     business, and that's one reason I like being here,'' says \n     Oberly. ``We're not trying to become the next Ballet of New \n     England--we are two professionals who settled here for our \n     own personal reasons, and we're trying to bring dance to the \n     Northeast Kingdom.''\n       At 3 the next afternoon, he is back at the Wolcott Town \n     Hall, unrolling the floor mats. Bronwyn Potter, pianist for \n     the troupe, lays her pocketbook on the hall's worn upright \n     piano. Oberly begins taping down the mats.\n       Six days a week he teaches the school's 48 students. He \n     also choreographs and conducts rehearsals for the spring \n     production. Last year the dancers performed The Four Seasons \n     in remote town halls throughout the Northeast Kingdom and in \n     northern New Hampshire.\n       Tickets cost only about $5. In the isolated hill towns--\n     Island Pond, Hardwick, Orleans--weathered men come in work \n     boots, and women wear their best dresses. Sometimes, as the \n     music wells and the costumed dancers spin and leap, children \n     in the audience run into the aisles to perform impromptu \n     solos. Every year, some join the Wolcott Children's Ballet \n     themselves.\n       At 3:30 p.m. a class of such beginners arrives, four \n     ponytails, one pageboy. They line up in front of Oberly, \n     belt-high recruits gazing up at their giant drill sergeant. \n     Oberly demonstrates the movements he wants them to practice. \n     First position: heels together, toes totally turned out. \n     Second position: ``Move your heels a foot apart.'' Third \n     position . . . ``Elbow in front of your ribs,'' Oberly says, \n     eyeing his ragged line of 8-year-olds. While the girls slowly \n     execute two demi-plies, he straightens torsos and adjusts \n     elbows. He dances with one girl so she can mirror his \n     movements.\n       As the lush practice music fills the hall, the little girls \n     frown in concentration. If they learn to make their plies and \n     jetes precisely and gracefully, they will join the troupe and \n     go on the tour. ``It's not so important, ladies, to lift your \n     leg high, because you get distortion,'' Oberly says. ``It's \n     like chocolate--do you want quantity or quality? We want \n     Belgian dark chocolate. And just a little of it.'' ``No!''--\n     rebellion in the ranks. ``Hershey bars!'' ``A lot!'' Oberly \n     pretends to look crestfallen. An older group is now arriving, \n     their knapsacks full of schoolbooks and leotards and \n     slippers.\n       Among the newcomers is Jamie McCollough, one of the \n     students Oberly considers talented enough for a ballet \n     career. That is her ardent plan, ``Finances are the hard \n     part,'' Jamie's father, Mark, a carpenter, had explained \n     earlier that day at the McCollough's old house in Wolcott, \n     which he is slowly shoring up and renovating.\n      Jamie's mother, Mollie, a waitress, said: ``Sometimes on her \n     way to bed she actually apologizes for her passion for \n     ballet, even though she's in fourth grade and gets \n     straight A's! And in the morning she comes down and dances \n     to the refrigerator!''\n       While the adults talked in the kitchen, Jamie and her \n     friend Cody Leary, who also plans a dance career, practiced \n     steps in the living room, in full stage regalia. The \n     McColloughs worry about funding Jamie's training as a dancer \n     once she is too old for the Wolcott Children's Ballet. They \n     worry about the troupe itself. ``I'm surprised about the \n     audiences because it's just about always full houses,'' said \n     Mark. ``But now we have to raise money.'' The fundraising \n     crisis, Mollie says, is never-ending.\n       ``It's hard,'' she observes, ``to ask the same little \n     businesses month after month for money. Everything's \n     difficult.'' Mollie points to the kitchen's cinder-block \n     chimney, festooned with pairs of defunct dancing slippers. \n     ``Slippers--once a month! And the stockings!'' But they are \n     enthusiasts. As Mollie puts it: ``Can you believe it? \n     Ballet--here!''\n       At the hillside home of 13-year-old Eliza Martin, another \n     of the dancers, the troupe's finances are also a worry. \n     Eliza's father, Tom, a cabinetmaker, builds props when the \n     troupe needs them. Her mother, Linda, Wolcott's town clerk, \n     also serves on the ballet's board of directors. She believes \n     the ballet has become part of everyday life here. ``I think \n     it gives the kids more than dance because it requires them to \n     commit themselves to something, and performing gives them \n     self-esteem. It's so important for adolescents to have a \n     chance to do something besides watch TV or hang around on the \n     streets--that's why I wanted to be a board member.''\n       At the Wolcott Town Hall, Eliza Martin, Jamie McCollough, \n     Cody Leary and the rest of their group have taken the floor. \n     Oberly is eyeing their feet.\n       ``What happens when you stand on your heels?'' he asks. \n     ``You fall down. The moral is, stand on the balls of your \n     feet. Even when you play basketball. Or prizefight. Do you \n     know who Muhammed Ali is? How could he dance like a butterfly \n     if he didn't stand on the balls of his feet?'' Oberly \n     presents a balletic interpretation of Muhammed Ali, dancing \n     like a butterfly. ``Each step you take is like stepping on \n     stones along a lake, and do you know why?'' Oberly asks. \n     ``Because every move you make for an audience must be \n     special.''\n       Now the most advanced students are arriving, girls of 13 \n     and 14. While they warm up at the barre, the younger group \n     disperses next door to the Wolcott Store and Gas Station for \n     a supper break. In their gauzy skirts and tights, holding \n     grinders and Fudgesicles and bottles of juice, they line up \n     at the counter behind two burly men\n      in flannel shirts smeared with chain-saw oil, buying \n     cigarettes and six-packs. Then they hurry back to the town \n     hall to await their turn to rehearse for the spring tour.\n       They practice late into the evening. ``One of our problems \n     here is that these children never see ballet,'' Oberly \n     announces. ``They have only me and Larissa and each other, so \n     we're all going to Boston.'' That weekend, most of the troupe \n     goes to the big city to see the Boston Ballet perform Eugene \n     Onegin. They return starry-eyed. Jamie McCollough and Cody \n     Leary declare they are even more determined to make their \n     careers in ballet. First, however, they must master The Four \n     Seasons. ``It's a meditation on the seasons,'' Oberly \n     explains to one class. ``Life is seasons, too, and we have \n     our own inner seasons.''\n       But this is a dance with no story. He must find ways to \n     help the dancers bring it to life. ``Really slow, Kaili,'' he \n     says. Kaili Goslant, a slender 10-year-old from Morrisville, \n     whose mother is a police officer and whose father operates a \n     ski lift, is kneeling for a sequence in the ``spring'' \n     section. ``Make believe you're following a spider along the \n     ground,'' Oberly suddenly says. ``Catch it!'' Kaili follows--\n     and grabs--the imaginary spider. And one more segment of The \n     Four Seasons is alive.\n       A bearded man wearing blue jeans and a flannel shirt walks \n     into the hall. He tells two visitors watching the rehearsal \n     that he is John Hancock, father of Juliette Hancock, one of \n     the Four Seasons dancers. He is a logger and the treasurer of \n     the ballet's board of directors.\n       Luckily, he says, use of the Wolcott Town Hall costs just \n     $10 a day. ``If we had to pay at the commercial rate, we \n     couldn't do it.'' Tuition is a minuscule $5 per class. But \n     even these modest fees are waived for children whose parents \n     cannot afford them. Donations trickle in from businesses and \n     citizens. And the troupe applies hopefully for grants. The \n     Vermont Historical Society, for instance, funded half the \n     $1,600 for floor mats. Summers, when the resort town of Stowe \n     puts on pop concerts, Wolcott Children's Ballet volunteers \n     drive over the mountain to run a concession stand.\n       A few afternoons later, Kennet Oberly is teaching his boys \n     class, while one mother, Peggy Sprague, watches from the \n     sidelines. Her daughter, Kate, has just finished her class, \n     and now it's her son Zachary's turn. When red-haired Zachary, \n     who is 11, decided to take ballet, his mother was \n     flabbergasted. ``I told Zach the other boys at school might \n     make fun of him, but he said he didn't care. He said it \n     teaches him good balance.''\n       After the boys troop out, Larissa Sintsova takes over \n     another class. Her family moved to Estonia from Ukraine when \n     she was 6, and she graduated from the Tallinn Choreographic \n     Institute, becoming a principal dancer with the Estonian \n     National Ballet. She brings to\n      the Wolcott Town Hall the Russian no-nonsense style of dance \n     teaching. As the six dancers line up at the barre, she \n     pats her midsection. ``Stomach!'' she says, and the \n     dancers instantly flatten in front. Satisfied, Sintsova \n     moves down the line to Jamie McCollough, who requires only \n     a slight adjustment to the curve of her wrist. ``Remember, \n     Jamie--nice hands,'' she says. Sintsova demonstrates new \n     steps. The dancers imitate her.\n       ``Chest is nice, but back--like this,'' she says, arranging \n     a girl's posture as if arranging flowers. She drops to her \n     knees to study \n\n[[Page S11995]]\n     moving feet. She shows Jamie McCollough and Cody Leary where to look. \n     Even the eyes--every molecule of the body--must be part of \n     the dance. ``Everybody! Elbows are very nice!'' she \n     announces. ``But hands and arms--not forming a round line!'' \n     She has them run through the routine again. ``Ever so slow, \n     Jamie,'' says Sintsova. ``And make the nice hands!''\n       Later that evening, the company's directors meet at the \n     Puffer United Methodist Church in Morrisville. The issue is \n     the new budget. ``I always say, if they can run a tunnel \n     under the English Channel and connect Britain and France, we \n     can run a ballet company,'' says Mark Demers, minister of the \n     Morrisville church and also of the Methodist church in \n     Wolcott. ``But I just saw a cartoon where you come out of the \n     tunnel on the French side, and there's a huge guillotine \n     poised over the exit, which seems to sum up our situation.''\n       ``We never made money on The Nutcracker at Christmas \n     before, so why is it budgeted to earn $3,500 now?'' asks Jack \n     Benoze, a retired Manhattan marketing executive, scrutinizing \n     the budget with a businessman's eye. ``Well, I was encouraged \n     by the attendance at Hardwick last year,'' responds treasurer \n     Hancock. ``I can guarantee the rent on the town hall will \n     increase, because the cost of fuel has doubled,'' says board \n     member Linda Martin.\n       Tuition fees come up. Are they too low, especially when \n     low-income families aren't even charged? The troupe faces a \n     $1,700 shortfall. ``We don't want to turn children away,'' \n     says Mark Demers. ``We've never turned anyone away who \n     couldn't pay, but what about those who say they'll pay and \n     don't?'' asks Jack Benoze.\n       The board decides to require 25 percent up front. But that \n     does not solve one embarrassing problem: the directors owe a \n     grant writer $1,000. ``We have to prioritize,'' says John \n     Hancock, sadly. He points out that he is already paying from \n     his own pocket for routine expenses, like the much-used duct \n     tape. Mark Demers volunteers to send the grant writer an \n     apologetic letter, explaining the delay in payment.\n       The next afternoon, rehearsals for the spring production\n        continue. Now the first performance is just days away. \n     ``Kennet, what's the story of The Four Seasons?'' asks one \n     small blonde girl. ``it's about all the insects in the \n     local swamp,'' Oberly says blandly.\n       He lines up his ``insects'' for their next run-through. The \n     sequence calls for one dancer to lie prone and beat out time \n     on the floor with her hands, while another girl does a \n     headstand and three more dancers form a rotating ring. Oberly \n     gives more instruction in the art of walking, showing how to \n     keep the chest up and the eyes on the goal. ``You're going \n     somewhere,'' he says. The dancers do it all again. Finally, \n     Oberly nods.\n       One May 19th last year, the Wolcott Children's Ballet began \n     its spring tour with five shows for schoolchildren, performed \n     at Johnson State College. (This fall they will be presenting \n     The Little Match Girl, using music composed by several girls \n     in the troupe who live on a communal farm in East Hardwick, \n     where they are home-schooled in music.) School buses from \n     throughout northern Vermont rolled up to the auditorium each \n     day, delivering 500 or so students per show.\n       For the first performance, the auditorium was filled with \n     kids generating a DC-10 roar. One burly boy turned to the \n     adults sitting behind him and announced with historic \n     disgust: ``We have to come every year.'' He pointed to his \n     friend, who was even larger and rougher-looking: ``He likes \n     it!'' The friend reddened.\n       Kennet Oberly walked onstage as the dancers cart-wheeled \n     and pirouetted behind him. He explained that the performance \n     had no sets because it was abstract. ``It's color, it's \n     emotion, but there is no story line--it is pure movement, and \n     it's about how we feel.'' The dancers were already moving \n     across the stage, he said, because the seasons never start \n     and never stop.\n       The dance began. And the 500 youngsters in the audience--\n     amazingly--were attentively silent. At the end, raucous \n     applause. Hoots. Whistles. As the audience left, several \n     small girls danced out the door.\n       A few days later, the troupe began its next tour \n     performance at the Hardwick Town Hall, where the stage floor \n     is warped. It was, mostly, a bib overalls and billed-cap \n     crowd. As the music filled the little hall and the dancers \n     spun and leapt, seemingly in danger of tumbling off the tiny \n     stage, toddlers in the audience took to the aisles to dance \n     along. A tiny voice rose from somewhere in the hall: ``I like \n     the girls' costumes!''\n       Onstage, two little girls whistled like the November wind. \n     Dancers whirled. Jamie McCollough danced her solo. Releve \n     lent, arabesque, pose en arriere . . . And she had--\n     definitely--``the nice hands.''\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to compliment the Senators from \nIdaho, who have spoken, and the Senator from Texas, both Senators from \nVermont, and the Senator from Arkansas, and the Senator from \nMassachusetts, for the way in which we have been able to accommodate \nwhat I think is the justified expectations of people who sometimes \nrather strongly disagree. In any event, they formed a powerful combine, \nand together, with the cooperation from the Senator from North \nCarolina, who is deeply concerned about matters relating to obscenity \nand disrespect for religion, we have come upon and agreed upon an \namendment in this field. I wish to make public the private assurances \nthat I gave to the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, that this is not \na pro forma amendment that I have agreed to, and I will defend the \nposition of the Senate in any conference vigorously.\n  With that, I hope and trust that we are ready to accept the amendment \nby a voice vote.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to say one word. I thank \ncertainly my colleague who I have known for many, many years, for all \nhis assistance in bringing about what I believe we have as a consensus \non passing this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2304, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2304) as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n                           Amendment No. 2303\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, what amendment do we return now to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question recurs on the Craig amendment No. \n2303.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Burns \nbe added as a cosponsor to the amendment of Senator Craig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, having spoken earlier to determine whether \nor not there were any objections or anyone else to speak, we have no \nspeakers, and I believe we are ready to put the question.\nNatural Resources Science Agency's [NRSA] Great Lakes Science Center in \n                             Ann Arbor, MI\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior and \nRelated Agencies in a brief discussion regarding the impact of H.R. \n1977 on the Natural Resources Science Agency's [NRSA] Great Lakes \nScience Center in Ann Arbor, MI.\n  The committee's report accompanying the bill recommends approximately \n$145 million for the NRSA, about $28 million below the budget request. \nIf the committee's recommended level prevails, will this center remain \nopen in fiscal year 1996?\n  Mr. GORTON. It is the committee's intent to provide sufficient funds \nfor research so that research units such as the Great Lakes Science \nCenter and other aquatic fishery research centers can continue to \noperate in fiscal year 1996 to the extent possible.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Washington for his \nresponsiveness. As he may know, the Great Lakes Science Center conducts \nfishery stock assessments that are relied upon by States, tribes, and \nCanada, in part to help fulfill treaty obligations. Effective \nmanagement of fish stocks in the Great Lakes is critical to the $4 \nbillion fishing industry in the region.\n  The center has other important duties. Besides its fishery stock \nmanagement activities, the center conducts invaluable scientific \nresearch on preventing, controlling, and mitigating the impacts of \nnonindigenous species, such as the zebra mussel. And, the center is \nconducting essential studies on the sources and health effects of \ntoxics in the Great Lakes ecosystem.\n  I have been a supporter of the NRSA in the past. However, I am very \nconcerned about administration proposals for allocating any possible \nfiscal year 1996 budget reductions disproportionately to the Great \nLakes region. I will strongly oppose efforts to close or significantly \nreduce the center's activities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the Craig \namendment? The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2303) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  \n[[Page S11996]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe we now have a full list of \namendments to be proposed by Members on this side of the aisle, and I \nbelieve the other side of the aisle is very close to that point. I urge \nanyone who wishes to add his or her name to do so. I hope that soon we \ncan at least get the unanimous consent agreement on what amendments \nremain to be discussed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2305\n\n    (Purpose: To permit the use of funds for the award of grants to \nindividuals for National Heritage Fellowships and American Jazz Masters \n                              Fellowships)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Pell, and Mr. Simon, proposes an amendment numbered 2305.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 135, line 25, insert before the period at the end \n     thereof the following: ``, National Heritage Fellowship, or \n     American Jazz Masters Fellowship''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The committee amendments will be set aside.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will not belabor the issue but I would \nlike to explain this. I have the cosponsorship of Senator Pell and also \nSenator Simon for the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. 1977 that \nwould expand the category of individual fellowships that could be \nawarded by the National Endowment for the Arts to include National \nHeritage Fellowship Awards and American Jazz Masters Awards. Under the \nbill reported by committee, only literature individual grants could be \nawarded. This amendment provides no new funding--the NEA would have to \npay for these honorific fellowships out of existing funds.\n  Mr. President, the fellowships I am seeking to restore, out of \nexisting funding for the NEA in the bill, are given in recognition of \noutstanding achievement in the folk arts and in jazz music. An \nindividual cannot apply for these awards; he or she must be nominated. \nTo the best of my knowledge, these awards have generated absolutely no \ncontroversy at any time. They have, however, generated great and well-\ndeserved pride for those receiving them, and have done much to preserve \nthe folk and traditional art and jazz music that distinguish our great \nnation.\n  To give some flavor of the artists recognized by these awards, I can \nshare with my colleagues some of the artists recognized by the National \nHeritage Fellowship Program this year. They include Mary Holiday Black, \na Navajo basket weaver, Robert Lockwood, Jr., an African-American blues \nguitarist, Donny Golden, an Irish-American step dancer, and Buck \nRamsey, a cowboy poet and singer from Amarillo, TX. Jazz artists \nrecognized this year include Ray Brown, Roy Haynes, and Horace Silver. \nEach of these artists is a part of our diverse and truly wonderful \nAmerican cultural heritage, and all are worthy of our recognition. By \nrecognizing these artists, we also gain the opportunity to appreciate \nour diversity, and the unifying effect this appreciation can have on \nour Nation.\n  I think it is worth noting that we are not the only nation that \nrecognizes its masters of traditional art forms. In fact, the \nfellowships I seek to restore are sometimes called National Treasure \nAwards because they resemble the Living National Treasures awards given \nin Japan. I am told that those awards in Japan are in fact richer \nawards, providing annual stipends for life. Our awards, by contrast, \nprovide one-time awards of $10,000-$20,000.\n  Although the financial award is often very important to the \ntraditional artists and musicians receiving them, at least as important \nis the recognition that their art is cherished by our Nation. This \nnational recognition simply cannot be recreated by the States, and for \nthat reason, I believe that we must allow the NEA to continue these \nimportant programs.\n  In closing, I would like to quote one of the several New Mexicans who \nhave received a National Heritage Fellowship. Upon receiving his award \nduring the Reagan administration, the great Santos woodcarver George \nLopez noted, ``I receive this, but it is for all those who came before \nme and made a lesson for all of us with their lives.''\n  Mr. President, let me just elaborate a little bit on each of these \ncategories to make the point a little more clearly for my colleagues. \nThe idea of these awards is to pick out a very few artists toward the \nend of their career, artists who provide a positive vision for what can \nbe done and what can be preserved that is great in our culture and our \nheritage.\n  The recipients this year come from a variety of States--from New \nYork, Utah, Missouri, Virginia, North Carolina, Alaska, California, \nOhio, Florida, South Dakota, and Texas. All of these recipients are \ndeserving recipients.\n  By giving them these National Heritage Fellowship Awards, we are \nacknowledging them for their work as teachers, their work as role \nmodels, mentors, or innovators. Each artist receives a one-time \nstipend, as I indicated.\n  Let me say a couple of words about the Jazz Masters Award. There have \nbeen many great jazz artists in the history of our country who have \nreceived this award in recent years: Dizzy Gillespie, Count Basie, \nMiles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Bellson, Art Blakey, Sarah Vaughan, \nand Lionel Hampton are examples that I think all Members of this body \nwill recognize.\n  The present practice of the National Endowment for the Arts is to \nmake awards to somewhere between 3 and 5 individuals each year under \nthe Jazz Masters Awards, to make awards to 12 individuals each year \nunder the National Heritage Award.\n  As I said at the very beginning of my discussion, this is not an \namendment to add money to the National Endowment for the Arts budget. \nAll this amendment is, Mr. President, is a granting of authority for \nthe National Endowment for the Arts to continue with these very \nvaluable, very important programs which we have all recognized over the \nyears.\n  I point out to my colleagues and remind them that each year, here in \nthe Senate, we have a reception at which we recognize and acknowledge \nand congratulate the winners of these National Heritage Fellowship \nAwards. So I think it would be highly misguided for this body at this \ntime to approve legislation that prohibits the National Endowment for \nthe Arts from going forward and maintaining this tradition that they \nhave begun, which I think is so important to our country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na full list of the National Heritage Fellowship Award winners, by \nState.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered printed in the Record, \nas follows:\n\n\n              NATIONAL HERITAGE FELLOWSHIP AWARDS BY STATE\n\n                                Alabama\n\n       Dewey Williams, Shape Note Singer 1983\n       Jerry Brown, Potter\n       Nora Ezell, African American Quilter\n\n\n                                 Alaska\n\n       Ester Littlefield, Alaskan Craftsman 1991\n       Belle Deacon, Basketmaker\n       Nichalos and Elena Charles, Woodcarvers\n       Paul Tiulana, Eskimo Artist\n       Jenny Thlunaut, Blanket Weaver\n\n\n                                Arizona\n\n       Chesley Wilson, Fiddle Maker\n\n\n                                Arkansas\n\n       Almeda Riddle, Ballad Singer 1983\n       Glenn Ohrlin, Cowboy Singer\n\n\n                               California\n\n       Brownie McGhee, Blues Guitarist 1882\n       John Lee Hooker, Blues Musician 1983\n       Nativitad Cano, Mariachi 1990\n       George Blake, Native American Craftsman 1991\n       Edwardo Guerro, Mexican Composer 1991\n       Kahmvong Insixiengmai, Asian Singer 1991\n       Gussie Wells, African American Quilter\n       Arble Williams, African American Quilter\n       Francisco Aguabella, Afro Cuban Drummer\n       John Naka, Bonsai Sculpter\n       Louis Ortega, Raw-hide Worker\n       Kansuna Fujima, Dancer\n       Jose Guiterrez, Musician\n       Richard Hagopian, Musician\n\n\n                                Colorado\n\n       Eppie Archuleta, Weaver\n\n\n                              Connecticut\n\n       T.

I know the Senator from Vermont had indicated he \nwanted to speak briefly in favor of the amendment.\n  Perhaps--in order to ensure that he has that opportunity, at least \nfor a few moments here, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from New Mexico. \nI understand the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] has had concerns \nabout this amendment and it is also for that reason a quorum was put \nin. We needed to check with her to see whether or not she wished to \nspeak on the amendment.\n  I am now informed the Senator from Kansas will later put a statement \nin the Record on this, and is willing to allow the amendment to be \nvoted on by voice vote.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I just informed the manager I was \nadvised by Senator Jeffords he did want to speak briefly in favor. I do \nnot know if that is still the case, but we are checking on that. If we \ncan just have another few moments with which to do that, and then have \na voice vote? I certainly do not require a rollcall vote on the issue. \nI would just like him to be able to make a statement if he desires to \ndo so.\n\n[[Page S11998]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I note the presence of the Senator from Vermont now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have listened to the statement of my \ngood friend from New Mexico on the amendment. I personally support it. \nI do not believe in any way it goes against what we intended to do in \nthe committee, with respect to individual artists and the questionable \nworks of some.\n  The purpose and intent of reducing those who are eligible for \nindividual grants was to protect the integrity of what we are trying to \ndo in preserving the endowment.\n  I personally believe that the amendment represents an improvement in \nthe bill.\n  I have notified the chairman of the committee [Senator Kassebaum], \nwho may or may not have an objection to it--notified her some time ago, \nSenator Kassebaum. I do not know her feelings. In committee she was \nvery restrictive, and understandably so. But I support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont. Based \non the statement that the manager of the bill has made about the \nSenator from Kansas intending to put a statement in the Record but \nallowing this to be voice voted, I have no objection to that procedure. \nIf we could dispose of it at this time, I urge adoption of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on amendment No. 2305, \nthe Bingaman amendment?\n  If there be no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2305) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we are open for business. There may be \ndiscussions going on at the present time. I can say I know the Senator \nfrom Vermont [Mr. Leahy] has an amendment on stewardship incentive \nprograms which will require debate and a vote. I believe the Senator \nfrom North Carolina [Mr. Helms] has an amendment on the red wolf, which \nI suspect will require a vote.\n  I know Senator Simon has an amendment on a museum that I believe will \nrequire a vote. And perhaps two or three others.\n  But I solicit Members to come to the floor and see whether or not we \ncan accept their amendments or have a debate. The majority leader, \nunderstandably, would like very much to finish this bill by late this \nafternoon in order that we can go on to further business and begin our \nsummer recess promptly.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I recognize that we have completed action \non an amendment that was offered by Senator Jeffords relative to \nrestoration of funds for the National Endowment for the Arts and the \nNational Endowment for the Humanities. However, I would like to make a \nbrief statement on those issues.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased with the action we have taken today. I \nshare the disappointment of my colleague from Arkansas, Senator \nBumpers, that it was not more substantial. And I hope that the action \ntoday is an indication of a continued interest by the Senate on the \nissue of national support for the arts and the humanities that we can \nbuild upon this decision in future years.\n  I believe that this issue of the appropriateness of a national \ncommitment to support the arts and humanities has unfortunately been \ntrivialized in that a few extreme examples have been cited as \nrepresentative of the totality of our national effort and have in fact \ndistorted what the United States has done in terms of its support for \nthe arts and humanities.\n  Let me just mention a few things that benefit America in a very real \nand tangible sense which would not be but for this national commitment \nto the arts and the humanities. One of those is to bring the arts to \nthe areas of America that would otherwise be excluded from such \nexposure because of their remoteness, because of their small \npopulation, because of their lack of a cultural infrastructure.\n  In my own State of Florida, many small communities are benefited by \nhaving access to performing arts and creative arts which they would not \nhave but for the grants that are made available either directly through \nthe national endowments or through the State endowment programs that \ndepend upon Federal support.\n  One of the most important aspects of the National Endowment for the \nHumanities is the support for America's libraries. America's libraries \nare probably the most underappreciated aspect of our educational \nsystem. They provide resources increasingly in all of the means by \nwhich information and ideas and creativity are transmitted to all \nAmericans. They are a free institution that contributes significantly \nto seeing that all Americans have an equal access to learning.\n  We debated this extensively during the course of the \ntelecommunications bill and decided that it was appropriate to give \nsome special recognition to public libraries in terms of their access \nto the information highway. The National Endowment for the Humanities \nhas been providing that on ramp for many years through its support of \nthe expansion of opportunities available through public libraries.\n  The preservation of historic documents is largely a responsibility of \nthe National Endowment for the Humanities through programs like the \nBrittle Book program, which is converting tens of thousands of books \nwhich would otherwise evaporate in a physical sense, evaporate but for \nthe efforts supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities to \nsee that they are microfilmed and preserved. Today one of the most \nimportant aspects of this preservation relates to newspapers. As many \nnewspapers, particularly smaller newspapers, go out of existence or \nmerge, their libraries of old newspapers are now being preserved \nthrough the efforts of the National Endowment for the Humanities, an \ninvaluable resource of the history and culture of our Nation.\n  It is unfortunate that this debate on the national support for the \nhumanities and arts is often characterized as elitist, that the only \npeople who care about this issue are small groups of persons who are \naffluent enough to do this on their own and, therefore, inappropriate \nfor public support.\n  I disagree with that and so would the facts. As an example, Mr. \nPresident, the Metropolitan Museum in New York, which most Americans \nhave benefited from, even those who live thousands of miles away from \nNew York City, that great world treasury draws more people annually \nthan all of the sports teams in New York City. More people visit the \nMetropolitan Museum than visit the Giants, the Mets, the Yankees, the \nKnicks, and all of the other professional teams in New York City. It is \nnot an elitist institution. It is an institution which serves the \nbroadest public interest.\n  There are important economic aspects of our support for the arts. \nStrong artistic institutions create a synergy in terms of the economics \nof the communities. There are many examples in my State. I would just \ncite the tremendous economic influence which the Miami City Ballet, \nwhich has received support through these endowments, has had in terms \nof supporting important artistic and economic components of our State. \nBut beyond the economics, there are extremely important cultural \naspects of our support for the arts.\n  Throughout time, societies have influenced their world by the use of \nthe arts. One of the reasons that the Greeks and the Romans, and the \nEgyptians before them, were such powerful influences and then have \ncontinued to influence our life today, is because of the arts and the \nuse of the arts as a means of expressing a societal set of ideas and \nvalues which have had transcendence of importance.\n \n[[Page S11999]]\n\n  Today, the United States of America, while we may have a trade \ndeficit in terms of the sale of products, has an enormous trade surplus \nin terms of the export of ideas and creativity. That not only has \neconomic value, but it also helps to advance the cultural goals that \nthe United States hopes to carry to the world. We want the world to see \nthe values that we stand for--freedom, independence, respect for human \nrights, democracy, a market system that democratizes economic \ndecisions. We would like to see the world adopt those values, not \nbecause we want to impose them but because we think those are the \nvalues that advance the human spirit. Our investment in and our \ndominant position in the culture of the world is an important means by \nwhich we will achieve that goal.\n  The support for the small artistic institutions or the individual \nartists is the seed corn for our ability to exercise that type of a \nstrong cultural influence in the world.\n  One of my favorite political figures, Mr. President, was the \nPresident of Costa Rica during the 1940's and 1950's, President \nFigueres, whose son is now the President of Costa Rica. President \nFigueres did a number of bold acts as President of Costa Rica. He \ndisbanded the army. He took the money that had been spent on the \nmilitary and used it to enhance education and health and the arts, \nincluding the establishment of a national symphony for the small and \nrelatively poor country of Costa Rica.\n  President Figueres was much criticized for the establishment of a \nnational symphony. It was too much for the economy of Costa Rica to be \nable to support. It was a diversion of funds away from more important \nand immediate needs of the people. President Figueres responded to \nthose criticisms by saying, ``We in Costa Rica believe in work. We work \nhard on tractors. Why do we work hard on tractors if it is not to be \nable to listen to violins?''\n  The arts express the reason for life. Tractors are important, but \nthey are a means by which we can enrich our spirit by exposure to the \narts.\n  So, Mr. President, we have made a small step forward today in \nrecognizing the importance of that in our times and in our society, the \nUnited States of America.\n  It is not as far as I would have wished that it could have been but \nby preserving this base of national support for the humanities and the \narts, I hope that we will be planting our own form of seed corn that \nwill allow us to grow a deeper and more abundant support for these \nimportant national initiatives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na statement by the American Historian David McCullough in support of \nthe Endowments for the Humanities and Arts.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Testimony of David McCullough Before the House Appropriations \n                   Subcommittee on February 16, 1995\n\n       As a citizen I am greatly concerned about the decline of \n     library facilities in our schools, the decline, even the \n     elimination of art, music, and dramatic instruction in the \n     schools, the reduction of services at our public libraries, \n     and the current ill-reasoned, ill-informed assaults on public \n     television. But as one who works in public television. But as \n     one who works in public television and with schools and \n     universities, museums, libraries, I also know the marvelous \n     possibilities there are, how much more can be done and done \n     better, and that to me is what is so exciting.\n       In the year 1814, after invading British troops burned the \n     congressional library, and Thomas Jefferson offered to sell \n     Congress his own library as a replacement, a heated debate \n     ensued. The issue, much like today, divided mainly on party \n     lines, with those in opposition to the purchase arguing that \n     the cost was too much or that since the books belonged to Mr. \n     Jefferson, a known free-thinker, some might not be at all \n     suitable. Critics attacked the very idea of wasting federal \n     money on ``philosophical nonsense.'' A large number of the \n     books were described by one member of Congress as \n     ``worthless, in languages which many can not read, and most \n     ought not.''\n       But Congress voted for the purchase, $23,950 for 6,500 \n     volumes. It may be seen as the beginning of federal \n     involvement in the arts and humanities and to the everlasting \n     benefit of the country. Today the Library of Congress is the \n     largest, finest repository of knowledge in the world, a crown \n     jewel in our national life.\n       The Lincoln Memorial, completed in 1922, is a great work of \n     public art. Its colossal statue of Lincoln, an effort of \n     thirteen years by the American sculptor Daniel Chester \n     French, is indeed the greatest work of public sculpture in \n     America and stunning testimony to the virtue of public \n     support--public money--for the area. It was costly to create. \n     It is costly, still--more than a million dollars a year for \n     upkeep and guide personnel--and worth every Lincoln penny of \n     that.\n       In the 1930s, during the hard times of the Great \n     Depression, came the Federal Writers Project, the Federal \n     Arts Projects, the Federal Theater Project, providing work \n     opportunities for writers and artists as never before. The \n     Federal Writers Project alone employed 12,000 people, among \n     whom were young Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Eudora Welty, \n     and Saul Bellow. The paintings, post office murals, the \n     incomparable series of state guidebooks that resulted are \n     among our national treasures.\n       In World War II, hundreds of artists, photographers, \n     filmmakers were assigned to record the experiences of \n     American service men and women on both fronts, and again at \n     government expense.\n       The programs and projects of the National Endowment for the \n     Humanities ``are sound investments for the federal government \n     to make, even during this era of fiscal constraints,''said \n     the chairman of the Endowment, Lynne Cheney, before a House \n     committee in 1991. The American people, she said the \n     following year, ``value the humanities and understand the \n     importance of things historical and cultural.'' Projects \n     supported by the Endowment, she continued, ``help to make \n     available a rich variety of opportunities for people to learn \n     more about the nation's heritage and the history and thought \n     of other cultures.'' What she said was right then and it is \n     right today, make no mistake.\n       It is argued that because a few of the hundreds of programs \n     sponsored by the Endowments have proven unworthy, or ill-\n     conceived, or worst of all, flagrantly offensive, that \n     therefore both the National Endowment for the Arts and the \n     National Endowment for the Humanities should be done away \n     with. That's absurd. It would be like saying that because of \n     the Tailhook Scandal we must get rid of the Navy.\n       When I think of what the National Endowment for the \n     Humanities has done to support gifted young documentary film \n     makers like Ken Burns, when I count up the programs in The \n     American Experience series that have benefited from Endowment \n     funding--thirty-eight films thus far, including biographical \n     portraits of such American figures as Eisenhower, FDR, \n     Lindbergh, Duke Ellington, Thurgood Marshall--when I see the \n     magnificent Library of America volumes filling shelf after \n     shelf, when I see in my own research in libraries and \n     archives the priceless books and historic documents that have \n     been preserved, all this, the films, the books, the \n     conservation efforts--because of Endowment grants, I know \n     absolutely the lasting value of government support.\n       Last night's broadcast of The American Experience, a \n     program called ``One Woman.\n      One Vote,'' marking the 75th anniversary of the 19th \n     Amendment, was called ``first rate'' by The Wall Street \n     Journal, which also praised the ``intellectual mettle and \n     moral character'' of the protagonists portrayed in the \n     long fight for women's suffrage. The broadcast, funded in \n     part by the National Endowment for the Humanities, was \n     seen by about 5,000,000 people. And that's only the \n     beginning. As the executive producer of the series, Judy \n     Crichton, says, this is not ``disposal television.'' Every \n     program is rerun, and with the audiences for the second or \n     third broadcasts often lager than the first. Further, the \n     programs are used in schools throughout the country, and \n     more so all the time.\n       Anyone who claims that commercial television could do the \n     same thing as well doesn't know what he's talking about.\n       The Library of America has been called by Newsweek, ``the \n     most important book publishing project in the nation's \n     history.'' It is a collection of the riches of our American \n     literature and political philosophy, cloth-bound, on acid-\n     free paper, and reasonably priced. There are now seventy-\n     three titles in print, two and a half million of these books \n     in circulation. Were it not for the National Endowment for \n     the Humanities, the Library of America would not exist.\n       Mr. Chairman, I can tell you about the rare documents in \n     the collection of the library of the Philadelphia Athenaeum, \n     including original architectural drawings of the Capitol, \n     that are being properly maintained with the help of NEH \n     grants. I can tell you about the twenty-year program, \n     starting in 1989, with congressional support, the goal being \n     to preserve on microfilm the content of some 3,000,000 \n     brittle books. Grants already made will, when completed, have \n     saved the contents of 660,000 volumes. This is unprecedented. \n     And seventy libraries are taking part nationwide. I can tell \n     you about the humanities program at one of our oldest and \n     best small colleges, Union College in Schenectady, New York, \n     which next week celebrates its 200th birthday. Long known for \n     the strengths of its science and technology departments, \n     Union, motivated by two NEH grants, is greatly enlarging its \n     library and thus its whole humanities curriculum. Because of \n     three NEH grants for the new John Heinz Pittsburgh Regional \n     History Center, grants totaling $1,500,000, we have been able \n     to raise at least twice, if not three times that amount, from \n     private, corporate, and foundation sources. Critics of the \n     Endowments carp about money spent for elitists' interests. \n     Mr. Chairman, attendance for this \n\n[[Page S12000]]\n\n     one new museum is expected to be somewhere between 400,000 \n     and 500,000 people a year, including at least 100,000 school \n     children. And while the NEH grants represent only a fraction \n     of the total cost, perhaps 6 percent, I assure you the \n     project would not be where it is today had there been no \n     National Endowment endorsement.\n       One of the glories of our American way of life, Mr. \n     Chairman, is our nation-wide system of public libraries, free \n     public libraries, the large majority of which, let me \n     emphasize, are located in small towns and cities of less than \n     25,000 people.\n       When you cross the threshold into an American public \n     library, you enter a world of absolute equality. All are \n     welcome, all have the same access to the riches within.\n       We hear much talk about the information highway. But \n     information isn't learning, isn't education, and there is no \n     education without books. In our wonderful public libraries \n     the books are free. Everyone has open access to ideas. The \n     computer hookups, too, are free. At the public library, a \n     youngster in a town on the Nebraska plains or a mill town in \n     Ohio can tie in to the same resources now as a student at one \n     of the great universities. Isn't that marvelous? Isn't that \n     American?\n       Newspapers, magazines, books in bookstores, cable \n     television, they all cost money. They're all fine if you can \n     afford them. Our national parks now charge an admission. \n     There's even talk here of charging for a tour of the Capitol! \n     But the public libraries remain free to the people, thank \n     God, and I don't know of federal dollars better spent than \n     those that through the National Endowments go to support our \n     public libraries.\n       Mr. Chairman, we now have 6,000,000 children living below \n     the poverty level--in this country, here in the United States \n     of America. What an outrage that is. And what a terrible cost \n     it will mean, unless something is done. What kind of \n     education will those children get? What kind of education \n     will any of our children get if the cutbacks continue in the \n     teaching of arts and music in our public school? What can we \n     expect when school libraries have no books, or when school \n     libraries shut down.\n       Mr. Chairman, as good as the work of the National \n     Endowments has been it is hardly a scratch on what could be \n     done, and what needs to be done. We have, for example, the \n     two great existing national institutions of public television \n     and the public library system that could join forces. They're \n     going concerns, each with its own immense power. Join that \n     power, those resources, and the effect could mean new \n     breakthroughs in education at all levels. I feel very \n     strongly about this. I want to see television audiences \n     brought in to the libraries and the libraries brought home to \n     television audiences, and I am working on a new project to \n     that end.\n       Instead of arguing over cutting the life out of the \n     existing programs of the Endowments, or ditching them \n     altogether, we ought to be joining forces in an effort to \n     make them better, more effective, of even greater benefit to \n     the country. We ought to be using our imaginations to do more \n     not less. Appropriations for the Endowments shouldn't be cut, \n     they should be doubled.\n       Mr. Chairman, more than two hundred years ago, a member of \n     another congress, the Continental Congress, wrote privately \n     of his fear that the future might be in the hands of members \n     who would hold sway by ``noise not sense, by meanness not \n     greatness, by ignorance nor learning, by contracted hearts \n     not large souls.''\n       As events would prove and to the everlasting benefit of our \n     nation, he, John Adams, and others of the founders were \n     Americans of abundant sense, learning, and soul, who knew \n     education to be the foundation upon which depended the whole \n     daring American experiment.\n       If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, it expects \n     what never was and never will be,'' warned Thomas Jefferson. \n     If was the example of America that so mattered for the future \n     of mankind.\n       They were politicians, to be sure. They could be \n     inconsistent, contradictory, mistaken, human. But they were \n     great lovers of books, of language, of art, of history. They \n     were architects, musicians, philosophers, and poets, if not \n     in practice, then certainly at heart.\n       John Adams, let us also not forget, was a farmer who worked \n     his land with his own hands, whose homestead comprised all of \n     four rooms.\n       In your deliberations, Mr. Chairman, you and your fellow \n     members of Congress--you who have so much of the future of \n     the country in your hands--might well take to heart these \n     wonderful lines written by John Adams in a letter to his wife \n     Abigail.\n       ``I must study politics and war that my sons may have \n     liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. My sons ought to \n     study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history, \n     naval architecture, navigation, commerce, and agriculture, in \n     order to give their children a right to study painting, \n     poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry, and \n     porcelain.''\n       Mr. Chairman, a great nation puts the highest value on its \n     art and literature, its history, its intellectual heritage. A \n     great nation takes its measure by the quality of life on its \n     citizens. A great nation takes care of its children, provides \n     schools second to none, schools where painting and music are \n     never dismissed as frills, never ever considered expendable. \n     A great nation prizes its poets no less than the best of it \n     politicians.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, with the permission and understanding of \nthe manager of the bill, the distinguished Senator from Washington [Mr. \nGorton], and also after consultation with the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nfor a time not to exceed 12 minutes in morning business.\n  Mr. GORTON. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, the \nSenator from Arkansas has been waiting a long time to make remarks and \nI certainly want to allow him to make the remarks. We do have now \npresent in the Chamber the Senator from Illinois, who will have an \namendment which will require a rollcall vote. So as promptly as the \nSenator from Arkansas completes his remarks, I hope we will go to the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, then let me withdraw that request.\n  Mr. SIMON. Go ahead.\n  Mr. PRYOR. The Senator from Illinois says he is waiting, so I will \nproceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/09/senate-section/article/S11980-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12000-S12002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         COLLECTION ACTIVITIES OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, on Saturday when the Treasury, Postal \nService and general Government appropriations bill came to the floor of \nthe Senate, it had what I thought to be a rather odd provision. I \nauthored and had introduced in my behalf--I was not present on \nSaturday--an amendment to strike $13 million to ``initiate a program to \nutilize private counsel law firms and debt collection agencies in the \ncollection activities of the Internal Revenue Service.''\n  In short, Mr. President, this provision requires the IRS to spend $13 \nmillion--this was under the proposed language--to hire private law \nfirms and private bill collectors to collect the debts of the American \ntaxpayer owed to the Internal Revenue Service. My amendment is very \nsimple. It strikes this provision from the Treasury, Postal Service \nappropriations bill, as well it should. I thank the managers of the \nbill for accepting my amendment. I urge the conferees to stay with the \ndecision of the Senate in this matter.\n  Mr. President, in over 200 years of our Federal Government, we have \nnever turned over the business of collecting taxes to the private \nsector.\n  I must point out that this dubious practice is as old as the hills \nand dates back to ancient Greece. The practice of a private tax \ncollection theory even has a name, I have discovered. It is called tax \nfarming. Its modern history is chronicled in a book authored by Charles \nAdams, a tax lawyer and history teacher. This book is named, ``For Good \nand Evil: The Impact of Taxes on the Course of Civilization.''\n  In this book, Mr. Adams recounts many tales of how the world has \nsuffered under the oppression of tax farmers. He specifically describes \nthe tax farmers sent by the Greek kings to the island of Cos as \n``thugs, and even the privacy of a person's home was not secure from \nthem,'' according to the author. He further states that a respected \nlady of Cos around 200 B.C. wrote, ``Every door trembles at the tax-\nfarmers.'' Once again, Mr. President, the tax farmers were the private \ncollectors of the public debt.\n  In the later Greek and Roman world, no social class was hated more \nthan the tax farmer. A leading historian of that period described tax \nfarmers with these words:\n\n       The publican (keepers of the public house) certainly were \n     ruthless tax collectors, and dangerous and unscrupulous \n     rivals in business. They were often dishonest and probably \n     always cruel.\n\n  Tax farming flourished; it was a monster of oppression in Western \ncivilization, in many forms, for over 2,500 years until its demise \nshortly after World War I.\n  Tax farming, Mr. President, brutalized prerevolutionary France. The \nFrench court paid the price during the Reign of Terror when the people \nwere so incensed that they rounded up the tax farmers, they tried them \nin the people's courts and they condemned them to death. Accounts of \nthis time tell us of the taxpayers cheering while \n\n[[Page S12001]]\nthe heads of the tax farmers tumbled from the guillotine.\n  In 17th century England, Charles II imposed a hearth tax assessing \ntwo shillings per chimney in each house. To collect it, the King \ncontracted out--in fact, he privatized the tax collection system--with \nprivate collection parties named by the people as ``chimney men.'' \nThese chimney men were ruthless. They were hated by the people of \nEngland. Hatred of the privately collected tax helped to depose \nCharles' brother, James II. As soon as the new monarchs, William and \nMary, were installed, the House of Commons abolished the tax, ending a \n``badge of slavery upon the whole people that allowed every man's house \nto be entered and searched at the pleasure of persons unknown to him.''\n  I am not suggesting that providing $13 million to the Internal \nRevenue Service in order to contract out, to privatize collections with \nprivate law firms and collection agencies will cause anyone to actually \nlose their head, but for well reasoned decisionmakers history should be \nutilized as a guide as to what is and what is not a good idea. Clearly, \nhistory tells us that contracting out the tax collection system and the \nresponsibilities that Government should be performing is not a good \nidea.\n  Some very notable economists and philosophers have also warned \nagainst tax farming. In his book, ``The Wealth of Nations,'' Adam Smith \nstates, ``The best and most frugal way of levying a tax can never be by \nfarm.''\n  Mr. President, I know there are those in this Chamber who revere Adam \nSmith so I hope they will heed his message in ``The Wealth of Nations'' \nagainst tax farming. Just as relevant to the discussion is how this \npractice may be employed in our time and by the Federal Government. Who \nwill these people be? How will they be hired? Who will train them? Who \nwill oversee them? Which taxpayers' cases can they work on? What type \nof taxpayer information will be made available to them? And how will \nthese private bill collectors be paid? Will we be creating a true \nbounty hunter system within our tax collection process?\n  This legislation provides no answer to these important questions. It \nsimply provides taxpayers' dollars, $13 million, to nameless, faceless, \nuntrained, unaccountable bill collectors and law firms with no guidance \nas to how they will be paid or how they will protect the \nconfidentiality of the taxpayer's information.\n  Let us just briefly explore two of the questions I have just \nmentioned. First, to what type of taxpayer information will these \nprivate bill collectors have access? The American people demand that \ntheir tax return information be kept confidential, that it will only be \nshared with the appropriate personnel within Government. It is an \nessential element which lends confidence in our tax system, and it \nleads to a very high percentage of voluntary compliance. If taxpayer \ninformation is shared outside of the Government confidence, how many \ntaxpayers will decide to no longer comply? This is a critical question. \nI fear in an effort to collect more revenues we will in fact collect \nless.\n  Second--and I am about to close, Mr. President--how will these bill \ncollectors be paid?\n This bill does not specify that, and also does not specify which of \nthese private law firms and private collection agencies will be \ncompensated.\n\n  Mr. President, most bill collectors are paid on a contingency basis; \nthat is, they are compensated by a percentage of what they collect. \nAgain, bounty hunters will be created to collect our taxes.\n  It is exactly what the 1988 taxpayer bill of rights, which passed \nthat year, declared illegal and unlawful. There is included in the \ntaxpayer bill of rights a strict prohibition against the Internal \nRevenue Service from using enforcement goals or quotas.\n  Mr. President, I know that my time is running out, but I would like \nto have printed in the Record a letter from the Commissioner of the \nInternal Revenue Service, Margaret Milner Richardson, that she wrote to \nme on August 4, stating her grave concern about even the remote \npossibility of farming out and privatizing the IRS collection system.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Treasury,\n\n\n                                     Internal Revenue Service,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 4, 1995.\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: I am writing to express my concern \n     regarding statutory language in the FY 1996 Appropriations \n     Committee Bill (H.R. 2020) for Treasury, Postal Service and \n     General Government that would mandate the Internal Revenue \n     Service (IRS) spend $13 million ``to initiate a program to \n     utilize private counsel law firms and debt collection \n     activities * * *'' I have grave reservations about starting \n     down the path of using private contractors to contact \n     taxpayers regarding their delinquent tax debts without \n     Congress having a thorough understanding of the costs, \n     benefits and risks of embarking on such a course.\n       There are some administrative and support functions in the \n     collection activity that do lend themselves to performance by \n     private sector enterprises under contract to the IRS. For \n     example, in FY 1994, the IRS spent nearly $5 million for \n     contracts to acquire addresses and telephone numbers for \n     taxpayers with delinquent accounts. In addition, we are \n     taking many steps to emulate the best collection practices of \n     the private sector to the extent they are compatible with \n     safeguarding taxpayer rights. However, to this point, the IRS \n     has not engaged in contractors to make direct contact with \n     taxpayers regarding delinquent taxes as is envisioned in H.R. \n     2020. Before taking this step, I strongly recommend that all \n     parties with an interest obtain solid information on the \n     following key issues:\n       (1) What impact would private debt collectors have on the \n     public's perception of the fairness of tax administration and \n     of the security of the financial information provided to the \n     IRS? A recent survey conducted by Anderson Consulting \n     revealed that 59% of Americans oppose state tax agencies \n     contracting with private companies to administer and collect \n     taxes while only 35% favor such a proposal. In all \n     likelihood, the proportion of those opposed would be even \n     higher for Federal taxes. Addressing potential public \n     misgiving should be a priority concern.\n       (2) How would taxpayers rights be protected and privacy be \n     guaranteed once tax information was released to private debt \n     collectors? Would the financial incentives common to private \n     debt collection (keeping a percentage of the amount \n     collected) result in reduced rights for certain taxpayers \n     whose accounts had been privatized? Using private collectors \n     to contact taxpayers on collection matters would pose unique \n     oversight problems for the IRS to assure that Taxpayers Bill \n     of Rights and privacy rights are protected for all taxpayers. \n     Commingling of tax and non-tax data by contractors is a risk \n     as is the use of tax information for purposes other than \n     intended.\n       (3) Is privatizing collection of tax debt a good business \n     decision for the Federal Government? Private contractors have \n     none of the collection powers the Congress has given to the \n     IRS. Therefore, their success in collection may not yield the \n     same return as a similar amount invested in IRS telephone or \n     field collection activities where the capability to contact \n     taxpayers is linked with the ability to initiate liens and \n     levy on property if need be. Currently, the IRS telephone \n     collection efforts yield about $26 collected for every dollar \n     expended. More complex and difficult cases dealt with in the \n     field yield about $10 for every dollar spent.\n       I strongly believe a more extensive dialogue is needed on \n     the matter of contracting out collection activity before the \n     IRS proceeds to implement such a provision. Please let me \n     know if I can provide any additional information that would \n     be of value to you as Congress considers this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Margaret Milner Richardson,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. I strongly believe, Mr. President, it is an idea whose \ntime has not come. I strongly urge, Mr. President, that our conferees \non the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government appropriations \nbill adhere to the decision that we made, that now is not the time nor \nwill it be in the near future for us to privatize the collections of \nthe Internal Revenue Service.\n  Mr. SIMON. Would my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I will be proud to yield to my friend from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. First of all, I concur completely. This idea of \nprivatizing everything sounds good. What it does, it gives an \nadministration or a Congress an ability to say, ``Oh, we have reduced \nthe number of Federal employees.'' We do not save one dollar for the \nFederal Government. And we invite abuse.\n  I would mention second--I would be interested in the reaction of the \nSenator from Arkansas--I have learned, in the Office of Personnel \nManagement, we are moving toward privatizing the investigators there, \nthe people who will investigate people for trust positions with the \nU.S. Government. Now, you privatize that and someone maybe is slipped a \nfew dollars or--all kinds of abuse is possible there.\n  Does the Senator from Arkansas think that privatizing investigators \nin \n\n[[Page S12002]]\nthe Office of Personnel Management is a direction in which we ought to \ngo?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I do not know how much time I have left. \nBut I would respond to my friend from Illinois that I have been here \nnow for 16\\1/2\\ years. I have watched us rely, as a Government, more \nand more on private contractors--and we are not holding down the cost \nof Government, as the distinguished Senator from Illinois has stated. \nWe are continuing to have the cost of Government rise, while the \naccountability of Government falls. This is of great concern to me. It \nconcerns me that the private contractors are under no code of ethics \nwhatsoever. They have no Government code of ethics and they are out \nthere in a competitive work force trying to get the Government grants \nin order to perform services that our Government should perform in the \nfirst place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 30 \nmore seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. This area of privatizing income tax collections is \nsomething that I think goes far beyond anything that I have seen in \nthis whole area of contracting. I urge the conferees to stay with the \ndecision of the Senate.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank the Senator from Arkansas. I agree with him \ncompletely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/09/senate-section/article/S12000-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12002-S12037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS, 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary only for costs directly relating to the operation \n     and maintenance of the Museum.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. If I may have the attention of the managers of the bill--\nif I may have the attention of the Senator from Washington and the \nSenator from West Virginia. I would be willing to enter into an \nagreement for 30 minutes, 15 minutes on each side, or whatever time \nagreement you would like.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is a wonderful offer on the part of the Senator from \nIllinois and is completely--I will put it in this fashion. I think that \nis a gracious offer on the part of the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. It moved from ``wonderful'' to ``gracious.''\n  Mr. GORTON. I think it is wonderful myself. I do have present on the \nfloor the Senator from North Carolina who would want more time to amend \nif the amendment survives a motion to table.\n  So if the Senator will agree, I will ask there be 30 minutes equally \ndivided on the Simon amendment prior to the disposition of the motion \nto table, and that no second-degree amendment be permitted prior to the \nexpiration of the 30 minutes and the disposition of the motion to \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of Senator \nMcCain, Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator Pell, and myself. It is an \namendment that has passed the Senate on a previous occasion and would \nhave passed the tail end of the last session, but it was stopped as \nsome 50 or 60 bills all of a sudden were frozen as they moved ahead.\n  This amendment says that we--it authorizes, does not appropriate any \nmoney. We do not appropriate a dollar in this, but authorizes that the \nSmithsonian can have a national African-American museum. There are two \ndistinct groups of Americans whose history is, frankly, very different \nfrom those of us who are German-American or British-American or Danish-\nAmerican or whatever our background is, and that is Native Americans, \nAmerican Indians, and African-Americans who came over here as slaves. I \nthink it is important for us to understand our heritage, for all of us, \nno matter what our background, and also particularly for those who are \nof African-American heritage to take special pride in this.\n  As I said, this does not appropriate one dollar at this point. That \nwould have to be done at some time in the future when Congress feels it \nis wise to do so. But it would permit the Smithsonian to collect money \nfrom a foundation or from some private entity for this purpose.\n  It also authorizes the Smithsonian to work with local museums around \nthe Nation. We have a museum in Chicago that is a very fine local \nAfrican-American museum. That is the kind of museum that they can work \nwith. It is not that complicated.\n  I know I have the opposition of my friend and colleague from North \nCarolina, Senator Helms. But I hope this body will accept this \namendment. I reserve the remainder of my time, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is with deep regret that I am going to \nhave to oppose the amendment proposed by the Senator from Illinois, \nalthough I suspect, if I looked up rollcalls, that I would have voted \nfor his proposal in previous Congresses.\n  But, Mr. President, there just is not any money for this project now, \nand it is almost certain that there will not be any in the foreseeable \nfuture.\n  I wish to emphasize the amendment is an authorization. We are dealing \nwith an appropriations bill.\n  The authorization bill is before the relevant committee. It has not \nbeen reported or recommended by that committee. The Smithsonian is now \nauthorized to build a museum of the American Indian. Very large amounts \nof private money have been collected for that museum, but it is simply \nnot possible to appropriate so much as a dollar for it in this bill.\n  The Smithsonian is authorized to expand the Air and Space Museum in a \nsignificant number of facilities out near Dulles Airport. Planning has \nactually gone on that one, and money has been spent on that one. There \nis no way that we can fund its creation.\n  By dint of very careful management and reductions in this bill, which \nhave been objected to since the moment the bill's debate was begun, we \ngot together a little bit more money so that the present Smithsonian \ncan literally fix the roof, so that deferred maintenance, which must be \naccomplished, can be accomplished.\n  The Smithsonian, together with the National Gallery of Art and a \ncouple of other Federal cultural institutions and the National Park \nService, are literally the only functions in this bill that do not have \nbudget cuts from last year. But we cannot build another museum. We \ncannot build two museums we have already authorized. And there is \nnothing in a budget resolution leading to a balanced budget in the year \n2002 that indicates we are going to be able to do so between this day \nand that.\n  So to pass this proposal is to make a promise we cannot keep, and, \nregrettably, I believe it to be irresponsible.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I fully support the position that has been \ntaken by the distinguished Senator from Washington. I do this \nreluctantly. I consider Paul Simon to be a happy warrior, my friend, \nand I am sorry to see him depart membership in this body after this \nterm.\n  This amendment, which contains 11 pages of authorizing language, in \nthe \n\n[[Page S12004]]\nfirst place does not belong on an appropriations bill. Secondly, as the \nmanager of the bill has pointed out, it authorizes yet another new \nmuseum for the Smithsonian. While the amendment limits the \nSmithsonian's exposure to that of operations and maintenance, these \nexpenses will still be a drain on the budget at a time when the overall \ndollars are declining.\n  The Smithsonian requested $19 million for the Indian Museum Cultural \nResources Center in fiscal year 1996. This has been reduced to $15 \nmillion. Still facing the committee are the Federal costs associated \nwith the construction of the mall facility for the Indian museum. Mr. \nPresident, these construction requirements are in direct competition \nwith operating dollars.\n  The subcommittee also faces the additional operating expenses \nassociated with the Indian museum, and I believe that it is \nirresponsible--and I say this with all due respect to the cosponsors of \nthe amendment--it is irresponsible to add yet another burden to the \nSmithsonian's portfolio at this time. The Smithsonian has a repair and \nrehabilitation backlog estimated at a cost of $250 million. We should \naddress these requirements before taking on the burden of a new \nfacility.\n  Congress has already also authorized the construction of an expansion \nfacility for the Air and Space Museum, and, again, we should address \nfacilities already authorized before proceeding with any additional new \nfacilities. This is an inappropriate time to adopt this amendment. This \nis a freestanding bill, and we ought to treat it as such.\n  So, Mr. President, I regretfully oppose the amendment. We see here \nwhat is going to be a growing problem. We are just beginning now. Wait \nuntil next year, as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee said \nthe other day during a markup of the committee. It is tough this year, \nbut just wait until next year, and it is going to be tougher.\n  We have these competing requests for funds, and we have discretionary \nfunds eating discretionary funds; domestic funds eating domestic \ndiscretionary funds--cannibalization of the domestic discretionary \nbudget with various and sundry domestic discretionary programs and \nagencies cannibalizing other discretionary domestic programs. And in \nthe final analysis, the military will cannibalize them all. Military is \nexpected to increase by $7 billion, while domestic discretionary is \ngoing to be cut.\n  I have to oppose the amendment. I hope that the managers' words will \nbe heeded and the Senate will reject the amendment, with all due \nrespect for my friend.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator from Washington yield me \n5 minutes?\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I, too, oppose this amendment. The Rules \nCommittee has been following the Smithsonian quite closely, and I call \nto the attention of the Senate the Commission on the Future of the \nSmithsonian. That Commission said in a report recently:\n\n       On the basis of the programmatic issues we have already \n     described, as well as the financial realities, continued \n     capital expansion in the early decades of the next century at \n     the rate experienced over the past few decades is out of the \n     question. The Smithsonian should essentially assume a \n     moratorium on new museums, other than what has already been \n     approved.\n\n  This is what they said in their report, Mr. President, if anyone \nwants to see it. The authorization of the African-American museum is \ncontrary to these recommendations. The projections for the cost of \noperating the Smithsonian range from $417 million for this year to $650 \nmillion in the year 2000. If you add to that approximately $190 million \nneeded for capital projects and capital needs for building maintenance \nfor museums already authorized, the result is that the budget needed \nfor the support of museums will almost double by the year 2000. Almost \ndouble without considering the cost of any new museums, including the \nAfrican-American museum. I am sad to say this is just not possible. The \nSmithsonian has not told us how they expect to pay the operating costs \nof any new museums.\n  I understand there will be contributions to the capital costs. But \nlet me remind the Senate of the Smithsonian Environmental Research \nCenter, known as SERC, located in Edgewater, MD.\n  In 1963, the Smithsonian was given a parcel of land on the Chesapeake \nBay for environmental research. By the mid-1970's, the Smithsonian was \nusing Federal funds. By the late 1970's, the Smithsonian began to \nrequest funds for renovation and construction and reconstruction at the \nChesapeake Bay center.\n  In justifying its request for Federal funds, the Smithsonian used the \nfact that ``although originally established with non-Federal funds, the \ncenter has come to be heavily dependent upon appropriated funds for \noperating program support.''\n  In this year, 1995, SERC again received Federal funds in the amount \nof $2.5 million. Federal funds now provide 90 percent of the operating \nfunds and all funding for repair, restoration, and maintenance of \nbuildings. This is typical of the situation we get into when we accept \ndonated funds for capital costs and do not realize how the incremental \noperating costs pile up year after year. It is just not possible for us \nto fund this.\n  I believe I am one of the Smithsonian's greatest supporters, and I \nhave told them before that I hope it will be around for my \ngrandchildren and their grandchildren. They take umbrage once in a \nwhile at some of my comments, but, in my opinion, the Smithsonian must \nmake serious changes in its budgeting and planning if it is to survive \ninto the next century based on what they already have and what is \nalready authorized.\n  We are not going to be able to have new initiatives that take \ntaxpayers' money and still have the Smithsonian survive as we know it \nin the decade after the turn of the century. I believe the Senate \nshould reject this amendment, as worthwhile as some may believe it is. \nWe have other African-American museums already authorized, and the \nSmithsonian has plans for a new Center for African-American History and \nCulture to organize exhibitions and sponsor research at existing \nfacilities.\n  Under the circumstances, I cannot support Senator Simon's amendment. \nI support the position taken by the managers of the bill and the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Will the Senator yield me 30 seconds?\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield whatever time I have left.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as I do every day the Senate is in session, \nI made a brief report to the Senate yesterday identifying the latest \navailable figure of the Federal debt--down to the penny. This is a sort \nof daily report on irresponsibility of the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  I reported today that as of the close of business Monday, August 7, \nthe Federal debt stood--down to the penny--at $4,946,673,660,276.63. On \na per capita basis, every man, woman, and child in America owes an \naverage share amounting to $8,777.66.\n  With a debt this large, should Congress create a new program the cost \nof which is unknown? I hope not. But that is precisely what Senator \nSimon is proposing with his amendment to authorize the National African \nAmerican Museum--saying, go ahead, give us unlimited amounts of \ntaxpayers' money without making us accountable for 1 penny.\n  The Simon amendment authorizes unlimited funds for an unlimited \nperiod of time for museum maintenance and operation. The Smithsonian \nhas refused to furnish any estimate as to how much the project will \nultimately cost the taxpayer--even after my asking them precisely that \nquestion on numerous occasions.\n  In addition, the Smithsonian refuses to provide a budget for the \nmuseum's first 5 years--the Congressional Budget Office estimates the \nmuseum will cost $5 million per year until 1997, then a $6 million \nauthorization for 1998.\n  Mr. President, it is puzzling that this amendment would be offered at \na time when the Smithsonian is lamenting its existing lack of funds \nbefore any consideration of yet another museum. As \n\n[[Page S12005]]\nreported in the Washington Post, ``The Dilapidated State of the \nNation's Attic,'' June 10, 1995, ``half a billion dollars' worth of \nrepairs will be needed over the next 10 years to keep the Smithsonian \nInstitution's aging facilities open.'' Smithsonian officials have told \nCongress that the Smithsonian buildings ``will all reach the end of \ntheir useful service lives within a 5-year time span.''\n  Certainly, this is not the time for the Smithsonian to be saddled \nwith another responsibility--especially a new museum.\n  Mr. President, most bills coming before the Senate provide lengthy \nestimates and explanations of what the particular project plans to do, \nwhat funds will be needed to fulfill those goals, where the funds will \noriginate, etc. But, with this project, we have been told by the \nSmithsonian--we want to create a museum, please authorize the project \nso we can come up with a plan. Well, this Senator is used to seeing the \nplan and the projected costs involved before he votes.\n  Let me reiterate, the Senate has no business authorizing any \nlegislation when we do not know the basic facts about its conception, \ncosts, and mission.\n  I hope the Simon amendment will be tabled.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 12\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SIMON. I will probably not use all that. Let me point out that \nthere is not 1 penny of appropriations in this. This is a request that \nhas been made by Smithsonian in past years. This complies with that \nrequest. The only expenditure possible without the approval of the \nAppropriations Committee would be if foundations provided assistance.\n  Again, the Appropriations Committee, or the Rules Committee, would \nhave oversight on this. I agree with Senator Byrd in terms of the \ncannibalization of domestic funds and that we ought to be pulling back \non the military, the $7 billion we are spending on the military. I \nvoted to take away that firewall, which I do not think makes any sense \nwhatsoever.\n  But I think the reality is that this is something that Smithsonian \nhas requested in the past. It makes sense. Again, I simply remind \neveryone that there are two American groups with very distinctive \nhistories, different from the histories of English-Americans or German-\nAmericans, or Norwegian-Americans, and every other group, and that is \nthe Native Americans, the American Indians, and African-Americans, \nthose who were brought over here as slaves. The need to recognize that \nthis distinctive history should be part of the Smithsonian, I think, is \na wise decision.\n  I hope the motion to table that I assume my friend from Washington is \ngoing to be making in a moment or two will be defeated.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to speak \nin support of the establishment of a National African-American Museum \nwithin the Smithsonian Institution.\n  The Smithsonian Institution is the national collection of American \nart and culture. Until now, this great collection did not include \nrepresentation of the African-American experience in the United States. \nToday, because of this amendment, we will add a museum dedicated to the \npresentation and preservation of African-American art, culture, and \nhistory to our national collection.\n  This museum is very important. Twelve percent of the population in \nthis country is African-American. There are 40 million African-American \nschoolchildren in the United States. This museum will be a tool for \nteaching those children about their history and their culture. It will \ngive all Americans an opportunity to know and appreciate the many \ncontributions and important history of the descendants of Africa in \nAmerica. Finally, the museum will recognize the rich legacy of the \nAfrican-American experience in the United States, and celebrate the \ndiversity of this Nation.\n  I want to commend my friend and colleague, Senator Paul Simon of \nIllinois, for his leadership in guiding this legislation through the \nSenate. I thank him for his dedication and commitment to the \nestablishment of a National African-American Museum within the \nSmithsonian Institution.\n  Mr. GORTON. Is there any more time available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes, sixteen seconds.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I will use very little of that time.\n  The report of the Commission on the Future of the Smithsonian \nInstitution, issued earlier this year, says:\n\n       To assure the future, declare a moratorium on new museum \n     construction unless the incremental funds needed for \n     construction and operations are assured.\n\n  Mr. President, they are not assured and they cannot be assured.\n  Second:\n\n       Devote attention and resources to the rehabilitation and \n     maintenance of existing facilities.\n\n  That is what we attempt to do in this bill, given the severe \nlimitations and great cuts to which it is subjected.\n  Mr. President, is the Senator finished?\n  Mr. SIMON. I will take 1 minute of my time. Again, I simply stress \nthat we are not asking for a penny here. We are simply authorizing it \nsubject to the action of the Appropriations Committee. I point out \nagain that this has passed the U.S. Senate before. It is not novel \naction here. I see my cosponsor walking onto the floor.\n  I do not know if he wishes to have a minute or two before I yield \nback, but if the Senator from Arizona wishes the floor, I am pleased to \nyield 1 minute to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support my colleague's amendment, as I \nhave in the past. I think it is an appropriate action. I remind my \ncolleagues that there are a lot of questions now today about our \nrelations with minorities in this country. I think recognition of the \ncontributions that African-Americans have made is appropriate for this \ncountry to do. I think that sooner or later, we will decide to do that. \nWe have decided to build an Indian museum. We have built other museums \nto memorialize the contributions and sacrifices of other Americans. I \nthink this is appropriate, too.\n  I appreciate the tenacity and dedication of my colleague from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the commission has spoken. We have no \nalternative but to listen. If we authorize this museum, it will be \nbuilt with non-Federal funds, but it will immediately become a burden \non the Smithsonian that the commission has urged us not to undertake.\n  Is all time yielded back yet?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. There is 1 minute 52 seconds for opponents \nand 8 minutes 52 seconds for the proponents.\n  Mr. GORTON. Is the Senator from Illinois ready to yield the remainder \nof his time?\n  Mr. SIMON. After taking 30 seconds, I will do that. I simply again \nsay that we do not appropriate a thing here. I think the remarks of the \nSenator from Arizona were right on target. I think this is the time to \npull people together. This is a way of doing it. I hope the motion to \ntable will be defeated.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GORTON. As I do, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to table the Simon amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 2306, offered by the Senator from Illinois, [Mr. \nSimon].\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] is \nabsent because of family illness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 47, as follows:\n  \n[[Page S12006]]\n\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 375 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     McConnell\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Campbell\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thompson\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Mack\n  So the motion to table the amendment (No. 2306) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion to table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Nevada is ready \nwith his amendment. But the Senator from Arizona has spoken very \neloquently on the earlier amendment with respect to the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs and wished to engage in a colloquy with me in lieu of \nanother amendment on the same subject. We hope we can do that in an \ninformal fashion and then go to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to thank my friend from Nevada. This will \nnot take very long.\n  The Senator from Washington was able to defend the committee position \non the reductions in funding for various Indian issues. I respect the \nverdict of the full Senate.\n  My colleague from the State of Washington has successfully defended \nthe committee position. I had contemplated proposing further \namendments, perhaps, in hopes of restoring at least some of the funds \nthat were taken out, restoring some of the funds that were reduced in \nthe bill in existing programs. I do not believe that probably will be, \none, viable, or, two, an appropriate use of the time of the Senate over \nthe last couple of days before we go out.\n  The Senator from Washington knows from the debate how strongly the \nSenator from New Mexico and the Senator from Hawaii and others feel on \nthis issue, who have been involved in it for many years.\n  I think it is important that my colleagues know that the Senator from \nWashington and I have engaged in conversations privately and that he \nhas assured me that he will make an effort to at least restore some of \nthose funds during the course of the conference. I think it would be \nhelpful that it be on the record that the Senator from Washington and I \nhave had this colloquy.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank my friend from Arizona. I point out to him what \nhe already knows--that there is perhaps a larger difference in this \naccount between the House and the Senate than there is in any other \naccount in this bill.\n  The Senator from Arizona also knows and has expressed his \nappreciation for the very difficult challenges which have faced both me \nand the Senator from West Virginia in meeting these stringent \nrequirements of the budget. But I have made private assurances, which I \nwish to make public, to the Senator from Arizona. The conference \ncommittee report is not going to come back with the figure which caused \nso much heartache to my friends from Arizona, New Mexico, and Hawaii. \nAnd I am certain that I will support significant restorations to the \naccounts which were of such concern to the three Senators who proposed \nthat amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to, first of all, thank the \nSenator from Washington for that commitment. I know that he and the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia are very aware of the \nimportance of these issues. I also appreciate the assurance of both the \nSenator from West Virginia and the Senator from Washington in allowing \nthe Senator from New Mexico, the Senator from Hawaii, and me to make \ninputs as to where the most important priorities are for restoration of \nfunding as we go into the conference, perhaps even to the point where \nthe Senators from New Mexico and Hawaii and I may send a letter to both \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from \nWashington outlining our priorities as to where we think the most poor \nareas are where funds need to be restored.\n  I want to again say to the Senator from Washington that I understand \nthat he has had to make very tough decisions. Obviously, I did not \nagree with those decisions. But that does not mean that I have a lack \nof respect for, first, his diligence, and, second, the difficulty of \nthe task that lays before him. I am especially appreciative of his \ncommitment to try to at least restore in conference, in the course of \nthe negotiations, as happens in every conference. This is not a very \nunusual situation. It has been unusual, obviously, to have this large a \ndifference between the two bodies. But I am deeply appreciative that he \nis willing to consider restoration of funding in certain areas as he \ngoes forward in the conference.\n  I have made my arguments in the course of the amendment of the \nSenator from New Mexico. It was defeated. I will not make those \narguments again.\n  I again want to thank the Senator from Washington and the Senator \nfrom West Virginia for their consideration and appreciation of the \nseriousness of these issues.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona in his set of \nremarks made a second point which is important to respond to. In \ndealing with this bill, the Senator from West Virginia and I had to \nkeep our focus constantly on the total amount of money we had available \nand carry it out as we did. The Senator from Arizona, together with the \nSenator from Hawaii, chairman and ranking member of the authorizing \ncommittee, the Committee on Indian Affairs, have far more expertise \nthan we do as to internally how to divide such moneys and efforts in \nthe programs. I can say for myself that I defer to leadership and the \nadvice and counsel of the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from \nHawaii on those internal divisions of money, and we look forward to his \nadvice. I think I can say that his advice will be followed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from Washington--and I note the \npresence of both my colleague from New Mexico and my dear friend from \nHawaii, who I know will have additional remarks. Again, I appreciate \nthe consideration that is shown by the Senator from Washington to all \nof us as we try to get through this very difficult situation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator McCain from Arizona for \nthe colloquy and for his observations, and I might say to my good \nfriend, Senator Gorton, I am on his subcommittee, so I will be there at \nthe conference with the House. So he will certainly be advised what I \nthink is right. I will not have to bring him a letter. I will be \npleased to carry their letter with my signature. But I will be there \nand suggesting what has been discussed here today.\n  I want to thank Senator Gorton for the understanding. Obviously, we \nwere very concerned about one particular aspect of Indian funding, and \nwe understand clearly that he had much more than that to look at. As I \nsaid before, Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd, with reference to the \nIndian health, which is one of those major programs that we have to run \nas a nation unless and until we change things, have been very generous. \nWe from Indian country appreciate that. But, obviously, with reference \nto this particular one that we \n \n[[Page S12007]]\n\nare concerned about, we hope we can work with Senator Gorton, since the \nHouse was higher on that, and perhaps some other of the Indian programs \nthat we might think are of higher priority. I thank him for that.\n  I understand his comments to Senator McCain would apply equally to \nwhat I have in mind and my concerns.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, they do.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to join the distinguished Senators \nfrom Arizona and New Mexico in expressing my words of gratitude to the \nSenator from Washington for his words of assurance.\n  I thank him very much.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Hawaii.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n Amendment No. 2308 to the Committee Amendment on Page 9, Line 23, and \n                              to the Bill\n\n(Purpose: To increase the amount of funds made available to activities \n relating to the administration of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, \n                            with an offset)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk in behalf of \nmyself, Senator Chafee, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Lieberman, and \nSenator Boxer, and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself, Mr. \n     Chafee, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Lieberman, and Mrs. Boxer, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2308 to the committee \n     amendment on page 9, line 23, and to the bill.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 9, lines 23 through 25, strike ``$496,978,000, to \n     remain available for obligation until September 30, 1997,'' \n     and insert ``$501,478,000, to remain available for obligation \n     until September 30, 1997, of which not less than $3,800,000 \n     shall be made available for prelisting activities, \n     $18,297,000 shall be made available for consultation \n     activities, and $36,500,000 shall be made available for \n     recovery activities, and''.\n       On page 27, line 10, strike ``$132,507,000'' and insert \n     ``$128,007,000''.\n       On page 27, line 11, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``: Provided, That none of the reduction below the \n     FY 1996 budget request shall be applied to the health and \n     safety budget activity''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as a young boy growing up, I had living \nacross the alley the Vincent family. The boys as I knew them were \nraised basically by their mother. They were a large family of eight or \nnine children, but the young men in the family were the toughest, \nstrongest, most athletic young men that you could imagine in a family. \nOne of them was a Golden Gloves champion. They were, I repeat, all very \ntough young men. We played ball together. We grew up together. We were \nvery close friends.\n  One of the Vincent boys, as we referred to them, was Don Vincent. He \nwas one of the older boys. As tough and as handsome and as energetic as \nall of them was Don Vincent. His first child was a little boy and, of \ncourse, in this Vincent society this young man was going to grow up and \nbe just like his dad.\n  Well, he was a Little League baseball player, and he hit a ball a \nlong way into the outfield as a Little Leaguer, and he was running, \ncoming around third base. He almost stopped. He made it home, but he \nwas tired. And his dad, of course, did not want to have the boy be a \nquitter; the Vincents were not quitters. He talked to his boy: You \ncannot quit; you have to go hard. He could not understand why a Vincent \nwould not do his best.\n  Mr. President, this little boy had leukemia. He died very quickly. \nYou see, 25 years ago, 30 years ago, as the Vincent family was growing \nup, the second generation that I knew, they had no cure for childhood \nleukemia. Everybody died. A child got leukemia; the child died. It is \nnot that way anymore. Had this little boy gotten leukemia today, there \nwould be over a 99 percent chance he would be healed.\n  So I talked to the Vincents, talked to Donnie, as we call him, about \nhis little boy and how things have changed. Why now can someone like \nthe little Vincent boy be saved? Because of a plant, a plant, Mr. \nPresident, called the Madagascar rosy periwinkle. This plant, of \ncourse, from the country of Madagascar, is near extinction. They are \nwiping out the rain forests in Madagascar and with it the periwinkle. \nNot only does it have a better than 99 percent rate of remission with \nchildhood leukemia, but it also has over an 80-percent cure rate for \nHodgkin's disease--not bad.\n  What we are here today to talk about is endangered species. It is the \nsense of the Senate and the House that there is a moratorium on listing \nfurther endangered species. I disagree with that. I think it is wrong. \nBut that is the will of the Senate.\n  Therefore, this amendment does not try to eliminate the moratorium on \nendangered species. What it does do is focus attention on the fact that \nendangered species are important, and this amendment further says that \nwe should spend more money on certain areas dealing with endangered \nspecies listing than we have in the committee mark that is now before \nthis body.\n  We need to spend more money in recovery. We need to spend more money \nin prelisting. And we need to spend more money, Mr. President, in \nconsultation. Even though we are spending money in these areas--that is \nprelisting, consultation, and recovery--we are still spending less \nmoney than we did even last year.\n  If, in fact, the periwinkle bush was the only plant that had great \nlifesaving value, it would still be worth doing more endangered \nspecies, but it is not the only plant that saves lives.\n  The Pacific yew tree is a relatively new plant family. It is a tree \nwe have found that has lifesaving qualities. It produces something \ncalled taxol. Taxol was first used relatively recently in 1983 to treat \novarian and breast cancer and some lung cancers and today, after 10 \nshort years, is the most effective treatment for achieving remission in \nadvanced ovarian cancer that has ever been known.\n  Originally, this substance--it is a chemical substance--was extracted \nfrom the bark of a yew tree--y-e-w. It took 3 to 12 trees, which take \n100 years to reach maturity, to provide enough taxol to treat one woman \nwith ovarian cancer.\n  Now, we are doing research to find out if there are other ways we can \ncome up with this lifesaving chemical that is in the bark of the yew \ntree. We are doing it from the needles of the yew tree. We are making \nsome progress there. We have even been able to synthesize this \nchemical, and so we are making progress.\n  But since clearcutting of forests in the Pacific Northwest has really \nsquandered the natural yew supply, it is important that we have \ndeveloped this alternative.\n  Mr. President, about 50 percent of the medicine and treatments used \ntoday can be traced directly to plants. If someone within the sound of \nmy voice goes today to a drugstore to get a prescription, there is a 50 \npercent chance that the medicine they are getting has some relation to \na plant.\n  Nearly all prescription antibiotics in addition to that were isolated \nfrom molds and microbes.\n  We have heard a lot about the Contract With America, and I think that \nis important. It has been an important discussion in this body and the \nother body. I think we should dwell on something called a contract with \nnature, a term that was developed by Thomas Eisner. He said he feels \nthat we as Americans and we as world citizens should be concerned about \nwhat nature has to provide for us. The irony of the Endangered Species \nAct is that most species cannot be listed on it because they do not \neven have a name.\n  Let me give you an example. Dr. Eisner and his colleagues were aware \nof a scrub plant. It was always in their way. It was a weed. That is \nwhat it was. It was a weed, in his technical jargon. He said it had a \nweed-like appearance. They decided to test it and see what substances \nthis plant had. They learned very quickly that it worked extremely well \nas an insect repellent, and they also have learned that it works great \nas an antifungal product. Is that very important? Yes, it is very \nimportant. Dermatologists are always looking for antifungal medicines. \nAthlete's foot is one of the better known kinds of \n\n[[Page S12008]]\n\nfungus. It gets a lot worse in people's feet. But they have medicines \nfor it, one of which was recently discovered in a weed patch.\n  This weed that is now called the Lake Placid mint and is found only \nwithin 300 acres of a protected biological station in central Florida, \nwere it not for its privileged position, being in a weed patch next to \na place where Dr. Eisner worked, it would be gone and we would never \nknow the properties that it has.\n  I spoke to this body a minute or two ago, Mr. President, about the \nyew tree. Let's bring it down into real personal terms. A woman by the \nname of Elaine Forma, chairwoman of the World Hunger Committee, in 1991 \nwas diagnosed as having terminal ovarian cancer. They told her she had \n6 months to live. She tried all conventional therapy, including \nchemotherapy.\n  They decided, because taxol was just getting started in 1991, that \nthey would try that on her. She has now been symptom free since taking \nthis medicine. Were it not for taxol, she would not be alive. There are \nnumerous instances just like this.\n  In Nevada there has been an ongoing debate for as long as I can \nremember about the desert pup fish. There is a place in Nye County \nwhere there is a little pond where the desert pup fish lives, little \ntiny, tiny fish. And if I have heard one, I have heard 50, 60, 100 \npeople say, ``What good are they? Why spend all the money on the desert \npup fish? Protecting this?'' They did not allow the water to be pumped \ndown.\n  People farmed in that area. At one time they grew cotton. They said, \n``You are not going to be able to do that anymore because you will kill \nthe desert pup fish.'' Well, we learned that the desert pup fish, one \nof the tiniest invertebrates on the Earth, is helping researchers to \nlearn more about kidney disease by studying how these little animals \nhandle the heavy quantities of salt that their little bodies must \nhandle. Tremendous advances are being made in kidney disease research. \nAnd if you have had a friend or a relative who has kidney disease, you \nknow this is important.\n  What about bears? I have always been just amazed at how bears and \nother animals, but especially bears, can just go to sleep, stay asleep \nfor months, not days, but months. We have found, Mr. President, that \nstudying bears, what happens to them when they are asleep, or in \nhibernation, gives us great ability to understand other things, for \nexample, kidney failure. How do these animals stay asleep for as long \nas they do? They never get up to go to the bathroom. How do they handle \ntheir bodily functions?\n  We have learned that hibernating black bears are immobile for up to 5 \nmonths. That is, they are down, taking a nap, sound asleep for 5 \nmonths, during which time they neither lose bone nor do they urinate. \nBears continue to lay down new bone, making use of calcium circulating \nin their blood, and somehow recycle their urinary waste to make new \nproteins--a totally new discovery. Researching the mechanisms of how \nbears survive hibernation may result in treatment for osteoporosis in \nthe elderly and, again, for kidney failure.\n  Now, we know that some of these bears are in danger. The Houston \ntoad, which is on the brink of extension due to absent habitat laws, \nmay produce alkaloids that reduce heart attacks. They found that a \nsubstance these little toads produce has more analgesic properties than \nmorphine.\n  I am not going to go into a lot more detail on endangered species and \nbeing species specific, but, Mr. President, there are species all over \nthe United States that we need to save that allow us to get well, to \ntreat diseases that have never been treated before. We need it, Mr. \nPresident, and that is the reason the endangered species law is \nimportant, is that it has allowed us to prospect for chemicals, to \nsearch for new medicines, for new agrichemicals and other useful \nsubstances from nature. We must do this.\n  As I have indicated, the sources of 50 percent of today's medicines, \nas well as foundation for medical research and future cures, comes from \na full range of species from bears and plants in our forests, sharks, \ncorrals, and even sponges in our seas. Well, this chemical treasury of \nnature is disappearing before we even have the opportunity to assess \nit--cancer, AIDS, heart and circulatory problems, infectious disease, \nParkinson's disease, tranquilizers, anti-inflammatory disease.\n  A member of my family, Mr. President, had we only known, would have \nbeen a well person today instead of somebody not in good health had the \nfact of having a fungus on wheat been available to treat their \ncondition, an anti-inflammatory disease. It works. It cures people.\n\n       This chemical treasury of nature is literally disappearing \n     before we have a chance to assess it. We cannot afford in \n     years ahead to be deprived of the inventions of nature, \n     chemicals such as taxol. And others could not have been \n     designed by human ingenuity. Both compounds--were totally \n     unforeseen in chemical structures and therapeutic action.\n\n  This is a statement by Dr. Thomas Eisner, the man about whom I spoke \na minute ago.\n  Mr. Stephen Brewer, manager of Bioproducts Chemistry, reported that \nhis analysis of the 20 best-selling drugs in the United States show \nthat most benefited from natural products research. This accounted for \nat least $6 billion in sales in 1988.\n  What we are trying to do here, Mr. President, is to provide a few \nextra dollars not for doing away with the lifting moratorium which is \nin effect, but for providing some money while we either reauthorize or \nwait for this next fiscal year to pass by, that the proper authorities \ncan still do work on endangered species. They will not be listing any, \nbut there will be some prelistings and they will do some consultations \nand do things to make sure we do not lose species.\n  Extinction, you know, Mr. President, is final. It is terminal. Once \nsomething becomes extinct, it is gone forever. That permanence should \nweigh heavily when we consider our priorities. Our priorities are \nreflected in this budget. And we must have a priority that says we need \nto be concerned about endangered species.\n  I see the diversity of life on this Earth is beneficial to all of us. \nThe benefits of species diversity are immeasurable. Even setting aside \nall the medical utilitary purposes of biodiversity, it is in all of our \ninterests to assure the continuation of all species. This funding is an \nexpression of that value.\n  Mr. President, the money that is being taken here, we are in a \nprocess here in the U.S. Congress where we are cannibalizing programs \nto save other programs, to help other programs. And that is in effect \nwhat we have done here. We are taking money from a program that could \nbe important to the State of Nevada. It is important to this country. \nBut, Mr. President, we have to list priorities. And what we have done \nhere is taken money from the Bureau of Mines.\n  We are taking money, Mr. President, from the Bureau of Mines, $4.5 \nmillion, and we are going to spend that in the prelisting, \nconsultation, and recovery. And as a result of doing that, we certainly \nare not going to be replacing much money. We will still be under last \nyear's levels in those areas, in addition to the fact that under \nlisting we will have lost, Mr. President, about $6 million in that \nprogram. And we will make up part of what we lost in the prelisting, \nthe consultation and recovery but certainly far below last year's \nlevels anyway.\n  I would ask the Members of the Senate to understand that this is not \na violation of what action has been taken previously in this body; that \nis, to place a moratorium on listings. It is, though, a step in the \nright direction. And I repeat, even though I disagree with the \nmoratorium that is now in effect, I think this is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  Of the 220,000 worldwide types of plants, only 5,000 have been \nexamined for medical compounds. So I understand that some may not \nappreciate our studying the black bear, may not understand why we are \nstudying some exotic plants, but we need to do that because our health \ndepends on it.\n  I very much appreciate the leadership shown in this matter by the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, the junior \nSenator from Rhode Island. He has been a great chairman of the \nsubcommittee. I have appreciated serving with him during my entire stay \nin the Senate and certainly appreciate his advice and counsel on this \namendment.\n\n[[Page S12009]]\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, first, I want to thank the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada, Senator Reid, for the excellent work he has done \non this amendment. He has really been a powerhouse in protecting the \nEndangered Species Act and working on it to make it more effective. I \nwant to express to him the appreciation, not only of myself but I think \nof all Americans who believe in preserving the diversity that now \nexists in our nature.\n  But for the Endangered Species Act, we would not be where we are. \nYes, it is all right to talk about the visible things that have been \nsaved, like the grizzly, the American eagle, or the California condor, \nbut it is the thousands of other less prestigious, if you will, plants \nand animals that also have been protected during these 20 years, 25 \nyears since the Endangered Species Act was first enacted, and it is due \nto Senators that have gone before us, such as Ed Muskie and others. But \nin that role of champions, there is none better than Harry Reid in \nworking for an effective Endangered Species Act.\n  Mr. President, the Endangered Species Act is funded at a very modest \nlevel. In the current year, $69 million. We had one witness come before \nus and say, ``Just remember, what you are spending on endangered \nspecies is about what it costs to build 2 miles of urban interstate \nhighway''--2 miles of urban interstate highway. Overall in the \ninterstate system, we have 45,000 miles, and 2 miles of that would \nprovide for the funding of the Endangered Species Act for an entire \nyear.\n  The bill, as originally proposed, provided for a 20-percent cut in \nthe funding for the Endangered Species Act; namely, going from $69 to \n$55 million. I want to express my appreciation to the senior Senator \nfrom Washington, the floor manager of the bill, Senator Gorton, for his \nworking with us, and Senator Byrd, likewise, the distinguished former \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, for working with us in the \nrestoration of $4.5 million of that $14 million cut.\n  I might say that what the Reid amendment would do with that $4.5 \nmillion, it will go for prelisting, for consultation, and for recovery \nactivities by the Fish and Wildlife Service. All of those services are \nrequired by the law. The law says you have to have recovery, you have \nto have prelisting, you have to have consultation. Thus, a reduction in \nthe funding will only make it more difficult for the Fish and Wildlife \nService to do its job and will compound the problems that exist out \nthere with local governments and with landowners.\n  This amendment, I might say, Mr. President, does not affect listing. \nUnder this bill we have before us, listing will be forbidden. There is \na moratorium on any new listings or any new critical habitat \ndesignation until September 30, 1996, over a year from now, or until \nthe Endangered Species Act is reauthorized. I am not enthusiastic about \nthat, but as Senator Reid said, that is the way things go, and that is \nthe will of the majority here. So there it is.\n  It is my hope that in the Environment and Public Works Committee, we \ncan come forward with a reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act, \nunder the able leadership of the subcommittee dealing with this matter, \nthe leader of that committee being Senator Kempthorne, doing a splendid \njob, five hearings have been held on the reauthorization of the \nEndangered Species Act, extremely constructive hearings with many good \nproposals for reform of the act.\n  We have another hearing coming up in Wyoming a week from today, that \nis, if we are not here, and I greatly hope that we will not be. As \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I want to make \nit clear that I am in favor of passing legislation to reauthorize, to \nimprove the Endangered Species Act and hope to have that done this \ncalendar year.\n  Several of the witnesses who testified in favor of changes to the \nESA, the Endangered Species Act, made a point of stating support for \nadequate funding. What did they say? Are they tree huggers who only \nbelieve in the Endangered Species Act? This is what Paul Harja, \ntestifying in behalf of the Western Governors Association, said on July \n13. He stated:\n\n       A lot of the Governors are very concerned that funds to \n     actually implement the act--I'm not talking about acquisition \n     funds--worry that funds will be cut, resulting in an even \n     worse problem than we have now.\n\n  On behalf of the Western Governors, Mr. Harja stated in testimony:\n\n       Reform of the act could prove meaningless if technical and \n     financial assistance cannot be provided for the renewed \n     public-private partnership that is essential to achieving the \n     goals of the Endangered Species Act.\n\n  The building industry of southern California wrote about ``the \ncritical need for Federal funding.'' This letter closed by saying:\n\n       Congressional action to reliably fund multispecies planning \n     programs such as California's Natural Communities \n     Conservation Plan, is essential to a workable Endangered \n     Species Act.\n\n  The theme through all this is, ``We've got the act, it has to be \nfunded properly.''\n  The Western Urban Water Coalition, an association that represents \nwater utilities for the largest cities in the Western United States, \nhas written a letter dated July 24, just last month, urging that \nfunding of the Endangered Species Act not be reduced. Their letter \nstates:\n\n       Federal agencies must be given the current resources needed \n     to do their jobs. If they cannot perform, the lack of staff \n     and funding for technical work and cooperation with our \n     utilities will cause ESA implementation problems to grow, and \n     our water consumers, rather than the Federal bureaucracy, \n     will be penalized.\n\n  The Western Lands Commission has passed a resolution urging Congress \nto provide adequate funding of the ESA. This is what that resolution \nsaid in part:\n\n       The members urge Congress to fund implementation of ESA at \n     a level that will permit, among other things, the required \n     consultation under sections 7 and 10, to be conducted in a \n     timely and expeditious manner . . .\n\n  Restoring funds to the Fish and Wildlife Service will help the ESA \nwork better on private lands. By providing funds for prelisting \nactivities, Fish and Wildlife Service can avoid additional listings.\n  Mr. President, why should those who oppose the existing Endangered \nSpecies Act support this amendment? The answer is clear. It is because \nproblems under ESA will get worse, not better, if we fail to provide \nadequate funds.\n  On the prelisting, some of the money goes for that. Funds for \nprelisting activities are used by the Fish and Wildlife Service for \ncooperative efforts with States and private landowners and Federal \nagencies to conserve a candidate species before it becomes threatened \nor endangered.\n  The Reid amendment provides $3.8 million for prelisting. What about \nconsultation? That is part of section 7 of the Endangered Species Act,\n  Funds for consultation activities are used by the Fish and Wildlife \nService to meet obligations under section 7 of the ESA. Section 7 \nrequires agencies to consult with Fish and Wildlife to ensure that \nFederal actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of listed \nspecies.\n  The Service also uses funds under the consultation account to pay for \nwork of landowners on habitat conservation plans. In a recent hearing, \na representative from Riverside County, CA, urged that financial \nassistance be provided to local communities to aid in the development \nof the habitat conservation plans.\n  What about recovery, the last section? Funds for the recovery program \nare used to develop and implement recovery plans so that species no \nlonger need to be listed. The whole thrust of this is to keep the \nspecies from becoming endangered. Do not get it on the list, if \npossible.\n  The recovery of wildlife and plants that are on the threatened and \nendangered species lists is the ultimate goal of the ESA. Once they are \non the endangered and threatened list, we want to get them off. That is \nwhy the recovery is so important throughout the whole Endangered \nSpecies Act.\n  The Senate bill would reduce funds for recovery efforts by $10 \nbillion. The Reid amendment restores $1.7 million of that funding.\n  Again, Mr. President, neither the current Endangered Species Act, nor \nany of the proposed reform bills--I know the Senator from Washington \nhas one and, clearly, out of the Environment Committee we will have a \nreform bill--will be successful without adequate funding. Eliminating \nthe funds \n\n[[Page S12010]]\nnecessary for the Fish and Wildlife Service to do its job is \ncounterproductive. The funding levels provided under the Senate bills \nwill exacerbate current problems with the ESA. That is why it is so \nimportant this $4.8 million be added.\n  I want to thank the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia \nfor his cooperation in this. The money does come from an area where he \nis deeply concerned. It is a cut to a modest degree--4 percent in the \nBureau of Mines. Without the support of the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, who I can say is a real friend of mine since I have been \nhere--for 19 years, it has been my privilege to have worked all that \ntime with the Senator from West Virginia, and I am very proud that we \nhave developed a friendship over that time, which I greatly value.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I was \nunder the impression it was $4.5 million. The Senator said $4.8 \nmillion.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am sorry. I nearly got away with $300,000 more, Mr. \nPresident. It is $4.5 million, and that is what my notes say.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. I shall remain his friend.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We would not like a friendship broken up over a mere \n$300,000.\n  I thank, again, my cosponsor, whom I have worked with, Senator Reid, \nand the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, who \nhas been very helpful and persistent in this. I must say we need lots \nof friends in the Endangered Species Act, and we have two good ones in \nthose two distinguished Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise because I am actively \nsupporting the amendment of the Senator from Nevada. I would like to \ntake a few minutes to outline my reasons for doing so and to thank, in \nparticular, Senator Reid from Nevada, for his leadership on this \namendment. I want to note that his battle has been a relatively long \none, and fairly detailed, to protect the species that mean so much to \nall of us. It is not simply one bird, one fish, one insect of sorts, \none shrub, or one plant; this problem of endangered species, long \nignored, will endanger the well-being of the human race.\n  So I commend him and, of course, the distinguished chairman of the \nenvironmental committee, Senator Chafee. I also thank our perennial \nleader, with or without titles, for his distinguished service in the \nU.S. Senate for so many years, someone who always reminds us about our \nresponsibilities, sometimes not often enough, to get the people's work \ndone. And, of course, that is Senator Byrd from West Virginia, whom I \nhave had the pleasure and opportunity to work with on so many things \nduring his chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee, during his \nranking standing on the Appropriations Committee, always with a guiding \nhand, and someone whose counsel and advice I treasure. I thank them all \nbecause this means a great deal to me.\n  I am delighted that there is a compromise of sorts that does lend \nmore funding to the Endangered Species Act. I cosponsored this \namendment. The bill, as it is written, includes drastic cuts in the \nendangered species program. And if those cuts are left to stand as they \nare, it would provoke rather than solve problems in the administration \nof the program. The cuts that are still there, despite the fact that we \nhave been able to add $4.5 million to the program, will reduce the \nflexibility of the Department of the Interior to work cooperatively \nwith landowners in complying with the Endangered Species Act and slow \nrather than speed the recovery of the species.\n  It is obvious that I support the Endangered Species Act, and I do so \nbecause it has worked successfully in many instances. Enacted over two \ndecades ago, the Endangered Species Act was a bold attempt to halt the \ndangerous disappearance of an increasing number of species. The act \ndoes more than preserve species; it protects the human race, and it \nprotects people by conserving the biological resources upon which we so \nmuch depend.\n  The act, as it stands, is not perfect, and the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, of which I am a member, is actively working to \nreauthorize the Endangered Species Act. Thusly, I think some of the \nactions being taken which preempt that legislation are precipitous in \nnature. And while we hope to address many of the faults that exist, we \nare still working to preserve the positive aspects of the act during \nthe reauthorization process.\n  Mr. President, this bill would reduce funding for those activities \nthat are considered to be the most positive aspects of the act. Over \nthe last 2 months, the Environment and Public Works Committee has held \nfive hearings on reauthorization. In those hearings, we have heard many \ndifferent points of view--from those who want the program to be totally \nvoluntary, to those who feel the program does not go far enough. \nHowever, most people support the conservation of threatened or \nendangered species, and most testify that the key to protecting \nthreatened or endangered species is to provide incentives for private \nproperty owners to help them do the right thing.\n  Mr. President, last week, the Keystone Center, a conference group, \nissued its final report on ``Incentives for Private Landowners to \nProtect Endangered Species,'' so titled. This report documents the \nconsensus proposal of a diverse group of people involved in the review \nof the act.\n  They agreed that ``it would be highly desirable to further the goal \nof conserving endangered species through greater voluntary \nparticipation and the involvement of the private sector and by \nproviding positive incentives that reward landowners for taking action \nto protect or conserve endangered or threatened species and their \nhabitat.''\n  Now, we ought to take these recommendations to heart and ensure that \nprivate landowners and local governments do not alone bear the brunt of \nthe cost of recovery.\n  Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not state my firm \nopposition to bill language that implements a moratorium on listing and \ndesignation of critical habitat.\n  This moratorium, in my view, is damaging and harmful. Our endangered \nspecies will continue to be threatened and maybe even totally \nterminated. The costs of recovery will continue to mount. And the Fish \nand Wildlife Service will find itself paralyzed to effect any \nimprovements in the administration of this act.\n  Last April, the Senate imposed a similar moratorium on listings while \nwe considered the defense supplemental bill. While I opposed this \nprovision, I understood that it would be in effect until the end of \nthis fiscal year, September 30, 1995. Now, Mr. President, we see the \nmoratorium extended for yet another year or until reauthorization. Now, \nI am pleased that the committee agreed to limit it for 1 additional \nyear, but I must say that I strongly disagree with the moratorium \nnotion altogether.\n  However, this amendment does not touch the moratorium on listing and \ndesignation of critical habitat. Let me make it clear: It does not \nremove the moratorium.\n  The amendment simply increases the funding for prelisting \nactivities--a little preventive medicine; consultation, which allows \ncooperation with landowners; and recovery programs to remove species \nfrom the list. Nothing more and nothing less.\n  Over the past few days, I received letters from organizations that \nare concerned with the slash in funding of the Endangered Species Act \nprograms. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord letters from the Western Urban Water Coalition, the Pacific \nCoast Federation of Fishermen's Associations, a joint letter from six \nreligious organizations, a resolution from the Western States Land \nCommissioners Association all in support of increases in ESA funding. \nIt is quite a diverse group.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Western Urban Water Coalition,\n\n                                          Orem, UT, July 24, 1995.\n     Re Fiscal year 1996 Interior Appropriations for \n         Administration of the Endangered Species Act.\n     Sen. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: On behalf of the Western Urban Water \n     Coalition, I am writing to urge that funding for \n     administration of the Endangered Species Act (``ESA'') \n     program by the Department of the Interior, and other \n     agencies, not be unnecessarily reduced \n\n[[Page S12011]]\n     or restricted by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Western Urban \n     Water Coalition is a national association of water utilities \n     for the largest cities in the Western United States. \n     Together, these utilities supply water to over 30 million \n     people in the West.\n       The Coalition agrees that the ESA should be amended to work \n     in a more balanced and efficient manner, and has been \n     actively involved in ESA reauthorization. A copy of our \n     position paper on the ESA is enclosed. Until such amendments \n     are in the law, however, FWS, NMFS, and other agencies must \n     be given the current resources needed to do their jobs. If \n     they cannot perform, the lack of staff and funding for \n     technical work and cooperation with our utilities will cause \n     ESA implementation problems to grow, and our water consumers, \n     rather than the federal bureaucracy, will be penalized.\n       The Coalition members are involved in a wide variety of \n     projects to provide water for Western cities. Many require \n     ESA compliance. To fulfill their mission of providing a \n     reliable water supply to their customers, the federal \n     agencies charged with ESA responsibility on these projects \n     must have adequate resources to carry out their required role \n     in a timely and consistent manner. In the Coalition's view, \n     the level of funding approved by the House for the FWS, the \n     NMFS, and other agencies, for ESA implementation is \n     inadequate. It runs unnecessarily high risks to our members \n     ability to provide reliable future water supplies. We \n     strongly urge the Senate to restore ESA implementation funds \n     to a more reasonable level.\n       A few examples illustrate the nature of this problem. \n     Several Coalition members are engaged in preparing Habitat \n     Conservation Plans (``HCPs'') to enable them to go forward \n     with important water supply activities. These plans require \n     extensive consultation with federal officials at FWS and/or \n     NMFS. Only recently have sufficient staff become available to \n     make these procedures workable and timely. If funding for ESA \n     programs is cut, we fear that the HCP process will suffer, \n     with negative impact on our long-term planning and on the \n     ongoing projects that are necessary to supply water to our \n     customers.\n       Consultation under section 7 also requires adequate support \n     from federal officials. Although Coalition members have some \n     concerns with the way the section 7 process is sometimes \n     applied, the solution is not to rescind or dramatically \n     reduce funding in advance of substantive amendments to the \n     Act. Such an approach will only slow down the section 7 \n     process to our detriment.\n       Similarly, recovery plans are essential to solving ESA \n     problems in a way that does not adversely affect the public \n     interest. As discussed in our position paper, the recovery \n     planning process must be improved. Nonetheless, without \n     adequate funds, recovery plans are likely to receive low \n     priority and the necessary actions to carry these plans \n     forward will be difficult or impossible to achieve.\n       Thank you for considering these concerns. We would be happy \n     to meet with you or provide additional information on our \n     concerns at the ESA appropriations level. Please call either \n     me or Don Baur if we can be of further assistance.\n           Very truly yours.\n\n                                                Guy R. Martin,\n\n                                                 National Counsel,\n     Western Urban Water Coalition.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          Pacific Coast Federation\n\n\n                                  of Fishermen's Associations,\n\n                                    Sausalito, CA, August 4, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: PCFFA is the largest organization of \n     commercial fishermen on the west coast, representing the men \n     and women of the Pacific fishing fleet who generate tens of \n     thousands of fishing jobs for coastal and inland communities. \n     Many of these fishermen are salmon fishermen.\n       Salmon are in collapse throughout the Northwest and \n     Northern California to the point of requiring listing under \n     the ESA in order to prevent many key runs from extinction. \n     The salmon fishery is in a state of fishing emergency as \n     declared by the Department of Commerce, and unless pre-\n     listing recovery efforts are well funded coho salmon may be \n     listed coastwide within the year. ESA recovery funds and pre-\n     listing biological reviews are thus vitally important to \n     restoring tens of thousands of salmon-dependent jobs on the \n     west coast. In fact, the only open salmon fishery in the \n     lower 48 is now open as a direct result of ESA-driven water \n     reforms and habitat restoration in the California Central \n     Valley.\n       We urge you to support the Reid Amendment to restore ESA \n     recovery funds. Without these funds the salmon fishing \n     industry cannot act to save the basic biological foundation \n     upon which its job base depends. The salmon fishing industry \n     in California, Oregon and Washington has already lost an \n     estimated 72,000 family wage jobs in the last 20 years, \n     almost 50,000 of them just since 1988. These jobs can be \n     restored with appropriate ESA-driven recovery efforts--but \n     not without appropriate funding.\n       Defunding ESA recovery efforts defunds all the solutions \n     and leaves only the problems. Defunding recovery only makes \n     those problems--as our job losses--worse. We urge you to \n     support the Reid Amendment in order to restore those funds.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Glen H. Spain,\n         Northwest Regional Director, Pacific Coast Federation of \n     Fishermen's Associations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                       Church of the Brethren,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 8, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: Along with many others, we, the following \n     faith communities, have a long history of support for the \n     protection of species. We see this as a stewardship \n     responsibility for all creation.\n       We also believe that safeguarding the wide variety of the \n     world's species is good for people. As we protect wild \n     species' ecosystems, we are preserving our own air and water. \n     In addition, people rely on a wide variety of species for \n     medicinal and agricultural breakthroughs. Finally, as many \n     communities have experienced, the presence of species results \n     in economic boons, due to sustained natural resources such as \n     fish populations, tourism and recreation dollars, and because \n     businesses prefer locations where the quality of life is \n     high.\n       Since we strongly support the protection of species, we are \n     very concerned about portions of the Interior appropriations \n     bill (H.R. 1977) that significantly cut or place moratoriums \n     on the operation of the Endangered Species Act. Such \n     provisions will lead to further decline within species that \n     are waiting to be listed or that need proactive protection \n     from recovery plans, land acquisition, prelisting preventive \n     activities, and so on. In addition, if the safeguarding of \n     species is delayed, later actions to protect these species \n     may be more expensive and burdensome.\n       We urge you to support amendments that will restore \n     Endangered Species Act funding and life the ESA moratoriums. \n     In addition, we urge you to oppose possible amendments that \n     will seek to slash funding further.\n       We look forward to continued dialogue with you as you deal \n     the Endangered Species Act issues. Thank you for considering \n     our concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n     Timothy A. McElwee,\n       The Church of the Brethren, Washington Office.\n     Father Robert J. Brooks,\n       The Episcopal Church,\n     Daryl Byler,\n       Mennonite Central Committee, Washington Office.\n     Paula Johnson,\n       Lutheran Office of Governmental Affairs.\n       Presbyterian Church (USA) Washington Office.\n     Rabbi David Saperstein,\n       Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, Union of \n     American Hebrew Congregations.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the offset that permits us to add $4.5 \nmillion comes from a decrease in funding for the Bureau of Mines\n  Now, I want to say this: The Bureau is one of the few agencies in the \nbill that received the President's full request.\n  The House bill, on the other hand, eliminates the Bureau. I want to \nsay this, particularly in the presence of my distinguished colleague \nand friend from West Virginia: This amendment does not eliminate the \nBureau. I would not support that. I believe that the Bureau conducts \nimportant research on mine and worker safety. There has been no \nstronger advocate on concerns for miner health and well-being than the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, we have struck a balance with some small adjustments \nhere and there. It is a positive mood on behalf of our ecology, and \nfrankly on the human race.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of this amendment. As I look at past \nhistory and think of what it costs us overall when mistakes are made in \nprotecting the environment, mistakes like the Exxon Valdez spill, that \ncost over $1 billion, and numerous other oil spills that have almost \ndecimated the ecology in a particular area, when we look here and we \nsee that we are funding protection of endangered species with a $59 \nmillion appropriation, and that only because we are able to add $4.5 \nmillion--compared, by the way, to $69 million last year; a very \nsignificant decrease, about 15 percent if my arithmetic serves me--a \nbudget request for the Endangered Species Act was $77.5 million. We are \noff almost 20 percent from there. These are huge cuts.\n  Mr. President, when I think of something like the Endangered Species \nAct, I cannot help but think of my grandchildren's faces and how \ndelighted my children were when we would go on a trip into the \nmountains. We did a lot of travel and we would see a deer, or even \nsmall animals like a raccoon, or to see the larger animals like the \ntrip we were able to take in which we saw lions, baboons, and \nelephants. It almost would bring tears to their eyes when we discussed \nwhat might happen \n\n[[Page S12012]]\nto these species if they were left unprotected.\n  We see it happening all over the world. In America, where we value \nour ecology, where we value the inhabitants of our Earth, we ought not \nto be talking about how we stop the process, but rather how we \nencourage the process of protection.\n  When we look at the return of the bald eagle, it excites all of us. I \nhave been to Alaska--one of the most beautiful places certainly in our \ncountry--to see the bald eagle recover from the days of earlier times \nwhen the species kept reducing. There are bald eagle pairs now seen in \nNew Jersey, the most crowded State in the country. It is a thrill to \nsee them.\n  In New Jersey now, sometimes some of it gets some of the neighborhood \npeople disturbed, but we have sightings that confirm that there are at \nleast 200 black bear and possibly up to as many as 600 in the State of \nNew Jersey. This is a group of animals that was almost totally gone.\n  It is not good if they chew in your garbage and things of that \nnature, but when you ask the little kids whether they like the pictures \nof the black bear and so forth, they thrill to the opportunity.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield for 30 seconds?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is always a pleasure to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to thank my friend from New Jersey and my friend \nfrom Nevada for their leadership on this. It is my privilege to serve \nwith both Senators on the Environment Committee. I feel so good about \nthis amendment. I understand it will be accepted, which is wonderful.\n  We may have some differences among us on administering this program, \nbut what we are doing here today is strengthening it, and I do agree \nthat there is such support as the Senator has noted in the State of New \nJersey for the underlying purpose of the Endangered Species Act.\n  I just want to thank the Senator. I guess in the end I did not have a \nquestion but a compliment for my friend from New Jersey and my friend \nfrom Nevada for their leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you. No campaign is successful without a good \narmy. The Senator from California is not only one of the best scouts \nbut one of the strongest fighters, as well, in military terminology.\n  Mr. President, I close my remarks with just one little tale about \nwhat happens in the migratory seasons with birds as they pass through \nNew Jersey, and the people that flock out there, along with the birds, \nat 4 and 5 o'clock in the morning to be ready to see the species \ntraveling north to south and vice versa, depending on the season.\n  What a thrill. They hear a bunch of adults yelling, ``Here it is,'' \nand they identify this remote species of a bird we have not seen in 20 \nyears, and everybody is thrilled about it, and it reaches all the local \nnewspapers. Maybe it is because we are such a crowded State that we in \nmany ways are more protective of the species than, sometimes, perhaps, \npeople who have such an abundance of them within their State.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we will adopt this amendment without any \nfuss or bother. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by Senators Reid, Chafee, Lautenberg, myself, and others to \npartially restore Endangered Species Act funding.\n  It is understandable in this era of budget balancing that endangered \nspecies programs take their fair share of cuts. However, the committee \nreport provides far deeper than average cuts to endangered species \nprograms. Whereas most programs have endured 15- to 20-percent cuts, \nendangered species program cuts are far greater--as much as 50 percent \nin some cases or zeroed out completely. I don't think this is necessary \nor advisable at the present time.\n  A number of endangered species recovery programs are in progress and \nat a critical stage. They depend on actions by Federal, State, local, \nand private interests that will create and implement the most cost-\neffective and flexible solutions to species recovery. Our amendment \nprovides a partial restoration of cuts to U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nprograms that help State agencies through grants and assistance; \ntechnical assistance to private landowners; prelisting agreements that \nnip species declines in the bud and avoid the need for regulatory \naction; consultations between agencies; and habitat conservation plans \nthat are now the preferred State-local-private approach for species \nrecovery in complex cases.\n  Funds in these areas are designed to reduce headaches for landowners \nand affected agencies of Federal, State, and local government. This \namendment does not change the committee moratorium on listings of new \nspecies or new critical habitat designation--even though I strongly \ndisagree with this moratorium. If we pull the rug out from the recovery \nprograms in progress--those that have already been the subject of \nextensive public hearings and economic analysis required under the \nlaw--we will only make it more difficult and expensive to enact them in \nthe future. The irony of this is that we hurt the very people and \norganizations that these funding cuts may have inadvertently been \ndesigned to protect--private landowners, State, and local agencies.\n  We have had three very extensive reauthorization hearings in the last \nmonth on the Endangered Species Act. It is noteworthy that we have \ndiscovered very substantial common ground among many diverse interests \non many issues. These include the need for positive incentives for \nthose responsible for implementing on-the-ground programs, and the need \nfor more State and local delegation. The amendment we offer today \nprovides a partial restoration of funding for exactly these purposes. \nThese funds will be highly leveraged by State, local, and private \nfunds, and these depend on a certain amount of Federal coordination and \nseed money.\n  The old adage that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure is \ncertainly operative in the case of this amendment: A relatively modest \namount of funding in these few areas for the Fish and Wildlife Service \nand their State and local partners will ensure that we avoid headaches \nand irreversible losses in the future. If we do not move forward and \nhonor our practical and ethical commitments to recovery programs \nalready in progress, particularly those at critical stages, we will be \nabandoning a pledge that I firmly believe the American people have \nasked us repeatedly to honor.\n  By cutting funds that are designed to resolve conflicts and provide \nState and local delegation and solutions, we are shooting ourselves in \nthe foot. By restoring funds, at least partially, we stay ahead of the \ncurve and give ourselves, our landowners, and our declining species of \nplants and animals a fighting chance. I think that we deserve it. I ask \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this as a sensible, \nprudent, and necessary step.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the Reid/Chafee Amendment to restore funding for species \nconservation programs under the Endangered Species Act.\n  Twenty-two years ago, Congress passed the Endangered Species Act with \nlarge bipartisan majorities. Even at that time, hundreds of species had \nbecome extinct since the creation of the United States. Today, \nscientists estimate that we are losing up to 100 species a day around \nthe world.\n  While I acknowledge that the act has significant problems, the ESA \nalso has achieved remarkable success in recovering species. One of \nthese is Florida's American alligator.\n  Today, of the 900 species that are listed in the United States as \nthreatened or endangered, 238 of those are stable or improving, and 7 \nspecies have been delisted. Americans understand that by protecting \nspecies, the Endangered Species Act protects us--our economy, our \nhealth, and our longterm existence. While we are pulling away from the \nbrink of crisis, we cannot afford to reduce our vigilance on this \nissue. We should correct the shortcomings of the act, and benefit from \nall our efforts thus far.\n  However, just as Congress is prepared to implement reforms to make \nthe ESA work better, this appropriations bill undermines our efforts by \ncutting ESA science funding, outreach to landowners, and State \nassistance--the specific programs that will reduce conflicts. This \nbudget would exacerbate \n\n[[Page S12013]]\nrather than reduce problems we have identified with the ESA.\n  The Reid-Chafee amendment will restore part of the disproportionate \ncut made in committee to endangered species programs, bringing it more \nin line with funding reductions in Interior across the board.\n  More importantly, the Reid amendment invests money in the future of \nimperiled species, spending wisely now to save money in the long run. \nTwo and one-half million dollars of the restored funds will go to \nprelisting programs that seek to conserve species before they reach the \nbrink of extinction, forestalling the need for costly and sometimes \ncontroversial recovery efforts. In my own State, this funding will help \nprelisting activities to conserve the Florida black bear, to prevent it \nfrom going the way of the critically endangered Florida panther.\n  Another $2 million will go to consultation activities under section 7 \nof the ESA to help Federal agencies better fulfill their \nresponsibilities under the ESA. Section 7 is a powerful tool for \nsolving, and in many cases avoiding, conflicts between Federal agency \nactivities and species conservation. In Florida, for example, Federal \nprojects that may have gravely impacted the conservation of Florida \npanthers and West Indian manatees were modified through the section 7 \nprocess in ways that did not significantly interfere with the projects \nand actually benefitted the species. It is hard to find a program where \nthe money is better spent.\n  Finally, $4 million would go to species recovery efforts. As Senator \nKempthorne has emphasized in his very productive subcommittee hearings \non the reauthorization of the ESA, recovery is, or should be, the heart \nof the ESA. Species such as the grizzly bear, the peregrine falcon--and \nour national symbol, the bald eagle--are recovered or recovering \nsteadily due to ESA recovery efforts. But the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService need the resources to keep these successes coming. Again, \nexpeditious recovery measures now will decrease the expense of recovery \nin the long run.\n  Throughout its history, the ESA has enjoyed bipartisan support. The \nact was signed into law by President Nixon. The harm regulation was \npromulgated during the Ford administration, which was revamped to its \ncurrent form during the Reagan administration. Now the program is being \ndefended by the Clinton administration. There are many good reasons for \nthis historical support. Let us bear them in mind, and address the \nact's obvious problems with consideration for the benefits that it has \nproduced thus far.\n  The Reid-Chafee amendment makes good fiscal sense, and will help \nconserve the endangered wildlife that all Americans value as part of \nthis country's priceless natural heritage. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to address for just a \nmoment the consultation and the recovery functions for endangered \nspecies. The consultations which must be conducted so the projects can \ngo forward, the consultation and the recovery functions of the Fish and \nWildlife Service, were designed to make certain that species that are \nalready on the list of threatened or endangered species are not in \njeopardy, and to assure that they would come off of the list as rapidly \nas possible. The committee has funded these activities at about 60 \npercent of the budget estimate.\n  We have before us an amendment that restores approximately $4.5 \nmillion to these activities. This is an amendment that I can support so \nfar as it speeds the process of removing species off of the list.\n  In hearings that I have held this year, it has been confirmed \nrepeatedly that the failure to consult, the failure of agencies to meet \ndeadlines, the failure of agencies to commit resources to consultation, \nhave severely delayed projects and have resulted in unnecessary project \ncosts and, in one instance, nearly resulted in economic disaster and \nthreatened thousands of jobs in the State of Idaho.\n  The February 1995 issue of Conservation Biology said that there were \nhuge delays in the writing of 314 recovery plans completed through \nAugust 1991. The average time that it took to write a recovery plan \ninvolving an animal was 11.3 years; for plants it took 4.1 years. The \nDirector of the Fish and Wildlife Service stated at a recent hearing on \nthe Endangered Species Act that their targeted goal was to reduce the \ntime it takes to produce a recovery plan to 2\\1/2\\ years after a \nspecies is listed. It would be counterproductive for us to reduce the \nmoney available for them to accomplish this job.\n  Another reason I want this money available is to make certain that \nconsultations such as those that will be required, now that the Bruneau \nHot Springs snail is considered by the courts to be a listed species, \ncan indeed go forward. For those who may not be familiar with this \nissue, the Bruneau snail was listed as endangered, removed from listing \nfor procedural reasons, and recently reinstated to listed status by the \ncourts.\n  During the months, and in fact even the years, it took, an entire \nregional economy in Idaho has been put on hold; consultations on farm \nloans and business loans and other projects that may affect the snail \nhave been totally held up.\n  We must at this juncture make certain there is enough money to \nconduct the consultations on species like the Bruneau snail.\n  There is another example of why I support the increased funding for \nrecovery and consultation. The recovery and ultimate delisting of the \ngray wolf, the controversial project of the administration, depends for \nits success on many things. One of the unknowns--a research problem \nwith gray wolf--is the possible conflict between the wolf and another \nmajor predator, the mountain lion. The Honecker Institute is conducting \nimportant research into this issue. This research, that is funded out \nof this appropriation, must be done to resolve a major gray wolf issue.\n  Mr. President, I do join, then, with Senator Reid, who is the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee. I enjoyed working with him. I also want to \nstate that there is a moratorium in place. The moratorium is in place \nso we can reauthorize, and in fact reform, the Endangered Species Act.\n  These funds must not be used contrary to the intent of that current \nmoratorium. In fact, I support the extension of that moratorium.\n  Mr. President, I support the continuation of the moratorium on \nfurther listings and designations of critical habitat under the \nEndangered Species Act until the act is reauthorized.\n  Earlier this year, a 6-month moratorium on further listings was \nsigned into law. I supported that amendment.\n  Unfortunately, since the moratorium took effect, courts have twice \nrequired the Department of the Interior to take actions counter to the \nmoratorium's intent. The courts ordered the designation of critical \nhabitat for the Mexican spotted owl throughout the Southwest and the \nreinstatement of the Bruneau Hot Springs snail on the endangered \nspecies list.\n  In those cases, and in similar cases over the years, the courts have \nstated they might have ruled differently had it not been for the \nwording of the Endangered Species Act, which leaves them no other \nchoice but to supersede other laws--including the moratorium. We must \nreform the Endangered Species Act in such a way to make sure it does \nnot become the super law that overrules all other laws of our Nation.\n  In my Drinking Water, Fisheries, and Wildlife Subcommittee, we have \nheld eight hearings in Washington and field hearings in Oregon and \nIdaho on reauthorization and reform of the act. We have heard some \nhonest and blunt testimony on the impacts of the act. We've heard from \nboth advocates of the act and those who favor its reform. We have heard \nfrom the administration. While all witnesses may not agree on the \nfuture of the act, they do agree that the ESA is in need of reform. \nWe've heard it from unemployed loggers in Idaho, environmentalists, and \nthe Secretary of the Interior. The Endangered Species Act has failed \nand must be reformed.\n  For years, Secretary Babbitt insisted the ESA only needed some fine \ntuning. At one of our hearings he clearly and forcefully stated it is \ntime to reform the act.\n  Continuing this moratorium gives us the time to do the job and do it \nright.\n  This is not a regional issue. It is not just a Western concern. \nSenators from \n\n[[Page S12014]]\nNorth Carolina to Washington; Arizona to Virginia will tell you of the \noverreaching effect of the Endangered Species Act on their States. \nWhether you are talking about Texas, where more than 800,000 acres of \nland in more than 30 counties were proposed for critical habitat for \nthe golden-cheeked warbler or Alabama where a relatively common \nsturgeon has been repeatedly proposed for listing--we are all affected.\n  Everyone agrees the Endangered Species Act must be reformed, and \nsoon. I am committed to getting a reform bill passed by the Senate this \nyear. Keeping this time out on further listings and designations of \ncritical habitat in place will only help us get the job done soon, and \nget it done well. We need to lower the rhetoric and allow for rational \ndiscussion of the legitimate issues facing ESA reform. I believe by \nremoving the potential for new listings of species and habitat for a \nwhile, we can proceed with meaningful ESA reform that will serve the \nbest interests of private landowners, resource users, nature lovers, \nand the very species we are trying to save.\n  Mr. President, I commend Senator Gorton, who has been a leader on \nthis whole issue of the Endangered Species Act, and thank Senator Byrd \nfor his continual assistance on these matters as we move forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Idaho leaves the \nfloor, I want to extend my public appreciation again for the fair \nmanner in which he has conducted the hearings and the studies that the \ncommittee has been engaged in, in arriving at the point where we can \nattempt to have legislation that will reauthorize the Endangered \nSpecies Act.\n  The Senator from Idaho and I on some occasions--not a lot of \noccasions--have disagreements about philosophy relating to the \nEndangered Species Act. He has conducted himself with the highest \nstandards of government in the hearings he has held. I want him to know \npublicly how much I appreciate the work he has done in that \nsubcommittee. He is an asset to the U.S. Senate.\n  I just want to say briefly, the money that is taken from the Bureau \nof Mines--it is the only program I think in this bill that was funded \nat the level the President asked, even though it is below last year's \nlevel. It is a real hit to the Bureau of Mines. We did, under the \ndirection and guidance of the ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Byrd, limit any cuts to programs that would not \ninclude health and safety. So I appreciate, as others have stated here, \nthe leadership of the Senator from West Virginia and the help and \nguidance of the Senator from Washington, who is managing the bill \ntoday.\n  I have no more speakers on this. If it is in keeping with the wishes \nof the manager of the bill, we could move forward with adoption of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, indeed, the Senator from Nevada is \ncorrect. This amendment was modified, changed, and worked out to the \nsatisfaction of all concerned and to my satisfaction and that of the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  I believe at this point, unless there is further debate, we are \nprepared to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2308) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n     Vote On The Committee Amendment On Page 9, Line 23, as amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the underlying \ncommittee amendment? If not, the question occurs on the amendment.\n  The amendment on page 9, line 23, as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, next in line will be the Senator from \nNorth Carolina. I believe, however, that his amendment is appropriately \nan amendment to one or both of the committee amendments on page 9 and \npage 10.\n  So, if he will permit me, I will ask that those amendments be called \nup and his amendment would be to those.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                Committee Amendment on Page 10, Line 12\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be informed the Senate has \nagreed to the amendment on page 9. We are now on the amendment on page \n10.\n  Mr. GORTON. Then I call up the amendment on page 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the pending business.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe accepted but it be considered as original text for the purpose of \nfurther amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment on page 10, line 12, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2309\n\n           (Purpose: To Save the American Taxpayers $968,000)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I believe I have an amendment at the desk. \nI ask it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the remaining committee \namendments will be set aside and the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2309.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 10, line 19, strike the word ``Act.'' and insert: \n     ``Act: Provided, That no monies appropriated under this act \n     shall be used to implement and carry out the Red Wolf \n     reintroduction program and that the amount appropriated under \n     this paragraph shall be reduced by $968,000.''\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the pending amendment proposes to save the \nAmerican taxpayers almost $1 million by eliminating funding for the so-\ncalled Red Wolf Program, which has created an enormous problem for the \npeople of North Carolina. This Red Wolf Program is administered by the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  Mr. President, 63 red wolves were released by the Fish and Wildlife \nService onto Federal lands, but they just did not stay there. They have \nincreasingly encroached on private property to the point that they have \nbecome hazardous and a menace to private property owners, their \nfamilies, their animals, their livestock, and so on.\n  Mr. President, the Red Wolf Program was created in 1987. It has \nalready cost the American taxpayers $5,224,500. According to a March \n1995 report from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the 63 wolves \noriginally released in eastern North Carolina in 1987 have multiplied. \nToday there are at least 170 or more wolves in eastern North Carolina. \nAt least 70 wolves have been born in the wild during the past 8 years. \nThat amounts to an increase of more than 100 percent in the population \nof red wolves in less than 8 years.\n  Since 1987 the Fish and Wildlife Service has conducted 934 monitoring \nflights over that entire area to monitor the location of these red \nwolves, at a cost of untold thousands of dollars--934 airplane flights \nto monitor these transplanted red wolves. And the administration has \nrequested another $968,000 for this very same program for the coming \nyear.\n  I am told that the States of Tennessee and South Carolina have the \nsame difficulty with the red wolves because the Fish and Wildlife \nService has transplanted and relocated red wolves in those two States \nas well.\n  Mr. President these wolves are predatory animals, and they have \nbecome an exceedingly dangerous presence in eastern North Carolina. \nThey slink onto private property, they attack and feed upon farm \nanimals and livestock, and we have reports that at least one child has \nbeen bitten by a red wolf and had to undergo tetanus treatment.\n  We have received all sorts of mail from eastern North Carolina. We \nhave \n\n[[Page S12015]]\nmail from organizations such as the North Carolina Farm Bureau and the \nHyde County, NC, officials, and from concerned citizens all over. They \noppose vigorously this Red Wolf Program because it has become \nincreasingly dangerous to the people, to their private property, and to \ntheir farm animals.\n  The chairman of the Board of Commissioners of Hyde County, NC, put it \nthis way. And I quote him:\n\n       Red wolves have caused a lot of hardship in Hyde, . . . \n     endangered species have more land rights than the landowner \n     paying the property taxes.\n\n  But the bottom line is that these red wolves have become such a \ndangerous problem that the Fish and Wildlife Service issued regulations \non April 13 finally allowing property owners to shoot these predatory \nanimals on their land. And the farmers and other landowners feel that \nthey ought not to have to go to that extreme. They want an end to the \nprogram, and I think that it has served its purpose, if it ever had \none.\n  In any case, for a long time authorities have been contending that \nreintroduction programs, which is what the Fish and Wildlife Service \ncalls them, do not work very well.\n  I have in hand a report published by the New York Times on October 5, \n1993, which emphasizes that these reintroduction programs are useless. \nMichael Phillips, the field coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife \nService, was quoted by the New York Times as saying, and I am quoting \nhim:\n\n       Most things we have tried to orchestrate in the wild have \n     not worked. The pairs we put out did not stay together and \n     the families did not stay in the places we chose.\n\n  So, Mr. President, so the many good citizens in eastern North \nCarolina resent this waste of taxpayers' money. They do not want these \npredators roaming their property, attacking their farm animals and \nlivestock, and being a peril to their children.\n  According to the committee report, private property owners in Idaho \nand Montana are experiencing the same sort of problems as a result of \nthe gray wolf reintroduction program.\n  All of it indicates to me--and I address this specifically for myself \nand my State, the Red Wolf Program--that this red wolf program is a bad \nidea whose time never came. I hope that we will not waste any more of \nthe taxpayers' dollars on it.\n  The pending amendment proposes to abolish the program by eliminating \nthe proposed $968,000 for its continuance for 1 more year.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is more or less in the form of a \nnotice that I have listened to the Senator from North Carolina. He is \ndealing with an issue which is almost exclusively contained within his \nown State. Personally, I defer to his judgment on the matter and tend \nto support him in his amendment. At the same time, I recognize--and I \nbelieve he recognizes--that this could well be considered to be a \nrelatively controversial amendment that would require a rollcall.\n  So what I should like to do at this time is simply put Members on \nboth sides of the aisle on notice that the Senator from North Carolina \nhas spoken to the amendment, and we will deal with it much as we dealt \nwith the amendment of the Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] this morning, \nand state that if there are those who are going to oppose the \namendment, would they please notify us? Better than that, will they \nplease come to the floor so they can debate the amendment?\n  If I may request of the Senator from North Carolina to withhold his \nrequest for the yeas and nays, and if no one comes to oppose the \namendment in an hour or so, we will simply accept it by a voice vote. \nBut if it is going to be opposed, we will certainly have a rollcall \nvote on it.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator made a \nproposition that I cannot refuse. As the Prince of Denmark was once \nreported to have said, it is a consummation devoutly to be wished.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the manager of the bill.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, once again, this amendment by the Senator \nfrom North Carolina on the reintroduction of the red wolves is a \nsignificant amendment. If there are those who are going to debate the \nSenator from North Carolina on it or object to it, we would appreciate \nnotice from them reasonably promptly.\n  Mr. President, we know that we have one other amendment that will be \ncontested. It will be proposed by the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] \nregarding the stewardship of an incentive program. We hope that we can \nget him to come to the floor as promptly as possible.\n  We have cleared a few other amendments for a wrap-up session. But it \nis now 3 o'clock in the afternoon. Most of these contentious amendments \non this bill have been debated and voted on.\n  We urge Members to tell us now whether or not they want to have their \namendments considered. And there is no better time to come and have an \namendment considered than right now. If Members want that kind of \nconsideration, would they come as promptly as possible?\n  With that, and waiting with bated breath the next Senator who wishes \nto speak, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Modification of Amendment No. 2295\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n2295, which was adopted last night, be modified by striking any \nreference to ``December'' and inserting in each such place \n``November''.\n  This agreement is cleared on both sides and is necessary for the \namendment to be internally consistent and also consistent with the \nassertions by its sponsors that it was a 90-day moratorium on the \nSecretary of Interior implementing any grazing regulations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                 Committee amendment on page 16, Line 4\n\n                Committee amendment on page 21, line 24\n\n                 Committee amendment on page 22, line 5\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe that there are three remaining \ncommittee amendments that have not been adopted. May I inquire whether \nthat is correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that those three \ncommittee amendments be considered en bloc and adopted en bloc and they \nbe considered as original text for purpose of amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the committee amendments were agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that \nfurther proceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside, and that I be allowed to offer an \namendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n[[Page S12016]]\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2310\n\n           (Purpose: To restore funding for Indian education)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], proposes \n     amendment numbered 2310.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 89, line 8, strike ``$54,660,000'' and insert \n     ``$81,341,000''.\n       On page 136, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3 . PRO RATA REDUCTION.\n\n       The amounts provided in this Act, not required for payments \n     by law, are reduced by 2 percent on a pro rata basis. The \n     reduction required by this section shall be made in a uniform \n     manner for each program, project, or activity provided in \n     this Act.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment will restore $26.6 \nmillion for Indian education programs that are funded on a competitive \nbasis through the Department of Education's Office of Indian Education.\n  Under the amendment, the office's programs would be maintained in \n1996 at the 1995 level of $81 million. The committee has appropriated \nand has contained in this bill $54 million for this purpose already. \nAnd I appreciate that very much, but I do want my colleagues to know \nthat this level of funding would represent more than a 30-percent cut \nfrom the current-year level. It would represent the complete \nelimination of the office's competitive grant program which \nspecifically awards funding to Indian tribes and tribal organizations \nthat work with the public schools and the community on a variety of \neducation issues.\n  This funding is vitally needed because it supplements but it does not \ndirectly fund our Nation's public schools; and those are the schools, \nMr. President, which educate 90 percent of our American Indian \nchildren.\n  Without the amendment and the restoration of the competitive grant \nprogram, we will be eliminating special services for Indian students in \npublic schools. We will be eliminating training for their teachers and \ncritically needed adult education and GED programs that are operated by \nIndian tribes and Indian people.\n  Mr. President, this is not fluff money. This is funding that is \nawarded on a highly competitive basis. It does not even come close to \nmeeting the actual need which has been demonstrated.\n  In 1990 to 1994 this Office of Indian Education received a total of \n$75 million in competitive funding requests from Indian tribes and \nIndian organizations. It was able to fund less than 50 percent of the \nrequests it received during that 4-year period. Only the programs of \nthe highest quality were funded due to the very competitive nature of \nthese grants.\n  I want to make sure that my colleagues understand this, that I am not \noffering an amendment that would allocate money out to school districts \non a formula basis. The funding that is involved with this amendment is \nspecifically designed to keep the Indian tribes and Indian people \ninvolved in the education of their own children, in the education of \ntheir own young people and the adults in those tribes and Indian \norganizations.\n  Mr. President, I have heard many speeches on this Senate floor about \nempowering people to do things for themselves. These funds that we are \ntrying to restore in this amendment empower Indian tribes and Indian \npeople to take a hand in educating their own children. That is the \nspecific purpose of these funds. And it is for that reason that I \nbelieve it is important that we maintain the current level of funding. \nAs I mentioned earlier, the funds enable tribes to operate GED classes \nand other adult education classes. It helps to train the teachers who \nwill teach these Indian students. It provides fellowships and grants to \nIndian students who wish to pursue higher education and through a \nspecific set-aside it funds several Indian control schools including \nschools in Wisconsin and in Minnesota and in the Dakotas.\n  Last year Indian-controlled schools in Minnesota received $1 and $2 \nmillion in competitive grant funding. That is two different schools in \nMinnesota. Unless the amendment that I am offering here is approved, \nthese schools will not even have the opportunity to apply for funding \nin the upcoming year. They will get nothing because there will be no \nprogram through which we can fund them.\n  Mr. President, there are many types of programs funded under this \nprogram. Let me give a few examples. The Yaqui tribe in Arizona has a \nprogram for curriculum development for dropout prevention, for support \nsystems, for students in those schools. In Washington State, the South \nPuget Intertribal Planning and Seattle Indian Center has a dropout \nintervention and GED program. That is funded through these funds.\n  In Alaska the Bristol Bay Native American Corps has a dropout and \ncounseling and testing center that they fund. In Oklahoma there is a \nCross Cultural Education Center that provides basic skills, classes and \ndropout prevention programs for Indian students.\n  In my own State, the Pueblo Zuni have programs in basic academic \nskills, enhancement and dropout prevention. New Mexico State University \nin the past has had a summer program for Indian youth in science and \nmath which is funded through the funds that I am proposing to maintain \nwith this amendment.\n  In Wyoming, there is the Northern Plains Education Foundation, also a \ndropout prevention program that they have there.\n  In Nevada, we have the Fallen Pauite Shoshoni Tribe and the Pyramid \nLake Pauite Tribe. They have the basic skills and dropout prevention \nprogram as well.\n  Mr. President, my Indian constituents recently reminded me that the \nvery first contract with America was between the Federal Government and \nthe Indian people of this country.\n  In school districts such as the Gallop-McKinley school district in my \nState of New Mexico, Indian students need the services that this \nappropriation provides, and the school district serving them relies \nupon these Federal funds. These funds provide the services that enhance \nthe cultural relevance and success of mainstream public education for \nstudents. They empower the Indian tribes and Indian people to remain \ninvolved in the education of their own children, even when these \nchildren are in public schools.\n  We ought not to be cutting programs that are essential for the very \nneediest in our society, and unless we adopt this amendment, that is \nexactly what we would be doing in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I think there are going to be many examples this \nyear--we have already seen a few and we will see more when we come back \nfrom our August recess--where we are proposing to cut funding for \neducation. As I go around my State of New Mexico and talk to people, \nthat is not the priority that the people of my State have. They want us \nto maintain funding for education. In fact, if there is any additional \nfunding to be used, they want it added to education.\n  Ninety percent of the Indian students in my State and in the country, \nin fact, get their education through the public schools, and the funds \nthat are involved in this program are the funds that are helping those \npublic schools to provide better education and are helping the Indian \norganizations and the tribal governments to participate in that.\n  Last Sunday, on July 30, Louis Gerstner, the CEO of IBM, told the \nGovernors in their meeting in Vermont that America's top priorities \nshould be setting ``absolutely the highest academic standards and \nholding all of us accountable for results. Now. Immediately. This \nschool year.''\n  He went on to say, ``Now if we don't do that, we won't need anymore \ngoals, because we are going nowhere. Without standards and \naccountability, we have nothing.''\n  Mr. President, I compliment Mr. Gerstner for his strong commitment to \nimproving education. We need to demonstrate that same commitment in the \nU.S. Senate. This amendment will help us to do that.\n  The offset that I have identified in this amendment and which I am \nsure is not ideal, since no offset is ideal, but it \n\n[[Page S12017]]\nis the least painful of those that I come up with, essentially involves \na 2 percent prorated reduction in funding for all other accounts \ncovered by this bill. With that kind of a 2-percent reduction on a \nprorated basis, we can have the necessary $26 million which is \nnecessary to keep funding in 1996 at the same level that we have it in \n1995 for these very important programs that help to educate Indian \nchildren in this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I yield the floor, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, with regret, I am going to have to oppose \nthis amendment first, by saying that, again, if you focus on only one \nline item in this appropriations bill or in all appropriations bill, \nyou reach one conclusion. If you take the budget of the United States \nas a whole, you come up with an entirely different conclusion. It is \ncorrect that this particular Indian education program is subjected to a \n$27 million reduction under the amount for the current year. In that, \nthe Senator from New Mexico is entirely correct. But that is only one \nsmall part of the moneys which are devoted to Indian education.\n  For the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the schools that it conducts, a \nsubject of the debate last night and early this morning, there is \nactually a small increase in the appropriation in this bill, one of a \ntiny handful of functions in the entire bill which is actually \nincreased over 1995 in attempting to reach our goal of an 11-percent \noverall reduction.\n  But that figure pales to insignificance in comparison with the $470 \nmillion which goes into Indian education programs administered by the \nDepartment of Education outside of this appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I do not think Members know that Indian children are \nthe subject of impact aid payments to the school districts that provide \neducation for them. Impact aid is something with which every Member of \nthis body is familiar. It is the added payments made by the Federal \nGovernment for people who live on or work on Federal reservations, for \nchildren in school, by reason of the tax exemption of the lands on \nthose Federal reservations.\n  So, for example, a child who is in a military family, with a family \nliving on a military reservation, entitles the school district \neducating that child to impact aid. Indian children get that impact aid \nexactly as everybody else that is its subject.\n  This bill includes $318 million, way more than the entire budget that \nwe are talking about, in impact aid for Indian children. In fact, \nIndian children are doubly privileged, because they get all the impact \naid and they get this program to which this amendment is an amendment, \nin addition. So we are not speaking about the only or even the \nprincipal program which provides educational assistance for Indian \nchildren. I simply want to repeat, other parts of the budget and the \nappropriations bill which we will adopt include $470 million for that \npurpose. It is infinitely more than what we are speaking about here.\n  But, Mr. President, at the same time, this amendment proposes to take \nmoney out of every other program covered by this bill, ironically \nincluding every other Indian program. So a significant portion of it \nwill be transferred from other Indian programs.\n  I have already made the commitment to the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, who chairs the Indian Affairs Committee, that when we arrive \nat a final amount of money for Indian programs, we will work with him \nfor those internal priorities. This proposal sets those priorities by \ntaking additional money from every other Indian program for this \ntogether with money from the National Park Service, which we have \nattempted to protect because of its obvious importance, for the \nNational Endowment for the Arts, on which we have just had a long \ndebate and a restoration of certain amounts of money, for energy \nprograms, for our national forests, literally for everything else in \nthis bill.\n  So everything in this bill, every program, every project, every \nagency, every responsibility is reduced by this amendment\n in order to deal with a single line item, which is far from the most \nimportant line item for the education of our children.\n\n  Mr. President, for that reason, I believe it should be rejected. I \nbelieve, also, that we would have a rollcall on it.\n  Does the Senator from New Mexico desire a rollcall vote?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would desire a rollcall. I would like \na few minutes to respond.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Before the Senator from New Mexico speaks again, I will \njust say that we are going to attempt to stack the vote on this \namendment with the vote on the amendment by the Senator from North \nCarolina on wolves and any other we may have. I hope perhaps we will \nsettle with the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will indulge me for a moment, I understand \nthat we may well have an agreement on mine. If we did, if it reaches \nthat point, maybe we can take 15 seconds, and I would ask at that point \nthat whatever is pending be set aside, and we can put all the \nstatements in the Record and agree to it.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be delighted.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me take a few minutes to respond to \nthe comments of the Senator. Let me give my perspective on where we \nfind ourselves, because I think it is important to always identify the \ncontext.\n  In my view, the budget resolution that was approved by the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives has in it a very misguided set of \npriorities, and that is part of what is driving us to debate cuts \nwithin this Interior appropriations bill at this point. We are seeing \nthat we have a bill coming up again tomorrow on defense matters, where \nwe are proposing, under that budget resolution, to add $7 billion to \nwhat the President has asked for and to what the Pentagon has asked \nfor, primarily to fund Member-interest items, which is usually referred \nto in the public arena as ``pork,'' at the same time that we are \ncutting funds for Indian education throughout this country.\n  So we have a very misguided set of priorities that have driven us to \nthe situation that we find ourselves in today. For that reason, of \ncourse, I oppose that budget resolution.\n  Let me say that even within this bill I have great difficulty \nrelating to the characterization that my colleague and friend from \nWashington made that the Indian students in this country are doubly \nprivileged by getting impact aid funds plus other types of funds. The \nimpact aid funds are clearly intended to make up for the loss of the \nlocal tax base. That is what that is. That is not free money. That is a \nresult of the fact that local communities have no ability to tax \nlocally, and, therefore, the Federal Government has said we will \nprovide some level of assistance to offset the loss of revenue from the \nloss of that tax base.\n  The truth is that the Indian students in my State--at least, when I \ngo around and visit schools, those schools are not luxurious; those are \nlarge classes, and those students do not have any kind of special \nprivileges by virtue of being Indian students.\n  A principal of one of the schools in Gallup County came to see me--\nKaren Woods from Jefferson Elementary in Gallup-McKinley County. She \nsaid to me--and I think this is her perspective in trying to prepare \nfor the new school year which will begin later this month--what she is \nfacing is cuts in support for kindergarten. She is having to go from a \nfull day down to a half day. There are cuts in counselors from the \nelementary school, cuts in bilingual education and funds for tutors, \nand cuts in chapter 1. She will have lost the first grade side-by-side \nprogram, as she explained it to me. Summer school for elementary \nstudents has been lost. Home school liaison program, which she had \nbefore, has been lost. Now we are proposing in this bill that the funds \nwhich she might have applied for to supplement public school funds to \nassist the Indian students, in particular, which the various tribes \ncould have applied for, will also be cut.\n  So I think it represents a very misguided set of priorities. I hope \nvery \n\n[[Page S12018]]\nmuch that we can do this. I wish we did not have to take a 2 percent \nreduction in the other accounts in this bill in order to at least \nmaintain level funding for this year in this vitally important program. \nBut that is the only way that I can figure out how to do it.\n  I think, on balance, that is the right set of priorities. On balance, \nwe should be putting our children first and putting the education of \nour children first. I think our obligation in the Federal Government is \nnowhere greater than in the education of the Indian children in this \ncountry.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and \nvote for it when we come to a final vote.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for \nthe promptness in dealing with this amendment. I ask unanimous consent \nthat we return to consideration of the Helms amendment and that we hear \nfrom the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2309\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to discuss the Helms \namendment that we have just returned to. What this amendment does is \nprovide that no moneys appropriated under this act shall be used to \nimplement or carry out the red wolf introduction program.\n  Mr. President, the amendment goes on to say, ``and that the amount \nappropriated under this paragraph shall be reduced by $968,000.''\n  It is agreeable with the Senator from North Carolina that that last \nphrase I just stated--``and that the amount appropriated under this \nparagraph shall be reduced by $968,000''--can be stricken.\n  Now, Mr. President, I presume that to have that amendment modified to \nthat extent would have to come from the individual presenter of the \namendment; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It can be done by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Well, the Senator from North Carolina might come back. If \nhe does, I would prefer to have him do it. If he does not, at the \nconclusion of my remarks, I will ask unanimous consent to have that \nstricken.\n  I will proceed pending the return of the Senator from North Carolina, \nif he chooses to come back. He and I discussed this, and there is no \ndoubt of his position on this particular clause.\n  Mr. President, a little review of the record. In 1967, which was 28 \nyears ago, the red wolf was listed as endangered. By 1980, which was \nsome 15 years ago, the red wolf was officially declared as extinct in \nthe wild. It was gone, except in a few zoos.\n  In 1987, the Fish and Wildlife Service reintroduced red wolves into \nthe Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, which is in Dare County, \nNC. The red wolf population was determined to be what they call a \n``nonessential experimental population.'' In other words, they released \nthese pairs of wolves with the hope that they would come back and \nrepropagate. Nonetheless, they are not a strictly experimental \npopulation. By calling them ``nonessential,'' it meant that if they \ntrespass out of their areas and so forth, they could be shot by the \nlocal individuals in the area if they destroyed wildlife and so forth \nor farm animals.\n  Now, a minimum of 40 to 50 red wolves are known to exist in the area \nnow. In 1991, the Fish and Wildlife Service initiated a second \nreintroduction effort in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Part \nof it is in North Carolina and part of it is in Tennessee.\n  In addition, there are some 200,000 acres of privately owned land \nthat is part of the recovery program. I presume that the great bulk of \nthat privately owned land is owned by timber companies, not by somebody \nwith a plot of 2 to 5 acres, but instead hundreds, indeed, thousands of \nacres owned by the timber companies.\n  A bill to allow private landowners to trap and kill red wolves on \nprivate lands in certain parts of North Carolina was passed by the \nState legislature and went into effect in January of this year. \nRecently, the Fish and Wildlife Service promulgated a special rule \nproviding more flexible management to private landowners.\n In other words, this is treated somewhat differently than strictly an \nendangered species. There is no taking. You cannot shoot, you cannot \ntrap them.\n\n  Mr. President, I was interested to discover that there are two red \nwolves in a captive breeding program in Roger Williams Park Zoo in our \ncapital city of Providence, RI. An effort is being made throughout the \ncountry to bring back this species that, indeed, was declared extinct \nin the wild, and considerable success has attended it.\n  With this amendment by the distinguished senior Senator, my longtime \nseatmate--we sit side by side and have for some 12 or 14 years--would \nprovide that no moneys appropriated under this act--that is the \nEndangered Species Act--or the Interior appropriations, could be used \nin connection to implement or carry out the red wolf reintroduction \nprogram.\n  I think that is unfortunate, Mr. President. I know that the senior \nSenator from North Carolina has ticked off some occasions when red \nwolves have attacked livestock, but I think those are relatively rare \nsituations.\n  What I worry about, Mr. President, is that each of us can come in and \ntick off individually these species that have been reintroduced in our \nStates, and we do not want that.\n  We all know in the Senate there is what they call senatorial \nprerogatives--a privilege, a deference. Both Senators from North \nCarolina are Republicans. I presume that the traditional deference will \nbe granted to them. It would not make any difference if they were both \nDemocrats, or one Democrat and one Republican. Judicial deference will \nbe granted by many, saying if that is what you want in your State, that \nis your business.\n  I think there is another view to this, Mr. President. I think it is \nto the advantage of all of us as a nation, as members of this society, \nas Americans, to have these populations come back. If they get out of \nhand, if we have wolves roaming all over the place and killing \nlivestock--sheep and cattle, ducks, chickens, whatever it might be--\nthere are ways of handling that. No question about it.\n  I do not think they represent a threat. I think the country is better \noff if we have some red wolves in these great national forests or great \nnational parks or wildlife refuges, whatever they might be.\n  I might point out, Mr. President, that where these are taking place \nis in lands that belong to all of us. It is not just lands that belong \nto the folks in North Carolina or the folks in Tennessee. They belong \nto all of us.\n  Mr. President, I am sorry that this amendment has been presented. I \nsuspect there will be considerable support for it. I indicated to the \nSenator from North Carolina that I would not be voting for it. I wanted \nto point out to others my feelings on it, and those that chose not to \nvote for it, obviously, I would be grateful for that likewise.\n  I think more than this particular case, Mr. President, yes, if we \nagree with red wolves, that is all right, the world will not come to a \nstop, but where do we go from here? What is next? What is after this?\n  Then, I believe, going after a grizzly or another type of wolf, no \nmatter what it is. These have been declared endangered species, and in \nsome cases extinct species, as in the case of the red wolf. Again, I \nwant to express my appreciation to the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina for taking out the last part dealing with the specific sums.\n  Now, why did he do that? He was gracious enough to do that because I \npointed out to him that when he takes money from the recovery funds, it \nmeans that whole series of other animals and species and flora, there \nis less money for that recovery program.\n  There is a long list of things seeking to be protected under the \nrecovery moneys which are very, very limited. I think total it is $36 \nmillion in all. This would cut that by nearly $1 million. An hour or so \nago on this floor we managed, with the help of the distinguished \nmanagers of the bill, to increase that part in the recovery program by \nabout $1.5 million. We are cutting it by $1 million. I am thankful, and \nI want to express my appreciation to Senator Helms in that particular \nprovision.\n  Mr. President, I do not see the Senator here. I know it is with his \napproval that I ask unanimous consent that the final clause in the \namendment \n\n[[Page S12019]]\nof the Senator which follows the word ``program'' be eliminated. That \nis, the clause that says ``and that the amount appropriated under this \nparagraph shall be reduced by $960,000.''\n  Mr. GORTON. Reserving the right to object, the Senator assures us \nthis has been agreed to by the sponsor?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. No question about that, otherwise I would not be doing \nit.\n  Mr. GORTON. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2309), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 10, line 19, strike the word ``Act.'' and insert: \n     ``Act: Provided, That no monies appropriated under this act \n     shall be used to implement and carry out the Red Wolf \n     reintroduction program.''\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been occupied across the hall, but I \ndid have the opportunity to speak to the senior Senator from Rhode \nIsland. I have to say that I do not agree with this amendment. I think \nthat it sets a very bad precedent for us to start micromanaging what is \ngoing on in the Interior Department.\n  We already have established a moratorium with further listing of \nendangered species. Now we are coming in here with line-specific \nlegislation dealing with a red wolf. I do not know about the red wolf. \nI do not think most people in this body know a great deal about the red \nwolf. I think that most of this body should agree we are not capable of \nlegislating.\n  Because of the simple fact that one of the Senators, for whatever \nreason, decides he does not want something done with a specific animal \nor specie of plant in his State, he should not come in here and \nlegislate something to be done or not done.\n  I think that we are legislating, of course, on an appropriations \nbill. This is a piecemeal approach, especially in light of the work \nthat Senator Kempthorne and I are engaged in to reauthorize the \nEndangered Species Act. On that matter, we have held five subcommittee \nhearings. There are more hearings scheduled for the recess a week from \ntoday. There is one in Casper, WY.\n  We intend to address the concerns of private landowners. The \nPresident, within the past 30 days, issued an Executive order that the \nEndangered Species Act basically does not apply to a private landowner \nowning less than 5 acres.\n  I just think this is wrong. I think it is a wrong way to legislate. \nThis Interior appropriations bill is an important bill. I think this is \nwrong. I am not going to go into a lot more detail other than to say, \nMr. President, that I move to table the Helms amendment and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Could I inquire of the Senator from New Mexico whether he \nwill be prepared to go to a vote on his amendment after the disposition \nof this vote?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, \nbe listed as a cosponsor of my amendment. I understand the yeas and \nnays have been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me ask the Senator from Washington if it is \nappropriate to ask unanimous consent for 4 minutes in between to \nexplain my amendment; he could have 2.\n  Mr. GORTON. It is certainly OK.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I prefer that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to table.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2310\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 4 minutes equally divided on the \nBingaman amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to take a minute and then defer \nto the Senator from Washington, and then take the last minute to make a \nfinal plea for this amendment.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would restore $126.6 million for Indian \neducation programs that are funded on a competitive basis. The funds go \nto Indian tribes and Indian tribal organizations.\n  The bill, as it presently stands, contemplates a 34-percent cut in \nthese funds for Indian education. I think that is not a responsible \ncourse for us to follow.\n  The amendment has an offset, which essentially is a 2-percent \nreduction across the board in all other accounts covered by the bill. I \nknow that is not a good result in the eyes of many people, but I do \nthink that the priority of this Senate should be to put in funds for \nthe education of our children and particularly the Indian children of \nthis country who depend upon the Federal Government for support.\n  I will yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this account represents no more than 10 \npercent of all of the money which goes into the education of Indian \nchildren. The great bulk of this account goes to school districts that \neducate Indian children. But those Indian children already get a credit \nthrough impact aid just as do other children on Federal reservations \nand the like.\n  I wish to repeat, impact aid applies to Indian children. This is over \nand above impact aid. The impact aid budget for this year is some five \nor six times greater than the amount that is included in this fund.\n  There is more than $470 million in the Department of Education for \nIndian education. The BIA line in this bill has more money for Indian \neducation than it does for the current year, one of the tiny handful of \nprograms that actually gets an increase.\n  And yet the Senator from New Mexico will take money, significant \namounts of money from our National Park System, from our cultural \ninstitutions, from our scientific institutions, and ironically this cut \nwill apply to all of the other Indian programs which were spoken of \nearlier today. They will also lose. The amendment I believe should be \nrejected.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just conclude by saying that this \namendment goes to the funding which is intended for tribes and tribal \norganizations to assist in the education of their own children. These \nare the only funds anywhere in this bill or, as far as I know, anywhere \nin any of the appropriations bills that are intended to empower tribes \nto assist in the education of their own children. \n\n[[Page S12020]]\n\n  We give a lot of speeches about empowering people to do things. I \nthink this is a priority. I think we ought to fund this. I regret that \nwe are having to reduce other accounts by 2 percent, but this is a \nhigher priority. I would rather reduce those accounts 2 percent than \nthis funding level here, 34 percent, which is what the present bill \ncalls for.\n  Mr. President, I think the yeas and nays have been requested already.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to table the Bingaman amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the Bingaman amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, this amendment would add $313,000 to the \nbudget of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board at the Department of the \nInterior, bringing the total for the Board to $962,000 for the upcoming \nfiscal year. The funding would be offset by an equal reduction in the \ndepartmental management account.\n  My amendment will ensure that a small, but important arts agency, the \n\n\n[[Page S12021]]\nIndian Arts and Crafts Board, can continue its operations. I want to \nmake it clear to my colleagues, however, that even if the amendment is \nadopted, the Arts and Crafts Board will take a 10-percent cut from the \ncurrent year level--a 20-percent cut from the President's budget \nrequest.\n  The work of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board is about creating \nopportunities for native American artisans, particularly young people \nwho must decide whether to continue the historical and cultural \ntraditions that are entailed in Indian art and craftmaking.\n  The Board helps to foster such opportunities for native American \nartisans, providing business advice and technical assistance to Indian \nindividuals and organizations; helping to identify new markets for \nIndian craft businesses; and promoting Indian art in Board museums as \nwell as outside exhibitions.\n  The most important function of the Board relates to implementation of \nthe Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, which directs the Board to \nassist native American artisans, tribes, or marketing organizations in \nobtaining trademarks for their products. Such marks of genuineness--\ntrademarks--help develop markets for Indian products, as well as assure \nconsumers that the products they buy are indeed genuine Indian. The act \nalso establishes stiff penalties for misrepresentation of works as \nIndian produced when they are not. The 1990 act represents a free \nmarket approach to promoting economic development in Indian country.\n  In a nutshell, the 1990 act gives the Board authority to obtain \ntrademarks for Indian artisans and thus help them distinguish their \nworks in the marketplace. This also helps consumers determine \ngenuineness. It strengthens criminal penalties for violations--\ncounterfeiting of trademarks--and establishes new civil remedies \nagainst those who misrepresent works as Indian produced when they are \nnot. In short, it cracks down on the fraud which is siphoning off a \nsignificant share of the market for native American artisans.\n  Prior to passage of the 1990 act, the Commerce Department had \nestimated that imported imitation Indian handcrafts were siphoning off \n10 to 20 percent from genuine Indian artisans' markets. Commerce also \nfound that much of the counterfeit market was made up of jewelry that \nundersold the genuine articles made by craftsmen such as the Navajo, \nHopi, and Zuni, by as much as 50 percent.\n  That is significant because, if Indian artisans cannot make enough \nmoney due to competition from cheap fakes, they will abandon the arts, \nand rich native American traditions will die out as a result. Or, if \nthey have to increase productivity at the expense of time-honored \nmanufacturing techniques in order to compete with imitation products, \nan important part of their heritage will be compromised and lost.\n  Mr. President, for many Native Americans, their art is their sole \nsource of income. These are not wealthy people. I met with one Navajo \ncouple, for example, whose ability to produce more Navajo rugs was \nlimited by their inability to raise more sheep. These people are \nstruggling from day to day to make ends meet.\n  I am not asking in our amendment that Indian artisans get special \ntreatment. We're proposing a funding level that represents a 10-percent \ncut from the fiscal year 1995 level. What I am asking is that the \nIndian Arts and Crafts Board be allowed to continue its work \npromulgating the regulations to implement and enforce the 1990 act; to \ncontinue its work on behalf of native American artisans.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n                           amendment no. 2315\n\n     (Purpose: To provide that any new fossil energy research and \n development project start shall be cost-shared with a private entity)\n\n       On page 77, line 12, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That any new project start \n     funded under this heading shall be substantially cost-shared \n     with a private entity to the extent determined appropriate by \n     the Secretary of Energy''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would require that any new \nstarts in the area of coal, gas, or oil research and development be \ncost shared with private industry.\n  Mr. President, at a time that we are cutting spending in programs \nacross the board in order to gain control over the Federal budget, we \nmust look very critically at those activities undertaken by the Federal \nGovernment which could and should be funded by private industry.\n  In fact, I believe we should not engage in any new starts and that we \nshould consider very seriously turning over research and development \nactivities intended to benefit particular industries, to those \nindustries. Until that decision has been made, however, we should at \nthe very least require private industry to put up a substantial cost \nshare for any new research activities undertaken by the Department of \nEnergy.\n  I trust that my colleagues will agree and that this amendment can be \naccepted.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2316\n\n (Purpose: To transfer certain funds from land acquisition to national \n                      recreation and preservation)\n\n       On page 18, line 17, strike ``$38,051,000'' and insert \n     ``38,094,000.''\n       On page 19, line 26, strike ``$43,230,000'' and insert \n     ``$43,187,000.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2317\n\n        (Purpose: To protect citizens' private property rights)\n\n       On page 16, line 17, strike the word ``surveys'' and insert \n     the following: ``surveys, including new aerial surveys.''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2318\n\n(Purpose: To provide funds for the acquisition of subsurface rights in \n                     the Kane Experimental Forest)\n\n       On page 69, line 11, after ``expended'' insert the \n     following: ``: Provided, That of the amounts made available \n     for acquisition management, $1,000,000 may be made available \n     for the purchase of subsurface rights in the Kane \n     Experimental Forest''.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, my amendment would provide $1 million to \nthe Forest Service for the acquisition of subsurface oil and gas rights \nbeneath the Kane Experimental Forest to protect the vital research and \nexperimentation programs in the forest. I am advised that if these \nsubsurface rights are not purchased this year, the landowner is likely \nto allow the commencement of exploration for oil and gas under the \nforest.\n  Located on the eastern boundary of the Allegheny National Forest, the \n1,737-acre Kane Experimental Forest is the field headquarters of the \nAllegheny Plateau Research Center of the U.S. Forest Service's \nNortheastern Forest Experimental Station. This research station has \nbeen a leader in the development of Allegheny hardwood management \ntechniques since the 1930's. Over the years, the Forest Service has \npursued an acquisition program of subsurface rights where important \nresearch would be adversely impacted by further oil and gas \nexploration. This program of acquisition has now moved to the Kane \nExperimental Forest, where new extraction activities are planned, some \nof which would likely eviscerate the vital research and experimental \nprograms of the forest.\n  The Forest Service has requested a $1 million appropriation for \nfiscal year 1996 to allow the agency to purchase the subsurface oil and \ngas rights beneath the Kane Experimental Forest. These funds would \nallow the consolidation of surface and subsurface rights throughout the \nforest to continue while protecting invaluable forest research and \ndata. This would also reduce the management costs that the Forest \nService currently incurs by having to monitor the extraction activities \nin the Kane Forest.\n  Mr. President, I would note that my amendment makes these funds \navailable for the purchase of these subsurface rights, but leaves the \ndecision to the discretion of the Forest Service.\n  I urge the adoption of my amendment and yield the floor.\n                           amendment no. 2319\n\n  (Purpose: To provide that $275,000 shall be made available from the \n cash equalization account in the Land and Water Conservation Fund for \n   the acquisition of Mt.

Mr. President, I offer an amendment to provide $2 \nmillion to continue the acquisition of land at the Petroglyphs National \nMonument in Albuquerque, NM.\n  I offer this amendment today because these ancient Indian rock \ncarvings continue to be directly threatened by development and urban \nencroachment.\n  The distinguished chairman and ranking member have done their best to \naddress land acquisition requirements. The subcommittee has focused its \nefforts on acquisitions wherein funding will complete the Federal \nGovernment's obligation for land purchase.\n  While the $2 million in this amendment will not complete acquisition \nat the Petroglyphs National Monument, it will ensure that we continue \nour commitment to the landowners within the boundaries of the monument.\n  Many of these landowners have announced their intention to develop \ntheir property if no funding is made available to purchase their \nproperty next year. Several landowners have begun breaking ground on \ntheir property.\n  These landowners have worked in good faith with the city of \nAlbuquerque, the National Park Service, and the Congress during the \nestablishment of this monument, expecting to be compensated within a \nreasonable time.\n  Mr. President, the Petroglyphs National Monument stretches for more \nthan 17 miles across Albuquerque's west side. Only 800 acres remain to \nbe purchased within the boundaries of the monument. This $2 million \nwill purchase property in the southern portion of the monument, most of \nwhich belongs to Westland Development.\n  Mr. Chairman, to ensure that the overall bill remains within the \nsubcommittee's 602(b) allocation, I am fully offsetting this amendment \nby reducing by $2 million the Bureau of Land Management automated land \nand minerals records system. This fully offsets the outlays needed for \nthe amendment.\n                           amendment no. 2321\n\n   (Purpose: To direct the National Park Service to conduct, within \n    existing funds, a Feasibility Study to evaluate proposals for a \n     northern access route into Denali National Park and Preserve)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following \n     section:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, Denali National Park and Preserve is \none of the Nation's most magnificent of natural resources. The park \nexemplifies Alaska's character as one of the world's last great \nfrontiers for adventure. Every year, the park instills awe into the \nthousands of visitors who are lucky enough to see it.\n  Unfortunately, few ever have the opportunity to enter the park. The \n1994 visitor season brought 490,149 visitors to the entrance of the \npark, only 241,995 of which were allowed to proceed past the entrance \ncheck point. The other 249,154 visitors were turned away. In other \nwords Mr. President, 51 percent of the visitors intending to visit \nDenali National Park were not allowed to set foot in the grandeur of \nthis 6 million acre park.\n  To some, 6 million acres may not sound like a significant piece of \nreal estate, but once you realize that the park is equivalent in size \nof the State of Maryland, and that within this vast area there is only \none 90-mile gravel road to accommodate a very limited number of park \nvisitors, you can begin to realize some of my frustration with the \nmanagement practices of the National Park Service.\n  The National Park Service sees nothing wrong with operating a park \nthe size of the State of Maryland in a way that keeps the majority of \nvisitors out of ``their'' park. Those fortunate enough to get past the \nentrance check point, complete with an armed guard, who I \naffectionately refer to as ``check point Charley,'' the average park \nvisitor is then confined to the narrow corridor of one gravel roadway, \nthe length of which is less than a round trip from Washington to \nBaltimore.\n  I find this whole concept to be a fraud on the park visitor. The \nvisitor in this case is bused 90 miles down a dusty road and then \nafforded the opportunity to return to ``check point Charley'' by \nexactly the same route. Thankfully, the NPS does not charge extra for \nthis double look at the resource.\n  From a park management standpoint it makes little sense to crowd \nevery visitor onto one length of existing roadway in a 6-million-acre \npark. The Park Service is now complaining that visitors are causing \nsome compaction of soils along the side of the existing corridor. Now \nthat is what I call a scientific discovery. It proves that there is \nsome intelligent life within the Service. Someone has actually noticed \nthat if you confine most of your visitors to a single pathway, \neventually some soil compaction will take place. Mr. President, great \nstrides are being taken here. Unfortunately, we are going the wrong \nway.\n  There is little movement to accommodate the increasing number of park \nvisitors, only warnings that increased visitation will damage every \nsinge acre of the 6-million-acre park.\n  Mr. President, from the very beginning, the national park equation \nincluded the accommodation of visitors. It is apparent that visitors \nare becoming less important in the park management scheme. It is high \ntime that we balance the national park equation again by reestablishing \nvisitors as important and desirable components of the system.\n  Mr. President, my amendment will assist the National Park Service in \nfulfilling their mandate: it will encourage the accommodation of park \nvisitors. When enacted, my amendment would direct the Service to \naccomplish a feasibility study on a second access road into Denali \nNational Park using a northern route which would carefully avoid any \ndesignated wilderness and would have little impact on the environment.\n  Mr. President, in all fairness, the National Park Service is looking \nat a southern location from which visitors will at least be able to see \nthe mountain. The proposal calls for a visitors' site to be located on \nadjacent State land. But you may be certain that the road will stop at \nthe park boundary. God forbid that anyone would let additional park \nvisitors actually visit a park.\n  The visitor needs access, moreover, the visitors want access. Mr. \nPresident, imagine how disappointed you and your family would be, if \nafter you had traveled thousands of miles to see the great vistas of \nDenali and Mount McKinley, ``check point Charley'' told you there was \nno room in the 6-million-acre park. I doubt that you would be \noverjoyed. Last year it happened to 51 percent of the visitors.\n  Mr. President, it is far more intelligent to provide additional \naccess by a well planned alternative route than to continue turning \naway thousands of visitors and managing the rest in a way that results \nin damage to Denali's resources.\n  This amendment does not construct a highway, it only studies an \nalternative solution to accommodate park visitors. My amendment would \nrequire the National Park Service to complete a feasibility study, \nwithin available park funds.\n  The study would evaluate current proposals for a northern access \nroute. It would ensure that the resource impacts from any plan to \ncreate a new access route are evaluated with accurate information and \nin a process that considers park values, visitor needs, a full \n\n[[Page S12023]]\nrange of alternatives, the viewpoints of all interested parties, \nincluding the tourist industry and the State of Alaska, and potential \nneeds for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act.\n  The study would also address the time required for development and \nall associated costs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n                           amendment no. 2322\n\n(Purpose: Within existing park funds to provide design and construction \ndrawings for the replacement of buildings accidentally destroyed by the \n             National Park Service, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following \n     section:\n       Sec.   . Consistent with existing law and policy, the \n     National Park Service shall, within the funds provided by \n     this Act, at the request of the University of Alaska \n     Fairbanks, enter into negotiations regarding a memorandum of \n     understanding for the continued use of the Stampede Creek \n     Mine property consistent with the length and terms of prior \n     memoranda of understanding between the National Park Service \n     and the University of Alaska Fairbanks: Provided, That within \n     the funds provided, the National Park Service shall undertake \n     an assessment of damage and provide the appropriate \n     committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, no \n     later than May 1, 1996, cost estimates for the reconstruction \n     of those facilities and equipment which were damaged or \n     destroyed as a result of the incident that occurred on April \n     30, 1987 at Stampede Creek within the boundaries of Denali \n     National Park and Preserve: Provided further, That the \n     National Park Service shall work with the University of \n     Alaska Fairbanks to winterize equipment and materials, \n     located on the Stampede Creek mine property in Denali \n     National Park, exposed to the environment as a result of the \n     April 30, 1987 incident.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in 1987 an explosion rocked a mine in a \nremote region of Denali National Park and Preserve.\n  Newspaper reports were sketchy; few individuals could have read \nbetween the lines to realize that a man's life work was involved, that \nthe U.S. Army, the University of Alaska, and the National Park Service \nwere interested parties, and that no one was willing to accept blame.\n  Mr. President, the very short version of this story is that the \nNational Park Service illegally took private property, and blew it up \nand in the process violated a number of environmental laws as well as \nthe provisions of the Historic Preservation Act.\n  The Stampede Creek mine is 115 air miles southwest of Fairbanks, \nlocated in the Kantishna Hills region of Denali National Park and \nPreserve.\n  As early as 1915, the site was mined for antimony, a high-priced \nmetal used for alloys and medicine. In 1942, Earl R. Pilgrim purchased \nthe claims and under his hands-on direction the mine continued to \noperate and ship antimony until 1972. At one time, the mine was the \nsecond largest producer of antimony in the United States.\n  Located in an isolated section of the park preserve, The Stampede \nmine was found to be eligible for listing on the National Register of \nHistoric Places on June 20, 1989. Today the mine site contains, or \nexcuse me, did contain several historic structures. The site is rich in \nequipment, machinery, tools, and the myriad objects that make up the \nstuff of a mining camp. Many of these items are unique to Pilgrim's \noperation and reflect his own inventiveness and mechanical skills.\n  In 1979, Stampede Mines LTD. entered into negotiations with the \nNational Park Service and the University of Alaska. As a result of \nthose negotiations the mining company made a donation to the National \nPark Service of the surface rights including road access from the \nairstrip, the historic buildings, water rights, and stream banks.\n  It was thought at the time that the National Park Service possessed \nthe wherewithal to better maintain and protect the valuable historic \nstructures. Unfortunately, history would record that there was little \nmerit to this line of thinking.\n  At the same time, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, School of \nMineral Engineering was donated all the mineral rights, mining \nequipment and fixtures with mineral development restrictions for the \neducation of students.\n  Mr. President, the mineral development restrictions included \nprovisions which allowed for only educational use of the mineral \nestate. No commercial mining would be allowed, only small-scale \neducational mining, and even though the buildings, roads, trails, and \nair strip were owned by the Park Service, the university would be \nresponsible for maintaining them.\n  The school of Mineral Engineering was most pleased with the \narrangement and looked forward to providing their mining students a \nunique opportunity to learn first hand about past and present day \nmining operations and equipment. Given the chance, they would like the \nopportunity to conduct such an educational program in the future.\n  The educational program is consistent with the intent of the \nuniversity's receipt of the property. The School of Mineral Engineering \nhas developed a meaningful program that provides instruction-\ninvestigation about environmentally sound mineral exploration and \nmining techniques in a sensitive natural environment--as well as \nstudying the geology, biology, and ecology of the area, and studying \nthe historical aspects of Mr. Pilgrim's mine.\n  The program has already helped the mineral industry develop methods \nto explore for and develop minerals on lands located in sensitive areas \nthroughout Alaska, even on land controlled by the Department of the \nInterior.\n  Mr. President, it was to be an absolute win for the National Park \nService and a win in the field of education for the university. No one \nin their worst nightmares, would have believed that the National Park \nService could blow this opportunity.\n  During 1986 to 1987 National Park Service personnel conducted field \ninspections of old mining sites located on their lands for the purposes \nof identifying potentially contaminated sites and hazardous conditions.\n  Toward the end of July 1986, the Stampede Creek site was examined. \nThe inspectors recommended immediate action to examine the safety of \nold blasting caps and chemicals at the site. Before taking any action, \nthe inspectors recommended that the ownership issue be resolved. In \nother words, someone actually considered private property. The matter \nwas treated as serious, but not as an emergency or life-threatening \nsituation. Nothing further occurred for 8 months.\n  Subsequently, National Park Service personnel and members of the U.S. \nArmy's Explosive Ordinance Detonation Team arrived, unannounced, at the \nStampede Mine site and on April 30, 1987 changed the configuration of \nthe mine site and its historic structures.\n  Mr. President, they moved 4,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate--private \nproperty of the University--and placed it on top of the still frozen \nStampede Creek. Ammonium nitrate may sound dangerous but in its \npackaged state it is nothing more than common fertilizer.\n  They piled 4,000 pounds of fertilizer on top of the creek and added \nseveral half gallon bottles of acid--more private property which they \nretrieved from the assay lab. Finally they added 45 points of high \nexplosives--set the charge and left the area.\n  When the smoke cleared and all of the debris fell back to Earth, they \nfound the explosion left a crater 28 feet wide and 8 feet deep in the \ncreek. There was also a noticeable change in the mining site.\n  Mr. President, this is a picture of the Stampede Mine site prior to \nthe arrival of the National Park Service. This is a picture of the mill \nupon their return to see if they had gotten rid of the fertilizer and \nchemicals.\n  In addition to the mine entrance and mill, damage occurred to other \nbuildings, trees, landscape, and stream bed. The bombing also blew up a \n5,000 ton tailings pile which, by using USGS records for the current \nprice of metals, would be worth approximately $600,000 in place. \nUnfortunately the heavy metals of the tailings pile were last seen \nmoving from the site and being scattered throughout the environment by \nthe force of the blast.\n  One of the most telling reports concerning this debacle is from the \nU.S. Army incident report No. 176-23-87 which stated that the NPS \npersonnel were aware that detonation would result in damage to the \nsurrounding buildings and according to Sergeant Seutter ``at no time \nwas it relayed to me that damage--was unacceptable.''\n  Mr. President, violations of the law are clear. There are violations \nof the \n\n[[Page S12024]]\nClean Water Act, the Historic Preservation Act, Section 404 of the \nClean Water Act involving wetlands, not to mention the taking and \ndestruction of private property.\n  Further, since the explosion, approximately $2 million worth of \nmining equipment--some historic--has been damaged or destroyed due to \nexposure to inclement weather and the normal Alaska freeze and thaw \ncycles.\n  What I find equally outrageous is the fact that no one from the \nNational Park Service has said ``I am sorry.''\n  Mr. President, my amendment does not attempt to rectify all the wrong \nthat has been done. My amendment would direct the Park Service to issue \na 10 year special use permit to the University of Alaska so that they \nmay continue their worthwhile education program with some assurance of \nprogram continuity and to insure that the $20,000 they have invested \nand other monies they continue to invest will not be lost or be spent \nin vain.\n  My amendment also directs the Park Service, within appropriated park \nfunds, to provide appropriate committees with cost estimates for the \nrepair and or restoration of buildings and equipment damaged or \ndestroyed by the National Park Service in this unfortunate incident, \nand to provide temporary shelter on site for any equipment and \nmaterials now exposed to the weather on the site.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n                           amendment no. 2323\n\n (Purpose: An amendment in regard to the Department of Energy Code and \n                           Standards Program)\n       On page 128, strike section 320, and insert the following: \n     ``None of the funds made available in this Act shall be used \n     by the Department of Energy in implementing the Codes and \n     Standards Program to propose, issue, or prescribe any new or \n     amended standard: Provided, That this section shall expire on \n     September 30, 1996: Provided, That nothing in this section \n     shall preclude the Federal Government from promulgating rules \n     concerning energy efficiency standards for the construction \n     of new federally owned commercial and residential \n     buildings.''.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, just a couple weeks ago on this floor, \nwe had an extensive debate on the issue of regulatory reform. A lot of \namendments were offered, a lot of work was done, and a great many \nspeeches were delivered--but in the end, nothing was delivered to the \nAmerican people.\n  It became clear that the only regulatory reform that would be allowed \nto pass would be something so watered down that it was hardly worth \npassing at all. And the leadership wisely decided to pull the bill \ndown.\n  Because of that, however, Americans today remain vulnerable to \noverzealous, overreaching Federal regulators. Consumers, businesses, \nand volunteer organizations are the easy prey of aggressive \nbureaucrats--who take the laws that we pass and twist them into absurd, \nextreme restrictions that impact the lives of everyday Americans.\n  The amendment I am offering today addresses one such instance of \noverreaching regulation. It is, if you will, a minor skirmish in the \nregulatory reform war. But in the balance are consumers' pocketbooks, \nas well as a huge number of jobs--in my State, and in many others as \nwell.\n  Specifically, my amendment would put a 1-year moratorium on so-called \nenergy efficiency regulations that the Department of Energy is \npreparing to issue under its Codes and Standards Program.\n  Now, let me make it very clear that my amendment is not hostile to \nthe laudable goal of energy efficiency. Nor is it intended to shut down \nthe regulatory process under DOE's Codes and Standards Program. No one \ndisputes the fact the energy efficiency is important; or that DOE has \nplayed a key role in encouraging companies and products to be more \nenergy efficient.\n  Nevertheless, as has happened all too often in the regulatory arena, \nDOE is on the brink of adopting new rules that would have tremendously \nadverse consequences on consumers and workers alike.\n  My amendment does not repeal the proposed regulations. Nor does it \naffect the enforcement of any existing energy efficiency regulations. \nWhat it does is impose a 1-year moratorium on the DOE ability to \npropose, issue or prescribe any new regulations under the Codes and \nStandards Program, so that both their impact and their relative benefit \ncan be better assessed.\n  I want to be quite clear on this point.\n  My amendment would not affect energy efficiency labeling of products. \nConsumers could continue to make well-informed choices about the \nrelative energy consumption of various household appliances.\n  Further, DOE could continue to test products and measure their energy \nefficiency. All my amendment does is call a timeout in the middle of a \nregulatory process that is about to become horrendously burdensome for \nthousands of workers and millions of consumers.\n  If we do not pass this amendment, and the proposed DOE regulations \nare adopted, consumers will see their range of choices sharply \nlimited--almost to the point of a legalized monopoly--and workers could \nsee their plants shut down, almost overnight.\n  I should point out that the bill before us recognizes the seriousness \nof this problem by including a moratorium on enforcement of these \nregulations--but just for one product alone: fluorescent lamp ballasts. \nI agree that these regulations pose a serious threat to fluorescent \nlamp ballasts, but the problem is clearly much broader than that.\n  The new standards proposed by DOE would affect refrigerators, air-\nconditioning units, water heaters, pool heaters, and mobile home \nfurnaces. Other products, like freezers, washing machines, clothes \ndryers, dishwashers, and electric motors, could also be hit hard by DOE \nregulations that are now under consideration.\n  Companies that make these basic household appliances are facing \nenormous costs because of the new standards. Manufacturing processes \nand product designs will have to be drastically altered. In some cases, \nentire product lines will simply be abandoned, and the employees who \nmake them will be dumped out on the streets.\n  Moreover, consumers who rely on these kinds of basic household \nappliances will face a drastic reduction in choice, along with steep \nincreases in price, as manufacturers scramble to meet the new standards \ncoming out of Washington.\n  This is an all-too-common tale of regulation gone wild: overzealous \nbureaucrats, proposing pie-in-the-sky restrictions, which inflict heavy \ncosts on American families who struggle to make ends meet.\n  Once again, the Federal regulatory apparatus is poised to disrupt a \nbroad range of industries, and pass the costs on to middle-class \nconsumers.\n  My amendment would give Congress the breathing room it needs to study \nthe regulations, analyze their impact, and suggest alternatives that \nmeet the goal of energy efficiency without threatening jobs or \nratcheting up the price tag for basic household appliances.\n  I am pleased that the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, Senator Murkowski, has endorsed in a letter the approach \ntaken by my amendment. In my view, the Energy Committee is best \nequipped to review the matter and recommend changes that are needed. I \nask unanimous consent that Senator Murkowski's letter on this subject \nbe made part of the record.\n  I would also like to point out that the House, by a vote of 261 to \n165, approved language that is virtually identical to what I am \nproposing now.\n  But ultimately, what matters to me is not what the House did or \nanything else: it is what the DOE regulations will do to thousands of \nemployees in my home State, many of whom will lose their jobs at some \npoint because of some bureaucratic decision made in Washington.\n  For example, the General Electric plant in Louisville is the largest \nsingle-site employer in my State.\n  I'm proud to say that the hard-working employees at the G.E. plant \nturn out some of the highest quality home appliances in the world. In \nfact, it's likely that just about everyone in this body--and most \neveryone watching C-SPAN today--has at one point or another owned a \nhigh quality home appliance that was made at G.E. in Louisville.\n  What do these pending Federal regulations mean to the workers at the \nG.E. plant?\n  The new energy efficiency standards--just for refrigerators--will \ncost \n\n[[Page S12025]]\nthe company $187 million, and that's only in the short term.\n  Possible new standards for clothes washers could force G.E. to shut \ndown a brandnew $100 million facility, and hand out pink slips to up to \n2,000 employees who work there.\n  Here we're trying to encourage investment and job creation--and these \nregulations could force a Kentucky plant to close down a state-of-the-\nart manufacturing operation and let go of thousands of employees.\n  All because some bureaucrats in Washington are designing their \nperfect world for the rest of the country to follow.\n  Similar effects will be felt by other players in the home appliance \nindustry, across the country. Ask the workers in your State who \nmanufacture home appliances. They will tell you that these regulations \nare economic poison in their industry.\n  In fact, there's only one manufacturer who supports these \nregulations; and not surprisingly, that one manufacturer is uniquely \npositioned to benefit from the regulations that this amendment seeks to \ndelay.\n  It so happens that this one manufacturer already holds a 50-percent \nshare in the clothes washer market.\n  But apparently, that is not enough. So what this one company hopes to \ndo is use the Federal regulatory system to drive its competitors out of \nbusiness.\n  It conveniently turns out that this company is the only one that \nmakes a certain kind of clothes washer which some Federal bureaucrat \nlikes. All other companies will have to radically change the way they \nmake clothes washers, just to stay in the game.\n  Mr. President, Federal regulators should not be in the business of \npicking winners and losers in the clothes washer industry.\n  Buyers of clothes washers should not have their purchasing decisions \nmade for them by Washington bureaucrats.\n  And Congress should not be sanctioning a proposed regulatory \nstructure that in effect creates a legalized monopoly. Don't take my \nword for it; listen to the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust \nEnforcement, Anne Bingaman. She wrote a letter to DOE concerning the \nanticompetitive effect these regulations would be likely to have on the \nmarketplace.\n  In her letter, dated September 16, 1994, Ms. Bingaman said:\n\n       For television sets, fluorescent lamp ballasts, and \n     professional style or high end kitchen ranges, it is the \n     Department's judgment based on the available evidence that \n     significant anticompetitive effects are likely to occur.\n\n  In other words, these regulations are bad news for consumers--for \nAmerican families.\n  The letter from Assistant Attorney General Anne Bingaman goes on to \nwarn DOE of the negative impact this rulemaking would have on market \ncompetition, as well as on individual product lines.\n  Remarkably, DOE did nothing in response to this devastating \nassessment of its proposal.\n In fact, it was not until the House flatly suspended DOE's regulatory \nauthority in this area that the agency finally acted.\n\n  Nevertheless, DOE's response was simply to terminate its rulemaking \non television sets--an obviously weak half measure. None of the other \npending regulations criticized by the Assistant Attorney General were \nsuspended.\n  Mr. President, many appliance manufacturers are facing the second or \nthird round of reregulation by DOE.\n  Each of these new sets of regulations imposes additional costs, which \nare directly paid by hard-working American families.\n  Sometimes, when the regulatory burden is too great, the company just \nabandons the product line altogether, and employees are sent home to \nlook for other jobs.\n  This is no way to regulate. We need a timeout with regard to these \npending regulations, to give Congress the time to take a good, hard \nlook at how DOE has been regulating this segment of our economy.\n  As I said earlier, I have a letter from Senator Murkowski, chairman \nof the Energy Committee, requesting that his committee be given the \nopportunity to evaluate the proposed standards.\n  Let's give the committee that opportunity, and try to restore some \nsanity to the regulatory process--at least in this one instance.\n  In closing, I want to remind everyone that no ground whatsoever would \nbe lost by adopting my amendment. It does not invalidate any current \nenergy efficiency regulations; it does not turn the clock back; it only \nlooks toward the future.\n  The energy efficiency regulatory process has gotten off track, and it \nis time to get it back on the rails--before jobs are lost, competition \nis restricted, and basic consumer products are banned.\n  I want to thank all of my colleagues who have cosponsored this \namendment: Senators Ford, Harkin, Grassley, Murkowski, Lott, Hutchison, \nand Gramm.\n  And I hope we can come together and at least put a 1-year moratorium \non regulations that have gone in a terribly wrong direction.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have cosponsored the McConnell \namendment. The amendment allows the DOE to do the planning work \nnecessary to develop energy efficiency standards. But, it does not \nallow the Department to issue a rule or a notice of proposed \nrulemaking. I am a strong supporter of solid energy standards. But, I \nhave become aware of some real concerns about how the Department of \nEnergy is implementing the law in this area.\n  The Department is supposed to consider the initial and lifetime cost \nof appliances under these standards. And, the Department is supposed to \nconsider the impact of new standards on the manufacturers. But, \napparently, while they may be looking at those questions, DOE is not \ngiving them the weight that I believe they should be given.\n  When we look at a family with $25,000 or $35,000 a year, the cost of \nan extra $200 for an appliance is significant. For someone who needs a \nnew furnace in an old home, if only very high-efficiency furnaces are \navailable, we need to not only look at the cost of the furnace, one \nalso needs to consider the retrofitting costs for the flue that can be \nvery considerable.\n  I am also concerned about a reduction in the number of companies \nmaking various types of appliances. As the cost of adjusting \nmanufacturing plants costs to meet higher energy standards rises, the \nnumber of models of appliances may be reduced. That reduces competition \nand costs existing jobs. But, those costs can be mitigated. There are \nnumerous ways that stronger energy standards can be promulgated in ways \nthat will limit the cost of facility modifications and the effective \nobsolescence of existing facilities. Unfortunately, the models that the \nDepartment uses to attempt to figure out the impact of the effects of \ntheir rules on manufacturers, looks at an average manufacturer. Their\n analysis of the average company may be correct. But, smaller companies \ncan and are very adversely impacted.\n\n  My State of Iowa has a number of quality appliance manufacturers who \nare relatively small compared to those that have the largest market \nshare for specific appliances. They provide quality products and \nalternatives to consumers. They are the major employers in their \ncommunities where they are very good corporate citizens providing \nquality jobs.\n  And, many of them are noted for being leaders in energy-efficiency-\noffering appliances that are well ahead of what the energy-efficiency \nrules require. In spite of their leadership, they could be very \nadversely impacted if their concerns are not considered by new energy \nrules under consideration.\n  Originally, there was a legislative proposal to completely stop work \ntoward improved standards. And, the House did agree with an amendment \nof that type. I had real concerns about that. The revised version of \nthe amendment does allow DOE to do considerable work toward the \ndevelopment of new energy standards. That change allows them to proceed \nafter the coming fiscal year with less than a year's lost time. And, I \nam hopeful that adjustments will be made that will allow us to proceed \nwithout further delay.\n  I hope that my concerns can be addressed during the coming fiscal \nyear through improvements in the authorizing law or through improved \nprocedures at the Department.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor and support \nthe McConnell amendment. This amendment establishes a 1-year moratorium \n\n\n[[Page S12026]]\non new standard-setting rulemakings by the Department of Energy.\n  This amendment is necessary to maintain the competitive nature of the \nU.S. appliance industry, which includes home appliances as well as \nheating and air-conditioning equipment.\n  New energy standards would threaten the viability of several U.S. \nmanufacturers of appliances, including at least four in my State.\n  A 1-year moratorium will allow the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee to review DOE's energy-efficiency standards program to \ndetermine what impacts these standards are having on competition, and \non the consumers of these products.\n  Senator Murkowski, the distinguished chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, has already indicated his support for the moratorium and his \nwillingness to conduct such a review.\n  Mr. President, I will just take a moment to highlight a few of the \neffects that new standard requirements will have on both the industry \nand the American consumer.\n  Energy standards currently exist for all major appliances. For \nexample, manufacturers must meet these standards on such products as \ndishwashers, refrigerators, laundry machines, and heating and air-\nconditioning units.\n  The Department of Energy reviews the standards periodically and most \nproducts are already being considered for their second set of standards \nsince 1990; some face their third set of standards during this period.\n  So these products already operate at a very high level of efficiency. \nIf the DOE continues to increase these standards, many companies will \nbe crippled by the burden of the capital investment necessary to meet \nadditional standards.\n  Furthermore, these companies will be unable to invest in other \nproduct innovations which are absolutely vital for maintaining their \ncompetitiveness, both in the United States and in the global \nmarketplace.\n  If further capital investment is required, it is likely that most of \nthe cost will be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices \nfor appliances.\n  Furthermore, companies will be forced to discontinue certain models \nand brands because they are no longer cost-effective to produce. So \nconsumers will have fewer products to choose from and the products that \nare available will cost more.\n  We need to call a time out, take a step back, and consider whether \nall of this is necessary. This amendment allows Congress the \nopportunity to do just that.\n  Mr. President, it is also important to note exactly what this \namendment will not do. This amendment will not affect existing energy \nstandards in any way. This amendment will not alter the existing energy \nlabeling program, which enables consumers to compare competing brands \nof appliances. And this amendment will not undermine the energy savings \nalready achieved in these products.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this amendment protects the consumer's \nability to purchase energy-efficient appliances at a competitive price.\n  For all these reasons, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n                           amendment no. 2324\n\n(Purpose: To provide funding for cooperative lands fire management and \n  to increase funding for the stewardship incentive program, with an \n                                offset)\n\n       On page 66, lines 3 and 4, strike ``$128,294,000, to remain \n     available until expended, as authorized by law'' and insert \n     ``$136,794,000, to remain available until expended, as \n     authorized by law, of which not less than $16,100,000 shall \n     be made available for cooperative lands fire management and \n     not less than $7,500,000 shall be made available for the \n     stewardship incentive program''.\n       On page 66, line 15, strike ``$1,256,043,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,247,543,000''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have an amendment that I would like to \nintroduce for myself and Senators Burns, Craig, Jeffords, Murray, \nLautenberg, Bond, McConnell, Lieberman, Snowe, and Cohen. It has the \nsupport of many Senators from both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed by the move to eliminate one of the \nfew financial incentives we have to help private landowners do the \nright thing for conservation--the Stewardship Incentives Program.\n  The Stewardship Incentives Program was created in the 1990 farm bill \nwith broad bipartisan support to help forest owners improve wildlife \nhabitat, protect water quality, improve forest management, and develop \nrecreation opportunities.\n  Every Endangered Species Reform Act being considered by this Congress \nincludes language to establish a program like the Stewardship \nIncentives Program. We need to put our money where our mouth is. If we \nare serious about moving from a regulatory conservation approach to a \nvoluntary approach, we have to fund the voluntary programs we have on \nthe books.\n  We know that landowners cannot always pay their property taxes by \nmanaging their land specially for wildlife and water quality. The \nStewardship Incentives Program helps private landowners do the right \nthing with a nonregulatory, cost-incentive, State-grant program.\n  The amendment also includes funding for volunteer fire departments \nwhich are essential organizations to rural communities throughout the \ncountry. These organizations are often the first to respond to common \nkitchen fires and dangerous forest fires.\n  This amendment is supported by the National Association of State \nForesters, the Izaak Walton League, the National Association of \nConservation Districts, The Nature Conservancy, the Northern Forest \nAlliance, the American Forest & Paper Association, the International \nAssociation of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, the National Volunteer Fire \nCouncil, and many others.\n  Mr. President, this amendment has broad support on both sides of the \naisle and broad support across the entire natural resource community. \nMy staff has worked with the committee staff and the Forest Service to \nidentify offsets. I hope the Senate can accept this amendment \nexpeditiously given its broad base of support.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment offered by my colleague from Vermont. The amendment restores \nfunding for the Forestry Stewardship Incentives Program [SIP]. \nLandowners who sign up for the Forest Stewardship Program are often new \nto the practice of forest management, the cost-share components assists \nthem in making land more productive more rapidly.\n  The SIP was designed to assist nonindustrial private landowners in \nimplementing good management practices. Recent surveys indicate over 9 \nmillion private nonindustrial landowners; by contrast, the Nation has \nonly over 2 million farmers. In Kentucky, we have over 300,000 private \nlandowners who have over 10.9 million acres of forest land to manage.\n  This amendment preserves one of the only nonregulatory Federal \nprograms in existence for nonindustrial private forest landowners.\n  The Kentucky Stewardship Incentive Program is a very successful \nprogram. It is a cooperative effort of Kentucky's environmental \ncommunity. The cost share assistance helps private landowners in \nimplementing a forest stewardship plan on rural land with existing tree \ncover and other lands including cropland, pasture land, surface mined \nland.\n  The Kentucky Stewardship Incentive Program:\n  Encourages private forest landowners to manage their forest lands for \neconomic, environmental, and social benefits;\n  Complements and expands other forestry assistance programs;\n  Gives priority to tree planting, tree maintenance, and tree \nimprovement practices;\n  Increases the quality and quantity of Kentucky's timber resources, \nand\n  Maintains and improves the habitat for a diverse mixture of native \nwildlife.\n  This is an extremely beneficial program that helps private forest \nlandowners provide better land management and improve our natural \nresources.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments.\n  The amendments (No. 2311 through 2324) were agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the Department of \nInterior and related agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 1996.\n  I am concerned about the funding provided for Indian programs and \nhave offered an amendment to restore $200 million for important Indian \nprograms.\n  The Senate-reported bill provides $12 billion in new budget authority \n[BA] and $8.2 billion in new outlays to fund the programs of the \nDepartment of Interior, the U.S. Forest Service, Department of Energy \nfossil energy and energy conservation programs, and programs related to \nthe arts and museum services.\n  All the funding in this bill is nondefense spending. This \nsubcommittee received no allocation under the crime reduction trust \nfund.\n  When outlays from prior-year appropriations and other adjustments are \ntaken into account, the Senate-reported bill totals $12.2 billion in BA \nand $13.2 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1996.\n  The subcommittee is essentially at its 602(b) allocation in BA and \n$6.5 million below in outlays.\n  The Senate-reported bill is $1.8 billion in BA and $1 billion in \noutlays below the President's budget request for these programs.\n  It is $68.5 million in BA above the House-passed bill, and $2.2 \nmillion in outlays below the House-passed bill. The Senate bill is $1.9 \nbillion in BA and $0.8 billion in outlays below the 1995 level.\n  I appreciate the subcommittee's support for a number of ongoing \nprojects and programs important to my home State of New Mexico as it \nhas worked to keep the bill within its allocation.\n  I urge the adoption of the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent the 1996 spending totals be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       INTERIOR SUBCOMMITTEE SPENDING TOTALS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL      \n               [Fiscal year 1996, in millions of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      Budget            \n                                                    authority   Outlays \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed......................................        146      5,001\n  H.R. 1977, as reported to the Senate............     11,977      8,166\n  Scorekeeping adjustment.........................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n    Subtotal nondefense discretionary.............     12,123     13,168\n                                                   =====================\nMandatory:                                                              \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed......................................  .........         24\n  H.R. 1977, as reported to the Senate............         59         25\n  Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                         \n   Budget Resolution assumptions..................          6          6\n                                                   ---------------------\n    Subtotal mandatory............................         65         55\n                                                   =====================\n    Adjusted bill total...........................     12,188     13,223\n                                                   =====================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n  Defense discretionary...........................  .........  .........\n\n[[Page S12028]]\n                                                                        \n  Nondefense discretionary........................     12,123     13,174\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund..............  .........  .........\n  Mandatory.......................................         65         55\n                                                   ---------------------\n    Total allocation..............................     12,188     13,229\n                                                   =====================\nAdjusted bill total completed to Senate                                 \n Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                        \n  Defense discretionary...........................  .........  .........\n  Nondefense discretionary........................         -0         -6\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund..............  .........  .........\n  Mandatory.......................................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n    Total allocation..............................         -0         -6\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

As the Senator from Washington is aware, the committee has \nrecommended $21,953,000 for advanced research and technology \ndevelopment from the Department of Energy fossil energy research and \ndevelopment account.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. As the Senator may know, there is an existing university-\nindustry consortium, known as the Carbon Products Consortium, \nconducting ongoing efforts in these areas. Through these efforts, this \nconsortium has developed an extensive foundation of background \nknowledge in these technologies. This consortium concentrates on the \nnon-fuel uses of coal to produce coal-derived carbon materials. The \nearly success of this consortium is encouraging, and the dollar-for-\ndollar cost sharing by the industrial partners shows their commitment \nto this work, and it is important that we continue developing these \nnew, environmentally benign technologies from non-petroleum feedstocks.\n  Does the Senator agree that funding for the ongoing efforts of this \nconsortium, due to its knowledge and experience in these matters, \nshould be given priority consideration for a portion of this funding?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, I agree that the Carbon Products Consortium should \nbe given priority consideration for funding from this account.\n     fossil energy research\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I note that Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd are on the \nfloor. I would like to ask them a question about fossil energy research \nand development. It is my understanding that, within this account, the \nSenators have agreed to shift $1,405,000 from fossil energy \nenvironmental restoration into cooperative research and development. Is \nis correct to say that the chairman has agreed to his shift in funding?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator's understanding is correct. The majority has \nagreed to this adjustment. Let me clarify that this does not increase \nthe bill's overall appropriation, nor does it increase the \nappropriation for fossil energy research and development. It is merely \na shift of funds from one account to another.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would also like to indicate to the chairman and ranking \nmember of the subcommittee my interest in this issue. I am pleased to \nhear of the chairman's intention. Would the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Byrd, tell us whether he agrees with Senator \nGorton on this issue?\n  Mr. BYRD. I do agree with the chairman of the subcommittee. This will \nallow the cooperative research and development program to continue at \nits present level of funding. This increase is to be divided equally \nbetween WRI and UNDEERC.\n  Mr. DORGAN. As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, I believe the work carried out under the cooperative \nresearch and development program is extremely important and is \nessential to meeting our country's energy needs. I am pleased with this \nshift in funding.\n     oil technology research\n  Mr. NICKLES. I note that the full committee took action on the \nDepartment of the Interior and related agencies appropriations bill, \nfiscal year 1996 which reallocated funding under oil technology \nresearch. This reallocation significantly reduced funding for \nprocessing research and downstream operations, particularly impacting \npollution prevention and environmental compliance programs. While the \nHouse bill cuts pollution prevention by $900,000 the Senate \nsubcommittee reduction of $1.8 million was amended to a cut of $5.3 \nmillion. Environmental compliance was also reduced from the \nsubcommittee reduction of $2.18 million to the amended reduction of \n$2.67 million. The House bill cut environmental compliance by $1.3 \nmillion.\n  The Senate bill results in a negative impact on the processing \nresearch and downstream operations fossil energy programs, and \nrepresents a vast disparity between the House and Senate allocations. I \ntherefore appeal to the Senator from Washington to address this \nimbalance in conference and to seek funding more closely in line with \nthe House funding.\n  Mr. GORTON. I recognize and appreciate the concern of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. While budget constraints necessarily entail reduced \nfunding of nearly all programs, I recognize the importance of pollution \nprevention and environmental compliance, and will endeavor to address \nthe Senator from Oklahoma's concerns for funding of these programs in \nthe conference committee.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the distinguished Senator from Washington.\n                   midewin national tallgrass prairie\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, as we consider the fiscal year 1996 \nInterior and related agencies appropriations bill, I would like to call \nattention to a very important project for my State of Illinois, the \nMidewin National Tallgrass Prairie. The House provided $400,000 for the \nForest Service to continue the development of a plan for preserving and \nmanaging the former Joliet Arsenal property in Illinois as a potential \nnational tallgrass prairie. These funds were not included by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, and I would like to take a moment to share \nwith my colleagues the reasons why this project should receive funding.\n  Earlier this year, my distinguished senior colleague from Illinois, \nSenator Simon, and I introduced S. 449, the Illinois Land Conservation \nAct. This bill transfers roughly 19,000 acres of land from the former \nJoliet Army ammunition plant to the Forest Service in order to \nestablish a national grasslands. Our bill also turns over 900 acres to \nthe Veterans Administration for a new national veterans cemetery, and \nconverts over 3,400 acres of former munitions production areas at the \narsenal to a variety of local purposes.\n  Illinois is known as the Prairie State. This name commemorates an \nearlier Illinois, a land of rolling prairies, butterflies, wildlife, \nand pioneers seeking out new lands to settle. At one time, more than \n43,000 square miles of prairie existed in Illinois.\n  Over the course of 175 years, however, development has crept over \nthese open lands. Today, only 0.01 percent of original prairie is left. \nLittle evidence remains of, in the words of Charles Chamberlain, the \nauthor of the Illinois State song, this ``Wilderness of Prairies.''\n  The Illinois Land Conservation Act, once enacted, will give Illinois \na rare opportunity to preserve one of its last remaining areas of \nnatural prairie. It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance to set aside such a \nlarge, undeveloped tract of property for environmental and recreational \npurposes. In a sense, S. 449 helps to protect a slice of ecological \nhistory, and in doing so, creates a legacy for future generations of \nIllinoisans to study and enjoy.\n  S. 449 was recently incorporated into S. 1026, the fiscal year 1996 \nDefense Authorization bill, and we are hopeful that these provisions \nwill be passed by Congress soon. In the meantime, we are working with \nthe Forest Service to ensure that adequate funding is available to \ncarry out this project.\n  It is for that reason that I ask that the committee consider language \nin the conference committee report which recognizes that the \nauthorization of the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie is nearing \nfinal passage by Congress, and that upon enactment, the Forest Service \nconsider the need for a reprogramming request in order to proceed with \nthe plan for preserving and managing the former arsenal property.\n  The Illinois Land Conservation Act is based upon a plan that has been \ncarefully crafted by key representatives of the local community who \nhave worked closely with Federal agencies and the State of Illinois. It \ndeserves to move forward quickly, and I urge favorable consideration of \nthis request.\n\n[[Page S12029]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Illinois for her comments \nregarding the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie planned for Illinois. \nI can assure the distinguished Senator that we will do all that we can \nto assist her in including her recommendation when this bill goes to \nconference.\n                         national trails system\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, in previous years, the report accompanying \nthe Interior appropriations bill has stressed the importance of funding \nfor the National Trails System within the National Park Service budget. \nAlthough no such language is included in the fiscal year 1996 report, \nwould the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee agree that the National Park Service should \ncontinue to place a high level of importance on funding for the \nNational Trails System?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I agree. Further, I would state that it is my \nintention, as a manager of this fiscal year 1996 Interior \nappropriations bill, that the National Park Service should seek to fund \nthe National Trails System as close as possible to the fiscal year 1995 \nlevels, given the budget constraints facing the committee in fiscal \nyear 1996. I would also ask my colleague from Washington, Senator \nGorton, the chairman of the Interior Appropriations Committee, if he \nagrees with this statement.\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, I concur, and thank the Senators for pointing out \nthe importance of providing adequate funding for the National Trails \nSystem.\n\n\n                       inpatient health facility\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nchairman for assistance in dealing with an issue that is very important \nto me and to the Indian people in my State of Nebraska. The Indian \nHealth Service has determined that there is a need for an inpatient \nhealth facility to serve the Indian people in eastern Nebraska. The \nexisting facility at the Winnebago Reservation is old, dilapidated, and \nneeds to be replaced. The tribes in the area have worked with the IHS \nfor 8 years to reach the point where we are now. The 103d Congress \nappropriated funds for planning and design of the new hospital and that \nprocess is fully underway. A site has been selected for the new \nfacility with the agreement of the tribes and the IHS has begun the \ndesign phase. Unfortunately, the Omaha Tribe broke off negotiations \nwith the Winnebago Tribe on matters related to the future construction \nand management of the hospital; the reasons for this action are not \nentirely clear. While this division occurred early in July, efforts are \nunderway to bring closure to whatever differences remain. In the \nmeantime, unfortunately, language was included in the report on H.R. \n1977 that would direct the reprogramming by IHS of the current year \nfunds for the hospital, about $1.6 million. I believe this action is \npremature and respectfully ask the chairman to consider eliminating the \nreprogramming in conference with the House.\n  Mr. GORTON. I understand the Senator's concern and agree to consider \ndeletion of the language in conference. In the meantime, I hope the \nSenator will continue to work with the IHS and the tribes to move \nforward on this project. Facility construction dollars are extremely \nscarce in the current fiscal climate and there are many worthy projects \nawaiting funding that have the unqualified support of local tribes. \nWith this in mind, I will be happy to revisit this issue in conference.\n  Mr. KERREY. The procedure that my colleague has outlined is \nacceptable and I thank him for his courtesy in this matter.\n\n\n                         doe's retrofit program\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, at this time I would like to enter into \na colloquy with the managers of this appropriations measure regarding \nfunding for the Department of Energy's retrofit program and interagency \nagreement with the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n  The buildings retrofit program within the Department of Energy's \nOffice of Buildings Technology is currently undertaking an important \ninitiative to save American taxpayers millions of dollars. The \ninitiative, created 4 years ago under an agreement between the \nDepartment of Energy and the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, works to reduce energy use at many of our Nation's public \nassisted housing developments. To cut off funding for this important \nprogram at this point would put to an end significant progress that has \nbeen made to date in reducing energy use in publicly funded low-income \nhousing.\n  Would the managers of this legislation support the following request?\n  That within available funds in the Department of Energy's buildings \nprograms, the Department of Energy be allowed to reprogram up to $3 \nmillion to continue implementation of the interagency agreement with \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development for public assisted \nhousing and other low-income housing initiatives.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would not object to this proposal.\n  Mr. BYRD. I would not object to this proposal.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the managers of this legislation for their \nassistance with this important matter.\n                             noxious weeds\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to discuss an issue with my \ngood friend from Washington, the distinguished chairman of the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Gorton, that is of the utmost \nimportance to many western public lands States.\n  Last year, I raised the issue of the widespread infestation of \nnoxious weeds on public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management \n[BLM] located throughout the West and in Utah specifically. Many of \nUtah's lands were suffering from the presence of various kinds of \nnoxious weeds, which is why I requested funding last year for the \nRichfield BLM District office in west central Utah to be utilized \nthroughout the district to address the infestation. The total amount \nappropriated to the Richfield District was $100,000. I appreciated the \nsubcommittee's recognition of this problem and its efforts to assist \nthis outbreak on acreage highly visited by the public.\n  This year, the story is basically the same. These lands, as well as \nother lands, are again infested with noxious weeds. They are ravaging \nlands that are critical to the agricultural industry of Utah and \nplaying havoc with those who utilize BLM lands for recreational \npurposes. As anyone who represents a public lands State knows, once \nthese weeds take hold of an acre of land, it is easy for them to spread \nto every acre that surrounds them, even if that surrounding land is \nprivate or State. Noxious weeds know no boundaries; and, therefore we \nmust address them in every locale to protect the overall ecology and \nhealth of all lands. In my State, the Utah Department of Natural \nResources is attempting to fight the noxious weed problem on State \nlands. So, I believe it behooves this body to provide funding to our \nvarious public land agencies, especially the BLM, to address this \nproblem on our public lands.\n  It is my understanding that this year's Interior appropriations bill \nprovides funding to the BLM for this year's noxious weed problem. Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. If my colleague will yield, the fiscal year 1996 \nDepartment of the Interior appropriations bill provides $1.2 million to \nthe BLM for noxious weed management. This funding is a part of the \nagency's range management account. My colleague will be pleased to know \nthat the subcommittee recognizes the existing noxious weed problem \nplaguing Utah and directs $261,000 of the total account to the Utah \nState BLM Office to combat this problem. Like my colleague from Utah, I \nhope these funds will assist to properly address the noxious weed \nproblem in our public lands States like Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague for that clarification. I share his \nhope that we can finally gain control of our noxious weed situation, \nand I appreciate his attention to this situation in my State of Utah.\n               office of surface mining and public roads\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to raise an issue with the \nchairman of the Interior Subcommittee, Senator Gorton, regarding the \nOffice of Surface Mining [OSM] and its regulation of public roads. I am \nespecially interested in the application of these regulations in States \nlike Utah that have received a delegation of primacy for implementing \nthe coal regulatory program pursuant to a State program. These \nregulations have, for several years, plagued public land States like \n\n[[Page S12030]]\nUtah that have hundreds of miles of public roads located near surface \nmining operations. I wish to engage the chairman in a brief discussion \non this critical matter.\n  Mr. GORTON. I understand this situation impacts several other Western \nStates with an equivalent amount of public roads and significant \nsurface mining activities.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague. There has been a difference of \nopinion between OSM and the Utah State Division of Oil, Gas and Mining \n[UDOGM] as to permitting of public roads as a part of mining \noperations. OSM's regulation of the Surface Mining Control and \nReclamation Act of 1977 [SMCRA] has led to differences of opinion on \nwhat constitutes a road and affected area, among other things, and has \nled to a number of Federal lawsuits and a series of unsuccessful \nrulemaking attempts since 1983. Clearly, there is little guidance in \nSMCRA on this issue. A literal interpretation of the act's wording \nwould bring Interstate 70 and most of the State, county, and Forest \nService roads located in central Utah under the Utah's regulatory \nprogram. Hopefully, no one is seriously suggesting that UDOGM, a \ndivision of the Utah State Department of Natural Resources, require the \npermitting of the interstate. The problem is that neither the Federal \nnor Utah regulatory programs provide any clear guidance as to where the \njurisdictional line must be drawn.\n  Although Utah's situation with regard to roads is no different from \nthat of other States, this issue has been a recurring problem between \nUtah and OSM. Several meetings have been held in recent months, even \nwith the Director of OSM, to address this situation. And, most \nrecently, OSM agreed to a clarification of Utah's policy on road \npermitting that maintains the State's program intact, which I want to \nbring to my colleagues' attention. In regard to the Utah coal \nregulatory program, OSM has agreed that, under several basic criteria, \nthe permitting of a public road would not be required. These criteria \nindicate that a public road involved in coal mining activities may not \nbe required to be permitted if: First, it was properly acquired by a \ngovernmental entity, second, it was maintained with public funds or in \nexchange for publicly levied taxes or fees, third, it was constructed \nin a manner similar to other public roads of the same classification, \nand fourth, the impacts of mining are not significant in relation to \nother impacts on the road.\n  I, for one, do not believe it was Congress' intent that OSM or States \nreceiving primacy on surface mining activities would attempt to \nregulate public roads in the jurisdictional control of some \nappropriately constituted public entity. Rather, it is my belief that \nthe intent of Congress was that only roads outside the jurisdiction of \nany responsible entity would be subject to jurisdiction under the \nFederal or State coal regulatory program. OSM's recent action regarding \nUtah's program is reflective of this belief, and I feel of sufficient \nimportance to inform my colleagues today. I intend to support \nmodifications to SMCRA that clearly spell out Congress' original intent \nwith SMCRA, but I am pleased with OSM's response to UDOGM's \nclarification of Utah State law. Based on the history of OSM's position \non road permitting vis a vis the act, it is my opinion that this \nresponse is significant.\n  I thank my colleague for his indulgence and for his advice on this \nmatter.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank my colleague from Utah for his statement and for \nthe information he has provided regarding OSM and its activities on \nroad permitting. This is very useful for States with primacy in this \narea, and I am also pleased with OSM's action that suggests decisions \non road permitting should rest in the hands of the States. I appreciate \nthe Senator's efforts in this area.\n      construction funding for the u.s. fish and wildlife service\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from New \nMexico would like to clarify an issue related to construction funding \nfor the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Domenici, Senator Byrd, and I be allowed to enter into a \ncolloquy in that regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I realize that the Appropriations \nCommittee has tried to include funding to complete construction and \nrehabilitate several Fish and Wildlife Service facilities. I thank the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member for recognizing the \nsignificant needs at the Bosque del Apache Wildlife Refuge in New \nMexico. I appreciate the constraints that we have on funding of this \nnature, but I am also aware that there are ongoing construction \nprojects that did not receive funding in this bill, including the \nSouthwest Fisheries Technology Center, in New Mexico. The committee has \nnot recommended that the Fish and Wildlife Service discontinue \nconstruction on these projects. It is my understanding that the \ncommittee intends to revisit these projects in the future, and will \nconsider funding for fiscal year 1997. I ask the distinguished chairman \nof the subcommittee if this is correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from New Mexico is correct. The committee \nunderstands the importance of these projects and intends to consider \nthem again next year.\n  Mr. BYRD. I join my colleague from Washington in stating that the \ncommittee should review these ongoing projects next year.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the chairman and ranking member for clarifying \nthe intent of the committee.\n\n\n                   energy information administration\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am concerned about the cuts this bill \nmakes to the Energy Information Administration. The EIA maintains \nvaluable and objective information on energy supply, consumption, \nproduction, and price. We must not lose this resource at a time when \nenergy prices and supplies are so volatile and the country is becoming \nincreasingly dependent on foreign oil.\n  Vermont's average petroleum price is the highest in the Nation and \nEIA information helps our State plan for and respond to energy \nemergencies.\n  This bill includes $63 million for EIA, a $21 million cut from last \nyear. The House included $80 million for EIA. As we proceed, I hope we \nkeep in mind the important role EIA serves.\n                    Naval petroleum and oil reserves\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the administration's budget request \nincluded $101 million for the naval petroleum and oil reserves for \nfiscal year 1996. The House has proposed appropriations of $151 \nmillion. This bill proposes appropriations of $136 million for the \nSenate.\n  The administration's budget is based on a caretaker status and does \nnot request funding for new initiatives. The administration's budget is \nbased on the sale of the NPR No. 1, commonly referred to as the ELK \nHills site. The budget resolution also assumes the sale of the reserve.\n  I understand and agree that the oil field must be maintained and \noperated at an adequate level regardless of whether or not the reserves \nare sold. However, the Department of Energy has indicated that the \nrequested fiscal year 1996 funding level combined with uncosted \nbalances from prior years and expected improvements in operational \nefficiencies by DOE are sufficient to operate the site in a responsible \nmanner such that the value of the field is maintained. The General \nAccounting Office has provided data showing substantial uncosted \nbalances exist for this purpose.\n  I am very concerned with this additional appropriation amount. I urge \nthe conferees on this matter to look very closely at this and determine \nwhat is really needed to operate the reserve in an appropriate manner \nwhile preserving the value of the reserve for future sale to ensure \nthat no taxpayer's dollars are wasted.\n\n\n                      Montezuma Creek IHS Facility\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I wish to bring to the attention of the chairman a \nmatter that, while it may appear small, is of great importance to the \nUtah Navajo population. The Navajo area includes 6 hospitals and 18 \noutpatient facilities. Unfortunately, none of these facilities are \ncurrently located in Utah. In fact, the only IHS facility in the entire \nState of Utah is an outpatient facility at Fort Duchensne which is \nlocated over 350 miles away.\n  The need for an IHS clinic located in Montezuma Creek is clearly \njustifiable. It is the population center for the eastern portion of the \nUtah Navajo. Approximately 6,000 Navajo live in southeastern Utah and \nunfortunately, their \n\n[[Page S12031]]\nhealth care needs are greatly underserved. In an effort to begin the \nprocess of replacing the dilapidated facility, I request that $30,000 \nbe made available to IHS for the preliminary study and design of a \nsatellite clinic located in Montezuma Creek.\n  Mr. GORTON. I am aware of the Senator's interest in the design of a \nfacility to replace the Montezuma Creek, UT facility and I hope to work \nwith the Senator to make certain the health care needs of the Utah \nNavajo's are met. To this end, I would agree that of the $1.9 million \nincluded in the bill to complete partially funded health care facility \ndesigns, $30,000 is available to the IHS for the study and preliminary \ndesign of a Red Mesa facility satellite clinic to be located at \nMontezuma Creek. This study should include an assessment of whether \nsuch arrangement is consistent with the existing IHS health care \nfacility priority list system.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the chairman and I would urge IHS to work \nclosely with the State of Utah and the Navajo Nation to utilize these \nfunds in the appropriate manner this fiscal year. This is a small \namount, but it is certainly the right first step in resolving the \nlongstanding problems of adequate health care delivery in southeastern \nUtah. Again, I thank the chairman for his leadership on this bill and \nhis efforts to help resolve this issue.\n              the United States holocaust memorial council\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today in support of \nfull funding for the United States Holocaust Memorial Council which \nfunds among other things, the staffing of the Holocaust Museum. The \nfunding request for fiscal year 1996 by the administration was $28.9 \nmillion. This request was approved by the House of Representatives. The \nrequest is being made after a momentous year during which attendance at \nthe Holocaust Museum reached a cumulative total of 3,880,517. The \nattendance totals have been an overwhelming surprise to all those \nplanning for the reception of the public. In fact, Mr. President, it \nexceeds by a factor of four the anticipated attendance at the museum. \nThis circumstance has stretched the capacity of the museum and its \nprofessional and volunteer staff to welcome the American public. This \nresponse to the program of the museum came with another unanticipated \nburden, that of providing a higher level of security for the public \nseeking to learn the lessons of the Holocaust.\n  Mr. President, the appropriations request for fiscal year 1996 is an \nincrease of $2.1 million from 1995 funding. I recognize the difficult \nchoices my fellow Members are making during this process and join with \nthem in making the hard choices. In this case, they have chosen to \nrecommend an appropriation of $26.6 million. I urge, however, a higher \nlevel of funding.\n  In light of the hatred and ethnic cleansing now underway in Bosnia \nand Croatia, I would anticipate an even more exponential growth of \ninterest by Americans. In the overwhelming demand and proven need to \neducate our youth of the folly of mindless hatred, I see the intense \nneed to reflect a higher sense of urgency by accommodating the request \nfor the full funding of the council, the museum, and their activities.\n  I would like to inform my fellow Senators of my intention to ask my \ncolleagues to give every consideration to accepting the House mark when \nthey go to conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                                  nrsa\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me ask Senator Gorton a question \nconcerning scientists currently employed by the National Resources \nScience Agency [NRSA] who had been transferred from the National Park \nService in 1993.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be delighted to engage in a colloquy with my \nfriend from New Mexico. I know he has a concern with the budget impact \nof the Interior appropriations bill on those scientists within the NRSA \nwho advise the Park Service on science-based natural resources \nmanagement.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. From my understanding, the National Park Service \ntransferred about 100 knowledgeable scientists to the NRSA in 1993. \nThese scientists provide long-term information that helps direct \nmanagement decisions. I am concerned for those scientist positions that \nwill have to be eliminated due to budget constraints. Is it the \nSenator's position that the National Park Service, in coordination with \nthe NRSA, should be included in the National Resources Science Agency's \npriority setting efforts for National Park Service research.\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, the Senator is correct. In fact, I believe it is in \nthe long-term interest for the national parks to be able to rely on an \nestablished pool of scientific knowledge and less on managerial \nguesswork and to have input into the priority setting of the NRSA.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator for discussing this subject with \nme.\n                              ellis island\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to discuss with the chairman of \nthe subcommittee an issue of importance to millions of Americans. I \nhope to clarify the intent of the subcommittee and keep intact the \nintegrity of what, to many, is a solemn place.\n   Mr. President, over a period of 62 years, more than 12 million \nimmigrants sailed into the gateway to the United States, Ellis Island, \nNY. They arrived from the four corners of the Earth with only a handful \nof possessions, uncertain of what they would find. From Ellis Island, \nthese individuals spread into every part of our land, eager to explore \nthe opportunities that our dynamic Nation presented.\n  Many Americans, including a number of our colleagues, can trace their \nheritage to Ellis Island. To those who passed through the great hall \nand to their descendants, Ellis Island is considered a hallowed place. \nIt is not a place to be treated insignificantly, it is a place to be \nrespected.\n  That is why, Mr. President, I am weary of anything relating to Ellis \nIsland that could somehow cheapen its meaning. That is why I have \nrepeatedly opposed constructing a permanent bridge linking the mainland \nto Ellis Island. Our ancestors did not arrive at Ellis Island by foot, \nby horse, by cart, or by automobile. Every one of them arrived by boat. \nA permanent bridge would violate the cultural and historical context of \nEllis Island, and would only serve to trivialize and detract from the \nexperience of how our ancestors came to pass through Ellis Island.\n  Therefore, I am sure that my colleague from Washington can understand \nmy concern with language included in the bill before us that prevents \nthe demolition of the current, temporary bridge that runs to Ellis \nIsland. In addition, as I understand, the language makes this temporary \nstructure available to pedestrians provided that proper safety measures \nare enacted and enforced.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from New York is correct. This \nis language that was included in the House-passed version of this \nlegislation. The other body voted 230 to 196 to include this language. \nAlso, it is the intent of the subcommittee that this language will \nprevent a situation from arising that the Senator describes, mainly, \nthe construction of a permanent bridge.\n  I understand and respect the concerns of the Senator from New York \nthat vehicle traffic not disrupt the cultural and historical context of \nEllis Island. Further, the committee is devoted to ensuring the safety \nof visitors to Ellis Island and will expect strict adherence to all \nrelevant safety guidelines before any pedestrian traffic is allowed. It \nis my intention to follow the progress of the execution of this \nprovision and will consult with the Senator from New York as to its \neffectiveness.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank my friend and colleague for that clarification. \nAs I stated, I become concerned when I feel the integrity of Ellis \nIsland is put into question. Fortunately, the chairman's leadership has \ngiven me confidence that this provision will be given the utmost \nscrutiny. I look forward to working closely with him on this issue.\n   Mr. President, I would like to receive further clarification from \nthe chairman of the subcommittee on another matter in relation to Ellis \nIsland.\n  As I understand, the present bill language places a 30-day hold on \nimplementing any plan to develop the southern end of Ellis Island until \nthe Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate have been \nnotified and \n\n[[Page S12032]]\ngiven a full and comprehensive report on such development.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank my friend. Ellis Island is a place that is of \nspecial interest to all Americans. Therefore, I believe that it is very \nimportant that any interested Member of Congress be notified before the \nNational Park Service undergoes any attempt to redevelop the southern \nend of Ellis Island.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would say to my friend that I understand \nhis concern that he or any Senator who is interested in the \nredevelopment of Ellis Island be made aware of any plans to do so. I \nwould expect that the Park Service would honor any request to be so \nnotified.\n  To be clear, it is not the intent of the subcommittee to allow such \naction without scrutiny. Further, the subcommittee would expect the \nNational Park Service on its own, to be cognizant of the concerns of \nthose Members of Congress who express an interest in the redevelopment \nof Ellis Island and take those concerns into consideration prior to \nentering into any such agreement.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank the chairman for that clarification.\n                   federal appliance energy standards\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I would like to engage in a colloquy on this amendment \nwith the bill manager, Senator Gorton, and Senator Ford. Federal \nappliance efficiency standards were established because manufacturers \nwanted one Federal standard as opposed to 50 different, and perhaps \ninconsistent, standards. If the Department of Energy cannot implement \nFederal standards, the States might attempt to revive their individual \nprograms. The appliance standards adopted to date will save consumers a \nnet of $132 billion over the lifetime of the affected products. The \nDepartment has committed to work cooperatively with manufacturers to \naddress concerns raised in current reviews of the appliance standards. \nWhere industry has raised significant criticisms of DOE's analysis or \napproach, as with recent proposals concerning fluorescent lamp ballasts \nand electric water heaters, DOE has organized workshops and public \nmeetings with manufacturers to solicit further input and work together \nto correct the problems. The consensus approach to revising standards \nshould be continued.\n  Mr. FORD. We all recognize the value of appliance efficiency \nstandards, the cost and energy savings that have been achieved with the \nexisting standards. However, the manufacturers have raised concerns \nabout the methodology and assumptions in the Department's current cost-\nbenefit analysis. For example, the burden on firms with small market \nshares need to be addressed. We expect the Department to analyze the \nimpact of any modifications to standards for both small and large \nmanufacturers. The cumulative impact of regulations across product \nlines should also be incorporated into the analysis.\n  Mr. GORTON. This amendment will only affect the proposal, issuance, \nor prescription of new or amended standards. There will be no limits on \nanalysis or information exchange. Nor will there be any prohibition or \nlimits on planning by the Department of Energy. The Senate expects that \nthe Department and the manufactures will spend the next year working \ntogether to analyze existing standards in order to conduct accurate \neconomic analyses and impact assessments. The second part of the \namendment also clarifies that the Department may proceed to establish \nefficiency standards for the construction of new federally owned \ncommercial and residential buildings. The Department can and should \nestablish minimum efficiency requirements for construction of new \nFederal facilities, such as military housing and office buildings.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I fully agree that, at a minimum, we have to be able to \nproceed with the rules affecting Federal facilities. Once built, the \ntaxpayers will have to cover the energy bills for the life of a \nfacility. These standards are required by the Energy Policy Act, which \nwas overwhelmingly supported by the Senate. Furthermore, under the \nFederal budget situation, we have to do everything we can to minimize \nongoing operating costs. To summarize the amendment, it is my \nunderstanding that this amendment will only preclude the proposal, \nissuance, or prescription of rules on new or amended appliance and \nequipment standards. Testing and labeling will continue. There will not \nbe any limit on grants for State programs or the Home Energy Ratings \nSystems [HERS] pilot projects.\n                          oriskany battlefield\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to seek the guidance of my friend, \nthe Senator from Washington, with respect to undertaking a management \nplan for Oriskany Battlefield.\n  Oriskany Battlefield is a national historic landmark that designates \nthe site of a major American Revolutionary War battle. On that site, \nAmerican patriots fought British regulars, loyalists, and certain \nnations of the Iroquois Confederation. Of particular interest is the \ninvolvement of four of the six nations of the Confederation on the side \nof the British. The Oneida and Tuscarora Nations within the Iroquois \nConfederation chose to support the Americans over the British, leading, \nas is believed, to the dissolution of the 200 year-old Confederation.\n  The significance of the battlefield, its proximity to another \nhistoric and integrally linked national site, Fort Stanwix National \nMonument, and the circumstances surrounding the involvement of the \ncombatants make Oriskany Battlefield an ideal candidate for possible \ninclusion in the National Park System. There is demonstrated interest \non the part of citizens of the local community, New York State, and the \nOneida Nation of New York to explore the option of a larger Federal \nrole in the site. However, in order to do this, a general planning \nstudy must be undertaken.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am familiar with the request of the \nSenator from New York to have this study conducted by the Park Service. \nThe subcommittee is confident that the Park Service will give due \nconsideration to the Senator's request to include Oriskany Battlefield \nin the National Park System.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank my friend.\n                     intertribal bison cooperative\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nclarify the intent of the Senate Appropriations Committee regarding the \nfunding for Bureau of Indian Affairs bison restoration projects.\n  As you may know, the Intertribal Bison Cooperative was formed 3 years \nago with only nine tribes as members. ITBC's mission is to reestablish \nhealthy bison populations on tribal lands in a manner that promotes \neconomic development, cultural enhancement, ecological restoration, and \nspiritual revitalization.\n  The role of ITBC, as established by its membership, is to act as a \nfacilitator in coordinating education and training programs, develop \nmarketing strategies, coordinate the transfer of surplus buffalo from \nnational parks to tribal lands, and provide technical assistance to its \nmembership in developing management plans that will help each tribal \nherd become a successful and self-sufficient operation.\n  Today, the cooperative works with 36 member tribes spread across 15 \nStates. The united efforts of cooperative member tribes to restore the \nNation's bison population have created much-needed economic development \nfor the member tribes through the sale of buffalo meat and other \nbyproducts.\n  Last year, the Bureau of Indian Affairs put the cooperative's bison \nherd management program in jeopardy by distributing its limited fiscal \nyear 1995 funds among any or all of the federally recognized Indian \ntribes. The effect of this action has the potential to undermine the \ncooperative spirit that ITBC has worked many years to achieve and that \nhas fostered its success. I believe that the BIA's interpretation of \ncongressional intent was clearly in error.\n  It has been consistently my belief that the ITBC, which has proven \nits success in achieving self-sufficiency, warrants investment by \nCongress. Of course, tribes wishing to qualify for Federal bison \nrestoration funding are free to become members of the cooperative.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to inquire of my colleagues \nwhether it is the intent of the Appropriations Committee to distribute \nfiscal year 1996 bison project funds specifically to the Intertribal \nBison Cooperative and its member tribes.\n\n[[Page S12033]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator from South Dakota, Senator \nDaschle is correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would ask the chairman of the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Gorton, if he concurs that my \nunderstanding that the fiscal year 1996 bison restoration project funds \nare to be solely designated for the Intertribal Bison Cooperative and \nits member tribes is correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, that is correct. It is the intent of the \nAppropriations Committee that fiscal year 1996 funding for bison \nrestoration projects be distributed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to \nthe Intertribal Bison Cooperative and not to all federally recognized \ntribes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I want to thank my colleagues from the committee for \nthis clarification.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to commend the chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Interior and related agencies, Senator \nGorton, and the ranking member, Senator Byrd, for the work that they \nand their staffs have done in shepherding the Interior appropriations \nbill through subcommittee and full committee. I would like to engage \nthe senior Senators from West Virginia and Washington in a colloquy \nregarding the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n  The subcommittee has funded the museum at the 1995 level of \n$26,609,000. As my colleagues know, the House-passed Interior bill \nappropriates $28,707,000. This is a $2,098,000 increase over fiscal \nyear 1995. The added funds are needed for the institution to meet the \nextraordinary and unanticipated demand from visitors and the attendant \nheightened security and wear-and-tear on the building.\n  Let me just illustrate this point. Before opening to the public 2\\1/\n2\\ years ago, the museum estimated the likely visitation at 500,000 \nannually. Instead, the museum has had over 2,000,000 visitors each year \ninstead of the 500,000 anticipated. I am especially heartened by who is \ncoming to the Holocaust Museum. Four out of five visitors travel more \nthan 100 miles to see the permanent exhibit. In 1955, more than 285,000 \nstudents will tour the museum as part of organized groups. The \nHolocaust Museum is a destination point in Washington, and is now one \nof the most visited museums in Washington.\n  And the museum's reach does not stop at the Potomac. The institution \nis assisting teachers, scholars, survivors, and our veterans in making \nsense of this dark hour in world history. It has responded to 70,000 \nrequests from educators; its Internet mailbox, open less than 6 months, \nreceives 15,000 inquiries a week; and its research institute has \nassisted 11,000 scholars and researchers and 14,500 survivors.\n  In short, the Holocaust Museum has done all that the Congress \nenvisioned for it and more. This remarkable success, when coupled with \nits newness, makes its case especially persuasive. I ask my colleagues \nto give every consideration to accepting the House's mark when they go \nto conference.\n  Mr. GORTON. I recently met with the new Director of the Holocaust \nMuseum, Dr. Walter Reich. I told him then that I am now a great \nsupporter of his institution. I think it has made a powerful and \nnecessary contribution to the Nation's education and remembrance.\n  As the Senator from Alaska knows, the committee had to make some \npainful choices during the markups. I have listened to his persuasive \nstatement, and I want to assure him that I will review the facts and \ngive every consideration to the House's funding level for the museum.\n  Mr. BYRD. This Nation has created a museum of memory, a memorial to \nthe victims of the Holocaust. It teaches us the lessons of what happens \nwhen democracy is not preserved, when democratic practices are \nsubverted, when the public will is subjugated. I, too, want to commend \nthe museum on its efforts and successes, and I want to say to Senator \nStevens and other Members of this body that I will listen carefully and \ngive the Senator from Alaska's proposal to fund the Holocaust Museum \nevery consideration.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the senior \nSenators from West Virginia and Washington in a colloquy concerning a \nparticular need in Alaska that just recently came to my attention and \nis not currently addressed in the bill.\n  Alaska Senator Robin Taylor has advised me of the need to provide \nfunds in the U.S. Forest Service budget for some critical environmental \nstudies related to construction of the American portion of a proposed \npublic toll road from the Iskut River region of British Columbia, \nCanada to the Bradfield Canal near Wrangell, AK. This is called the \nBradfield Road.\n  An environmental impact statement is required because the road must \ncross through the Tongass National Forest, which encompasses most of \nsoutheastern Alaska. The Tongass is the country's largest national \nforest at 16.7 million acres, an area larger than the States of West \nVirginia and Rhode Island combined. Because of its immense size, almost \nno road can be constructed to serve southeastern communities that does \nnot traverse the Tongass National Forest.\n  Mr. GORTON. Why is the road needed?\n  Mr. STEVENS. With no existing road, Wrangell is currently \neconomically isolated. It is served only by air and ferry. Until \nrecently Wrangell's economy was largely dependent on the timber \nindustry. However, last year the U.S. Forest Service unilaterally \ncanceled Alaska Pulp Company's 50-year timber contract, resulting in \nthe closure of the Wrangell sawmill. As a result, the unemployment rate \nhas skyrocketed up to 40 percent and climbing. Unless a new economy \ndevelops, the city and its residents face a harsh winter ahead.\n  The proposed Bradfield Road would provide the shortest route to \ntidewater for several Canadian gold and copper mining operations. The \nnearest Canadian port to the mining district is roughly four times \nfarther than Alaska's Bradfield Canal. The Bradfield Road would not \nonly reduce transportation costs and the overall environmental impact \nof the project, but it would create American jobs in Wrangell. The \npeople of Wrangell would be involved in constructing the road in the \nshort-term, and in the long-term would have access to mining jobs in \nCanada and increased tourism opportunities in the area.\n  The Alaska State Legislature has already committed to pay the \nconstruction costs of the road through revenue bonds. Commercial and \npublic traffic will pay a toll to use the road, which will finance its \noperation and maintenance. The only contribution required from the \nFederal Government is funds to conduct the EIS required by the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act.\n  I propose that $2.5 million of the funds provided in this bill to be \nallocated to region 10--the Alaska region--be allocated to conduct the \nEIS required by NEPA. The funds should be taken out of non-timber-\nproducing accounts such as recreation and administration.\n  Mr. GORTON. Given the severe economic dislocation occurring in \nWrangell as a result of the U.S. Forest Service's decision to terminate \nthe contract which provided timber to the Wrangell mill, I agree that \nthe Bradfield Road should be given priority. I concur with my good \nfriend from Alaska that the Service should allocate the funds necessary \nto complete the environmental studies. The Service should be directed \nto fund this project out of accounts not designated to produce timber \nin region 10.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nconcur?\n  Mr. BYRD. Since the Alaska State Legislature has agreed to fund \nconstruction of the road and provide for its operation and maintenance, \nI support the concept of directing the Service to conduct the necessary \nenvironmental studies. The funds should be reallocated out of nontimber \nfunds already budgeted for region 10.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Gorton and \ncommend him for the great job he has done putting together a very \ndifficult bill. There are important parts of this bill that will have a \nlasting impact. One of those is the extension of the Endangered Species \nAct moratorium which I sponsored, and was enacted, several months ago \nto try to wait until \n\n[[Page S12034]]\nwe have reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act so that future \nlistings will have the stamp of congressional intent in a revised \nEndangered Species Act.\n  This moratorium is a very important part of the legislation before \nus. We have seen so many jobs lost, so many people devastated in their \nability to use their land and farm and ranch and make their \nlivelihoods, because of the Endangered Species Act being overzealously \nenforced.\n  I believe that the Endangered Species Act was passed with all the \nright intentions, and I think many of the things that are done by Fish \nand Wildlife are very good. But we have seen such excesses that the \nwater supply of two cities in my State, Amarillo and San Antonio, have \nbeen endangered by bait fish, the Arkansas River shiner and the \nfountain darter in the Edwards aquifer.\n  We now see the same thing coming forward with the same Edwards \naquifer, only this time it is three beetles that have now been proposed \nas endangered, despite the effect on the water supply of the 10th \nlargest city in America.\n  So I do appreciate the fact that we are extending the moratorium \nuntil the earlier of reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act, or \nuntil the end of 1996, which will give Congress the time to set \nparameters for the Endangered Species Act that will assure that we have \nbalanced the needs of people with species.\n  We added money to the Fish and Wildlife Service's budget during floor \ndebate on this bill. I expect that the listing money will be used only \nto delist some of the endangered species that really should not be on \nthe list, and the prelisting money for species conservation so that we \nwill not have to list new endangered species. That would be a very good \nuse of our taxpayer dollars.\n  The second thing that I think is very important that we put in this \nbill, and I want to thank Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd for agreeing \nto do it, is in the National Biological Survey language. We make sure \nthat a private property owner must give permission for any new surveys \nunder this act, and including aerial surveys.\n  We have had instances in my State and others where airplanes paid for \nby the National Biological Survey have flown over private property \nwithout permission taking pictures for habitat studies. That is now \nprohibited in this act. That is why I think it is very important that \nwe pass the act and say, once again, that private property is protected \nby the Constitution of the United States.\n  I think the Congress is speaking today to make sure that everyone \nunderstands--that the people in Washington, in Government understand--\nthat we are going to protect private property rights, and I think we \nhave taken a step in the right direction today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the fiscal year \n1996 Interior Department appropriations bill as reported by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee does not earmark funds for land purchases \nwithin the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area [SMMNRA]. I \nam greatly concerned that this remarkable national treasure--an island \nof green in an urban sea--now faces the prospect of increased \ndevelopment within its boundaries. We must not let this happen. Our \ncontinued support of this majestic recreation area is crucial.\n  The open spaces of the SMMNRA stretch over 50 miles from Elysian Park \nin downtown Los Angeles to Point Mugu State Park in Ventura County. The \nmountains climb from the Pacific Ocean to provide breathtaking vistas \nof the Los Angeles Basin, the blue Pacific, and the San Fernando \nValley.\n  The Santa Monica Mountains are the only undeveloped pristine mountain \nrange in the world that bisects a major city--in this case the Nation's \nsecond largest. In addition, the Los Angeles area has one of the lowest \namounts of open parkland per capita in the United States.\n  This national recreation area provides recreational opportunities for \nmore than 12 million people living in surrounding communities--\nincluding hikers, campers, picnickers, and nature lovers, young and \nold. The beauty of the recreation area leads many visitors to express \namazement that they are just minutes from an urban area the size of Los \nAngeles. In the mountains, a variety of wildlife live and thrive, \nincluding mountain lions, deer, and a dozen endangered plants and \nanimals. 369 bird species, 50 species of mammals, and 36 kinds of \nreptiles and amphibians call this area home.\n  The land that was to be purchased through funding in the fiscal year \n1996 Interior appropriations bill includes undeveloped canyons, key \nwildlife corridors, and trailways that provide coastal access and link \nseveral major activity centers throughout the SMMNRA.\n  Significant progress on land acquisitions was made with the purchase \nof the Jordan Ranch, the largest acquisition in the park's history, but \ndelays have escalated purchase costs and threaten opportunities to \nacquire key parcels that otherwise may be developed. Biologically \nsignificant areas could be lost if we do not act now.\n  Although I would have preferred a specific allocation for this \nrequest, there is still an opportunity to get funds from this bill. Of \nthe $43.2 million appropriated by the bill for land acquisition by the \nNational Park Service, approximately $6 million is designated for \nemergencies and hardships and inholdings. I intend to call on the \nClinton administration to designate the Santa Monica Mountains project \nas a top priority for funding under these provisions.\n  We must continue our commitment to the Santa Monica Mountains \nNational Recreation Area. We must do this for ourselves and our \nenvironment, and the name of future generations--so that they may enjoy \nthe rich natural splendor of the southern California landscape.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate agreed to \naccept an amendment to this bill that imposes a 1-year moratorium on \nissuance of new or amended appliance efficiency standards. The \namendment will not prevent engineering or economic analyses on \nefficiency standards, but it will stall issuance of new or amended \nrules for a year. This is a limited delay in the implementation \nprocess, only until September 30, 1996, so that appliance manufacturers \ncan work out their concerns with the process with the Department of \nEnergy [DOE]. The manufacturers and the Department are expected to \nresolve differences with the methodology and assumptions in the current \nanalytical process. A process to mitigate the affect of any retooling \nmodifications on small manufacturers should be worked out so that any \npotential for anticompetitive impacts will be resolved early in future \nrulemakings. Consensus and voluntary efforts are not affected and \nshould proceed. Appliance testing and labeling will continue and no \nlimits will be imposed on the State grant program or the home energy \nratings system. The Department is also expected to proceed with \nissuance of rules on minimum efficiency standards for federal-owned \nbuildings as required in the Energy Policy Act.\n  The efficiency program authorized under the Energy Policy and \nConservation Act [EPCA], as amended, has been one of our Nation's most \neffective programs at ensuring wiser energy use. The appliance \nefficiency standards currently in place will save consumers over $132 \nbillion over the life of the products. In the 100th Congress, the \nNational Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 was enacted \nestablishing minimum Federal appliance standards. Additional amendments \nwere enacted in 1988. Both bills were reported unanimously by the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. These two actions \namended EPCA to require and set Federal standards and preempt a \npatchwork of State standards. Congress established minimum Federal \nstandards by statute to take effect between 1988 and 1993, depending on \nthe product. DOE was required to conduct follow up rulemakings to \ndetermine whether the standards established in the statute were \nadequate.\n  Under EPCA, the DOE standards rulemakings require very specific cost-\nbenefit analyses. The criteria for prescribing new or amended standards \nspecifically require the Secretary to determine that benefits exceed \nthe burdens to the greatest extent practicable, considering the \nfollowing: the economic impact on manufacturers and \n\n[[Page S12035]]\nconsumers; a determination of a positive net present value to the \nconsumer of any increased price; any lessening of consumer utility or \nproduct performance; impact on competition as determined by the \nAttorney General; and any other factors considered relevant.\n  Any final rule will have to address all of the above issues. In \naddition, none of the new standards would go into effect for 3 to 5 \nyears after the final rule is in effect.\n  The process followed under EPCA entails issuance of an advanced \nnotice of proposed rulemaking [ANOPR] to solicit the necessary \ninformation to carry out cost-benefit and detailed engineering analyses \nof the feasibility of any proposed standard. A notice of proposed \nrulemaking [NOPR] is subsequently published with draft proposed \nstandards, including the cost-benefit criteria and engineering analyses \nused in developing the proposal. The Department of Justice and all \ninterested persons are asked to comment on the NOPR. EPCA requires the \nSecretary to hold a conference or informal procedure to allow \ninterested parties an opportunity to question written or oral \npresentations of U.S. employees where facts are in dispute. DOE then \ndrafts a proposed final rule based on the input received from the \nprevious two rounds of public comment.\n  DOE is attempting to work collaboratively with the industry to \ndevelop the engineering and economic models. The Congress and the \npublic have strongly supported this program in the past and after the \nopportunity for the Department and industry to come to closure on \ncertain technical issues, the program will continue without \ninterference as Congress intended.\n                   IHS Study on Staffing Distribution\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the floor managers, the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], and the \ndistinguished Senator for West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], and the members of \ntheir staffs, for working with me on this amendment. I am very pleased \nthat they have agreed to accept it.\n  I offered this amendment to help ensure that the IHS meets the health \ncare needs of the American Indians in an equitable, cost-efficient \nmanner. The amendment requires the Secretary to submit a report to the \nCongress that contains a comparison and analysis of IHS staffing by \nhealth facility and service unit.\n  For several years, I have been very concerned about the inability of \nthe Indian Health Service to fully meet the health care needs of \nAmerican Indians in my home State of New Mexico and throughout the \ncountry. I am particularly apprehensive about the new IHS hospital in \nShiprock, NM, which opened last year under-staffed and which remains \nunderstaffed today.\n  Too often in the past, the Federal Government has overlooked the \nhealth care needs of American Indians. As a result, the IHS currently \nmeets only 45 percent of the total estimated health care need of our \nNation's 1.3 million Indians and Alaska Natives.\n  I am concerned that in our zeal to lower the Federal budget deficit \nand cut waste from the system, we will do harm to Indian children and \nfamilies if we do not develop strategies for dealing with existing and \nproject funding and staffing shortfalls. We need to work together to \nstreamline administrative services, eliminate bureaucratic waste, and \nmaximize existing resources through the thoughtful, mandatory \nredistribution of personnel and equipment from areas of lesser need and \nlow productivity to areas of greater need and potential.\n  This amendment will help us achieve these goals. Specifically:\n  First, distribution study and report: To ensure that the Indian \nHealth Service meets the health care needs of the American Indians in \nan equitable manner, the Secretary is directed to submit to the \nCongress a report containing a comparative analysis of Indian Health \nService staffing by health facility and Service Unit.\n  Such report and analysis shall:\n  First, intra-facility ratio: Compare the ratio of health care \nproviders--by profession--to patients in each IHS hospital facility and \nclinic;\n  Second, Inter-facility ratio: Compare facility ratios throughout the \nIHS system to ensure that all areas of the country are being served \nequitably; and\n  Third, Overall staffing distribution: Analyze overall staffing and \ndistribution levels, including all types of health professionals, \nsupport staff, and administrative staff.\n  Again, I thank the managers of the bill and their staffs for \naccepting this amendment.\n             klamath national wildlife refuge pesticide use\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the fiscal year \n1996 Interior appropriations bill, I want to express my concerns about \nlanguage in the committee report that affects the natural resources and \nwildlife of California.\n  I am disappointed that the Senate Appropriations Committee added \nlanguage to the bill that prohibits the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nfrom enforcing its pesticide use policies in the Lower Klamath and Tule \nLake National Wildlife Refuges in northern California and southern \nOregon. Specifically, the language states that pesticide use can \ncontinue if the pesticide meets applicable Federal and State pesticide \nlaws for use on non-Federal land. According to the Department of the \nInterior and the Fish and Wildlife Service, this language, if enacted, \nwill significantly increase the risk of pesticide related deaths of \nmigratory birds and endangered species on these protected lands. Mr. \nPresident, this land is federally owned but leased to private \nindividuals, and this language would override the Fish and Wildlife \nService's authority to restrict pesticide use on public land even when \nthe pesticide endangers the wildlife the Service is directed to \nprotect.\n  This requirement needlessly micro- manages specific national wildlife \nrefuges and undermines the conservation aims of the refuge system. \nThirty-five herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, and nematocides made \nwith chemicals known to have reproductive- and endocrine-disrupting \neffects will be allowed to be used in the next year as a result of this \nlanguage.\n  Unfortunately, the language in the Senate bill may be the best option \navailable to the Fish and Wildlife Service since the House has \naddressed this issue by passing the National Wildlife Refuge \nImprovement Act of 1995, which permanently prohibits the Fish and \nWildlife Service from enforcing its pesticide use policies in the \nKlamath and Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuges. A permanent ban on the \nenforcement of pesticide policies in these refuges is even more \ndisturbing than a 1-year moratorium on enforcement.\n  The Department of the Interior and the Fish and Wildlife Service \nshare my concerns about the language contained in the Interior \nappropriations bill, but believe that they will be able to work out a \ncompromise with the parties involved in the next year. This negotiation \nand eventual resolution would remove the need for a permanent ban. I \nsincerely hope that all interested parties are able to resolve the \nquestions surrounding the use of pesticides in our refuges in a timely \nmanner. I will be monitoring this process closely and, if necessary, I \nwill fight any permanent ban against enforcement of these pesticide use \npolicies.\n                             HIV-AIDS STUDY\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, over the past several months, I have met \nwith several groups from New Mexico's Indian tribes to discuss the \nIndian Health Service and the health needs of American Indians. Many \nmentioned to me that, like the rest of the population in the United \nStates, the incidences of HIV and AIDS is growing among native American \npopulations. I learned recently that on the Navajo Nation, which \nincludes parts of the States of New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah, 53 cases \nof HIV and AIDS have been reported to IHS. A few years ago, there were \nalmost none.\n  Unfortunately, many of the people who care for HIV-AIDS-infected \nnative Americans believe that the IHS has not begun taking aggressive \nsteps to meet this growing--and potentially very costly--need. Current \nIHS policy is to treat HIV-AIDS-infected patients with general IHS \nservice funds. The IHS is not funded through the Ryan White CARE Act, \nalthough I believe it should be. The result is that already \ninsufficient funds are squeezed even tighter.\n  My amendment would simply require the IHS to do a little preplanning. \nIt directs the IHS to undertake a study of the existing need and \ndevelop a plan for meeting the need. Specifically:\n\n[[Page S12036]]\n\n  (I) Study: The Secretary is directed to report to Congress, by \nService unit, on: (1) incidences of HIV-AIDS among the American Indians \nand Alaska Natives; (2) services provided under the PHS Act to HIV-\nAIDS-positive Indians; (3) unmet needs, including preventive \neducational needs, of Indians and Alaska Natives living with HIV-AIDS \nwho use the IHS for primary health care; (4) capacity of each Service \nunit to meet the existing need; and (5) resources, including education, \nneeded to meet existing and projected need.\n  (II) Plan: Based on the results of the study, the Secretary is \ndirected to develop a plan meeting the existing and projected needs.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of bill for accepting my \namendment, and I look forward to working on this issue with them and \nother interested Members of Congress as the Interior appropriations \nbill goes to conference with the House. I believe we will be able to \neffectively deal with this amendment and its reporting requirements \nduring the conference.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Chairman, the \nsenior Senator from Washington, for doing an outstanding job on a very \ndifficult bill. There are many divisive issues that lend themselves to \none-sided partisanship in the interior appropriations bill. Senator \nGorton presided over a balanced and responsible bill that maintained \nour commitment to good government and saved more than $1 billion. I \nwant to commend him for his excellent work and thank him for the \nintegrity and fairness of his efforts.\n  I also want to thank Senator Byrd, whose wisdom, experience and \nfairness is a perennial asset in putting this bill together. I am very \ngrateful for the bipartisanship represented in this bill, and look \nforward to working with the Chairman and the ranking member as we go to \nconference.\n  There are a few programs that I want to highlight that were served \nvery well by the Chairman, such as the National Biological Survey \n(NBS). Some interest groups and Members of Congress use the NBS as a \nhook to hang all sorts of fears and frustrations about natural resource \nmanagement. In fact, the NBS is not comprised of new money, new \nemployees, or new research objectives. It is simply a consolidated \ncollection of all the research that has been going on for decades \nassembled under one, non-regulatory agency so that science can be \nserved well. Chairman Gorton and Senator Byrd also took fair and \nbalanced positions on endangered species act funding, the water \ninstitutes, the Appalachian Trail, the Park Service, and Federal land \nacquisition.\n  I want to thank the managers of the bill for making changes to the \nAmeriCorps language at the request of Senator Murray and myself. I also \nappreciate their willingness to work with me on the National Endowment \nfor the Arts and on the Stewardship Incentive Program. I believe the \nrevised language for the ecosystem management objectives for the \neastern Oregon and Washington is also a valuable improvement.\n  Finally, I want to express some disappointments that I wish we could \nhave improved. In particular, I was sorry to see such substantial cuts \nin the weatherization program which is so important to frost belt \nstates like my native state of Vermont. While the Senate mark is higher \nthan the House, it still respresents a cut that will have a significant \nimpact in Vermont. I hope in conference we can protect the Senate \nfunding. I had also hoped to see stronger funding for Historic \nPreservation, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and the \nNational Capital Arts and Cultural Affairs program. Vermont leverages \n$28 for every Federal historic preservation dollar with our Main Street \nprogram. I was disappointed by a complete elimination of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund State grant program and the 50 percent cut in \nthe Forest Legacy program. Both of these items are critically important \nto my State. Lastly, I wish we could have continued our efforts to \nrestore the Atlantic Salmon to the Connecticut River with a buy-out of \nforeign fishermen who harvest our hatchery stock on the high seas.\n  Nonetheless, as a former subcommittee Chairman myself, I am well \naware that the Chairman and ranking member cannot make good on every \nrequest, especially in times like these. I hope that they will bear in \nmind my thoughts as we go to conference with the House. I want to thank \nboth the managers for their leadership and congratulate them again on a \ndifficult but successful Interior Appropriations bill.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, most Members have been notified that we \ndid not expect to have a rollcall vote on final passage of this bill. \nThere has now been a request by a Member for a rollcall.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment Nos. 2326 and 2327, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send two amendments to the desk in \nbehalf of Senator Bingaman, and I ask for their consideration en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington (Mr. Gorton), for Mr. Bingaman, \n     proposes amendments numbered 2326 and 2327, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, each of these amendments is for a study \nwithin the Indian Health Service.\n  We have not had time to deal with them to the point at which we have \nfull confidence in them, though each of them appears to have a degree \nof merit.\n  I ask that they be agreed. But we will have to look at them very \ncarefully on both sides during the course of the conference committee \nand see whether or not they are appropriate or need to be revised. But \nat this point we are willing to accept them.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the amendments meet with approval on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to state \nthe obvious, but an obvious that is all too often overlooked, and that \nis that there was no possibility of dealing with this bill either in \nthe timeframe within which we dealt with it, nor the effectiveness, nor \nefficiency, nor the wisdom with which we have dealt with it without the \nhelp of a number of dedicated members of the staff:\n  Cherie Cooper, who is majority clerk; Sue Masica, the minority clerk; \nCarole Geagley; Kathleen Wheeler, who has worked on energy, BIA, the \ngeological survey, land and water conservation accounts; Bruce Evans, \nwho was formerly of my personal staff, who dealt with Fish and Wildlife \nService, mines; Virginia James with NEH, which was, obviously, very \ncontroversial, and the Smithsonian; and Ted Milesnick, a detailee from \nthe Bureau of Land Management to provide support service to all \naccounts; and my own staff member, Julie Kays, a legislative assistant \non my staff who is tireless, fearless, and persuasive in all she does; \nand, once again, to thank Senator Byrd whose advice, counsel, and \nwisdom has been of great assistance, for that matter all of the members \nof my subcommittee, each of whom contributed significantly to this \nresult.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will take a few seconds to express my \nadmiration for Mr. Gorton because of the remarkably superb job that he \ndid in skillfully piloting the appropriations bill for the Department \nof the Interior through committee and through the Senate. He did an \noutstanding job, and I am grateful to him and for his fairness, his \ncourtesy, and for his ability in moving this bill.\n  I also want to thank Sue Masica, my superb staff person, and Cherie \nCooper is an equally superb staff person on the other side of the \naisle. I think that this has been a preeminently fine display of skill \nand statesmanship on the part of Mr. Gorton on behalf of the Senate. I \nexpress all of our appreciation to him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Washington, \nSenator Gorton, and also the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, \nSenator Byrd, for their expeditious action on a very important and a \nvery, in some areas, contentious bill. They have disposed of the \namendments, I think, in very good time.\n  Now we are prepared to move on to the next bill. Let me remind my \ncolleagues, everything is on automatic pilot. The speech you do not \nmake in the next 2 days means you will get out that much earlier. You \ncan make the speech when you get home, and a lot of people have never \nheard it before and most of us have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/09/senate-section/article/S12002-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12037-S12064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that-- \n\n[[Page S12047]]\n\n       (1) affordable public transportation is essential to the \n     economic vitality of the national capital area and is an \n     essential component of regional efforts to improve air \n     quality to meet environmental requirements and to improve the \n     health of both residents of and visitors to the national \n     capital area as well as to preserve the beauty and dignity of \n     the Nation's capital;\n       (2) use of mass transit by both residents of and visitors \n     to the national capital area is substantially affected by the \n     prices charged for such mass transit services, prices that \n     are substantially affected by labor costs, since more than \n     \\2/3\\ of operating costs are attributable to labor costs;\n       (3) labor costs incurred in providing mass transit in the \n     national capital area have increased at an alarming rate and \n     wages and benefits of operators and mechanics currently are \n     among the highest in the Nation;\n       (4) higher operating costs incurred for public transit in \n     the national capital area cannot be offset by increasing \n     costs to patrons, since this often discourages ridership and \n     thus undermines the public interest in promoting the use of \n     public transit;\n       (5) spiraling labor costs cannot be offset by the \n     governmental entities that are responsible for subsidy \n     payments for public transit services since local governments \n     generally, and the District of Columbia government in \n     particular, are operating under severe fiscal constraints;\n       (6) imposition of mandatory standards applicable to \n     arbitrators resolving arbitration disputes involving \n     interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital \n     area will ensure that wage increases are justified and do not \n     exceed the ability of transit patrons and taxpayers to fund \n     the increase; and\n       (7) Federal legislation is necessary under Article I of \n     section 8 of the United States Constitution to balance the \n     need to moderate and lower labor costs while maintaining \n     industrial peace.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is therefore the purpose of this Act to \n     adopt standards governing arbitration which must be applied \n     by arbitrators resolving disputes involving interstate \n     compact agencies operating in the national capital area in \n     order to lower operating costs for public transportation in \n     the Washington metropolitan area.\n\n     SEC. 403. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Title--\n       (1) the term ``arbitration'' means--\n       (A) the arbitration of disputes, regarding the terms and \n     conditions of employment, that is required under an \n     interstate compact governing an interstate compact agency \n     operating in the national capital area; and\n       (B) does not include the interpretation and application of \n     rights arising from an existing collective bargaining \n     agreement;\n       (2) the term ``arbitrator'' refers to either a single \n     arbitrator, or a board of arbitrators, chosen under \n     applicable procedures;\n       (3) an interstate compact agency's ``funding ability'' is \n     the ability of the interstate compact agency, or of any \n     governmental jurisdiction which provides subsidy payments or \n     budgetary assistance to the interstate compact agency, to \n     obtain the necessary financial resources to pay for wage and \n     benefit increases for employees of the interstate compact \n     agency;\n       (4) the term ``interstate compact agency operating in the \n     national capital area'' means any interstate compact agency \n     which provides public transit services;\n       (5) the term ``interstate compact agency'' means any agency \n     established by an interstate compact to which the District of \n     Columbia is a signatory; and\n       (6) the term ``public welfare'' includes, with respect to \n     arbitration under an interstate compact--\n       (A) the financial ability of the individual jurisdictions \n     participating in the compact to pay for the costs of \n     providing public transit services; and\n       (B) the average per capita tax burden, during the term of \n     the collective bargaining agreement to which the arbitration \n     relates, of the residents of the Washington, D.C. \n     metropolitan area, and the effect of an arbitration award \n     rendered pursuant to such arbitration on the respective \n     income or property tax rates of the jurisdictions which \n     provide subsidy payments to the interstate compact agency \n     established under the compact.\n\n     SEC. 404. STANDARDS FOR ARBITRATORS.\n\n       (a) Factors in Making Arbitration Award.--An arbitrator \n     rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an \n     interstate compact agency operating in the national capital \n     area may not make a finding or a decision for inclusion in a \n     collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of \n     employment without considering the following factors:\n       (1) The existing terms and conditions of employment of the \n     employees in the bargaining unit.\n       (2) All available financial resources of the interstate \n     compact agency.\n       (3) The annual increase or decrease in consumer prices for \n     goods and services as reflected in the most recent consumer \n     price index for the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, \n     published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United \n     States Department of Labor.\n       (4) The wages, benefits, and terms and conditions of the \n     employment of other employees who perform, in other \n     jurisdictions in the Washington, D.C. standard metropolitan \n     statistical area, services similar to those in the bargaining \n     unit.\n       (5) The special nature of the work performed by the \n     employees in the bargaining unit, including any hazards or \n     the relative ease of employment, physical requirements, \n     educational qualifications, job training and skills, shift \n     assignments, and the demands placed upon the employees as \n     compared to other employees of the interstate compact agency.\n       (6) The interests and welfare of the employees in the \n     bargaining unit, including--\n       (A) the overall compensation presently received by the \n     employees, having regard not only for wage rates but also for \n     wages for time not worked, including vacations, holidays, and \n     other excused absences;\n       (B) all benefits received by the employees, including \n     previous bonuses, insurance, and pensions; and\n       (C) the continuity and stability of employment.\n       (7) The public welfare.\n       (b) Compact Agency's Funding Ability.--An arbitrator \n     rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an \n     interstate compact agency operating in the national capital \n     area may not, with respect to a collective bargaining \n     agreement governing conditions of employment, provide for \n     salaries and other benefits that exceed the interstate \n     compact agency's funding ability.\n       (c) Requirements for Final Award.--In resolving a dispute \n     submitted to arbitration involving the employees of an \n     interstate compact agency operating in the national capital \n     area, the arbitrator shall issue a written award that \n     demonstrates that all the factors set forth in subsections \n     (a) and (b) have been considered and applied. An award may \n     grant an increase in pay rates or benefits (including \n     insurance and pension benefits), or reduce hours of work, \n     only if the arbitrator concludes that any costs to the agency \n     do not adversely affect the public welfare. The arbitrator's \n     conclusion regarding the public welfare must be supported by \n     substantial evidence.\n\n     SEC. 405. PROCEDURES FOR ENFORCEMENT OF AWARDS.\n\n       (a) Modifications and Finality of Award.--In the case of an \n     arbitration award to which section 404 applies, the \n     interstate compact agency and the employees in the bargaining \n     unit, through their representative, may agree in writing upon \n     any modifications to the award within 10 days after the award \n     is received by the parties. After the end of that 10-day \n     period, the award, with any such modifications, shall become \n     binding upon the interstate compact agency, the employees in \n     the bargaining unit, and the employees' representative.\n       (b) Implementation.--Each party to an award that becomes \n     binding under subsection (a) shall take all actions necessary \n     to implement the award.\n       (c) Judicial Review.--Within 60 days after an award becomes \n     binding under subsection (a), the interstate compact agency \n     or the exclusive representative of the employees concerned \n     may file a civil action in a court which has jurisdiction \n     over the interstate compact agency for review of the award. \n     The court shall review the award on the record, and shall \n     vacate the award or any part of the award, after notice and a \n     hearing, if--\n       (1) the award is in violation of applicable law;\n       (2) the arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's powers;\n       (3) the decision by the arbitrator is arbitrary or \n     capricious;\n       (4) the arbitrator conducted the hearing contrary to the \n     provisions of this title or other statutes or rules that \n     apply to the arbitration so as to substantially prejudice the \n     rights of a party;\n       (5) there was partiality or misconduct by the arbitrator \n     prejudicing the rights of a party;\n       (6) the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or bias on \n     the part of the arbitrator; or\n       (7) the arbitrator did not comply with the provisions of \n     section 404.\n                                [TITLE V\n\n                     [ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n       [Sec. 501. None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used for improvements to the Miller Highway in New York \n     City, New York.]\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Transportation \n     and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, we are here today to discuss H.R. 2002, \nthe fiscal year 1996 Department of Transportation and related agencies \nappropriations bill.\n  This bill has been a challenge--a challenge to meet the over arching \ngoal of deficit reduction while at the \n\n[[Page S12048]]\nsame time providing the resources necessary to address the Nation's \ninfrastructure needs. The 602(b) allocation for this bill is $12.4 \nbillion in budget authority and $36.561 billion in outlays--$200 \nmillion less in budget authority and $386 million less in outlays than \nthe House allocation. My colleagues should know that the bill as \nreported from the committee is right at its 602(b) allocation for both \nbudget authority and outlays. So any amendment that affects either \nbudget authority or outlays needs to be budget neutral.\n  A number of my colleagues are unhappy that we could not do more \neither for individual projects or for transportation in general.\n  I too wish that more could have been done.\n  The allocation was very restrictive; but, I want to make this very \nclear to the Members. The allocation for the subcommittee was higher \nthan what was implied by the budget resolution that many have endorsed. \nIf the committee had strictly adhered to the budget resolution's \nassumptions for Transportation, both budget authority and outlays would \nhave been reduced even further. The budget resolution assumed \napproximately $20 million less in budget authority and $350 million \nless in outlays. The outlay assumption in the budget resolution would \nhave been particularly difficult to satisfy. To accommodate the outlay \nassumptions of the resolution, the bill would have had to totally \neliminate transit operating assistance, or to put it in perspective, \nreduce the Federal aid highway obligation ceiling by 13 percent.\n  I should point out to my colleagues, the Transportation Subcommittee \nhas limited control over outlays in a given year. Over 69 percent of \nthe total outlays are from prior years' commitments and on top of that \nanother $330 million is outside the subcommittee's control because \nhighway authorizing legislation has made the minimum allocation program \nand the highway demonstration projects exempt from any spending \ncontrols. The net effect is that over 70 percent of the bill's outlays \noccur regardless of what we do in the current year--and next year we \nwill be further restricted in funding new programs.\n  Transportation is unique in another way because it pays for itself. \nThis fiscal year, 1995, almost 76 percent of the budget is financed \nthrough the various trust funds. The bill before you maintains the user \nfee concept. However, in order to address the fiscal year 1996 \nconstraints and to be in a better position for fiscal year 1997 there \nare a number of provisions included that deal with the financial \noperations of the Department and the need for capital and continued \ninvestment in the Nation's infrastructure, such as highway trust fund \nreceipts are not increasing, yet demand for surface transportation is \nincreasing, therefore, I am recommending the creation of State \ninfrastructure banks; in order to assist the FAA better manage its \npersonnel and equipment purchases, bill language on reforming those \nareas is included; to help States avoid a 20-percent reduction in new \ncontract authority for highways in 1996, bill language is proposed to \ngive States greater flexibility over the use of their highway dollars. \nAnd, finally there is direction to the FAA to recover fully the costs \nfor providing services and for administrating various programs.\n  These proposals have a direct effect on the Department's financial \nwherewithal, which should be of great concern to all of us.\n  These proposals are not about jurisdiction They are about providing \nthe tools and the resources that the Department of Transportation needs \nnow and more importantly for the future. We cannot idly sit by.\n  I hope that the financial and management proposals in this bill are \nsupported by the full Senate. I welcome the debate that these proposals \nhave generated. Because they are so important and affect all the modes \nof transportation, I thought that they needed consideration and input \nby the full Senate. As a colleague said, many of these are not new--\nsome of the reforms proposed were first requested by former Secretary \nof Transportation, Elizabeth Dole.\n  Some of the committee's recommendations have already had the desired \neffect, and that is immediate consideration. I hope that the outcome \nwill be that the authorizing committees in concert with the \nAppropriations Committee will propose legislation that makes changes in \nthe way that the Department of Transportation currently does business.\n  I have been very encouraged by the time and energy that members of \nthe Commerce Committee immediately gave to the proposals in the \naviation area; and, I am hopeful that we can reach some agreement in \nthat area. Some form of aviation financing legislation must be enacted \nthis session. On the other provisions, which are offered in response to \ntransportation's overall fiscal situation, I ask for your support.\n  I have also heard concerns expressed about the funding level for the \nICC. The bill before you contains funding to pay for ICC functions that \nwill transfer to DOT, $4.7 million; and funding to pay for ICC \ntermination costs, $13.4 million. These funds were included without \njudgment as to what may succeed the present commission, which will be \ndetermined by authorizing legislation.\n  I want to say that, Mr. President, that we have worked concurrently \nand in close harmony with the authorizing committees, both the Commerce \nCommittee and Environment and Public Works Committee. We worked most \nparticularly with Senator Chafee, chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee and with Senator McCain, the subcommittee \nchairman, on aviation in the Committee on Commerce. We are hopeful that \nthese matters will move speedily to a conclusion.\n  Again, I emphasize that we are not attempting to usurp jurisdiction, \nbecause it is not a jurisdictional question, it is a survival question, \nin many instances, and a question of what our future infrastructure is \ngoing to be.\n  Mr. President, I would like to yield to my close associate and former \nchairman of this subcommittee, Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey, for \nany opening statements he wishes to make relating to this bill. Then I \nwill ask that the next moment be reserved for adopting the committee \namendments, en bloc, and with a tabling motion followed on one of the \ncommittee amendments.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, before I discuss my view of the bill \nthat is before the Senate, I want to take a moment to thank Chairman \nHatfield for the considerable work he has put into this bill.\n  This was tough. The entire Transportation Subcommittee recognizes \nthat we are fortunate to have Senator Hatfield as our new subcommittee \nchairman. Over the last several months, he has demonstrated a unique \nability to provide balance to the discussion and to arrive at a \nconsensus.\n  I am not totally satisfied with the outcome of the bill, and I \nbelieve that the chairman shares my views. Our concern raises \nprincipally because the resources are lacking to confirm our belief of \nwhat ought to be invested in the transportation infrastructure in this \ncountry.\n  We had several hearings, a thorough and complete set. The legislation \nbefore the Senate clearly demonstrates Senator Hatfield's leadership in \nputting this delicately balanced bill together. It probably fails to \nsatisfy almost everyone, and the reason that the bill will fail to \nplease is due to the inadequacy of resources. That is a pure and simple \nfact.\n  I support H.R. 2002, the fiscal year 1996 Transportation \nappropriations bill. I do it, however, with obvious reluctance. My \nreluctance has nothing to do with the chairman's product or any single \nprovision in the bill. Again, I cannot emphasize it too often, it is \nattributable entirely to the shrinking size of the bill itself. It \ncontains $1 billion less than we spent in 1995.\n  Madam President, for the last 8 years, I stood before the Senate as \nchairman of the Transportation Subcommittee, and though I miss that \n\n[[Page S12049]]\nrole, I am nevertheless pleased to continue as the ranking member on \nthe Transportation Subcommittee. I stood here and argued for an \nincrease in balanced spending for transportation, and I make no \napologies, none, for supporting spending that invests in our Nation's \ninfrastructure, spending that boosts our efficiency, our \ncompetitiveness, and our productivity.\n  My view is no different than that of dozens of economists across the \nphilosophical spectrum. While many things have changed here in \nWashington over the years, my views on transportation spending have \nnot; neither have those of the dozens of economists that I refer to, \nwho believe that investments in infrastructure pay off in so many areas \nin our society.\n  Infrastructure investment promotes efficiency. It can promote a \nbetter quality of life as we travel from work to home, home to \nrecreation, or home to shopping or vacation. It affects us, obviously, \nin those ways. The amenities of life are considerably improved.\n  It also affects very directly our environmental condition. Nothing \nfouls the air more than the proliferation of automobiles, trucks, and \nmachines that produce toxic chemicals into our air.\n  We ought not to have to deal with this in an advanced society like \nours. By providing a balanced transportation network, we could avoid \nmuch of that grief and much of those problems.\n  We are short of resources. The bill before the Senate cuts our \nnational investment in transportation by $1 billion. I continue to \nbelieve that cuts of this magnitude undermine our prosperity ultimately \nand harm the traveling public.\n  When I spoke in opposition to the budget resolution that passed the \nSenate, I did so as a member of the Budget Committee. What I had in \nmind when I voted in opposition were moments like these. We all support \nspending cuts that are prudent and well reasoned and in the national \neconomic interest. But the budget resolution does not allow \nselectivity. It requires us to adopt slash-and-destroy tactics. A $1 \nbillion cut in transportation demonstrates that fact.\n  Look at the questions raised by this bill, at the needs it does not \naddress, at the problems it will cause. While air traffic continues to \nrise, we find ourselves required to cut the FAA's operating budget more \nthan $150 million below the President's request. While our Nation's \ncities are struggling to clean the air, minimize congestion, we slash \nmass transit operating subsidies, cuts that will increase fares, \ndecrease service, and push more commuters out on the highways in their \ncars.\n  After Amtrak has already gone through a painful series of service \ncuts and has reluctantly accepted a 23-percent cut in operating \nsubsidies, we are now required to cut them even deeper and trigger yet \nanother round of service reductions. I think that is ridiculous, for \nthe United States, the leading economic power in the world, to have a \nrailroad system that frankly compares to that in some of the developing \ncountries. This Nation of ours is about 50th in per capita spending on \ninfrastructure investments, and we rank way behind the countries that \nhave the leading transportation systems, like France, like Germany, \nlike Japan.\n  I find it an intolerable condition. By the way, so do most, if not \nall, of our colleagues in this Chamber and I believe on the other side \nof the Capitol as well. And, we see it by the requests that come in--to \nme, and I know to Chairman Hatfield--by the dozens, from Members of the \nSenate who had specific projects that they wanted to be either \ninitiated or continue. These were not in the tradition of what is \ncommonly called bacon, or pork--whatever piece of the pig one chooses. \nThe fact of the matter is, these requests were often very, very \nsignificant in terms of development of easier traffic routes and a more \nefficient economy in the region.\n  There again, I hear it from almost all the Senators here--perhaps \nSenator Hatfield has heard more because he is now the chairman. But \nwhen I was chairman, I would get requests from virtually every State in \nthis country, certainly every region.\n  Here we have this incredible aviation system of ours. It handles \nmillions of passenger miles each day. It works superbly. It is safe. \nBut it is late, often. It is insufficient to meet the demands. As a \nconsequence, we see the kind of pricing that I think could be lowered \nif we could expand the system to accommodate the growth.\n  When our Nation's air traffic controllers are working under \nincredibly stressful conditions, we are going to penalize them further. \nWe are going to require a reduction in their annual take-home pay by \n2.5 percent. It does not sound like a good idea, but we are forced into \nthat position because of the inability to fund the needs for FAA.\n  We are making these cuts not because they represent solid policy \nchoices; we are making them because the budget resolution gives us no \nchoice. Certainly, the Appropriations Committee is not to blame for \nthese cuts. The chairman has done the best that he could, and I \nconsider it a privilege and a honor to work with him. It is the best he \ncould do. We are from different parties and different regions of the \ncountry, but we share a common interest in investments in \ntransportation infrastructure. The chairman has done the best he could \nunder the insufficient funding that is available to us.\n  As chairman of this subcommittee for the last 8 years, even when \ntimes were better and more funding was available, I decried the budgets \nat those times because they were insufficient to keep up with the \ngrowth and demands of our Nation. Now, as the resources are reduced \nsubstantially--and, yes, I would like to see us balance the budget, but \nI would not like to see it at a pace that is perilous to the economic \nwell-being of this country, nor would I like to see it in such a way \nthat it deprives us of the opportunity to be the competitive nation \nthat we ought to be.\n  I fought for larger investments in transportation infrastructure. It \npained me to see the list of obsolete bridges that exist all over the \ncountry--a lot in my own State of New Jersey, the most densely \npopulated State in the country, with very dense traffic. It pained me \nto see the inadequate roadways being ever more worn down by excessive \ntraffic. I found it very difficult to accept the kind of intercity rail \nservice and transit service that we see around our country when, again, \nwe are the most prosperous nation in the world.\n  We have made mistakes, yes. But the fact is, we have the ability to \nfinance these things. We have an aviation system straining to meet \nschedules and service requirements because we, once again, are not \nmaking adequate investments. Be that as it may, we are guided, as I \nsaid earlier, by the budget resolution, not by our desires nor our \nbeliefs in what ought to be taking place.\n  This bill, as passed by the House of Representatives, included some \nsubstantial increases, especially in the areas of highway and airport \ngrants and paid for those increases with severe cuts in mass transit \nand Amtrak. The Senate bill before us, however, is almost $400 million \nin outlays below the House bill. As a result, those programs that are \ntreated most generously in the Senate are often frozen. Everything else \nhas been cut.\n  It is my hope that when this bill reaches conference, our \nsubcommittee allocation will rise to the level that is approved by the \nHouse and we will have more money to work with. At that time I hope we \ncan address some of the most severe funding cuts in the bill.\n  Some of the most problematic provisions that I find in our bill \ninclude this provision I discussed, to cut the pay of our air traffic \ncontrollers. I know the incentive pay program, which is cut in this \nbill, was initially designed as a one-time initiative to bring the \nstructure back. It was just after the illegal strike that took place, \nand it was designed to strengthen and fill the personnel requirements \nthat we needed. But now, this is many years later, it is a basic \nelement in every air traffic controller's compensation plan.\n  So it is my hope, when we get to conference and can add more funding \nto the FAA operations, we will be able to avoid a pay cut for our air \ntraffic controllers. They work hard; they earn their money. We want \ntheir nerves to be good and calm, and we want them to be able focus on \ntheir job.\n  I am equally concerned with language in the bill which exempts the \nFAA system from many civil service \n\n[[Page S12050]]\nrules and the language requiring workers on workers' comp to retire, \nsaying to them, ``You have to quit now because you are deriving \nbenefits from workers' compensation.'' It is without, I think, an \nunderstanding that these people may be able to get back to work in the \nnot-too-distant future and would probably like to have their positions \nback if they are able.\n  There is no question, no question in my mind at all, that we need \nserious reform at the FAA. But true reform has to be comprehensive.\n  I hope and I know that the chairman of the Commerce Committee, with \nme, will move forward with appropriate comprehensive reform legislation \nso that we do not need to take this kind of action in the final \nappropriations bill. I know that, if Senator Hatfield was in a better \nposition to provide more funding in the FAA's budget request, he would \nnot be proposing some of these ideas in the appropriations bill. But he \nwas forced to take an action, as they say, to balance the books.\n  Finally, I am concerned with the formula change in transit operating \nassistance. Simply put, the Federal Government has been the partner in \nthe transit systems around the country and has provided some measure of \nfunding. We find it in New Jersey, and I know we find it in States \naround the country. But this program is being cut now by 44 percent, \nwhich means that unless the States can come up with, or the local \ncommunities, or the metropolitan trading area authorities can come up \nwith more money, fares are going to go up significantly.\n  This program is being cut 44 percent, the largest single cut of any \nmajor formula program in the bill. And make no mistake about it, the \ncuts will mean transit service reductions. People are going to have to \npay more to get to work, to get to shopping, and to get around the \ncommunity. So this is going to be painful when these increases finally \narrive at home.\n  The formula has been changed, so that larger urban systems will have \ndisproportionately larger cuts than the more rural, smaller systems. \nAnd it makes the problem even worse in many of the cities, including \nthe cities in my State.\n  I know many people view this provision as a way to spare some of \nthese transit agencies that are most dependent on Federal assistance. \nHowever, this provision can also be viewed as rewarding the very \nmunicipalities that have made the least local funding commitment to \ntransit. I hope that this formula change will be reviewed or done away \nwith during the conference committee action on the bill.\n  Despite all these reservations, Madam President, I once again commend \nmy colleague and friend and chairman for his hard work on this bill. He \nhas done an extraordinary job with the resources available. I thank him \nfor the cooperative spirit and fair-mindedness that he has always \nmaintained throughout the process.\n  I also want to thank the staff people who have been so helpful--on \nthe chairman's side Pat McCann, Anne Miano, and Joyce Rose, people who \nwere part of my staff when I was chairman. They have continued to do \nthe work just as faithfully and just as expertly without any glitches \nas a result of the party change there, people who are committed to the \nassignment of transportation appropriations. And they do it well.\n  And I thank my own staff person, Peter Rogoff, for his continued \nassistance and his personal growth on the job; he has taken over more \nresponsibility and has done more than well.\n  As the chairman has already noted, the bill before us is at its \nceiling both in budget authority and outlays. So any amendments that \nare offered will have to be fully offset in both budget authority and \noutlays.\n  I want to join the chairman in our hope that any of those who have \namendments will come to the floor as soon as possible so that we can \ncontinue progress on the bill.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Joanne Horne, a \ncongressional fellow with the Transportation Subcommittee, be granted \nprivileges of the floor during the debate on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, I thank the ranking member, Senator \nLautenberg of New Jersey, who served ably as the former chairman of \nthis subcommittee--and I had the privilege of working with him over a \nnumber of years--for his eloquent description of the bill and for his \nwonderful support and cooperation in bringing this bill to the floor. I \nmade comments about that previously in my opening remarks. But he was \nat that time unable to be here on the floor present, and I wanted him \nto hear it directly from me.\n\n\n                          Committee Amendments\n\n  Madam President, I have some unanimous consent requests that have \nbeen cleared on both sides.\n  First of all, I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendments \nbe considered and agreed to en bloc, except for section 352 of the \nbill, page 74, lines 1 through 8.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I ask unanimous consent that they be considered as \noriginal text for the purpose of further amendment and that no points \nof order be waived thereon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, I move to table the committee \namendment, section 352 on page 74, lines 1 through 8 at this time. And \nI might just briefly state this committee amendment that was to give \nauthority to the airport agencies; that is, the local airport \nauthorities, to raise the passenger fees from $3 to $5. We got a lot of \nresponse from those effected carriers and other interested parties. We \nthink we have their attention.\n  So I now move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, I am happy at this time to yield to \nthe Senator from Colorado, who I understand has some matters to bring \nbefore the body.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I want to express my thanks to the distinguished chairman and the \nranking member for their efforts.\n  I rise to inquire about a concern I have with regard to the \nappropriations that are described on page 179 of the committee report \nunder the title of ``New Systems.''\n  Madam President, my concern is specifically and my understanding is \nthat our Federal statutes outline the process for the Department of \nTransportation to allocate funding for these new systems on, if you \nwill, a merit basis; that is, after consideration in depth of the \nproject, looking at the benefit it will have, and the cost it will have \nand the local participation it will have. Our Federal statutes \nanticipate that money would be allocated by the Department of \nTransportation on the merit basis.\n  Yet, in looking at the committee report and reviewing the bill, it \nappears to me that what has been done here is the committee has \nearmarked all of the money in that category, and virtually nothing \nwould be left for the Transportation Department to allocate to projects \nbased on their merit.\n  I raise that as a question, and ask the chairman if I have \ninterpreted that correctly or if there are factors that I have not seen \nin reviewing it.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Let me put this in context, if I might. A few years ago \nwhen we adopted the ISTEA legislation, before that time we had \ndesignated these various projects in report language. At that time, the \nauthorizing committee identified those projects within the bill \nlanguage legislating them into law. They identified a total of $666 \nmillion to be expended annually for those designated programs in \nlocations, descriptions, and costs, full-funding agreements and so \nforth. \n\n[[Page S12051]]\n\n  The President sends up his budget by which the Department of \nTransportation expresses its views as to those projects most able to \nundertake the construction, all of the preliminaries being completed, \nand agreements having been signed by the Department of Transportation \nwith those local entities. When you get to a cap on a figure in any \naccount, you obviously then are in a position to have to make \nselections and priorities.\n  We also find that when that legislative authorization has taken \nplace, events tend to change those projects as you get down the road \ninto them. As an example, Los Angeles has been having some recent \ndifficulty in its project relating to its contractor, and as I \nunderstand that is under investigation. Therefore, things are kind of \non hold.\n  If we did not have this earmarking, as the Senator calls it, which \nreally more precisely to try to distinguish it from other kinds of \nearmarks, we set these priorities within that $660 million, we would \nnot have $688 million this year. We were able to take some unobligated \nfunds to add to that to do a little bit more.\n  By the way, we had $1.1 billion in requests from Members within this \ncategory of the $660 million cap. So what we have to do then is to \nidentify those in dollars concurrent to those changing roles or \nchanging rates of action and progress, and so forth. And that is why \nthese are listed by certain number of dollars.\n  Let me take as another example both New York and Portland. In \nPortland, OR, my home State, there was a shortfall in the next to the \nlast increment to complete the light rail system in my city of \nPortland. There were a couple of years of shortfalls in terms of the \nmoneys appropriated by the House and Senate, and so forth, which put a \ntime lag into that project that had full funding and contracting \nalready established. And so by being able to add a little over the \nPresident's request of $106 million, this catches both Portland and New \nYork City up to date, which means we can complete the Portland project \nwith one last increment in 1997. Otherwise, we might be forced into \n1998, which expands the costs, of course, because of the time \nextension.\n  So those are the kinds of judgments we are called upon as a committee \nto make to maximize the dollars for these programs that we are \ncommitted to by contract, authorized and designated in the ISTEA \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BROWN. I understand the projects listed under fixed guideway \nmodernization on 178 do total, or do involve the ISTEA presentation.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes.\n  Mr. BROWN. Am I to understand that the ISTEA priority affects those \nin the new systems as well?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes. Yes, that is correct. And there is a formula that \nyou will find on the guideway modernization, fixed guideway \nmodernization on page 178. Those are allocated on the basis of formula \nset by the Department and in the legislation, ISTEA legislation.\n  Mr. BROWN. I guess the concern I bring is the difficulty of falling \ninto a circumstance where allocation of these funds is based on \ndesignation by legislative acts instead of what should be a merit \nfocused formula that I understand section 5309 of our Federal law lays \nout. I am wondering if that objective criteria is what guides Congress \nin its selection here or if this involves simply an overriding \nobjective criteria?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I can assure you that the basis the committee has used \nis purely merit. I believe that we have similar capacity to executive \nagencies to establish priorities by merit within the body of the \nCongress. I do not assume that only the executive branch can set those \nstandards by merit. You will also find that there is a great \ncorrelation between what has been determined as merit in the committee \nand what the administration has also declared on the basis of merit. In \nother words, our merit basis tends to affirm, one affirm the other.\n  Mr. BROWN. I understand the process that we have in the statute. I \nthink the Senator can see my concern. The statute, as I understand, has \nwith legislative authority laid out some fairly detailed guidelines as \nto how you would evaluate projects, and yet at least from the outside \nit appears that we use a different system in coming up with it.\n  What the Senator is telling me is the statute is used by the \nadministration in what they recommend to the Congress, and that the \ncommittee presumably looks at those ratings in making their decision, \nalthough they are not bound by them.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I am saying basically, yes, that the administration \nsends up its recommendations. Take my city of Portland, for instance--\none of the highest because we are moving toward that completion offered \nby the administration. The addition between what the administration's \nlevel is and what we made on a basis of merit and maximizing the \ndollars and trying to complete the project within the existing contract \nwas to add for the shortfalls of 2 previous years, and certainly I \nthink that is within the prerogative of the congressional body and I \nthink it is based on merit.\n  Mr. BROWN. I appreciate the Senator taking the time to go through \nthis with me. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2328\n\n   (Purpose: To transfer additional funds for mass transit operating \n                              assistance)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Santorum and myself and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself \n     and Mr. Santorum, proposes an amendment numbered 2328.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, at the outset, I add my words of \ncommendation to those already articulated for the distinguished \nchairman of the full committee and the chairman of the subcommittee and \nthe distinguished ranking member for an outstanding job which they have \ndone and acknowledge the very grave difficulties in stretching a \nlimited number of dollars to a great many important aspects of \ntransportation.\n  I serve on the Transportation Subcommittee and advised the \ndistinguished chairman at the markup on the subcommittee of a number of \nconcerns I had, one of which was the mass transit operating \nexpenditures, which have been reduced very materially from $710 million \nin Federal operating assistance to $400 million. These Federal funds \nare used to keep transit fares down and to maintain service.\n  The amendment which I have offered on behalf of Senator Santorum and \nmyself would increase the funding by $40 million in budget authority \nand $24 million in outlays with a series of offsets which total $43.2 \nmillion in budget authority and $24 million in outlays.\n  This amendment is being offered to make some adjustment in operating \nassistance which is relatively minimal--a 10-percent increase but at \nleast some effort to ameliorate and improve the tremendous losses which \nwill be suffered across the country. These offsets have been very \ncarefully calibrated to do the minimum amount of harm to the areas \nwhere the offsets are obtained.\n  For example, on GSA rental payments, there is a $5 million offset in \nboth budget authority and outlays which still leaves the Senate at \n$134.6 million which is above the House figure; a $10 million reduction \nin budget \n\n[[Page S12052]]\nauthority and $6 million in outlays from FAA research and development, \nwhich still leaves the Senate $205.9 million ahead of the House figure \nof $143 million; DOT working capital fund, a $5 million offset in \nbudget authority and $3 million in outlays, which leaves the Senate at \n$95.4 million compared to $92.2 million for the House; the Federal \nTransit Administration, administration expenses, a reduction in budget \nauthority of $2.74 million and outlays of $2.47 million, which leaves \nthe Senate at $39.2 million equal to the House $39.2 million; an offset \nof $1.1 million in budget authority and $1 million in outlays from the \nSecretary of Transportation salaries and expenses, noting a very small \nreduction; and $3.37 million in budget authority and $2.53 million in \noutlays from Transportation planning, research and development, which \nleaves the Senate still ahead of the House $6.3 million to $3.3 \nmillion.\n  I omitted the figure of the Secretary of Transportation salaries and \nexpenses, which still leaves the Senate figure $55.4 million, ahead of \nthe House figure of $55 million. This has been a very, very carefully \ncalibrated reduction in a number of accounts which I think can be \naccommodated without any undue problems.\n  The information which has been provided to me from my Pennsylvania \nconstituent group, the Pennsylvania Association of Municipal \nTransportation Authorities, and also provided to my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Santorum, shows the impact on transit authorities \nacross the State which are very, very substantial.\n  For example, in Wilkes-Barre there would be a loss of $409,000, which \nwould require an increase in fares of 104 percent, from $1.10 to $2.25 \non fares, or a reduction of service of 39 percent, which would result \nin a customer loss of 680,000 riders.\n  In Indiana, PA, for example, an operating loss of $28,260 would cause \na fare increase of 80 percent, from $1 to $1.80, or reduction in \nservice of some 25 percent.\n  There would be losses across the board of a very substantial nature--\nAllentown, Altoona, Harrisburg, Lancaster, Scranton, State College. In \naddition to the ones already referred to, a loss to Pittsburgh of some \n$3.75 million, and Philadelphia, $11.5 million.\n  Now, this is minimal, as I say, Madam President. And I offer this \nmodification with some fine-tuning to an excellent job already done by \nSenator Hatfield and Senator Lautenberg, looking across the entire \nspectrum of expenses in the transportation account. But this is being \noffered in an effort to try to bring some help to the mass transit \nriders. There has been a reduction in the fares for urban areas of 43.7 \npercent, in rural transportation of 19.4 percent, which we had \nconsidered making it a modification and did not do so. But this I would \nconsider minimal and necessary.\n  The point has already been made about mass transit being necessary \nfor the elderly and for the working poor. And at a time when we are \nconsidering the changes in the welfare laws, we really need to keep \npeople on the move in the Philadelphia area, for example. Keep people \nmoving from center city to suburban areas and moving in all the towns \nacross Pennsylvania. I am sure these figures are duplicated, really, \nacross the country.\n  That states the essence of the position. And I would be delighted to \nyield at this time to my distinguished colleague, Senator Santorum.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Madam President. I will join my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania in congratulating the chairman of the committee and \nthe ranking member for their outstanding work on this bill. And I know \nhow difficult it is.\n  The chairman of the committee is often in our meetings talking about \nhow the discretionary funds continue to get cut, and to try to \nreallocate those resources is a brutal task and one that is a thankless \njob, and you have to make tough decisions and you are not going to make \na lot of people happy in that case. And I also say no one fights to \nmake sure that discretionary spending gets a fair allocation out of the \nbudget process more than the Senator from Oregon.\n  I rise to join my colleague from Pennsylvania in what I agree with \nhim is a modest amendment. If you look at what has happened over the \nlast many years to mass transit funding in past Congresses, mass \ntransit funding has suffered a disproportionate share in the cuts of \nthe transportation budget for quite some time and continues in this \nround to suffer again a disproportionate share of the funding cuts.\n  I understand we have priorities, and this was an attempt by the \ncommittee to try to order those priorities. What we are trying to do \nwith this amendment is to try to in some way give back or create a \nhigher priority for mass transit.\n  I think the reason I am so enthusiastic in supporting this is because \nI strongly believe in mass transit and its role, not as just providing \ntransportation to seniors who want to get to the store, which is \nobviously important, but the majority of riders on mass transit systems \nin this country use it to get to work.\n  When you look at what is happening with the reductions in Federal \nfunding and the increase in fares and what that means to particularly \nlow-income families who rely on mass transit to get to work. When I \nserved in the Congress, I represented an area called the Mon Valley, an \nold steel valley outside Pittsburgh. There are communities there that \nare now almost ghost towns, unfortunately. But these communities had \nincredibly high unemployment rates, virtually no jobs. Most all of the \nmills that were in these towns have closed down years ago. And the only \nway they could get to work, because most of them could not afford a \ncar, was to get on the port authority bus, PAT bus in Pittsburgh, and \ngo into town or some other job center.\n  Well, because of cutbacks and the like, they had to discontinue \nservices to a lot of these communities. So these people had absolutely \nno way to get to work. They could not afford a car. Unfortunately, in \nthose areas crime was very high. Insurance rates were very high. Even \nif you could afford a car, in many cases you did not keep a car very \nlong.\n  So it was a difficult task, and I became very sensitized to the \nimportance of mass transit as a link to a lot of urban areas; in small \ntowns, for that matter, the link for the people who live in these poor \ncommunities where the jobs do not exist anymore.\n  There are no jobs in North Philadelphia. They do not have many. If \nyou want to get to work, you have got to somehow get into center city \nor out up into northeast or out in the suburbs. Those are the realities \nof living in urban areas today. And mass transit provides that very \nvital link.\n  I find it ironic we are discussing this the day after we were talking \nabout welfare reform. I have been on the floor here the last couple \ndays talking about welfare reform. And I was in Philadelphia a couple \nmonths ago. We talked with a group of welfare recipients as well as \nadvocates. And one of the things that they highlighted most to me was \nthe need to continue mass transit funding.\n  The response was, ``Why so?'' And it came back with, ``Well, if you \nare expecting these people to go to work, they have to have some way to \nget to work.''\n  Obviously, most welfare recipients do not own cars. They do not have \nthe resources to get a car. Many of them do not have friends who have \ncars or relatives, and they have to use mass transit. As we continue to \ncut back or increase fares, which is going to be the result of the \naction here, we are going to affect the ability for these people to \nhold jobs, and in fact if we are going to make them have jobs on \nwelfare, to get those jobs and collect those benefits.\n  So, that is why I rise in very strong support of this, I think, very \nminor reallocation of resources to recognize the importance of mass \ntransportation for so many Americans who are trying to do what we want \nthem to do, which is get to work, hold a job, and be responsible \ncitizens, tax-paying citizens of our country.\n  I wanted to mention one place in particular just so you do not think \nthis is a problem of the big cities. This bill is, in fact, kinder to \npopulations of under 200,000 people. So the big cities get a little \nbigger hit in this bill than the smaller areas. Maybe that should be \nthe case, because a lot of the smaller \n\n[[Page S12053]]\nareas are more dependent upon the Federal subsidy because they do not \nhave the base of support that a lot of the larger urban areas have.\n  But I wanted to pick up on what my colleague from Pennsylvania talked \nabout. He talked about Indiana, PA. Indiana, PA, is famous--probably \nnot famous to many people, a lot of people here--but it is famous \nbecause it is the birthplace of Jimmy Stewart. In fact, the Jimmy \nStewart Airport--they just had a big commemoration of naming the \nairport after Jimmy Stewart. They opened up a museum there. Indiana, \nPA, is a town in western Pennsylvania that has just a tremendously \ntough time.\n  Indiana County has the highest unemployment rate in the State. It is \nover 20 percent. With these cuts, as was reported by my colleague from \nPennsylvania, it would go from $1 to $1.80; either that or have a 25 \npercent reduction in service. That is going to be a big hardship on \nthis community.\n  So what we are trying to do is just ease the pain a little bit by \nadding some money to this account. I hope that we can get the support \nof our colleagues and stand up in conference and look at the House \nnumbers and try to do a little bit more in recognition of the \nimportance of mass transit for the employment of so many people in our \nurban settings who need to get to work.\n  I want to congratulate my colleague from Pennsylvania for his \namendment and his willingness to stand up and fight for what I believe \nis a very just cause. I am pleased to sponsor him and support him in \nhis effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Airline Fares\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I will just take a moment to describe an \namendment I have discussed with the chairman and the ranking member on \nthis appropriations bill. I intend to offer an amendment that I hope \nthey will accept this evening which calls for a study by the Department \nof Transportation on the subject of airline fares.\n  I come from North Dakota, which is not a heavily populated partof the \ncountry. All of us have understood, I suppose, from our own unique \nperspective what has happened with respect to airlines under \nderegulation. I can tell you what has happened to airlines under \nderegulation for some parts of the country. If you live in Chicago and \nfly to Los Angeles, it has been a wonderful, wonderful thing. You have \nmultiple opportunities to call a number of carriers. You find robust \ncompetition and low prices.\n  If you live, however, in a smaller community, in a rural State, you \ncall the airline and find out that you are paying more. I can get on an \nairplane and fly from here to London and it costs less than it costs to \nfly from here to Bismarck, ND. Let me say that again so people \nunderstand.\n  I can fly from here to London to see Big Ben for less money than it \ncosts me to fly from here to see Salem Sue the Cow, the biggest cow in \nthe world sitting on a hill near New Salem, ND, 30 miles from Bismarck \nairport.\n  Why should it cost me less to fly from here to London than from here \nto Bismarck? Because that is the way deregulation has worked. If you \nhappen to live in areas where there are a lot of folks, you get a heck \nof a deal on airline fares, plenty of opportunities for different \ncarriers and different flights and lower prices. If you live in a rural \narea, you are going to have less opportunity, fewer carriers, less \ncompetition, and higher prices.\n  I am going to bring some charts to the floor one of these days that \nwill entertain the Senator from New Jersey, I hope. They will make a \nsimple point about who pays what for airline travel in this country. \nThe fact is, people who live in rural areas pay through the nose, and \nthe folks who happen to live in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles get a \nwonderful deal from airline deregulation.\n  I want a definitive study done that demonstrates that is the case. I \nknow it is the case, and most folks who live where I do know it is the \ncase. I would like to see a DOT study done, and when that is done, I \nwould like to talk with the folks in the Senate and the House about \nderegulation and what ought to be done to address some of these issues.\n  I want to mention one additional thing to the Senator from New \nJersey, who is obviously now intently listening to this discussion. If \nyou try in today's circumstance to start a new regional airline carrier \nto provide jet service in Maine or North Dakota or some State with a \nmore rural population, what will happen is, you are going to get \nsquashed like a little bug. In the old days, if you had a regional jet \ncarrier, the major carriers were required to do code-sharing and offer \njoint fares. These days, of course, there is no such requirement. So a \nnew jet carrier service begins to provide regional carrier service, and \nquickly finds the service they can provide is from one city to another \nand that is their only opportunity, because no big carrier is going to \njoin with them for joint fares and code-sharing.\n  So very soon they will discover, for example, if you are providing \nservice from Bismarck, ND, to Denver, which happens to be the case with \nthe new regional jet carrier, you cannot if you are traveling from \nBismarck to Los Angeles. The most direct route would be a jet from \nBismarck to Denver and then on another jet from Denver to Los Angeles. \nYou cannot do that, because the major carrier flying from Denver to Los \nAngeles says, ``We don't offer joints fares. That is our judgment. We \njust don't do it.''\n  What is the result of deregulation policy, a policy which would not \nhave existed 20 or 30 years ago? We would not have allowed that to \nhappen. What is the result? The result is, we will not see the \nemergence of robust, energetic, new jet service from regional carriers \nin this country until we decide to change the rules or maybe change the \nlaw and decide that deregulation must be adjusted in those certain \ncircumstances.\n  The first step is to demonstrate with a definitive study about who \ngets the benefits and who bears the cost of airline deregulation, and \nthen to take that study and use it to try to find some sensible \nsolutions to it.\n  So I intend to offer an amendment that simply requires such a study. \nI hope that it will be acceptable to the Senators who are managing this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to respond to our distinguished \ncolleague from North Dakota.\n  First of all, I was struck by a speech we heard the other day, one of \nthe most illuminating and interesting speeches on the floor when the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, stood up and \ntalked about his 14,000th vote, about two votes that he regretted. One \nof major magnitude was a vote that he made against the civil rights \nlegislation in 1964. And he is a man whose knowledge is unchallengeable \nhere. And the other was when he voted for airline deregulation.\n  Frankly, if I was here at the time, I would not have voted to \nderegulate, and I am very interested in all forms of transportation, \nparticularly aviation. In a State like New Jersey, a critical part of \nour structure, our culture, our economy is the airport we have at \nNewark.\n  That does not mean that we have cheap fares, I say to my friend from \nNorth Dakota. As a matter of fact, if you want to fly from New Jersey \nto Washington, you often will pay more than you might to fly to Chicago \nor some further place. So we wound up with higher fares and worse \nservice. At the same time airlines reduced their costs because they do \nnot pay the wages they used to pay, and they do not have the services \navailable that they used to. Now everybody crowds their luggage onto \nthe airplanes, and if you ever traveled with a bunch of high school \nstudents and get hit in the head with backpacks as they walk up the \naisle like a ball down bowling alley, you realize that is not something \nyou are really fond of. I would not be surprised if somebody tried to \nbring a pet elephant or a donkey. But the crowding \n\n[[Page S12054]]\nthat you get on airplanes is almost insufferable.\n  I share the Senator's interests in having a study done. But, I think \na study ought to be committed that would be a little more \ncomprehensive. It should be the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee \nand have a full review of what happened with airfares and with service. \nAnd some of the more rural places are just not going to get a lot of \njet service because of the fact that it is so expensive to offer. But I \nbelieve that service to communities is an essential part of their \nsurvival. We had this debate over essential air service. For a lot of \ncommunities, if you get rid of the airline availability, you almost \ndestroy the economic well-being of those communities. So I would like \nto share with the Senator from North Dakota the request for getting a \nstudy done. But I hope that we can do it with another committee, a \ncommittee that has authorizing jurisdiction and so forth. I will defer \nto my chairman here to see what his views are.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, I would associate myself with the \nremarks of the Senator from New Jersey in responding to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2328\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, I would like to now respond to the \namendment offered by the Senators from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter and \nMr. Santorum.\n  Madam President, first of all, I want to commend the Senators from \nPennsylvania for the careful crafting of an amendment in which they \ntook full responsibility to have reductions to offset the increase they \nare seeking for the transit operating fund. I wish that I could accept \ntheir amendment because I know they speak not only for their State of \nPennsylvania, but for all States that have a system which depends so \nmuch an transit operating aid. I have one in my own State of Oregon, in \nthe city of Portland.\n  Madam President, I have to say, in looking at the total picture as to \nwhat is happening to this fund, not only this year but in the previous \nyear, 1995, it would be, in my view, offering less than full support, \nit would be raising false hope that we somehow are going to reverse the \ntrend.\n  In 1995, that fund was reduced by 12 percent. In 1996, the President \nreduced it from $710 million down to $500 million. He suggested an \nacross-the-board reduction which would turn out to be about a 30-\npercent reduction in transit operating aid to all systems. The House \nreduced it down to $400 million, which translates into about a 44-\npercent reduction across the board to all systems, large and small. The \nSenate suggested the same figure of $400 million that the House did. \nBut we try to draw a distinction between small and large operations.\n  In small operations, on the average, their budget is supported by \ntransit operational aid from 12 to 20 percent in their total budget. \nYou take a large operation and, on the average, it is 4 percent of \ntheir total budget, supported by transit aid. So we took a figure of \n200,000 population and said that under 200,000, it would be reduced by \n20 percent. The lowest percentage of reduction between the President's \nsuggested 30 and the House's suggested 44. We increased the reduction, \nof course, to offset that 20 percent consideration to the small \noperations by increasing the larger ones up to a 48-percent reduction.\n  Let me also add that the budget resolution we passed in this body has \nmade very clear that we are phasing out that fund entirely over the \nlife of the budget resolution. So when you look at all of those trend \nlines as it relates specifically to that particular account we are \ndealing with in this amendment, as much as I would like to be helpful \nand accommodate Pennsylvania and all the others that would be involved \nand affected, I really feel that I cannot do so.\n  Let me also say that all of those deductions that were taken in this \namendment identified as offsets, those accounts have already taken \nheavy reductions in light of the total budget caps that we are working \non. And I again say, almost apologetically, but within the context of \nmy duty and responsibility to keep this appropriation bill and all 12 \nother appropriation bills within the caps, and to indicate a strong \ndetermination moving toward a balanced budget by the year 2002, we just \nhave to come to grips with the fact that we have too little money for \nthe demands and needs and for the justified requirements that are being \nasked here.\n  So I do not want to stop the discussion necessarily, but I will soon \nmove to table the Specter-Santorum amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator would allow me, I wanted to offer some \ndocuments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated July 25 to me from James \nJ. Lutz, from the Pennsylvania Association of Municipal Transit \nAuthorities be printed in the Record, together with a survey of losses \nto cities in Pennsylvania, together with a document showing the offsets \nneeded to increase mass transit.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Pennsylvania Association of Municipal Transportation \n           Authorities,\n                                    Harrisburg, PA, July 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: The Pennsylvania Association of \n     Municipal Transportation Authorities (PAMTA) urges your \n     support to fund the federal transit program including \n     operating assistance at the highest possible levels.\n       The funding levels included in the FY 1996 House \n     Appropriations Bill includes a 43.7% reduction in urban area \n     operating assistance and a 19.4% reduction in rural \n     transportation funding amount other reductions.\n       Pennsylvania's transit systems rely heavily on the federal \n     program for both capital and operating needs. A recent survey \n     of a cross section of medium and small urban systems and \n     rural systems in Pennsylvania shows that fares would have to \n     be increased 64% to make up for the operating assistance \n     reductions in the House bill. Fare increases of this level \n     would likely result in unprecedented losses in ridership \n     forcing fares to go even higher. As an alternative to solving \n     the problem through fare increases, these same systems would \n     have to eliminate 26% of their services.\n       The public transit systems of Pennsylvania have a proud \n     tradition of providing some of the most efficient services in \n     the nation and a proud tradition of quality services to the \n     citizens of the Commonwealth. Affordable fares and reasonable \n     levels of service cannot be sustained to continue that proud \n     tradition with the funding levels included in the House bill \n     (H.R. 2002). For that reason, PAMTA urges your support for a \n     Senate Appropriations bill that improves the levels of \n     funding included in the House bill and provides increased \n     operating assistance and greater flexibility to use formula \n     funds for operating needs.\n       Thank you for continued support. Please contact me at (717) \n     397-5613 if you have questions or require additional \n     information.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                James J.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of the \nbody, Mr. President, we are attempting at this time--the manager, \nSenator Lautenberg, and myself--to ascertain what amendments are being \nexpected for the Transportation appropriations bill. I am told by the \nmajority leader that we will expect to finish this appropriations bill \ntonight.\n  If we can now get the cooperation of our colleagues to indicate if \nthey are expecting to offer an amendment, and if they are expecting to \nask for a rollcall on such amendment, at this point in time I have five \namendments that may be offered on our side of the aisle. Senator Roth \nhas two amendments listed.\n  I would estimate we may have rollcall votes tonight on completing \nsome of these amendments. Senator Lautenberg and I have indicated that \nwe want to move on those which we do not expect to have rollcall votes \nand take up time to complete those amendments. I am not saying there is \na window because I do not have authority to establish the window. But, \nnevertheless, we will try to complete those first for which we do not \nexpect and do not ask for a rollcall vote.\n  We are making inquiry of the majority leader if he could consider \nstacking votes for tomorrow, and we could offer a number of amendments \nyet to be offered and complete those amendments tonight. We do not have \nthat information at this point.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that Senator Pressler, Senator Roth, \nSenator Byrd, and Senator Chafee might be willing to offer amendments \nnow.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a \ntime agreement of 20 minutes equally divided in consideration of the \nHarkin amendment, equally divided between Senator Harkin and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection----\n  Mr. PRYOR. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, will the \ndistinguished chairman please repeat the request.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Senator Harkin is going to offer an amendment now, and \nhe said he would be willing to enter into a time agreement of 20 \nminutes equally divided.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I have no problems with that, and I do \nthank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2329\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Railway Labor Act regarding overseas domiciles \n                    regarding airline flight crews)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment which I send to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2329.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At an appropriate place in the bill, add the following new \n     section:\n       Sec.   . Section 201 of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. \n     181) is amended by adding at \n\n[[Page S12056]]\n     the end the following: ``As used in this title, the term `foreign \n     commerce' includes flight operations (excluding ground \n     operations performed by persons other than flight crew \n     members) conducted in whole or in part outside the United \n     States (as defined by section 40102(a)(41) of title 49, \n     United States Code) by an air carrier (as defined by section \n     40102(a)(2) of such title).''.\n\n\n                                employee\n\n       Section 202 of such Act (45 U.S.C. 182) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following ``As used in this title, the \n     term `employee' also includes flight crew members employed by \n     an air carrier (as defined by section 40102(a)(2) of title \n     49, United States Code) while such flight crew members \n     perform work in whole or in part outside the United States \n     (as defined by section 40102(a)(41) of such title).''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this provision is intended to clarify the intent of \nCongress that title II of the Railway Labor Act, which governs airline \nlabor/management relations, applies to flight crews employed by U.S. \nair carriers engaged in international operations.\n  In 1993, this same provision was included in the transportation bill \nfor fiscal year 1994 and passed by the Senate. The House bill contained \nno provision on the subject. The Senate receded to the House but \nincluded the following language in the conference report:\n\n       The conferees urge the authorizing committees with proper \n     jurisdiction to report legislation during fiscal year 1994 \n     clarifying that the Railway Labor Act extends to flight crew \n     personnel employed by U.S. air carriers who are domiciled \n     overseas and covered by a collective bargaining agreement.\n\n  No action was taken in response to the conferees in 1994 other than \nthe House committee formerly known as the Public Works and \nTransportation Committee held a hearing in October 1994. The Senate \nLabor and Human Resources Committee has taken no action, nor do I know \nof any plans to consider this provision in the future.\n  I believe this is important to make certain that Congress intends \nthat the basic statute which governs collective bargaining involving \nU.S. airline flight crews, namely the Railway Labor Act, applies \nequally to those flight personnel who are engaged in international as \nwell as domestic flying. This provision would ensure that the long-\nestablished principle of maritime laws that applies to workers on board \nU.S. flagships, namely that the law follows the flag of the vessel, is \nalso applied to those flight crew members who work aboard U.S. flag air \ncarriers when operating in and out of foreign ports.\n  As our U.S. airlines expand their operations internationally, it is \nnecessary, in my view, in the interest of uninterrupted air service and \nthe stability of collective bargaining relationships, that the flight \ncrews who are engaged in these international operations have the \nprotection of U.S. law as it relates to their conditions of employment \nto the same extent as their counterparts in domestic operations.\n  Mr. President, let me very clearly state what this does not apply to. \nThis does not apply to ground crew personnel. There was some mistake on \nthat. It applies only to flight crews.\n  In over 50 years of international aviation, there has not been a \nsingle case of a foreign government attempting to assert jurisdiction \nover U.S. airline flight crews.\n  Let me state that again. In over 50 years, not one foreign government \nhas attempted to assert jurisdiction over U.S. airline flight crews, \nnor has the United States ever attempted to assert jurisdiction over \nflight crews of foreign airlines transiting through the United States \nto other foreign points such as Canada, Mexico, or South America. \nBilateral aviation treaties do not reference flight crews, only ground \nemployees. The amendment does not apply to ground employees, only to \nflight crews. That is the pilots and the flight attendants.\n  Furthermore, if there is a remote chance that a foreign country \ndesired to exercise some authority that could easily be negotiated by \nthe U.S. pilots or the flight attendants' union and the airline for \nwhom they work.\n  Again, this amendment tracks the same policy as maritime law for \nmaritime employees. The law follows the flag of the vessel. There is \nabsolutely no conflict-of-laws problem with this. It is simply to \nclarify the intent of the Railway Labor Act.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, the time will be deducted equally from each \nside.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if there is no opposition and no one wants \nto speak, in the interest of time I would be willing to yield back my \ntime--if no one else wants to speak.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum with the time \ndivided equally----\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I withhold that.\n  Mr. PRYOR. If the distinguished Senator would please withhold that, I \nhave a question I wish to propose to the distinguished Senator, my good \nfriend from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Who yields time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa controls the time.\n  Does the Senator from Iowa wish to yield time to the Senator from \nArkansas?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 4 minutes and 45 \nseconds. The Senator from Oregon has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I would be happy to yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If he needs a couple more minutes, I will give it to him.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Chair and the distinguished chairman, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is a very, very complex and far-\nreaching amendment. It has just come to our attention it was going to \nbe offered just a very few moments ago. This amendment is going to be \none that basically, to the best of my understanding after a cursory \nlook, is going to affect and impinge upon 28 commercial treaties that \nairlines now have with respect to countries.\n  Mr. President, further it is my understanding that in the Senate--\nperhaps in the House, I do not even know this--there has never been a \nhearing on the particular issue that our friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa, is bringing before the Senate tonight. We are about, \nif this amendment passes, to extend our own labor laws to other foreign \ncountries. And I do not know how we would react if other countries \ntried to extend their labor laws to this country.\n  So, Mr. President, I think the better part of discretion, I say \nrespectfully, is to turn down this amendment at this moment and to try \nto see if we cannot work something out eventually. In September when we \ncome back, we will have time to study this matter more thoroughly. And \nI urge, Mr. President, the defeat of the amendment offered by my good \nfriend from Iowa, Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes in response.\n  Mr. President, I say to my friend from Arkansas, if I could have his \nattention. I listened to his comments. Mr. President, it is my \nunderstanding, from having worked with this over 3 years now on these \ncommercial treaties, that these treaties only impact ground crews. My \namendment does not touch ground crews; only flight crews, not ground \ncrews. Those commercial treaties only involve ground crews. My \namendment does not even touch that.\n  Secondly, in response to your assertion that maybe this extends our \nlabor laws to foreign countries, no, it does not. It does the same \nthing as our maritime law. If one of our ships is in a foreign port, \nfor example, our maritime laws cover the people on that ship, not the \nlaws of the foreign country.\n  This is well recognized in international law and always has been. As \nI said in my opening comments, in the 50 years of international \naviation, there has not been a single case of a foreign government \nattempting to assert jurisdiction over U.S. flight crews, nor have we \ntried to assert jurisdiction over foreign flight crews.\n  All this amendment says is: If you are a pilot or flight attendant \nand you work for a U.S. airline and you are based in Tokyo or someplace \nlike that, if you are a part of that bargaining \n\n[[Page S12057]]\nunit with that airline, then you come under the same laws as your \ncounterparts flying out of Los Angeles or Chicago or New York. If you \nare not a part of the bargaining unit, of course, then it does not \napply to you. It applies only if you are part of that bargaining unit \ncovered by the Railway Labor Act.\n  Mr. PRYOR. If I might ask my friend a question, has this been looked \nat and have hearings been held in the Labor Committee?\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I said earlier, the only hearing that was held was \nheld by the House Public Works Committee in October of 1994.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Well, I do not have any additional time, but I really hope \nwe could reconsider this issue at a later time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes twenty one seconds.\n  The Senator from Oregon has 8 minutes 14 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is reserved.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have how much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes twenty one seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you. Mr. President, I appreciate the time. I \nwant to support the Harkin amendment. This amendment has been passed by \nthe Senate in the past. Its provision was included in the original \nsubcommittee bill because the language had been cleared by the majority \nand the minority leadership of the Labor, Health and Human Resources \nCommittee.\n  There was an objection raised. An objection was raised by other \nSenators on the provision. And then it was dropped by the full \ncommittee. So, Mr. President, simply, this provision provides for \nfairness for pilots that fly for U.S. carriers but does so between \npoints that are outside the United States. The amendment extends the \nsame collective bargaining rights that apply to the pilots that fly for \nU.S. carriers between domestic and foreign airports to pilots that fly \nfor U.S. carriers from point to point outside the United States. They \nought to be included. I support the Senator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 1 minute 5 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has 8 minutes 14 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, at the appropriate time, when the \ndiscussion has been exhausted, I will move to table the Harkin \namendment.\n  I think the Senator from Iowa realizes very clearly that it was \nincluded in the subcommittee chairman's mark. And the full committee \ntook action to strike it following communications from the authorizers \non that issue. This had been put in the bill 2 years ago, as I recall, \nand then under a threatened veto by President Bush, it was withdrawn. \nSo, consequently, I think it is one of those matters that we ought to \nnot try to incorporate in the bill at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will use the remainder of my time. I yield myself the \nremainder of my time.\n  I just say that I do not know why this is such a problem. It only \nclarifies the intent of the Railway Labor Act and only covers flight \ncrews and only covers those flight crews that are part of the \nbargaining unit in foreign ports. It does not cover ground crews. It \ndoes not disturb the treaties. It passed the Senate 2 years ago. There \nwas not any objection raised at the time. Regarding President Bush, if \nhe objected to it, it was probably part of eight items in a bill that \nPresident Bush at that time said he would veto.\n  But it seems to me now is the time to go ahead and move on on this \nissue and put it behind us and clarify the intent of the Railway Labor \nAct. That is all we are trying to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Iowa is expired.\n  The Senator from Oregon had 7 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Does anyone wish to be heard on this?\n  If not, Mr. President, I move to table the Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back his time?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to table the Harkin amendment, and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL when his name was called. Present.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] is \nabsent because of illness in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBingaman be added as a cosponsor to the Domenici amendment regarding \nthe Petroglyph National Monument during the consideration of the \nInterior bill and as adopted by the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing amendments be the only first-degree amendments in order to \nH.R. 2002 and that they be subject to relevant second degrees; that all \namendments must be offered and debated tonight; and that any votes \nordered with respect to these amendments be stacked to occur at 9:15 \na.m. Thursday morning, with 4 minutes for debate to be equally divided \nbetween each succeeding rollcall vote, and all votes in the stacked \nsequence after the first vote to be limited to 10 minutes each, and any \nvote after the third vote, that there may be 10 minutes for debate.\n  I have a list of such amendments that have been given to the managers \non both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  \n[[Page S12058]]\n\n  Mr. EXON. Reserving the right to object, may I ask my friend and \ncolleague, I was trying to get to my friend the last 2 or 3 hours, but \nfor some unexplained reason there has been such a crowd down there I \nwas unable to break through.\n  I have an amendment that has been cleared, I believe, on all sides \nthat I have not had a chance to talk to the Senator about. I think it \nwill be agreed to by voice vote, but I will agree to just put my name \ndown for an amendment, 10 minutes a side.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. If the Senator would yield, I have listed here an Exon \namendment relating to the Rail Institute. Is that the amendment? One \nmillion for the Rail Institute?\n  Mr. EXON. That is right. I thank you.\n  I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, could I inquire if a Bingaman amendment \nis reserved?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I have a Bingaman amendment relating to DOT on energy \nsavings.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, are there \none or two amendments for me?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I have two amendments for the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROTH. Reserving the right to object, am I on the list?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I have two amendments for the Senator from Delaware, \n[Mr. Roth].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The list of amendments is as follows:\n     Possible Amendments to H.R. 2002 Transportation Appropriations\n\n       Bumpers: essential air service; essential air service.\n       Dorgan: FAA study on airfares.\n       Ford: relevant.\n       Levin: relevant.\n       Simon: FAA.\n       Lautenberg: relevant.\n       Byrd: relevant.\n       Boxer: relevant.\n       Daschle: essential air service.\n       Burns: ICC; relevant.\n       Roth: strike committee amendment on FAA personnel reform; \n     strike committee amendment on FAA procurement reform.\n       Jeffords: relevant.\n       Pressler: Sense of the Senate regarding the Government of \n     Japan's violations against United States/Japan bilateral \n     aviation agreements.\n       Warner: relevant.\n       Harkin: airline labor protection.\n       Chafee: technical amendment on the committee's section 1003 \n     flexibility provisions.\n       Gregg: essential air service.\n       Coverdell: Georgia bridge.\n\n\n                          managers' amendment\n\n       Technical: page 71, line 9, strike ``(b)'' insert.\n       Bingaman: on DOT energy savings.\n       Abraham: striking 3 advisory committees.\n       Inouye: striking in Hawaii under EAS Program.\n       Feinstein: on Orange County Toll Authority.\n       Exon: out of available funds $1 million for rail \n     institution.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate that we do have the \nagreement. All amendments must be debated tonight. The votes will start \nat 9:15 tomorrow morning. The first votes, if they are ordered, will \noccur at 9:15. Votes after that will be 10 minutes each. There will be \n4 minutes between the stacked votes.\n  As I understand, after the third vote you can have up to 10 minutes, \nwhich I trust you would not use. We are on automatic pilot. As soon as \neverybody finishes making speeches, we can go home for the recess.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Did I understand the distinguished majority leader to say \nafter the transportation bill is over?\n  Mr. DOLE. After two more.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2330\n\n (Purpose: To reduce the energy costs of Federal facilities for which \n                funds are made available under this Act)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2330.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . ENERGY SAVINGS AT FEDERAL FACILITIES.\n\n       (a) Reduction in Facilities Energy Costs.--The head of each \n     agency for which funds are made available under this Act \n     shall take all actions necessary to achieve during fiscal \n     year 1996 a 5 percent reduction, from fiscal year 1995 \n     levels, in the energy costs of the facilities used by the \n     agency.\n       (b) Use of cost Savings.--An amount equal to the amount of \n     cost savings realized by an agency under subsection (a) shall \n     remain available for obligation through the end of fiscal \n     year 1997, without further authorization or appropriation, as \n     follows:\n       (1) Conservation measures.--Fifty percent of the amount \n     shall remain available for the implementation of additional \n     energy conservation measures and for water conservation \n     measures at such facilities used by the agency as are \n     designated by the head of the agency.\n       (2) Other purposes.--Fifty percent of the amount shall \n     remain available for use by the agency for such purposes as \n     are designated by the head of the agency, consistent with \n     applicable law.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than December 31, 1996, the head \n     of each agency described in subsection (a) shall submit a \n     report to Congress specifying the results of the actions \n     taken under subsection (a) and providing any recommendations \n     concerning how to further reduce energy costs and energy \n     consumption in the future.\n       (2) Contents.--Each report shall--\n       (A) specify the total energy costs of the facilities used \n     by the agency;\n       (B) identify the reductions achieved; and\n       (C) specify the actions that resulted in the reductions.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is a very straightforward \namendment, and I do not believe it is controversial. It calls for the \nhead of each agency for which funds are made available under the act to \ntake action to try and reduce by 5 percent the energy costs of the \nfacilities used by that agency in the next fiscal year.\n  It is an amendment that is essentially identical to the amendment \nthat we have offered to each of the appropriations bills this year.\n  I do not believe there is any objection to it on either the \nRepublican or Democratic side. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The amendment is clear on this side.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is also clear on this side. We commend the Senator \nfrom New Mexico for offering it.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I urge adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2330) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM.\n   Mr. President, although the Bingaman amendment was accepted by voice \nvote, I would like to be recorded in opposition to the amendment. I \nbelieve that this amendment could open a large loophole for the \nNational Endowment for the Arts (NEA) to continue making grants to \nindividuals that raise the ire of the American public.\n\n  The appropriations bill includes language from the authorization bill \nreported by the Committee on Labor and Human Resources which eliminates \nall direct NEA grants to individuals except literature fellowships. \nThis amendment would add two more exceptions for awards honoring those \nwho have excelled in American art forms and jazz music.\n  The issue of NEA grants to individuals has resurfaced as recent \ncontroversies have drawn new attention to the NEA's practice of \nawarding grants to individuals whose ``art'' offends so many of us. \nWhile the Labor Committee bill's increased oversight of the NEA's \ngrant-making process and Chairman Alexander's administrative changes \nwill be of some help in restoring public confidence in the Endowment, I \nbelieve that the time has come \n\n[[Page S12059]]\nto a draw the line on grants to individuals. Both the authorization and \nappropriations legislation provide that the only individuals eligible \nfor direct NEA grants would be those applying for literature \nfellowships. I believe that the literature fellowships are the only \nworthwhile exception. Furthermore, during consideration of the \nauthorization bill the Labor Committee defeated, by a vote of 7 to 9, \nan amendment to exempt 7 additional categories of grants to \nindividuals.\n  While the preservation of Heritage Fellows and Jazz Masters grants \nwould weaken the Labor Committee's strong stance on this issue, I admit \nthat the grants the Senator from New Mexico seeks to protect are not \nnecessarily part of the problem I have cited. I can understand the \nSenator's interest in maintaining these programs, which honor artists \nand musicians for their past achievements. However, I wonder why these \nawards need to provide grants at all. The cash awarded is a ``thanks \nfor a job well done,'' rather than a subsidy for an artist's first \nworks. I would think that being honored by the NEA for past \nachievements would be sufficient, and would not require a cash payment. \nIf the NEA had taken that route, there would be no need for this \namendment.\n                           Amendment No. 2331\n\n(Purpose: To require the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a study \n                             of air fares)\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Dorgan I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], for Mr. Dorgan, for \n     himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Dole, and Mr. Conrad proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2331.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD.

SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING UNITED STATES/JAPAN \n                   AVIATION DISPUTE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Governments of the United States and Japan entered \n     into a bilateral aviation agreement in 1952 that has been \n     modified periodically to reflect changes in the aviation \n     relationship between the two countries;\n       (2) in 1994 the total revenue value of passenger and \n     freight traffic for United States air carriers between the \n     United States and Japan was approximately $6 billion;\n       (3) the United States/Japan bilateral aviation agreement \n     guarantees three U.S. carriers ``beyond rights'' that \n     authorize them to fly into Japan, take on additional \n     passengers and cargo, and then fly to another country;\n       (4) the United States/Japan bilateral aviation agreement \n     requires that, within 45 days of filing a notice with the \n     Government of Japan, the Government of Japan must authorize \n     United States air carriers to serve routes guaranteed by \n     their ``beyond rights'';\n       (5) United States air carriers have made substantial \n     economic investment in reliance upon the expectation their \n     rights under the United States/Japan bilateral aviation \n     agreement would be honored by the Government of Japan;\n       (6) the Government of Japan has violated the United States/\n     Japan bilateral aviation agreement by preventing United \n     States air carriers from serving routes clearly authorized by \n     their ``beyond rights''; and\n       (7) the refusal by the Government of Japan to respect the \n     terms of the United States/Japan bilateral aviation agreement \n     is having severe repercussions on United States air carriers \n     and, in general, customers of these United States air \n     carriers.\n       (b) Action Requested.--The Congress--\n       (1) calls upon the Government of Japan to honor and abide \n     by the terms of the United States/Japan bilateral aviation \n     agreement and immediately authorize United States air cargo \n     and passenger carriers which have pending route requests \n     relating to their ``beyond rights'' to immediately commence \n     service on the requested routes;\n       (2) calls upon the President of the United States to \n     identify strong and appropriate forms of countermeasures that \n     could be taken against the Government of Japan for its \n     egregious violation of the United States/Japan bilateral \n     aviation agreement; and\n       (3) calls upon the President of the United States to \n     promptly impose against the Government of Japan whatever \n     countermeasures are necessary and appropriate to ensure the \n     Government of Japan abides by the terms of the United States/\n     Japan bilateral aviation agreement.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, this amendment is identical to a \nresolution I introduced several weeks ago. It is simple and \nstraightforward. It calls on the Government of Japan to abide by the \nterms of the United States/Japan aviation agreement.\n  This amendment has a number of cosponsors. It has been floating \naround for some time while we negotiated with the Japanese so we tried \nto contact all cosponsors to reconfirm their support. We were unable to \ncontact all of the cosponsors to notify them of this amendment so we \nhave taken some of the cosponsors' names off of it. At this time, the \namendment is for myself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Brown, Mr. \nBumpers, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Lott, Mr. Pell, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Kerry, and \nMr. Lautenberg.\n  Mr. President, Let me say that for some time we have had an aviation \ndispute with Japan regarding the refusal of Japan to respect the right \nof several of our carriers to fly beyond Japan to countries throughout \nAsia. Several of our carriers--United Airlines, Federal Express, and \nNorthwest Airlines--are guaranteed this right by the United \n\n[[Page S12061]]\nStates/Japan bilateral aviation agreement. Nonetheless, the Government \nof Japan refuses to recognize our carriers' right to initiate new \nservice beyond Japan.\n  On June 20, the Government of Japan agreed to honor the United State/\nJapan bilateral aviation agreement with respect to the cargo dispute. \nThis favorable development was due in large part to the leadership of \nFred Smith, the chairman of Federal Express. Mr. Smith made the point, \nand I agree with him, that it is time that we get tough with the \nJapanese in terms of enforcing our bilateral aviation agreement.\n  Let me add that I think our Secretary of Transportation, Secretary \nPena, has done a good job in this and other international aviation \nmatters. He has done the best job he can despite tremendous political \npressure to put the interests of individual carriers before the \ninterests of our country.\n  Aviation relations between the United States and Japan are an \nimportant trade issue. The Japanese recognize the significant and \ngrowing air service market in the Pacific rim and they want to control \nall the air passenger service beyond Tokyo into China, Malaysia, \nIndonesia, and so forth. They also have a system of trying to control \nmost of the air cargo transportation beyond Tokyo. The travel distances \nare so great on transpacific routes between the United States and Japan \nthat it very difficult for our carriers to overfly Japan. The Japanese \nknow this and they are trying through protectionist tactics to prevent \nour carriers from serving the rapidly expanding Asian market.\n  Resolution of our cargo dispute several weeks ago was welcome news. \nUnfortunately, as I said at the time, the agreement on cargo issues did \nnot put our aviation dispute with Japan over ``beyond rights'' \ncompletely behind us. The passenger carrier portion of the United \nStates/Japan aviation dispute remains unresolved.\n  The Government of Japan continues to deny United Airlines the right \nto fly between Osaka and Seoul, Korea. As our Department of \nTransportation has said, this route is clearly authorized by the United \nStates/Japan bilateral aviation agreement. United Airlines has \npatiently waited while United States negotiators focused on the cargo \ndispute. Now, it is imperative that the United States demand the \nGovernment of Japan honor the rights of our passenger carriers as well.\n  The passenger carrier issue must be redressed promptly. By failing to \ndo so, we are sending the wrong message to countries around the world. \nOur silence on the passenger carrier dispute sends the dangerous signal \nthat it is okay for foreign nations to pick and choose which, if any, \nprovisions of an international aviation agreement with the United \nStates with which they will comply. This is the wrong message. It sets \nan extremely dangerous precedent.\n  On June 20, I, along with 20 colleagues from both sides of the aisle, \nintroduced a resolution calling on the Government of Japan to \nimmediately honor the terms of the United States/Japan bilateral \naviation agreement, On the floor the next day I told my colleagues I \nwould press this issue if the Government of Japan continued to refuse \nto resolve the passenger carrier issue. Several weeks have passed. The \npassenger carrier dispute remains unresolved. This is why I today offer \nthat same resolution as an amendment to the pending bill.\n  By passing this amendment, we will send the Government of Japan a \nstrong and clear signal that the United States Senate expects it to \nimmediately honor the terms of the United States/Japan aviation \nagreement. This is the purpose of my amendment. Simply put, selective \ncompliance with international agreements must not be tolerated. The \nGovernment of Japan must honor the beyond rights of our passenger \ncarriers. I urge adoption of this amendment on behalf of myself and my \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, we are willing to accept the sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment of the Senator from South Dakota on this side.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am a cosponsor. My name was crossed off because \nthey were not able to get in touch with me, but I want to be sure that \nI am listed. I did ask that my name be included.\n  I support the amendment and urge its adoption.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Some names have been crossed off. We are trying to \ncontact those offices. We wanted to be sure, since we drafted the \nresolution a couple of months ago, that we did not list any cosponsors \nwithout their permission. But I think we will have close to 25 \ncosponsors.\n  I urge the Senators--whose offices are listening--to become \ncosponsors of this amendment because it is a signal to Japan that we \nare tired of their behavior under our bilateral air agreement. We are \nabiding by the terms of the United States/Japan bilateral aviation \nagreement. It is time the Government of Japan also honors that solemn \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The amendment (No. 2336) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2337\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for the allocation to certain airports with \n respect to which commercial air service has been disrupted during the \npast 3 years, an annual subsidy under the essential air service program \n  under subchapter II of chapter 417 of title 49, United States Code)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and I \nask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], for himself and \n     Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 2337.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 4, line 2, strike ``$26,738,536'' and insert \n     ``$27,738,536''.\n       On page 4, line 12, insert after ``That'' the following: \n     ``, except if service is provided to the only hub airport in \n     a State that is, as of the date of enactment of this Act, \n     served under a program under subchapter II of chapter 417 of \n     title 49, United States Code, and the service to that hub \n     airport has been discontinued and then reinstated during the \n     36-month period preceding the date of enactment of this \n     Act,''.\n       On page 32, line 15, strike ``$333,000,000'' and insert \n     ``332,000,0000''.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this amendment will allow two airports \nin my region to continue to receive funding under the essential air \nservice program. There two airports, in Rutland, VT, and Keene, NH, \ndepend on this important funding to maintain commercial air service to \nour region. Without this subsidy, commercial air service would halt \nimmediately to these communities.\n  Mr. President, the city of Rutland is the second largest city in \nVermont. Commercial air service is vital to ensure that Rutland can \ncontinue to expand its economy and reach out to businesses throughout \nthe country interested in locating to this beautiful city. Two years \nago, in August 1993, the small airlines serving this city went out of \nbusiness. This left a major gap in the transportation infrastructure in \nRutland. In December 1993, Colgan airlines revitalized the service to \nRutland, recognizing that they would be assisted in their efforts to \nservice this rural city by the essential air service funding.\n  According to many experts, it takes close to 4 years to develop a \nsteady clientele to a small, regional airport. Cologan airlines has \nincreased ridership in Rutland by 21 percent in the last year. But they \nare not close to breaking even and depend on the subsidy provided by \nthe essential air service to maintain service. Colgan predicts that \nthey will not need this subsidy for more than 1 year. If we could \nprotect this small airline route for 1 year, we would be assured a \nviable commercial passenger air service to this region of Vermont and \nNew Hampshire.\n\n[[Page S12062]]\n\n  Mr. President, my amendment will grant Rutland and Keene 1 final year \nof essential air service subsidy. This amendment states that if a \ncommunity has had their commercial air service interrupted during the \nlast 24 months and is the only hub covered under the essential air \nservice program in that State, then funding will continue for 1 final \nyear.\n  Mr. President, this air service is too important to Rutland to lose \nat this point. I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. I thank \nthe managers of this legislation for working with me on this important \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have a question on the amendment, \nand I would ask if we can withhold action until we clear up a question \nwe have. If the Senator from Vermont will agree, perhaps we can move \nalong to the next amendment while we chat about what we see here.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Jeffords amendment, for the \nmoment, be set aside to consider other amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2338\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Boxer and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], for Mrs. Boxer, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2338.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD.

We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If there is no \nfurther debate, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2338) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 42, beginning on line 13, insert the following:\n\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Interstate Commerce \n     Commission, $13,379,000 shall be for severance, closing \n     costs, and other expenses.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, this is an amendment relating to the ICC \nproviding severance pay and closing costs. It has no budgetary impact. \nIt has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2339) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I should like to indicate that we are \nmaking progress on completing this list of amendments. We have not yet \nreceived clearance on one offered by Senator Abraham, one offered by \nSenator Chafee, one offered by Senator Feinstein, one to be offered by \nSenator Gregg, one by Senator Warner--they either have not been cleared \nor they have not been offered--one by Senator Coverdell, two by Senator \nRoth, and one by Senator Burns. Senator Roth has reduced his from two \nto one.\n  As the unanimous-consent agreement did indicate and instructed the \nmanagers and the body, we had to complete all of these amendments \ntonight, and if a vote is required on any one of them, then that will \nbe carried over until tomorrow. So if Senators have a desire to offer \ntheir amendments, we would urge them to come to the floor to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2340\n\n (Purpose: To strike out sections 350 and 351, relating to waivers of \n  the applicability of certain Federal personnel laws and procurement \n              laws to the Federal Aviation Administration)\n\n  Mr. ROTH. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth], for himself, Mr. \n     Glenn, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Pryor, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2340.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 71, strike out line 13 and all that \n     follows through page 73, line 24.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, sections 350 and 351 of the bill now before \nthe Senate would exempt the Federal Aviation Administration from all \nFederal procurement and personnel laws. While I understand and share in \nthe committee's desire to reform the operations of the Federal \nGovernment, I strongly disagree with the approach embodied in these \nsections. In fact, as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I \nam working on a comprehensive reform of Government management \nstructures and procedures. So while I support restructuring and reform, \nI join with Senators Glenn, Cohen, Levin, and Pryor in proposing an \namendment that would strike sections 350 and 351.\n  I want to specifically address the need for procurement reform and \nthe approach taken by the bill. First, I agree with the need for \nacquisition reform, however, the laws are not primarily the cause of \nthe problems at the FAA. The Federal Aviation Administration's troubles \nstem not from the constraints of Federal law but from poor program \nmanagement decisions and lax management. In its reports on high risk, \nthe General Accounting Office cited the FAA's air traffic control \nmodernization project as a prime example of the failure of civilian \nagencies to improve contract management. The GAO stated the project ``* \n* * failed because FAA did not recognize the technical complexity of \nthe effort, realistically estimate the resources required, adequately \noversee its contractors' activities, or effectively control system \nrequirements.'' In 1992, the GAO reported on another FAA program, the \nmicrowave landing system. The GAO found the FAA's decision to move \nforward was premature ``* * * because the capabilities and benefits of \nthe [new system] may be provided by emerging alternative systems''--a \nfailure to adequately define program requirements. The GAO also \nobserved that ``* * * the agency was committing an insufficient level \nof resources [for development]''. Last February, the GAO's report on a \nthird program, the Safety Performance Analysis System, concluded that \n``* * * FAA's current cost estimates for * * * software are subjective, \nnot supported by verifiable analysis, and therefore may not be \nreliable.''\n  Mr. President, these problems cannot be attributed to either the \npersonnel or acquisition laws. Rather, they are a result of poor \nmanagement. Problems of this type can not be effectively addressed by \nexempting the agency experiencing them from laws that affect related \nactivities of an agency.\n\n[[Page S12063]]\n\n  Moreover, the FAA's problems are no different from other agencies. \nNew weapon systems and virtually every major Federal computer system \nare experiencing large cost and schedule overruns, and technology is \nout of date by the time they will be fielded. The primary causes of the \nproblems are poor program management and bureaucratic incentives. \nConsequently, the data suggest that the FAA will experience procurement \nproblems whether or not the procurement laws are waived.\n  Mr. President, the current laws were put in place to address critical \nissues, such as how do contractors deal with the Government in \nexecuting a contract or getting paid. Without such system of \ntransactions, there will be a proliferation of litigation on every \naspect of the relationship between the FAA and its contractors. The \nresult is that the FAA procurement will grind to a halt. The \nCompetition in Contracting Act was created because sole-source \ncontracts were driving costs of government contracts skyhigh and \ndelivering poor quality products. Given the FAA's management problems, \nI am very concerned that lives will be at risk without the checks and \nbalances provided by the procurement rules.\n  I would also like to emphasize that we continue to streamline the \nprocurement system, including special authorities for the FAA. Last \nyear's Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act removed many barriers to \nGovernment procurement of commercial items and services. It added \nstreamlined procurement procedures and provided pay-for-performance \nincentives, which should both make it easier to acquire leading \ntechnologies and improve management incentives. Why should these be \nremoved? Last Friday, the Senate passed Senator Cohen's amendment to \nthe Defense authorization bill that will get rid of the so-called \nBrooks act and implement results-oriented management procedures. The \nGovernmental Affairs, Armed Services, and Small Business Committees are \nworking together to produce additional acquisition reforms. Our bill \nwill be ready at the end of September.\n  Mr. President, in last year's procurement reform bill, special \nprocurement authority was provided to the Administrator of the FAA to \ntest waivers of each of the procurement laws that the appropriations \nbills identified. Why have a blanket exemption before we know the \nresults of the test program? What additional flexibility is required?\n  As with the waiver of the existing procurement laws, equally \ntroubling is section 350 of the bill which waives most provisions of \ntitle 5, the Civil Service personnel laws. This section would allow the \nFAA to unilaterally set up an entirely new personnel system, which sets \nup a terrible precedent for personnel policy reform. Clearly there is a \nneed for a complete overhaul of our civil service system. A \ncomprehensive reform package is something that I have a deep interest \nin moving through the Governmental Affairs Committee, the committee \nwith jurisdiction over personnel and procurement laws. However, this \nprovision would start us down the path of a piecemeal approach for \ncivil service reform and allow for a completely new personnel system \nincluding a new pay structure, pension and health benefit formulations, \nhiring and firing practices.\n  Mr. President, there is no documentation or data to support such a \ndrastic approach. A blanket waiver of Federal law is a dangerous \nprecedent to set in an appropriations spending bills. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Roth-Glenn amendment to strike.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to support and cosponsor the \namendment offered by Senator Roth about which he just spoke. Senator \nRoth is the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, of course. \nThis amendment will strike section 350 and 351 of the appropriations \nbill for the Department of Transportation. Now, if passed, these \nsections would waive civil service laws and procurement laws and \nregulations at the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  Before I even address the merits of these sections--though I feel \nthey are premature, for as I understand it there are currently several \nproposals on the table to privatize the FAA--and some of those \nproposals include either or both civil service and procurement reforms. \nSo there is just no logic to legislating in this area before the \ndecision to restructure the FAA has even been made.\n  With that said, I do have some substantive objections to both of \nthese provisions.\n  First, with respect to the waivers of civil service laws, section 350 \nof the bill would direct the Secretary of Transportation to create and \nimplement a new personnel system for the Federal Aviation \nAdministration by January 1, 1996, next January, without regard to \ntitle 5 or any other Federal personnel law.\n  Such a system shall, according to the bill's provisions, provide \ngreater flexibility in hiring, training, compensating, and locating \npersonnel.\n  The appropriations bill language contains no accountability to the \npublic or to the Congress of conflict of interest laws and merit system \nhiring principles for this new personnel system.\n  It does not require public comments. It does not require public \nnotice for this new system. It does not provide any role for the Office \nof Personnel Management to be involved in the creation of this new \nsystem.\n  Instead, I think the language of the bill is reckless. It simply \ndemands that a new system be in place in less than 6 months. It just \nsays, new system be in place in less than 6 months.\n  Well, do we want the employees under the new FAA to be subjected to \nconflict of interest laws? Do we want these employees to be subject to \nthe ethics laws? I think we do. Do we want merit systems principles to \nbe followed in hiring practices? I think we do.\n  I believe we can work cooperatively on legislation that builds these \nsorts of safeguards into a new personnel system for the FAA. But as the \nbill now stands there are no safeguards. The appropriations bill \ndirects the Secretary of Transportation to offer flexibility in \ncompensation without regard to title 5.\n  Employee compensation includes wages, includes health benefits, \nincludes pension benefits. If the Secretary of Transportation were, let \nus say, to offer employees under FAA's new personnel system greater \npension benefits than those enjoyed by other Federal employees, it \ncould present a new tax burden to the American taxpayer.\n  In short, Mr. President, this sort of authorizing legislation has no \nplace on an appropriations bill. I do not believe it has been \nthoughtfully examined or reviewed. With respect to the procurement side \nof things--and this gets even more sticky--this section is not only \nimprudent, I think it is haphazard, and I think it is without \njustification.\n  Section 351 waives several procurement laws and the Federal \nacquisition regulations.\n  This provision provides for the Secretary of Transportation, in \nconsultation with nongovernmental experts in acquisition management, to \ngo right ahead and develop and implement an acquisition management \nsystem for the FAA.\n  So, in essence, the companies who benefit from the FAA's largess \nwould now be helping to develop the system under which they would \ncontinue to do business with the FAA. This is just flat wrong, \nespecially when taxpayer dollars are involved, and there are going to \nbe a lot of them involved.\n  Let me go through some of the following laws which would be waived. \nLet me go through them in full.\n  First, the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. \nIf exempted from this law, the FAA would no longer have to follow \nGovernment procurement procedures, including the Truth in Negotiations \nAct providing for cost data and pricing data for very high-priced \nprocurements.\n  The Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act: The FAA could establish \nits own policy for acquiring the products and services it needs and \nwould be exempt from the strict, yet very effective procurement \nintegrity laws which bind both Government and industry.\n  They would be exempt from the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of \n1994. This act was passed just last year. Among many other reforms, it \nspecifically gave FAA the very broad pilot authority to free them from \nthe procurement laws and give them the flexibility to move quickly, to \nimplement \n\n[[Page S12064]]\nnew technology and ideas and bring in new contractors when needed. \nCongress has already bent over backward for them. The time is not ripe \nto abandon any organized acquisition system at the FAA.\n  I add, Mr. President, we spent over 3 years putting together that \nFederal Acquisition Streamlining Act, FASA, as it is called. We worked \non the Governmental Affairs Committee about 2 years to put together the \nideas of streamlining Federal procurement. We worked through the Armed \nServices Committee with the Pentagon to establish what is called an 800 \npanel that gave their recommendations on streamlining procurement. We \nworked with the National Performance Review of this administration when \nthey came in. Working altogether in a collegial fashion, we put \ntogether what is an excellent, new Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act \nof 1994. That will get knocked out, even though we provided the \nflexibility FAA says that they want.\n  Another act that will be involved is the Small Business Act. The \nelimination of this section means the elimination of small business \nset-aside programs and assurances that small businesses are treated \nfairly in the award-decision process.\n  Mr. President, let me finish my statement and then I will yield the \nfloor. I will be just about 2 or 3 more minutes.\n  Another one is the Competition in Contracting Act. With the waiver \nfrom CICA, the FAA would not have to conduct its acquisitions using the \npresent standard of full and open competition which lets all offerors \nin at the outset of a procurement.\n  I think it is interesting to note that, as drafted, this section \nleaves the FAA subject to CICA's predecessor, 41 U.S. Code 5, the most \nbasic procurement statute, under which the competition standard was \n``maximum practicable.''\n  This statute requires that purchases and contracts be advertised, \nsubject to exceptions, such as for urgency or being the only known \nsource. The requirements for the exceptions to competition are less \nstringent than under CICA. Is this really what the appropriators \nintend? I do not think so.\n  Another one is GAO protest authority and the Brooks ADP Act. Under \nthese sections, the FAA would be exempt from the GAO and GSBCA bid \nprotest processes. That would leave the FAA subject to protests in \ncourt, a much more time-consuming and expensive process than either the \nGAO or the GSBCA. It would also take away GSA's delegation of \nprocurement authority or for the FAA's acquisition of computer and \nother technology.\n  The Federal Acquisition Regulations: By waiving the FAR, the FAA \nwould be exempt from all regulations pertaining to procurement.\n  By waiving all of these laws and regulations, there will be no hard \nand fast rules governing business between the Government and the \ncontractor. How are we going to do business? How are contractors going \nto litigate disputes they have with the Government on ongoing \ncontracts?\n  In short, Mr. President, this section of the proposed bill eliminates \nthe current system of checks and balances which has developed in \nresponse to problems over the years.\n  I know that probably the proponents of this part of the legislation \nwill say that we have a statement of administration policy that backs \nthis up, but I quote from that statement of administration policy where \nit said that their support for this includes fast-track authority for a \ndepartmental reorganization plan and Federal Aviation Administration \npersonnel and procurement reform which the administration has proposed \nas part of comprehensive FAA reform.\n  I do not quarrel with that. They do want some reform in this, but \nthis is for a departmental reorganization, not for details of \nprocurement we are talking about here.\n  I will add that we have asked them for a clarifying letter, and \nbefore there is a vote on this tomorrow morning, we will have that \nclarifying letter sent over to us from the Office of Federal \nProcurement Policy and, hopefully, from the Office of Management and \nBudget Office itself. So we will have that before there is a vote on \nthat tomorrow morning.\n  So for all these reasons, Mr. President, I hope that we will have \ngeneral support for the amendment by the distinguished chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Senator Roth, to strike this section.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for Senator Roth's amendment. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2002) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Transportation and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 1996, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n                           Amendment No. 2340\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the pending Roth \namendment, to strike language from the pending legislation.\n  Mr. President, I understand and appreciate the amendment of the \nSenator from Delaware. Clearly, it is very significant legislation on \nthis appropriations bill. I do, however, want to point out that the \naction of the Appropriations Committee does have a certain logic \nassociated with it. Right now, the amount of money that is going to be \nappropriated for 1996 is $8 billion; $6 billion of that comes from the \naviation trust fund, which we know comes from fees, services, et \ncetera, and $2 billion \n\n[[Page S12065]]\ncomes from general revenues. The Appropriations Committee is required \nto come up with an additional $2 billion in revenues, which is what \nthey are required to do in keeping with their obligations.\n  Mr. President, I can certainly understand why the Appropriations \nCommittee would seek action on the part of the authorizers or take \naction on their own in order to streamline the procurement process, \nstreamline the personnel process and bring about the necessary changes, \nso that they will not be required, in these years of ever-declining \nbudgets and ever-increasing cuts in expenditures, to come up with that \nadditional $2 billion.\n  I have had numerous conversations with the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Hatfield. I have been working on a bill with his \nstaff, with the Secretary of Transportation, with Senator Ford's staff, \nand others, in coming up with legislation which would be, I say to my \nfriend from Delaware, sequentially referred to the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, because, clearly, the chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee has oversight over procurement or personnel reform. But this \nwould all be in the context of the reclamation of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration.\n  So I appreciate what the Appropriations Committee has done in an \nattempt to rectify the imbalance of some $2 billion that has to be \nfound. I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, because I \nbelieve that if we get this legislation done, which will encompass more \nthan just the revenues that the Appropriations Committee needs, but \nalso a long, long overdue reformation of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. I do not want to talk too long because the hour is \nlate.\n  In case you did not hear, today, again, there was a power outage in \nnorthern California. Hundreds of planes were grounded all over northern \nCalifornia. There was a certain risk--I do not know how much--because \nplanes were flying around all over northern California not under radar \ncontrol. This is only one of a series of outages in the last couple of \nmonths. There was also one in Chicago.\n  Clearly, there is something very wrong with the procurement process \nin the FAA when they are using vacuum tubes which they have to scour \nthe country to get in their computers, and they are still writing down \nthe name of an airplane and passing it to the person at the next radar \nscope. I do not want to go on very long because of the lateness of the \nhour, but it is clearly a compelling requirement to reform our \nprocurement process as far as FAA is concerned and reform the personnel \naspect of it and, very frankly, make them at least a quasi-independent \nagency.\n  Mr. President, I am not often in the business of defending the \nAppropriations Committee, but there was an article in the Congressional \nMonitor this morning that said, ``Pork may shrink, but Senator Byrd \nstill gets biggest slice.'' It goes on about how much money is \nappropriated in the transportation bill for the State of West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, that is incorrect. That was in the report language; it \nwas not bill language. As we all know, report language is not \nmandatory. I hope that can be corrected in this and other periodicals. \nThat is not the kind of earmarking that is alleged here and, very \nfrankly, overall, I think this bill is largely free of that kind of \nthing. I think the chairman and ranking member of the committee are to \nbe congratulated.\n  I, however, make two additional comments. One is concerning the Port \nof Portland. I will have a statement for the Record. I do not approve \nof $50 million to the Port of Portland to retire a debt, with an \nadditional $10 million to make improvements in the shipyard.\n  One additional comment. While I was in the cloakroom, an amendment \nwas accepted by Senator Bumpers concerning essential air service, \nwhich, once you get through the language and match it up with the bill, \nbasically carves out an exception for an airport. Obviously, that would \nnot otherwise qualify for these funds. I object to that, obviously. \nBut, also, I say that it is a reason why we should authorize these \nthings rather than put them into appropriations bills.\n  I also want to say again, while the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee is here, he and his staff have worked diligently in \ncooperation with me and my staff. I believe that significant \nimprovements have been made, and I am pleased to note that most of the \nappropriations bills I have seen are largely the kind that I think \nAmericans would be proud of.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds so \nthat I might propound a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1026\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I had an inquiry of the Senator from South \nCarolina when he properly filed a cloture petition on the defense \nauthorization bill for Friday. At the time, I was not aware that there \nwas a previous DOD pending motion on cloture that might be called up \ntomorrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that if a cloture vote is called for tomorrow \non the defense authorization bill, the Senator from Nebraska be allowed \n10 minutes preceding that vote for appropriate remarks.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I have a matter I would like to discuss \nwith the Members, with the manager of the bill.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I hope the Senator from South Dakota \nwill withhold on this third amendment question for a moment. I think \nthe last speaker on this pending Roth amendment --and then I would like \nto take action on it--is the Senator from Michigan. He said he is going \nto be brief. I would like to complete this business before we turn to a \nnew piece of business.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. OK.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2340\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Oregon.\n  Mr. President, sections 350 and 351 in the bill before us would \nexempt the Federal Aviation Administration from the application of \nFederal acquisition laws. Now, in particular, ``Section 351 states that \nthe following laws shall not apply to the FAA.''\n  The bill before us says that the following laws will not apply to FAA \nacquisitions: competition in contracting; the FAA does not have to \nfollow that one. Bid protest laws; the FAA does not have to follow \nthat. Federal Procurement Policy Act; they are exempt from that one. \nLast year's Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act; they are exempt from \nthat one. The Small Business Act. The Uniform Federal Acquisition Form \nRegulation.\n  Now, our acquisition laws that apply to every Federal agency to \nrequire competition, allow for bid protests that protect us from \nimproper expenditures, such as expenditures on recreation, on \nadvertising, FAA is going to be exempt from all of them. We are doing \nall this on an appropriations bill.\n  I think I understand the frustration of the appropriators--at least I \ntry--in terms of getting a resolution of some of the procurement \nproblems which the FAA has faced.\n  But there has been no request to the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nthat I know of, and I believe that the chairman knows of, from the FAA, \nfor exemption from our procurement law.\n  We adopt procurement laws for the Government. If the FAA has problems \nwith it, they ought to come to the Governmental Affairs Committee and \nseek an exemption.\n  I make a parliamentary inquiry. My parliamentary inquiry is this: If \na bill were filed to exempt the FAA from the procurement laws of the \ncountry, what committee would that bill be referred to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  As far as I know, there has not been a bill that has been introduced \nto exempt the FAA from procurement laws. These are serious laws. I \nreally believe deeply that if there were a bill introduced to exempt \nthe Defense Department from procurement laws, and on \n\n[[Page S12066]]\nan appropriations bill, the Defense Department was suddenly going to be \nexempt from all of our competition laws, all of our laws that protect \nbid protests, our laws that stop expenses for entertainment, for \nadvertising, all the work we have done for defense procurement, I think \nmost of us would say, ``Wait a minute, there are problems with \nprocurement laws.''\n  On an appropriations bill, to exempt the Defense Department even with \nits duty to secure the safety of our forces and security of this land, \nwe cannot give a blanket exemption on an appropriations bill, as \nfrustrating as it may be to the Defense Department all these years to \nbe governed by a procurement act.\n  I am not familiar with the FAA procurement problems. Being a member \nof the Governmental Affairs Committee, I think this should have been \nbrought to the attention of the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to make an inquiry of the \nSenator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Could I ask the Senator from Delaware whether or not to \nhis knowledge the Governmental Affairs Committee has been requested to \nexempt the FAA from the procurement laws of this country?\n  Mr. ROTH. I say to my distinguished colleague that I have no \nknowledge of such a request from the FAA.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to frame this in a form of a question. I do \nnot know if the Senator from Michigan is aware that last week we did \nhave a hearing in the Aviation Subcommittee concerning FAA \nreorganization, with all witnesses stating that procurement reform, as \nfar as FAA is concerned, and personnel reform are two critical issues \nthat need to be addressed.\n  So in deference to the chairman of the committee, it is an issue that \nhas been raised by the Secretary of Transportation and the \nAdministrator of the FAA.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No, no, I have no greater respect for any Member of this \nbody than I do for the Senator from Oregon, so I know that this is a \nproblem which he has had a headache with.\n  I have established, however, that the committee that has jurisdiction \nover the procurement law has not been asked by the FAA for an exemption \nfrom those laws. The hearing which my friend from Arizona is referring \nto is a hearing in front of the Commerce Committee.\n  My point is that the committee with jurisdiction over procurement \nlaws, which is the Governmental Affairs Committee, has not had this \nproblem brought to its attention.\n  Now, I know the Senator from Oregon has had plenty of material \nbrought to his attention and there is a big problem here which he is \ntrying very much to get some assistance on somewhere to bring to \nsomeone's attention to resolve. I respect that a good deal.\n  All I am simply saying is that the committee that has jurisdiction \nover the procurement laws has not had that problem or been made aware \nof the problem through no fault of the Senator from Oregon or anybody \nelse, but it has just happened. No bill has been filed to exempt the \nFAA from the laws nor has the FAA come to the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee to make a request for exemption from these laws.\n  Now, the administration has given us a statement of policy. I know \nthat this was solicited from them and there is a good-faith effort here \non the part of the managers to try to implement their request and carry \nit out.\n  The administration's written request says that they ``support fast \ntrack authority for departmental reorganization plan,'' which is not \nbefore you as I understand it, ``and Federal Aviation Administration \npersonnel and procurement reform which the administration has proposed \nas part of comprehensive FAA reform.''\n  We do not have the comprehensive FAA reform in front of the Senate. \nThat is where they have said that they support personnel and \nprocurement reform. It is that general. But it is only after part of a \ncomprehensive FAA reform do they say that they have supported personnel \nand procurement.\n  Now, that puts the managers in a difficult position, which I can \nunderstand because the administration has asked for personnel and \nprocurement reform but as part of a comprehensive FAA reform. We do not \nhave the comprehensive FAA reform before us.\n  So the question is, what is the administration position on doing it \nseparate and apart from comprehensive FAA reform? I suggest we are \ntrying to find out. We hope to find out by the time dawn breaks on this \nCapitol of ours.\n  Let me close, then, by just simply saying that to give an agency on \nan appropriations bill a blanket exemption from our procurement laws \nreally is a recipe for chaos. There is nothing to take their place. All \nthat the bill says is that the Secretary of Transportation should \ndevelop an acquisition plan for the FAA. Anything goes. The rest of the \nGovernment is going to be governed by law.\n  This agency is going to have its own law as determined by its own \nSecretary, and anybody who wants to do business with this Government \nbetter start learning two sets of law: One is for the Government except \nthe FAA, and another set of procurement laws is determined exclusively \nby the Secretary of Transportation--mind you, not by law, not by \nCongress, but by the Secretary of Transportation. People are going to \nhave to learn that second set of what I would call regulations, because \nthey surely are not laws.\n  Again, I said ``finally'' once, and this time I will really mean it, \nbut I think a year or 2 years ago we established a pilot program for \nthe FAA. I do want to emphasize this. I know the Senator from Delaware \nhas pointed this out, but I want to emphasize just this fact: We have \nauthorized the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a pilot test of \ninnovative and alternative procurement procedures. We authorized a \npilot program. We do not have the results from that program.\n  So, here it is that the agency got that authority, I believe, from \nthe Commerce Committee in law, and the Federal acquisition specifically \nauthorized the FAA to undergo this pilot study in the area of \nacquisition, and before the results are in we are exempting that agency \nfrom procurement law.\n  While I think I can feel at least part of the frustration which the \nchairman and ranking member feel, I do not feel this is the right way \nto go about giving them kind of a different criteria for their \nacquisition in the rest of the Government.\n  I thank my friend from Oregon for making it possible for me to give \nmy remarks at this point before the Senator from South Dakota gave his. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I am going to make a response now to \nthis amendment to complete the debate on this so we can put it in line \nfor a vote tomorrow, and that I will move to table the amendment \nfollowing my brief remarks.\n  Does the Senator wish recognition?\n\n\n                  Unanimous-Consent Agreement--S. 1026\n\n  Mr. EXON. Could I ask unanimous consent for 10 seconds? My friend and \ncolleague from Arizona has no objection that he had earlier.\n  I ask unanimous consent that if there is a cloture vote on the DOD \nauthorization bill tomorrow that the Senator from Nebraska be allowed \n10 minutes prior to the vote for the purposes of making appropriate \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2340\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I yield to the Senator from South Dakota. I would like \nto complete this particular issue, but if the Senator is raising \nanother issue, I guess he would have to do it by unanimous consent \nanyway.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I will do whatever the chairman says.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. If the Senator would bear with me for just a few \nmoments, we are trying to proceed in an orderly fashion here and \ncleaning up these amendments as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, just a brief response to the proponents of this \namendment. Let me make clear first of all to the Senator from Michigan, \nwe did not solicit this administration statement. The administration \nsubmits such a statement to every appropriations bill, so this was a \npart of a normal routine. \n\n[[Page S12067]]\nThis administration policy statement is dated as of August 9--which I \nbelieve is today, since August 10 is tomorrow, President Hoover's \nbirthday.\n  Mr. President, I would like to say this. The administration \napproached us. Let me relate the story that the administration gave to \nus in desperation, to try to get some kind of help in a very serious \nsituation. We are not talking about jurisdiction of one committee or \nanother committee. That is important for our process. Nevertheless, the \nadministration says to us that, for years--not just this year--but for \nyears, one FAA administrator after another has talked about this, has \npled to get out of the Federal personnel and procurement rules because \nthey need to maintain the safety and the modernization of the whole \noperation. Over the last 2 years, Secretary Pena and Adminstrator \nHinson have continued to focus on this as a major problem facing the \nFAA. They tell us this particular story. They say the FAA technology, \nthe air traffic control system, is based on 30-year-old technology. I \nam greatly concerned when I think of the massive air transportation in \nour country today and throughout the world, that we are depending on \n30-year-old technology.\n  The Senator from Arizona mentioned a moment ago about vacuum tubes. \nThey told us the FAA is the largest consumer of vacuum tubes today, \nwith funds in this bill designated to buy $7 million more of vacuum \ntubes, a technology that was thrown out by the private sector 20 years \nago; 20 years ago.\n  I think that ought to give us a pretty major signal this is not just \nsome effort to try to escape rules or regulations set down. Because, as \nI say, they approached us, really, in a state of desperation.\n  Let me illustrate it further, as they did to me. The Boeing 777 has \nas much computing power today as existed in the whole world a few \ndecades ago--one airplane. As much or more than the whole world had in \ncomputing power, they now carry. I think we should have an ATC system \njust as advanced, helping to protect our planes and the people who fly \nin them.\n  They tell me that these changes that they gave us, in the technical \nlanguage, to incorporate in this bill, would do much to help improve \nthe situation that has reached this kind of a crisis. I think also, as \nwe note in the committee report, we are facing tremendous budgetary \npressures this year. We are going to face greater ones in 1997.\n  Let me repeat what I said earlier today in the presentation of this \nbill. In this bill, 70 percent of that funding is prior year \ncommitment, and it is going to be greater in 1997. So we are squeezed \ndown with the money, the demands for new technology, and the demand for \ngreater safety continues to escalate. Also, the FAA tells us if they \ncould have this kind of operational flexibility, they believe they \ncould cut as much as 20 percent out of the procurement budget than what \nthey are forced to spend today.\n  I have just here, August 9 dated, again, the Airport Report, which is \na publication of the American Association of Airport Executives. The \nPresident, Mr. Charles Barclay, says:\n\n       The existing governmental personnel and procurement rules \n     serve as a straitjacket at FAA.\n\n  Now, there is no one who admires and respects our orderly procedures \nand our methods of procedure, our jurisdictions, more than I. But I \nhave to say that in many instances over the time I have served in the \nSenate, when authorizing committees either have failed or where they \nhave been not been able to move within their own committee, they have \napproached the Appropriations Committee as a vehicle to get the action \naccomplished. I remember when Senator Thurmond, of South Carolina, as \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, came to me back a few years ago \nand said, ``Would you take the crime bill and put it on an \nappropriations bill to get this before the body and get it passed?'' I \nremember when Senator Percy, former Chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee said, ``Would you put on the foreign assistance authorization \nbill?\"\n  So, for years the committee has been approached by authorizers and by \nothers as well to assist in moving something that had somehow bogged \ndown, for whatever reasons. I am not faulting the authorizing \ncommittees. I have to say we gave notice we were going to take action \non some of these things that were legislation on appropriations. I have \nindicated, also, we would like to see the kind of taking over of that, \nand we would be happy to relieve ourselves of that burden, within the \nconference committee, if we could see the substitution of the \nauthorizers taking hold of something the administration has asked us to \ntake emergency--what you would call emergency action on.\n  We have enough problems without reaching out, trying to do the \nauthorizers' work. That is not our intent. But, nevertheless, I have to \nput it in that kind of context. That led us to take this particular \naction.\n  I have to, again, thank the Senator from Arizona for his kind \nremarks, and for clarifying again this relationship that we have with \nhim as well as the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee \nSubcommittee on Aviation. We have full confidence in our authorizers. \nWe have full confidence in our Governmental Affairs Committee. But \nnevertheless, the administration approached us with this crisis and \nsaid, ``Will you help?'' And we responded by saying, ``Yes, we will \nhelp.''\n  Now, I do not want to cut off anyone on this.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I am about ready to make a motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to briefly comment to my \nfriend from Oregon. First, the Governmental Affairs Committee has not \nbogged down on this issue. It has never been asked to modify the \nprocurement laws for the FAA. It is not a bog down of the committee \nwith jurisdiction. There has never been a request.\n  Second, I have to agree very strongly, this is not a question about \nwhich we should get involved with jurisdiction, because that is not the \nissue. The issue is the procurement laws and who they are intended to \nprotect. They are intended to protect the taxpayers of this country.\n  The Defense Department, I can assure you, will tell you they could \nsave 20 percent of their procurement budget if they did not have to \nfollow any laws either. Every agency would love not to follow the laws. \nWhen my friend from Oregon says this agency has vacuum tubes--I think \nit is the only agency that does. And every other agency follows the \nprocurement laws of this country. Why can FAA not get modern equipment \nlike every other agency can? Why can they not use the laws, which gives \nthem great flexibility?\n  I would like to point out to my good friend from Oregon, the \nCompetition In Contracting Act. This is all the FAA has to do. Under \nthe Competition In Contracting Act, which Senator Cohen and I authored, \nall they have to do to meet the act is to say ``the head of the agency \ndetermines it is necessary in the public interest to use procedures \nother than competitive procedures in the particular procurement \nconcerned.''\n  Do you mean the head of the FAA, if he wants to get rid of the vacuum \ntubes, cannot say that it is necessary in the public interest to use \nother than competitive procedures? I mean, what is wrong with the \nadministration of the FAA that they cannot get modern equipment if \nevery other agency got rid of their vacuum tubes 20 years ago? Why \ncould the FAA not get rid of their vacuum tubes 20 years ago using the \nsame procurement laws as every other agency in this Government?\n  So I hope we would not simply give a blanket waiver here to the FAA. \nI happen to agree that if they need reform they ought to have some \nreform. But this is not reform. This just says throw out all the \nprocurement laws. That is not reform. That just says you are not bound \nto the competition laws, you are not bound to all the other laws which \nprotect the taxpayer. And what is going to be substituted for it? \nWhatever the Secretary wants. I think it is arbitrary and I think it is \ngoing to be very confusing and in the end it is going to be very, very \nexpensive.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator. I yield the floor. As soon as this \nis completed, I will then move to table.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if I might just make a comment, I did \nnot want to get into this dispute. But there is almost an insinuation \nthat comes \n\n[[Page S12068]]\nout of the remarks of the Senator from Michigan about FAA's inability \nto stay abreast of things.\n  I come out of the computer field, and I can tell you I was in shock \nwhen I saw the kinds of equipment they had. When I was in the computer \nbusiness and when our equipment ran out of gas and was no longer worth \nkeeping, we tried to give it away to charities and schools so they \nmight use it for learning. And many times they turned us down because \nthe cost of maintenance would have been far higher than the value of \nthe asset that we were going to transfer to them.\n  When I went for my first visit to FAA in 1982 or 1983, I was shocked \nto see the equipment that we could not give away still being worked on \nand being used to operate the FAA system.\n  I point out to my friend from Michigan that there is one distinct \ndifference. Leadership at the FAA turns over at an alarming rate. With \nevery new Administrator comes changes in priorities and management \nstructure. This almost constant disruption of the procurement process \nis something that is almost unique to the FAA. That is one of the \nthings that I hope we will be looking at.\n  If the Senator wants to use the Defense Department as a shining \nexample, then lets look at it. Toilet seats at $600 and a couple of \nhundred bucks for a pair of pliers. If that is the shining example of \nthe way we ought to do procurement, then I pity those that follow that \nexample.\n  I do not want to get into a long debate here. I simply want to \nsupport the chairman's comments. We were pushed into this, almost \nforced into it, to put a big enough pebble in some committee's shoe to \nsay, ``Take care of this thing. If all you are going to do is gripe and \ncomplain about it, then we are going to do something about it.'' Though \nit was late at night, we succeeded in getting some significant \nattention focused on this issue.\n  I respect the Senator from Delaware, the Senator from Michigan, the \nSenator from Ohio, and our colleague from Arizona and his response.\n  This is not simply a group of people sitting on their chairs and not \ndoing anything to make the FAA's air traffic control system work. The \nFAA has handled an expanded volume with an incredibly good record on \nsafety and maintenance. Though the service sometimes is late, the fact \nof the matter is we have the best aviation system by far. However, we \nwould like for it to function a heck of a lot better. And that is the \npurpose of these parts of the bill.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I shall be brief because the hour is growing \nlate. But I think it is important for the record to clearly show that \nthe Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 gave the Secretary of \nTransportation authority to test alternatives and innovative \nprocurement procedures in carrying out acquisitions for one of the \nmodernization programs under the Air Force capital investment plan. I \npoint out that in part of this legislation, there is permitted a waiver \nof procurement regulations.\n  So the point I want to make is that authority last year was granted \nthe Secretary of Transportation to take action irrespective of the \nprocurement rules and regulations.\n  Unfortunately, I would also point out that early this year the GAO, \nin a February 1995 high-risk series, pointed out that the air traffic \ncontrol modernization project, which covers all parts of the $36 \nbillion effort to overhaul the Nation's air traffic control system, has \nfailed because FAA did not recognize the technical complexity of the \neffort, realistically estimate the resources required, and oversee \ncontractors' activities or effectively control system requirements.\n  So opportunity has been given but, unfortunately, the management of \nthose efforts has not been successful.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor knowing that the chairman wants to \nmake a motion to table.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I move to table the motion to strike \nthis language, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will occur under the previous order \ntomorrow.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2341\n\n       (Purpose: To protect shippers in a captive shipper state)\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana (Mr. BURNS) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2341.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3  . DETERMINING OF MARKET DOMINANCE IN RAIL CARRIER \n                   RATE PROCEEDINGS\n\n       (a) In this section, ``market dominance'' means an absence \n     of effective competition from other carriers or modes of \n     transportation for the traffic to which a rate applies. Any \n     agricultural shipper without economically competitive \n     railroad or truck alternatives, shall be considered \n     ``captive'' to the market dominant railroad. Further, any \n     agricultural shipper or its representative, that does not \n     have access to two or more competing railroads for shipping \n     the same commodity from the same origin to the same market as \n     other agricultural shippers shipping to the same market, \n     shall be deemed `captive' by a market dominant railroad. \n     Competing railroads shall mean two railroads not under common \n     control for rate making purposes.\n       (b) When a rate for transportation by a rail carrier that \n     is subject to the jurisdiction of an appropriate regulatory \n     federal agency, which is designated by Congress, and \n     adequately funded to protect the interests of ``captive'' \n     shippers, is challenged as being unreasonably high, the \n     Agency shall determine, within 90 days after start of \n     proceeding, whether the railroad carrier has market dominance \n     over the transportation to which the rate applies. After a \n     finding by the Agency that the carrier does have market \n     dominance, the affected shipper and traffic shall be \n     classified as ``captive.''\n       (c) When the Agency finds, in any proceeding that a shipper \n     and associated traffic is captive, the Agency shall suspend \n     the carrier established rates and set the maximum reasonable \n     rates that may be charged by the market dominant railroad. \n     The Agency shall set the maximum reasonable rate at that \n     level which will return fair and reasonable profit to the \n     carrier that would have occurred has there been effective \n     transportation competition for the market dominant traffic. \n     This maximum reasonable rate level determination shall be \n     completed within 120 days of the initiation of the \n     proceeding. The Agency shall not set the maximum reasonable \n     rates any higher than earnings for traffic having similar \n     transportation characteristics with rail-to-rail competition \n     moving distances. In any event, the Agency will not set the \n     maximum rates higher than 180% of railroad systemwide \n     variable cost of the movement as determined by the Agency.\n       (d) A market dominant carrier will be required to provide \n     its full common carrier obligation on rates and services to a \n     captive shipper without prejudice or preference, and without \n     any economic penalty to captive shippers. In addition, this \n     carrier shall offer identical or substantially similar \n     transportation services to captive shippers that it offers to \n     any other shipper moving a similar product on the market \n     dominant railroad carrier system.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this amendment should be inserted after \nline 22 on page 7.\n  This is no transfer of money. This is not asking for any money. This \nis really a pretty simple and straightforward kind of an amendment.\n  We are slowing phasing out the ICC. When we phase out the ICC, we \nalso phase out quite a lot of rules and regulations with regard to rail \nshipping. I think there is only a couple of States that fall in the \nsame category as the State of Montana. We are captive shippers. If \nshould something happen in the conference committee where we may have \nquite a debate about the phaseout of the ICC, this language can be \nstruck. But basically it sets up the safeguards of those agricultural \nshippers located in captive shipper States. Montana happens to be one \nof those. If you do not think it does not have an impact on you, the \nrate of shipping a carload of wheat from Omaha, NE, to Portland, OR, is \ncheaper than you can ship it from Montana to Portland. So we have a \nproblem as far as moving our grain to the ports.\n  So I ask that this language be considered. It is just a safeguard; \nthat should \n\n[[Page S12069]]\nthe ICC completely go out of business, this sets a parameter of which \nwe deal with States that are regarded as captive shippers.\n  I want to add a little footnote to the last discussion and associate \nmyself with the chairman of the committee. When he said the Boeing 777 \nhad more computing power than all the computers put together in the \nworld just as near as 10 years ago, one has to realize that our \ntechnology is so advanced now that there is an airplane that was \ncompletely designed on a computer and every part in it designed on the \ncomputer. There was never a mockup. There was never a prototype. It was \nbuilt strictly by computer, one of the great airplanes, of course, on \nthe cutting edge of civil aviation.\n  I ask that this language be accepted and considered. Both sides of \nthe aisle may have to look at this and then render a judgment tomorrow \nwhether we have a receipt or not or work on the language, whichever \nwould be proper. But I hope it would be accepted because we do need \nsome safeguards or a safety net for captive shippers, and the State of \nMontana falls in that category.\n  I thank the Chair and the managers. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Montana we \nstill do not have a copy of the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily lay aside the \nBurns amendment in order to complete the Pressler amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                     Local Rail Freight Assistance\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I shall be fairly brief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if the Senator from South Dakota is \noffering an amendment, it is not on this list. I would think it unfair \nto those who made requests earlier in the day for additional \namendments, to whom we denied this opportunity, to now at this hour of \nthe night suddenly open up the gate and take an amendment about which \nwe know very little and that--\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If I could just say something.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Has not been agreed to. Frankly, I would like to see \nit. I object to its being offered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I have not offered an amendment. If I could get a word \nin edgewise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Earlier today and throughout the day my staff has been \ndiscussing an amendment with the staff of the Appropriations Committee, \nand we thought we had it on the list. In fact, discussions were held \nthroughout the day with Anne Miano. We called the cloakroom and said, \nplease, put it on the list. I think there has been an error made, a \ngood-faith error, and I would very much like to offer this amendment \nbecause as chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation \nCommittee, several of my members wanted a chance to vote on this \namendment.\n  I will not take much time, but I am not trying to do anything by \nsleight of hand. There has been a genuine slip-up, so to speak, and I \nam not blaming anyone. I am not here to blame staff at this hour of the \nnight. But we did intend to have this on the list. It was our \nintention. We discussed it throughout the day with members of the \nstaff.\n  I would like to ask unanimous consent--first of all, let me explain, \nif necessary. I am not going to get into a tit for tat about what is on \nand what is not. I will spend some time explaining what is in the \namendment.\n  As you know, on the Commerce Committee, we try very hard to work with \nvarious critical transportation modes--rail, passenger. Indeed, I went \nout of my way to help with the Amtrak bill this year even though my \nState has no Amtrak. There is assistance for different types of \ntransportation in this country. My State frequently does not share as \ngenerously as some other States, but I have fought hard for things that \nthe Senator from New Jersey believes in. I know there is Amtrak in his \nState, and I could have blocked the Amtrak funding in the Commerce \nCommittee. But I did not choose to do so because I think there is a \nnational interest.\n  There is one area of service that is not included, and that is the \nlocal rail freight assistance program and the section 511 loan \nguarantee programs. These programs are critical to addressing our \nNation's rail freight infrastructure needs. While billions of dollars \nhave been invested in Amtrak over the years and now high speed rail \ninitiatives are receiving increased focus, little has been invested in \nthe rail freight lines serving our smaller cities and rural areas.\n  Indeed, capital investment needed to maintain our secondary rail \nlines far outpaces supply. In my view, Federal involvement in rail \nservice should not be limited to rail passenger service. Certainly \nAmtrak and high speed rail are important. However, to smaller-city \nStates such as mine, which has no Amtrak service and will never benefit \nfrom high speed rail, freight rail is even more important.\n  As my colleagues know, H.R. 2002 provides a good deal of money to \nfund rail passenger service. Certainly a limited amount of funding \nshould be provided to meet very serious rail freight needs. Even \nlimited Federal involvement will help to rebuild and improve the rail \nlines serving our smaller cities and rural areas. These lines, run \nmainly by short-line regional railroads, are critical to the survival \nof rural America's economy, yet the capital needed to maintain these \nsecondary rail lines is very limited.\n  Mr. President, the LRFA program has proved to play a vital role in \nour Nation's rail transportation system. Created in 1973, the LRFA \nprovides matching funds to help States save rail lines that otherwise \nwould be abandoned. For instance, over the past few years, several rail \nimprovement projects in my State and other States have been made \npossible. And I know we have been unable to reach the Senator from Iowa \ntonight, but he has worked on this. In fact, one of the east coast \nSenators wished to have a chance to speak on this tonight.\n  Without LRFA, our freight funding needs would go largely unmet. Of \nparticular importance is how LRFA's matching requirements enable \nlimited Federal, State and local resources to be leveraged. Indeed, \nLRFA's success has been in part due to its ability to promote \ninvestment partnerships, thus maximizing very limited Federal \nassistance.\n  Historically, LRFA has received only a very modest level of Federal \nfunding. For example, $17 million was provided for LRFA in fiscal 1995. \nBut a substantial portion of this very limited appropriations, $6.5 \nmillion, was rescinded recently by Public Law 104-6.\n  In fiscal year 1995, 31 States requested LRFA assistance for 59 \nprojects totaling more than $32 million in funding requests. \nUnfortunately, less than one-third of the funding was available to meet \nthese rail infrastructure needs. With continued railway structuring, \nthese legitimate funding needs will only increase. LRFA is a worthy \nprogram and should be funded.\n  As my colleagues may already know, oftentimes small railroads face \nunique problems and difficulties securing needed financing. Unlike \nother businesses that need short-term loans, smaller railroads need \nlong-term financing for big-ticket items, ranging anywhere from \nequipment to track rehabilitation. Yet, I understand most financial \ninstitutions will not make loans that are not repaid within 7 or 8 \nyears. These loans and loan arrangements simply do not work for smaller \nrailroads. And 511 loans were permanently authorized to address these \nproblems and should be funded.\n  In this era of significant budgetary pressures, the 511 program \nprovides a cost-effective method of ensuring modest infrastructure \ninvestment on a repayable basis. We should support programs like the \n511 program and the LRFA that provide an excellent leverage of our \nlimited Federal dollars.\n  The 511 railroad guarantee program is permanently authorized at $1 \nbillion, of which approximately $980 million currently is available for \ncommitment. The Credit Reform Act rules require appropriation for the \n511 program to cover the anticipated loss to the Government over the \nlife of each loan.\n  Based on a fiscal year 1994 appropriation for a 511 project in New \nYork \n\n[[Page S12070]]\nState--the first 511 application processed under the rules of the \nCredit Reform Act--5 percent of the total loan obligation must be \nappropriated. Several regional and short-line railroads are ready to \nsubmit loan applications as soon as the program is appropriated \nfunding.\n  My amendment provides $10 million to enable up to $100 million in \nloans.\n  Mr. President, I wish to be up front regarding the offsets I have \nproposed. A portion of this funding is taken from the Department of \nTransportation's working capital fund. Another portion is being off set \nby reducing the next generation high speed rail account for planning \nand design.\n  However, more than one-half of that account will still remain. Let me \nbe clear. I am not opposed to the high-speed rail program. However, we \nare still waiting for two reports from the administration on high-speed \nrail. One is on the commercial feasibility of high-speed ground \ntransportation. It will be submitted to Congress by the end of the \nyear. The other report due next year is to provide the administration \npolicy directions and a perspective on high-speed rail.\n  They are two very important reports. They will lay out the \ntechnological feasibility of where we should go in the next 20 years \nwith high-speed rail. Certainly we can delay some funding for this \nuntil we have a firm foundation and vision on high-speed rail.\n  Of course, I am willing to entertain any other suggestions for \noffsets and invite my colleagues to provide an alternative.\n  So, Mr. President, in conclusion, let me say that I stand here as a \nSenator from a State where we do not have passenger rail service. We \nare, I believe, one of two States in the United States that do not have \nAmtrak. We have no prospect of getting high-speed rail. But I have been \na supporter and a helper in those areas on the authorizing committee.\n  Just the other day I assisted Senator Lott in working out the package \nthat involved Amtrak. And I rise in good faith. I would ask that my \namendment be considered. And I would ask unanimous consent that it be \nconsidered, and that we have a vote on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I do object.\n  Mr. President, I think it is a fair and appropriate courtesy that the \nSenator from South Dakota and I and the chairman of the subcommittee \nhave a chance to talk about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from South Dakota does not lose the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is true.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I know the position that my friend from New \nJersey and my friend from Oregon, the managers of the bill, find \nthemselves in. I have found myself in similar positions during long, \ntedious sessions of the Senate when we try and make appropriate cutoffs \nat certain times. And they would be fully within their rights, and \nmaybe it is their final determination not to consider the amendment \noffered by my friend and colleague from South Dakota.\n  I happen to feel that this was one of those very legitimate \noversights where the chairman of the Commerce Committee, on which I \nhave had the opportunity to serve with the Senator from South Dakota \nsince we both came to this Senate 17 years ago--I know he has always \nbeen helpful and understanding on a whole series of matters. Therefore, \nI think the decision is up to the managers of the bill, but I would \nsimply suggest that this was, I am certain, a very innocent error. I \nbelieve the Senator really felt that his amendment had been included.\n  To make the point, if we would go back to the managers of the bill \nwhen they were reading the bill, the various amendments that have been \noffered, the Record will show the Senator from Nebraska rose and asked \nif his amendment would be included. And I was properly corrected by my \ngood friend, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, to the fact \nthat the amendment offered by the Senator from Nebraska was indeed \nlisted. So I was protected. There are occasions when we are not sure \nwhether we are protected or not. And in this particular case I was.\n  I simply say that I believe this was a simple oversight. And I was \njust wondering, is there any way we could possibly resolve this matter \nby considering some other kind of an offset of the funding that the \nSenator from South Dakota has used to finance the measure that he has \nrequested? I do not know whether that is one of the problems or not.\n  I have no dog in this fight except to say that fully understanding \nthe problems that the managers of the bill have, I think this was a \nvery legitimate error. If the wishes of the Senator from South Dakota \ncould be accommodated, I think it would be fair. If there is any \nproblem with the measure itself, you could always have a vote on it. Is \nit possible that there may be some other form of offset we might be \nable to work out?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my friend would yield for a question.\n  I begin my question by thanking him very, very much for his fair \nstatement that in our 20-some years together on the Commerce \nCommittee--I believe 18 years we were together on the Commerce \nCommittee--he has always been fair and thoughtful to me.\n  I would certainly consider some other offset. As I mentioned, my \nState is, I believe, one of two States that does not get Amtrak. I have \nbeen a supporter of Amtrak to help out in other areas. And my State \ndoes not get high-speed rail. And I have been a supporter of high-speed \nrail. So, I am trying to help out. I am not trying to send any signals \nhere, just that maybe it was another offset. These are hard to find. \nBut I would like to offer my amendment. I know some other Senators who \nare not in the Chamber tonight who are very interested in this \namendment. And so that is what I am trying to accomplish.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The discussion that evolves is one that often is \ndecided in this kind of a forum when the pressure is on to close out a \nbill. And we look at new ideas that have not been considered. And I \nregard my relationship with the Senator from South Dakota, as well as \nthe Senator from Nebraska, as good and friendly. And I certainly do not \nwant to be contentious.\n  But, Mr. President, the fact that suddenly now we are discussing \nAmtrak, and whether it is in New Jersey. We do not have essential air \nservices in New Jersey.\n  Mr. President, that will not resolve the issue as far as this Senator \nis concerned. We want to discuss it. I am absolutely amenable to \ndiscussing it.\n  I do think that out of respect for those of us who have been working \non this Transportation appropriations bill, after the budget resolution \nzeroed out local rail freight, that we ought to have a chance to \ndiscuss it.\n  I do not want to diminish the opportunity for either of the \nproponents of this amendment. It is to service their States. That is \nsomething that is always kept in front of us.\n  However, I think it is fair to say that adding this at the end, and \nbefore we clear the other amendments that have to be considered, is an \ninappropriate thing to do at this time. People want to close up shop. \nAnd that is not the primary reason for doing anything. But there is a \nprecedent. Others have managed to get their amendments in place. And I \nwould like to have a chance to discuss it before I even agree to \naccepting the amendment, Mr. President.\n  So that is my request. And I hope that we are not going to get a \nbalance sheet here with what was done for one or done for the other. We \nare discussing the Transportation Subcommittee bill. There are lots of \nthings that benefit all of us: highways, rail service, air service, and \ntransit service. All benefit different parts of America differently. \nBut, we can never get the scales to be exactly equal.\n  So, Mr. President, I would note the absence of a quorum until we \nresolve the couple of issues that are outstanding here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S12071]]\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2342\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a technical correction to Public Law 102-388)\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Feinstein and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], for Mrs. Feinstein, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2342.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate point in the bill inset:\n       ``Sec.   . The Secretary of Transportation is hereby \n     authorized and directed to enter into an agreement modifying \n     the agreement entered into pursuant to Section 339 of the \n     Department of Transportation and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 1993 (Public Law 102-388) to conform such \n     agreement to the provisions of Section 336 of the Department \n     of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n     1995 (Public Law 103-331). Nothing in this section changes \n     the amount of the previous appropriation in section 339, and \n     the line of credit provided for shall not exceed an amount \n     supported by the previous appropriation. In implementing \n     either Section 339 or Section 336, the Secretary may enter \n     into an agreement requiring an interest rate that is higher \n     than that specified therein.''\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, this is a simple, straightforward \namendment that would allow formerly appropriated funds to be used in a \nbackup on a bond matter. This has been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2342) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2343\n\n   (Purpose: To eliminate certain highway safety advisory committees)\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Abraham and Senator Inhofe and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], for Mr. Abraham, \n     for himself and Mr. Inhofe, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2343.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title III, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 3  . ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN HIGHWAY SAFETY ADVISORY \n                   COMMITTEES.\n\n       (a) National Highway Safety Advisory Committee.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 404 of title 23, United States \n     Code, is repealed.\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--The analysis for chapter 4 of \n     title 23, United States Code, is amended by striking the item \n     relating to section 404.\n       (b) Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Regulatory Review \n     Panel.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 31134 of title 49, United States \n     Code, is repealed.\n       (2) Conforming amendments.--\n       (A) The analysis for subchapter III of chapter 311 of title \n     49, United States Code, is amended by striking the item \n     relating to section 31134.\n       (B) Section 31140 of title 49, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (i) in subsection (a), by striking ``and the Commercial \n     Motor Vehicle Safety Regulatory Review Panel''; and\n       (ii) in subsection (b)--\n       (I) in paragraph (2), by striking ``the Panel or''; and\n       (II) by striking ``the Panel'' each place it appears and \n     inserting ``the Secretary''.\n       (C) Section 31141 of title 49, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (i) by striking subsection (b) and inserting the following:\n       ``(b) Annual Analysis by the Secretary.--The Secretary \n     annually shall analyze State laws and regulations and decide \n     which of the laws and regulations are related to commercial \n     motor vehicle safety.''; and\n       (ii) in subsection (c)--\n       (I) in paragraph (1), by striking ``The Secretary'' and all \n     that follows through ``shall--'' and inserting ``Not later \n     than 18 months after the date on which the Secretary makes a \n     decision under subsection (b) that a State law or regulation \n     is related to commercial motor vehicle safety or 18 months \n     after the date on which the Secretary prescribes a regulation \n     under section 31136, whichever is later, the Secretary \n     shall--''; and\n       (II) in paragraph (5), by striking ``(5)(A) In'' and all \n     that follows through ``(B) In'' and inserting ``(5) In''.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in further demonstration of our resolve to \ndownsize Government and eliminate needless departments, agencies, \ncommissions, boards, and councils, I offer this amendment along with \nSenator Abraham to terminate the National Driver Registration Advisory \nCommittee and the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Regulatory Review \nPanel.\n  The National Highway Safety Advisory Committee was established under \nthe Highway Safety Act of 1986 to advise the Secretary on matters \nrelating to highway safety. Moneys have not been appropriated for this \ncommittee since 1986.\n  The commercial motor vehicle safety regulatory review panel. The \npurpose of this panel is to conduct a study to evaluate the need for \nthe Federal assistance to the States to enforce specific regulations \nissued by the Secretary of Transportation. The panel was created by the \nMotor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 and is not currently funded.\n  Although these cuts are merely symbolic, they are illustrative of the \ntype of needless activity that have outlived their usefulness. These \ntypes of programs drain the Government of its efficiency and clutter \nits structure with organizational deadwood.\n  This amendment promotes the type of reform which is supported by the \nGAO, the CBO, and in some cases, the President. It terminates two \ncommittees whose jobs are finished. While it may not achieve savings in \nthe millions of dollars, it is an important step in complying with the \ndemands of the American people who told us on November 8, 1994, to \nbalance the budget, and cut the size of Government. It is important \nthat we demonstrate that resolve by reviewing even the most \ninsignificant or inexpensive programs as well as the more prominent \nones. Let us show the public we are serious and eliminate these useless \npanels.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, this is a repeal of two existing \ncommittees within the Department of Transportation, and it has been \ncleared on both sides. These are two advisory committees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2343) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would like to indicate precisely where \nwe are on the list of amendments. One was reserved for Senator Gregg of \nNew Hampshire. I am informed Senator Gregg has departed the Hill. So, \nobviously, he will not be offering his amendment. We had one for \nSenator Coverdell, and we now have a colloquy that will replace that \nslot for amendment.\n  Therefore, we are waiting the arrival of Senator Warner, and on \nbehalf of Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus, Senator Warner will offer \nan amendment.\n  And then I say, from my list that I have, that completes all the \namendments that were incorporated in the unanimous-consent agreement.\n  If there is any information relating to Senator Gregg, I would be \nvery happy to receive it. But if he is not here at the time we finish \nthese other amendments and the amendment has not been offered, that \ncloses the list.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, there remains a colloquy between the \nDemocratic leader and myself which we will have printed in the Record. \nAs far as I can see, I think that takes care of it, with the exception \nof the two matters----\n  Mr. HATFIELD. And Senator Burns. There is, I believe, a pending \namendment by Senator Burns of Montana, which is being checked out on \nthe Democratic side.\n\n[[Page S12072]]\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I have staff working ferociously to find other offsets \nthat might be more agreeable, but I may be offering potentially a \nsecond-degree to the Burns amendment, if he were to concur in that. I \njust wish the managers to know of that intention.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I believe now that the last amendment we \nhave before us is to be offered by Senator Warner on behalf of Senator \nChafee and Senator Baucus.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If the Senator will yield for a question. I will be \noffering an amendment to second-degree another matter. I will be \noffering a second-degree amendment later this evening.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. To what?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. To the Burns amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished managers for \npermitting me at this late hour to offer this amendment. I will do so \non behalf of the distinguished chairman of the committee, Mr. Chafee, \nand the ranking member, Senator Baucus.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be temporarily \nlaid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2344\n\n     (Purpose: To delay the effective date of a restriction on the \n   availability of certain highway funds and to provide for National \n                      Highway System designation)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself, Mr. \n     Chafee, and Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 2344.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3. DELAY OF RESTRICTION ON AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN \n                   HIGHWAY FUNDS; NATIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM \n                   DESIGNATION.\n\n       (a) Delay of Restriction of Availability of Certain Highway \n     Funds.--Section 103(b) of title 23, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (3)(B), by striking ``1995'' and inserting \n     ``1997''; and\n       (b) National Highway System Designation.--Section 103 of \n     title 23, United States Code, is amended by inserting after \n     subsection (b) the following:\n       ``(c) National Highway System Designation.--\n       ``(1) Designation.--The most recent National Highway System \n     (as of the date of enactment of this subsection) as submitted \n     by the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to this section \n     is designated as the National Highway System.\n       ``(2) Modifications.--\n       ``(A) In general.--At the request of a State, the Secretary \n     may--\n       ``(i) add a new route segment to the National Highway \n     System, including a new intermodel connection; or\n       ``(ii) delete a route segement in existence on the date of \n     the request and any connection to the route segment;\n      if the total mileage of the National Highway System \n     (including any route segment or connection proposed to be \n     added under this subparagraph) does not exceed 165,000 \n     miles (265,542 kilometers).\n       ``(B) Procedures for changes requested by states.--Each \n     State that makes a request for a change in the National \n     Highway System pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall establish \n     that each change in a route segment or connection referred to \n     in the subparagraph has been identified by the State, in \n     cooperation with local officials, pursuant to applicable \n     transportation planning activities for metropolitan areas \n     carried out under section 134 and statewide planning \n     processes carried out under section 135.\n       ``(3) Approval by the secretary.--The Secretary may approve \n     a request made by a State for a change in the National \n     Highway System pursuant to paragraph (2) if the Secretary \n     determines that the change--\n       ``(A) meets the criteria established for the National \n     Highway System under this title; and\n       ``(B) enhances the national transportation characteristics \n     of the National Highway System.''.\n       Page 69, line 3: At the end thereof insert the following: \n     ``and congestion mitigation and air quality program funds. \n     Provided, That a State shall not deposit funds that are \n     suballocated under title 23 or Public Law 102-240.''\n       Page 63, line 16: At the end thereof insert the following: \n     ``Provided, That prior year unobligated balances may not be \n     withdrawn and canceled that were suballocated under title 23 \n     or Public Law 102-240 or were made available under the \n     congestion mitigation and air quality program.''\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus to ensure that States receive \ntheir National Highway System and Interstate Maintenance apportionments \non schedule by October 1, 1995.\n  As my colleagues will recall, the Senate devoted 6 days of debate on \nlegislation I am sponsoring, S. 440, to designate the National Highway \nSystem. As required by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \nAct of 1991 [ISTEA], the Congress must enact the National Highway \nSystem before States receive $6.5 billion in 1996 highway dollars.\n  I am pleased that the Senate acted promptly and passed legislation to \nmeet the timetable established in ISTEA.\n  At this time, however, I am very concerned that Congress will not \nmeet this requirement and the States will be penalized because the \nCongress has failed to do its job.\n  I offer this amendment today in the hopes that it is not necessary \nand that the Congress does enact legislation to designate this critical \ntransportation system by September 30.\n  This amendment accomplishes three purposes. First, it delays the \nsanction in ISTEA which prevents highway funds from being allocated to \nthe States until the National Highway System is designated. Second, it \nextends for 2 years the deadline for Congress to complete its work on \nthe NHS bill in conjunction with our schedule to reauthorize the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act in 1997. Third, it \ndesignates the National Highway System as submitted by the Department \nof Transportation which was developed in cooperation with our States.\n  As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure, my first priority for this Congress \nhas been to enact the National Highway System. The subcommittee held \nfour hearings on the NHS and reported S. 440 to the Senate on May 10. \nThe full Senate soon took action and approved this legislation on June \n22, 1995.\n  I am also pleased that this amendment designates the system by \napproving the NHS map of 159,000 miles. For over 2 years, the Federal \nHighway Administration worked closely with all States and local \ngovernments to determine those most important roads which provide for \nthe efficient travel of people and goods and enhances our intermodal \ntransportation system.\n  Mr. President, it is my strong view that the Congress should enact an \nindividual NHS bill because of the other important transportation \nissues which were approved by the Senate. I am equally committed, \nhowever, that our States receive these funds on schedule so that \ncontracts can be awarded and urgent transportation projects can proceed \nwithout delay.\n  Mr. President, I understand that this amendment is in the nature of a \ntechnical amendment which is acceptable on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think it would be fair for the Senator \nfrom Virginia to describe what this amendment is. It is a very \nsignificant amendment. It is now 10:40 at night, and it is far more \nthan a technical amendment. I understand that it has been agreed to by \nother important members. But I say to the Senator from Virginia, an \namendment of this impact, under normal circumstances, should be \nhotlined before it is agreed to.\n  I do not intend to object, but I think we ought to be clear about the \nimpact of the amendment. It is not technical, and under normal \ncircumstances, one of this impact would be hotlined before it would be \nadopted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I simply say to my distinguished colleague \n\n\n[[Page S12073]]\nfrom Arizona that this amendment relates to the need for a certain \nrelief under the ISTEA legislation, whereby States can begin to receive \nhighway funds in the next fiscal year in the event the House does not \nsend a bill here and that bill is conferenced and adopted by both \nChambers. It is a matter of extreme urgency by highway governors and \nofficials across America. It applies to all 50 States equally; also, \nthe need for the adoption of the national highway map, such that \nplanning can get underway for the future enlargement of the Nation's \nhighway systems.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand the amendment better now. I \nthank the Senator from Virginia. He just made my argument, that it is \nnot exactly a technical amendment. I now better understand how \nimportant it is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2344) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I send to the desk two amendments on behalf of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Environment Committee, Mr. Chafee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Parliamentary inquiry. I want to make sure it is \nclearly understood that these are technical amendments that were not \nincorporated in the unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  I apologize to my distinguished colleague. I now find that the \namendment that was just considered by the Chair contained the two \ntechnical amendments and were considered en bloc, so the two amendments \nhave already been accepted.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the managers.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2341\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the pending business is the Burns \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is correct.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, we have not been able to clear the Burns \namendment on both sides.\n  Therefore, I suggest that we provide for the yeas and nays on \ndisposing of the Burns amendment in the context of tomorrow's actions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I say to my colleague and comanager, on the written \namendments that we have on our list, that concludes all of those \namendments.\n  Mr. GREGG. A recurring theme of this Congress is to find commonsense \nsolutions to national problems. One of these is to create practical \nways to promote recycling of waste material. This requires developing \napplications and processes in which benign waste performs, as well as, \nor better than, and at the same or lower cost as traditional materials. \nExperts at the University of New Hampshire have stressed to me that \nthis requires integrating appropriate tests for long term physical \nperformance with a thorough understanding of the long-term \nenvironmental implications. The committee provides $14,622,000 to FHWA \nfor technology assessment and deployment and expresses its support for \nthe priority technologies initiative funded under the section 6005 \nprogram. Would the committee consider evaluation of environmental and \nphysical results of using benign waste materials in transportation \ninfrastructure and helping AASHTO to incorporate those results into \ntheir construction standards to be a priority technology under the \nsection 6005 program?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes, the committee believes this is a priority \ntechnology and encourages FHWA to fund this type of research which is \nimportant to the future of our Nation's infrastructure.\n                          SIDNEY LANIER BRIDGE\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would like to thank the chairman for his leadership \nin crafting this Transportation appropriations bill before us. In light \nof the budgetary restriction placed upon all of these projects, I think \nthe chairman has done a skillful job of handling many divergent \ninterests.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would also like to thank the Senator for his \nassistance in attempting to remedy funding difficulties we have \nexperienced with the Sidney Lanier Bridge in Brunswick, GA. As the \nchairman knows, the Sidney Lanier Bridge is in need of replacement. \nThis bridge has been authorized by Congress as a hazard to navigation \nbecause of the 10 lives that have recently been lost there. In \naddition, the State of Georgia has matched every Federal dollar spent \non this project since 1992, which to date, has been nearly $12 million. \nGiven our current budget realities, I understand from the chairman that \nSidney Lanier was not funded in the Senate under the project's \ntraditional source, the Truman Hobbs Act. Am I also to understand from \nthe chairman that the committee is aware of the importance of this \nproject?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The Senator is correct. The Sidney Lanier Bridge is a \nproject of great importance to Georgia's growing ports industry not \nonly for safety concerns, but also for commercial reasons.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator. With this recognition, would the \nchairman be willing to give every consideration to the House position \nof $8 million through the Truman Hobbs Act for continued funding of the \nSidney Lanier Bridge.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Every consideration will be given to the House position \nin regard to the Sidney Lanier Bridge. The Senator is to be commended \nfor his diligence on behalf of this important project and we will \nattempt to facilitate him in the conference committee.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the chairman for his efforts on behalf of this \nproject.\n                    faa military assistance program\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Department of \nTransportation and related agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year \n1996.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor bringing us a balanced bill considering the current budget \nconstraints.\n  The Senate-reported bill provides $12.6 billion in new BA and $11.7 \nbillion in new outlays to fund the programs of the Department of \nTransportation, including Federal-aid highway, mass transit, aviation \nand maritime activities.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the bill totals $13.0 billion in budget \nauthority [BA] and $37.1 billion in new outlays.\n  The subcommittee is essentially at its 602(b) allocation in both BA \nand outlays.\n  The Senate-reported bill is $526 million in outlays below the \nPresident's 1996 request. The bill does not incorporate the President's \nrequest for consolidating all capital transportation programs into one \nUnified Transportation Infrastructure Investment Program.\n  The Senate-reported bill is $201 million in BA and $386 million in \noutlays below the House version of the bill.\n  I am concerned about one provision in the bill concerning the FAA \nMilitary Assistance Program [MAP]. The bill has set an arbitrary figure \nfor the MAP Program, reducing its funding below the amount the \nstatutory formula requires under the Airport Improvement Program [AIP]\n  I do, however, support the bill, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe spending totals.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n....................................................................... \n\n[[Page S12074]]\n    TRANSPORTATION SUBCOMMITTEE SPENDING TOTALS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL   \n                [Fiscal year 1996, in million of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      Budget            \n                                                    authority   Outlays \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed......................................        382     25,376\n  H.R. 2002, as reported to the Senate............     12,017     11,185\n  Scorekeeping adjustment.........................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n    Subtotal nondefense discretionary.............     12,399     36,561\n                                                   =====================\nMandatory:                                                              \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed......................................  .........         60\n  H.R. 2002, as reported to the Senate............        582        521\n  Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                         \n   Budget Resolution assumptions..................          2         -0\n                                                   ---------------------\n    Subtotal mandatory............................        584        581\n                                                   =====================\n    Adjusted bill total...........................     12,983     37,142\n                                                   =====================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n  Defense discretionary...........................  .........  .........\n  Nondefense discretionary........................     12,400     36,561\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund..............  .........  .........\n  Mandatory.......................................        584        581\n                                                   ---------------------\n    Total allocation..............................     12,984     37,142\n                                                   =====================\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate                                  \n Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                        \n  Defense discretionary...........................  .........  .........\n  Nondefense discretionary........................         -1         -0\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund..............  .........  .........\n  Mandatory.......................................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n    Total allocation..............................         -1         -0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly on the impact of \nthis bill on funding for the FAA Military Airport Program [MAP] within \nthe Airport Improvement Program [AIP].\n  MAP is a 2.5-percent set-aside with AIP for current or former \nmilitary airfields. Grants are issued to airport sponsors of current \nmilitary airfields where there are joint use agreements with the \nmilitary department controlling the airfield. MAP grants are used for \nprojects that are most needed by eligible airports converting from \nmilitary to civilian use. Current AIP discretionary funds cannot be \nused for most of these activities.\n  The need for MAP funding is growing each year. With the Defense \nDepartment closing an unprecedented number of military airfields since \n1988, coupled with the current and projected growth in commercial and \ngeneral aviation, more and more MAP sites across the country will \nbecome eligible for these funds. The FAA has identified almost 40 \nairports nationwide in which MAP funds may be used in future years for \nthe conversion of military airfields to civilian use.\n  MAP funds play a vital role in New Mexico. In 1995, Albuquerque \nInternational Airport received $1 million for airports improvements \nrelated to the airport's shared facilities with Kirtland Air Force \nBase. In 1996, MAP funds will be used, in conjunction with other \nfederal and local funds, for the rehabilitation of one of Albuquerque's \nmain runways.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee \non Transportation, I support passage of H.R. 2002. This bill is within \nthe subcommittee's 602(b) allocation, and Chairman Hatfield has crafted \na bill to meet the needs of all modes of transportation within a \nreduced allocation for transportation.\n  However, I am concerned about the committee's action to arbitrarily \ncap MAP funding for 1996 by not allowing the full 2.5-percent set-aside \nfor MAP. Under the committee's action of setting the AIP program at \n$1.25 billion for 1996, MAP should receive $26.4 million. However, the \ncommittee's action to cap this program at $20 million means that MAP \nwill receive $6.4 million less than mandated under current law under an \nAIP program at $1.25 billion.\n  It is in this respect I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman of both the Appropriations Committee and the Subcommittee on \nTransportation, Senator Hatfield, in a discussion. Let me first ask my \ncolleague, if it is correct that the committee has capped the Military \nAirport Program at $20 million for 1996?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee is \ncorrect. The committee has capped the MAP program at $20 million for \n1996. The committee has also capped another AIP set-aside program, the \nReliever Airport Program, at $50 million.\n  As the chairman of the Budget Committee knows, our committee was \nforced to make difficult decisions in order to fund our nation's top \ninfrastructure needs for 1996. As Congress, under the direction of the \nbudget resolution, moves to balance the Federal budget by 2002, our \ncommittee will be faced with even more difficult choices over the next \nfew years.\n  One of the most difficult choices our committee faced was setting the \nobligation limitation for the AIP program. In 1995, funding for AIP was \nset at $1.45 billion. The Senate-reported bill has set this figure at \n$1.25 billion. Because of this lower AIP level, the bill has capped \nboth MAP and the Reliever Airport Program.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate the comments from the chairman. While I \nunderstand his position on this issue, might I ask the chairman if he \nintends, within the confines of the final joint House and Senate 602(b) \nallocation for the Transportation Subcommittee, to work for a higher \nAIP funding level during the House-Senate conference on H.R. 2002? And \nin addition, if a higher AIP figure can be achieved in conference, will \nthe chairman allow MAP funds to be distributed at 2.5 percent, as \nrequired by law?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. At this point, without knowing our final 602(b) \nallocation for the Transportation Subcommittee, it is hard to predict a \nfinal AIP or MAP figure. However, I stand ready to work in conference \nwith the distinguished Senator from New Mexico on achieving the highest \nfunding possible for AIP and in turn, working for the highest possible \nlevel of funding for MAP.\n                       air traffic controller pay\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it has come to my attention that our bill \nmay have the effect of reducing air traffic controller pay by as much \nas 2.5 percent. I am also advised that this action could impose \nadditional burdens on our air traffic control system at a time when air \ntraffic is undergoing rapid growth. Therefore, I hope the chairman will \nprovide some assurance that these issues will be carefully examined and \nreconsidered prior to conference with the House.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator for bringing his concerns to my \nattention. This action was only taken because of our difficult budget \nsituation. As the Senator knows the House bill does not contain a \nsimilar provision and I am hopeful that in conference a satisfactory \nsolution can be reached on this issue.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the distinguished chairman for his willingness \nto take another look at this matter, and I know that with his \nleadership we will see a favorable resolution of the issue in the final \nconference agreement.\n\n\n                 title information system pilot project\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to clarify a point in the committee's \nreport concerning funding for a title information system pilot project. \nIt is my understanding that the States frequently issue new titles for \nvehicles that were reported stolen in other States. To prevent that \nfrom continuing, the Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992 required the \nTransportation Department to establish an instant title verification \ncheck prior to the issuance of new titles. Congress required this \nsystem to be up and running by January 1 of next year.\n  The House provided $1 million from the budget for the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration to help a pilot group of States \nto modify their computer software and get the system started. Here in \nthe Senate, the committee disagreed with this earmark. The reason \nstated in the committee report is that the system cannot work until all \nthe States use uniform definitions and titling procedures.\n  However, the Motor Vehicle Administrators' Association tells me that \nnationwide uniformity is not necessary for such a system to be \neffective. If a car is stolen, it is stolen. States simply cannot \nverify documents from other States. With the proposed system, they will \nbe able to know instantly that the vehicle is stolen. In addition, the \nNational Driver Register, an electronic system on which the title \ninformation system is modelled, has helped keep habitual drunk drivers \nfrom obtaining drivers' licenses, even though the States have widely \nvarying terminology and definitions for ``drunk driving,'' ``driving \nunder the influence,'' and so forth.\n  My question to the Chair is this: Should the Committee not give \nserious consideration to this provision in the House bill when we go to \nconference?\n\n[[Page S12075]]\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator for focusing our attention on this \nissue. All of us are concerned about auto theft, and we recognize the \nproblems the States face in trying to cope with it. I agree we will \nthoroughly review the merits of the House initiative during the \nconference.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the chairman.\n\n\n                              aip funding\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would pose a question for the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Committee. Would the Senator agree that \nairports which serve communities with a large number of displaced \naerospace workers from defense base closures ought to be given a \npriority in the receipt of airport improvement grants which would \nencourage and promote commercial development, through the expansion of \ntaxiways and aircraft parking ramps, which could employ a significant \namount of displaced workers?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I would agree.\n  Mr. ROBB. Would the Senator agree that if a more robust funding level \nfor AIP grant funding was possible that these priorities would have \nbeen established?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I would agree.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator agree that the Aviation Research Park \nat the Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport would qualify as \na priority project because of the pending closure of the Naval Aviation \nDepot, Norfolk.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Under the circumstances as the Senator describes them \nas the Senator knows, I would have provided more AIP funds if the \nbudget would have allowed, and not forced such difficult decisions in \nallocatting AIP funding. I would agree.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank the distinguished Senate.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from South Dakota \nwishes to proceed.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. As far as I am concerned, if I may, Mr. President, I \nam removing the objection that I had put forward before so that the \nSenator from South Dakota can offer an amendment.\n  There are a couple of questions that I would like to deal with, so if \nthe Senator would not mind, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Parliamentary inquiry. I believe that the Jeffords \namendment has not been disposed of, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is correct.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I now move to table the Jeffords \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I inquire once more of the Chair, have all amendments \nnow been disposed of that have been either presented or temporarily \nlaid aside or any other action?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are three amendments that have been \noffered and laid aside. All the other amendments have been disposed of.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Would the Chair enumerate the author of those \namendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The first amendment is the Burns amendment \nnumbered 2341; the second amendment is the Roth amendment numbered \n2340; and the third amendment is the Jeffords amendment numbered 2337.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. The staff are rewriting so that the offsets will be \npleasing to the various Members.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, first I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Frist be added as original cosponsor for an earlier amendment I \noffered, No. 2336, regarding a U.S.-Japan bilateral agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2345\n\n     (Purpose: To provide funding for rail freight infrastructure \n                             improvements)\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, under an agreement I have reached, I am \ngoing to send an amendment to the desk and not debate it or say \nanything about it and tomorrow morning some of the numbers we are going \nto modify. This involves the local rail freight assistance. We are \nfinding other offsets that may be acceptable or may not be acceptable \nto some other Members of the Senate.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold, I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Pressler be authorized to offer an \namendment tonight and be able to modify that amendment tomorrow in the \nsequence of the amendments to be taken up tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like, if we can, to amend that \nunanimous-consent agreement that was just propounded by asking further \nunder unanimous consent that the 10 minutes that may be available for \ndebate be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Parliamentary inquiry: I would also like to ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Harkin be added as an original cosponsor \nfirst, after all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To this amendment?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator offer the amendment?\n  Mr. PRESSER. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Pressler], for himself, \n     Mr. Exon, and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2345.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following:\n       On page 26, line 15, strike ``1996.'' and insert ``1996, \n     except for not more than 50,000,000 in loan guarantee \n     commitments during such fiscal year (and 5,000,000 is hereby \n     made available for the cost of such loan guarantee \n     commitments).''.\n       On page 26, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n\n                     Local rail freight assistance\n\n       For necessary expenses for rail assistance under section \n     5(q) of the Department of Transportation Act, $12,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 6 strike ``9,710,000'' and insert \n     ``$6,300,000''.\n       On page 6, line 13, strike ``$139,689,000:'' and insert \n     ``$134,689,000''.\n       On page 54, line 8 strike $99,364,000 and insert \n     $94,364,000.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Without making a speech on this amendment, I ask \nunanimous consent that tomorrow morning I be allowed to modify the \namendment after consulting with my cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota should note that \nthat is already part of the agreement. And that we would not ask for \nthe yeas and nays tonight, but I would hope to ask for the yeas and \nnays tomorrow morning unless we get it agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is part of the agreement.\n  Does the Senator from South Dakota want to have Mr. Harkin added as \nan original cosponsor?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I just want to make sure that I have made no commitment \nabout the action tomorrow on this amendment. My unanimous consent did \nnot involve all the procedures that will be open to handle this \namendment tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment can be disposed of either with \nan up-or-down vote or a motion to table.\n\n[[Page S12076]]\n\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD.

Unfortunately, my Senate duties \nprevent me from being in Illinois with Judge Marovitz tomorrow, so I \nwant to take this opportunity to tell him how much I think of him, how \nmuch he has helped me, and how much he means to the people of Illinois.\n  I am very proud that Judge Marovitz took the time to act as my \nmentor. He always had time for me. He always made time for me. I feel \nvery fortunate to have had the benefit of his counsel and advice \nthroughout my career.\n  I first met Judge Marovitz as a young Assistant U.S. attorney. Even \nthough he was a Federal District Judge, he went out of his way to help \nme become a good trial lawyer. He virtually walked me through my first \ntrial, and the special attention he gave me helped convince me that I \nhad made the right choice in becoming a lawyer.\n  What is really so remarkable about Judge Marovitz, however, was that \nthe special attention he gave me was an everyday thing for him. He \ntreated everyone as special. He made a major difference in my life, and \nin my career--I probably would not be in the United States Senate today \nif not for his help all through my career--I am but one of the many, \nmany people he has helped.\n  He has always found the time to encourage the good in people. He is \nnever too busy to care, or to give real attention to personal need.\n  At the outset of my remarks, I stated that Judge Marovitz was a real \nhero. He was a World War II marine veteran, but his heroism was not \nlimited to his years in military service; it encompasses his entire \nlife. His is a heroism based on commitment to principle, on always \nliving and acting on those principles, and perhaps most of all, on his \nuntiring efforts to make this a better America for every American.\n  As Steve Neal said in his column entitle ``Marovitz: A Legacy of \nCitizenship'' in today's Chicago Sun-Times, ``Marovitz is a believer in \nthe American Dream because he has lived it.'' To that, I would only \nadd, that Judge Marovitz has made it his life's work to try to see that \nevery American can live that dream.\n  He has had a distinguished career as a jurist. And I have to say that \nJudge Abraham Lincoln Marovitz is very well named; he has always \ndispensed justice, as President Lincoln said in his second inaugural \naddress ``with malice towards none, with charity for all, with firmness \nin the right as God gives us to see the right * * *.''\n  Judge Abraham Lincoln Marovitz has been a leader all his life, and \nhas been the best kind of leader, one whose leadership is based on his \nown life of excellence, of principle, and of commitment to others. He \nhas served as a judge for most of his professional life, and he is \nstill building on the superb record he has created.\n  I wish him the happiest of birthdays, and I want him to know that, \nwhether the Senate is in session or not, I intend to be at the party \ncelebrating his 100th birthday.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Steve Neal \ncolumn on Judge Marovitz be printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Aug. 9, 1995]\n\n                   Marovitz: A Legacy of Citizenship\n\n                            (By Steve Neal)\n\n       The federal courtroom was packed.\n       Senior Judge Abraham Lincoln Marovitz asked the multiethnic \n     group of men and women, young and old, to stand and take the \n     oath of U.S. citizenship.\n       Standing behind the bench in the courtroom that bears his \n     name, Marovitz asks the new citizens to renounce in unison \n     their allegiances or loyalty ``to any foreign prince, \n     potentate, state or sovereignty,'' and to defend the \n     Constitution of the United States.\n       He is a man for all people. Marovitz performs this ceremony \n     twice a month, as he has for more than 30 years. For \n     Marovitz, who celebrates his 90th birthday Thursday, the \n     induction ceremony has a special significance. He is a \n     believer in the American dream because he has lived it. His \n     father, a Lithuanian immigrant, took the same oath of \n     citizenship in 1894.\n       ``Every time I perform the induction ceremony I think of my \n     father,'' says Marovitz, who is wearing cuff links with \n     portraits of his parents. He talks with love and pride of the \n     legacy of Joseph and Rachel Marovitz. The U.S. Immigration \n     Department has given Marovitz an award for administering the \n     citizenship oath to more naturalized Americans than any other \n     member of the federal bench.\n       Nearly everywhere Marovitz goes, he is approached by a man \n     or woman who took the citizenship oath in his courtroom. His \n     door is always open to the people whose lives he has touched.\n       Marovitz talks with nostalgia about the immigrant world in \n     which he grew up. He is a West Sider from the old Maxwell \n     Street neighborhood. His father had a tailor shop, and his \n     mother ran a candy store in front of the family's three-room \n     apartment. ``It was a large Jewish community and we learned \n     the importance of hard work, loyalty and fairness,'' said \n     Marovitz.\n       His path to prominence wasn't easy. Marovitz still \n     remembers the hurt, anger and humiliation he felt as a \n     teenager when he was fired from his job in a Michigan Avenue \n     clothing store after his employer learned that he was Jewish. \n     ``My father told me that anti-Semitism is an old story, but \n     that one day I would do something about it,'' Marovitz \n     recalled. The elder Marovitz lived to see his son become the \n     youngest assistant state's attorney in Cook County history, \n     and the first Jewish Illinois state senator.\n       A Marine veteran of World War II, Marovitz has served on \n     the bench for half of his life. In the mid-1950's, he nearly \n     became the Democratic nominee for governor of Illinois. But \n     Marovitz recalled Tuesday that his mother told him not to \n     quit the court because no office is more important than \n     judge. Marovitz took her advice. He has no regrets.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/09/senate-section/article/S12076-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12076-S12077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO THE LATE ARTHUR MAGILL, AUGUST 9, 1995\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, one of the unique aspects of the \nAmerican business community is the concept of the ``corporate \nneighbor''. The belief that business leaders and heads of companies \nneed to be involved in their communities and give something back to the \ncities, States, and Nation which have allowed their enterprises to \nprosper. Some of the leading philanthropic and charitable organizations \nin the Nation were started by the men who made their fortunes in \nbusiness. Ford, Carnegie, and Rockefeller--among many others--are \nfamiliar names gracing endowments and foundations that support the arts \nand other noble causes. I rise today to pay tribute to a man, who in my \nhome State of South Carolina, was a person who excelled in business and \ngave generously back to the city and State that he loved--Mr. Arthur \nMagill.\n  Born in Philadelphia, Arthur Magill moved to South Carolina in 1954 \nafter inheriting the textile business his father started, Her Majesty \nIndustries. Three of the company's mills were located in South Carolina \nand Arthur chose to settle in the upstate city of Greenville, a \nhistoric community that was at the heart of much of the South's textile \nmanufacturing. In the 41 years between Arthur's arrival in South \nCarolina and his death earlier this week, he became known as a gifted \nbusinessman, a civically concerned individual, and a supporter and \npioneer of culture in South Carolina.\n  Many organizations benefitted from the generosity of Arthur Magill \nand the foundation he and his wife started, including the Greenville \nCounty Library, the Greenville Little Theater, the Greenville Symphony, \nand the South Carolina State Museum. Perhaps Arthur's most well known \ncontribution to the arts community was his purchase of a large \ncollection of Andrew \n\n[[Page S12077]]\nWyeth paintings and drawings, which he placed on loan to the Greenville \nMuseum. Though he eventually sold this collection, the display of these \nitems not only brought recognition and acclaim both to the museum and \nto Mr. Magill, but they served as an impetus to involve others in the \narts community.\n  A man of many talents and much energy, Arthur Magill pursued many \ninterests outside of his company. He was instrumental in starting a \nFurman University summer program geared toward high school students \ncalled ``School of the Arts,'' even serving as its director; he was the \nauthor of four books; served as the director of the Friends of the \nAmerican Art in Religion; and, he was an adjunct professor of economics \nat Furman University. Truly an impressive set of accomplishments for \nany one person, let alone a man who had to shoulder the considerable \npressures and responsibilities of running a corporation.\n  Mr. Magill's charitable efforts were not limited to the art world. \nThrough a substantial donation to the Medical University of South \nCarolina, the Arthur and Holly Magill Refractive and Laser Center was \nestablished at the Storm Eye Institute. These facilities greatly \nenhance the research, treatment, and instruction that is conducted at \nMUSC and they help to ensure that South Carolinians are able to see to \nenjoy all that life has to offer, including art.\n  Mr. President, Arthur Magill passed away this past Sunday at the age \nof 88, after enduring a lengthy illness. While he will be greatly \nmissed by those who knew him and those who benefitted from his \nendeavors, his lifelong commitment to improving the quality of life in \nour State and Nation ensures that his memory and legacy shall live on \nfor generations to come. His wife, Holly, and daughter Holly Melosi, \nhave my deepest sympathies on the occasion of the death of their \nhusband and father.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/09/senate-section/article/S12076-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, the Hattiesburg American newspaper in my \nState carried two articles earlier this week about a remarkable woman \nand her generous gift to students in financial need at the University \nof Southern Mississippi.\n  Ms. Oseola McCarty, who was born on March 7, 1908, in Mississippi, \nand saved the money she earned from washing and ironing clothes for \nothers for over 60 years, has decided that the bulk of her estate, \n$150,000, should be given to the University for scholarship assistance \nto African-American students.\n  The story was aired on NBC Nightly News by Tom Brokaw.\n  The President of the University, Dr. Aubrey K. Lucas, said, ``I don't \nknow that I have ever been as touched by a gift to the University as I \nam by this one.''\n  Ms. McCarty said, ``I just want the scholarship to go to some child \nwho needs it, to whoever is not able to help their children.''\n  Mr. President, as we struggle here to rewrite the welfare laws, we \ncan learn, with humility, and deep respect for Ms. Oseola McCarty, that \nour country would benefit greatly from her example of hard work, \nfrugality, and concern for the needs of others.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the two articles from the Hattiesburg \nAmerican be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n            Local Woman Makes Extraordinary Donation to USM\n\n                           (By Sharon Wertz)\n\n       Oseola McCarty's lined, brown hands, now gnarled with \n     arthritis, bear mute testimony to a lifetime spent washing \n     and ironing other people's clothes.\n       Less evident is how this quiet, 87-year-old woman came to \n     donate $150,000 to the University of Southern Mississippi.\n       ``I want to help somebody's child go to college,'' McCarty \n     said ``I just want it to go to someone who will appreciate it \n     and learn. I'm old and I'm got going to live always.''\n       McCarty's gift establishes an endowed Oseola McCarty \n     Scholarship, with ``priority consideration given to those \n     deserving African-American students enrolling at the \n     University of Southern Mississippi who clearly demonstrate a \n     financial need.''\n       ``This is just extraordinary,'' said USM President Aubrey \n     Lucas. ``I don't know that I have ever been as touched by a \n     gift to the university as I am by this one. Miss McCarty has \n     shown great unselfishness and sensitivity in making possible \n     for others the education she never had.''\n       Bill Pace, executive director of the USM Foundation, which \n     will administer McCarty's gift, said ``This is by far the \n     largest gift ever given to USM by an African American. We are \n     overwhelmed and humbled by what she has done.''\n       McCarty's gift has astounded even those who believe they \n     know her well. The customers who have brought their washing \n     and ironing to her modest frame home for more than 75 years \n     read like the social register of Hattiesburg. She has done \n     laundry for three generations of some families. In the \n     beginning, she said, she charged $1.50 to $2 a bundle but, \n     with inflation, the price rose.\n       ``When I started making $10 a bundle--I don't remember \n     when--sometimes after the war--I commenced to save money,'' \n     she recalled. ``I put it in savings. I never would take any \n     of it out. I just put it in. It just accumulated.''\n       Actually, she started saving much earlier. McCarty, seated \n     in her small, neat living room--the linoleum floor gleaming, \n     a spotless pink bedspread pinned carefully over the sofa--\n     related her story quietly and matter-of-factly.\n       Born in Wayne County on March 7, 1908, she was raised by \n     her mother, Lucy, who moved to Hattiesburg when Oseola was \n     very very young. Her mother, she recalls, worked hard to \n     support her young daughter.\n       ``She cooked for Mr. J.S. Garraway, who was Forrest County \n     Circuit Clerk, and--she would go to the schoolhouse and sell \n     candy to make money. She would leave me alone. I was scared, \n     but she didn't have no choice. I said then that when I could, \n     I would save money so I could take care of my grandmother.''\n       Young Oseola went to school at Eureka Elementary School. \n     Even as a young child, she worked, though, and her savings \n     habit started early.\n       ``I would go to school and come home and iron. I'd put \n     money away and save it. When I got enough, I went to First \n     Mississippi National Bank and put it in. The teller told me \n     it would be best to put it in a savings account. I didn't \n     know. I just kept on saving.''\n       When Oseola was in the sixth grade, her childless aunt had \n     to go the hospital, and McCarty said, ``I had to go and wait \n     on her. When she came out of the hospital, she couldn't walk, \n     and she needed me.''\n       McCarty never returned to school. ``All my classmates had \n     gone off and left me,'' she said, ``so I didn't go back. I \n     just washed and ironed.''\n       Over the years, she put money into several local banks. \n     While banks merged and changed names and management, \n     McCarty's savings grew.\n       Her grandmother died in 1944, her mother dies in 1964, her \n     aunt died in 1967, ``and I've been havin' it by myself since \n     then,'' she said. Her mother and her aunt each left her some \n     money, which she added to her savings. In 1947 her uncle gave \n     her the house in which she still lives.\n       Bank personnel, realizing that McCarty was accumulating \n     sizable savings, advised her to put her money into CD's, \n     conservative mutual funds and other accounts where it would \n     work for her.\n       Meanwhile, McCarty washed and ironed and lived frugally. \n     She never had a car and still walks everywhere she goes. She \n     shows a visitor the shopping cart she pushes to Big Star, \n     more than a mile away, to get groceries. For the visitor's \n     benefit, she turns on the window air conditioner bank \n     personnel only recently persuaded her to get.\n       Nancy Odman and Ellen Vinzant of Trustmark Bank have worked \n     with McCarty for several years, not only helping her manage \n     her money but helping look after her personally. It was they \n     who helped her get the air conditioner. They also were \n     concerned about what the future held for her.\n       ``We both talked with her about her funds and what would \n     happen to her if something happened,'' said Odam. ``She knew \n     she needed someone to take care of her.''\n       McCarty, who never married, said, ``After my aunt died, I \n     began to think, I didn't have nobody. I began to think about \n     what to do \n\n[[Page S12078]]\n     with what little I had. I wanted to leave some to some cousins and my \n     church. But I had been thinking for a long time . . . since I \n     was in school . . . I didn't know how to fix it, but I wanted \n     to give it to the college (USM). They used to not let colored \n     people go out there, but now they do, and I think they should \n     have it.''\n       Odom and Vinzant referred McCarty to Paul Laughlin, \n     Trustmark's assistant vice president and trust officer.\n       ``In one of our earliest meetings, I talked about what we \n     could do for her,'' Laughlin said. ``We talked about \n     providing for her if she's not able. Then we turned naturally \n     to what happens to her estate after she dies.\n       ``She said she wanted to leave the bulk of her money to \n     USM, and she didn't want (anybody) to come in and change her \n     mind. I called Jimmy Frank McKenzie, her attorney--she's done \n     laundry for him for years--and he talked to her. He made sure \n     it was her idea. Then I met with her to let her decide how to \n     divide her money up.''\n       Mr. Paul laid out dimes on the table to explain how to \n     divide it up,'' McCarty said.\n       Laughlin said, ``I got 10 dimes (to represent percentages). \n     I wrote on pieces of paper the parties she wanted to leave \n     her money to and put them on the table. Then I asked how she \n     wanted her money to be split up. She put one dime on her \n     church and one each for several relatives. Then she said she \n     wanted the rest--six dimes--to go to the college. She was \n     quite definite about wanting to give 60 percent to USM. To my \n     knowledge, she has never been out there, but she seems to \n     have the best of the students in mind. The decision was \n     entirely hers.''\n       ``I just want the scholarship to go to some child who needs \n     it, to whoever is not able to help their children,'' McCarty \n     said. ``I too old to get an education, but they can.''\n       McCarty signed an irrevocable trust agreement stating her \n     wishes for her estate and giving the bank the responsibility \n     for managing her funds.\n       ``Mr. Paul gives me a check, and I can go get money anytime \n     I need it. My lawyer gave them permission to take care of me \n     if something happens to me.''\n       Laughlin said the bank normally keeps such transactions in \n     strictest confidence, but because of the uniqueness of \n     McCarty's story, he asked for her permission to make it \n     public.\n       ``Well, I guess that would be all right,'' she said with \n     her typical calm acceptance.\n       ``She seems wonderfully at peace with where she is and who \n     she is,'' Laughlin said.\n       McCarty's arthritis in her hands forced her to retire from \n     washing and ironing in December 1994, at the age of 86. Now \n     she spends her days cleaning house, and she still walks \n     everywhere she goes. But she said, ``If I ever get able to, I \n     want to go back to work.''\n       She is taking others' excitement over her gift with the \n     same quiet grace that she has taken all the bad and good that \n     have come into her life.\n       ``I can't do everything,'' she said, ``but I can do \n     something to help. And what I can do I will do. I wish I \n     could do more.''\n               Heatfelt Gift to Students Motivates Public\n\n                           (By Ronnie Agnew)\n\n       The way Oseola McCarty figures it, her best years are \n     behind her.\n       The 86-year-old Hattiesburg woman doesn't get around like \n     she used to. The hands that once washed and ironed millions \n     of pieces of clothing are now failing her.\n       The desire to get up in the morning and begin another 12-\n     hour day has subsided. McCarty is slowly getting used to her \n     new life, even if it comes without the endless line of \n     customers knocking at her door. Even if it comes without the \n     work that has consumed most of her 86 years.\n       She is a woman who believes that she has served her time. \n     She has worked hard, she will tell you. But she also flashes \n     a smile that says she enjoyed every minute of it.\n       McCarty's recent donation of $150,000 to the University of \n     Southern Mississippi is but a small part of a fascinating \n     life, a life without frills and perks. A life painfully \n     primitive to most people--she still washes clothes by hand--\n     but a satisfying life to McCarty.\n       Her donation continues to both shock and motivate people.\n       In fact, there is a move within the Hattiesburg area \n     business community to donate $150,000 to USM to match \n     McCarty's gift, which will provide scholarships after her \n     death.\n       Bill Pace, executive director of the USM foundation, said \n     the university is putting together a plan so the public may \n     match McCarty's gift. Moneys donated by the public would be \n     put into the Osecola McCarty Scholarship fund and used for \n     scholarships now.\n       The rest of the money, the $150,000 McCarty donated, would \n     be available to the university upon her death, as stated in \n     an irrevocable trust.\n       USM President Ambrey Lucas calls it the most heart-\n     rendering donation the school has ever received. He marveled \n     at how a woman whose sole income was washing and ironing \n     clothes could amass a small fortune and then give it all \n     away.\n       It was only in December that McCarty closed her business. \n     There is crippling arthritis in her right hand now. Years of \n     ironing has nearly rendered useless the hand that literally \n     fed her. ``It's gone dead on me,'' she says.\n       I would be working now if my hand hadn't started hurting. \n     Some people thought I stopped a long time ago,'' she said.\n       So difficult are some tasks, that she now washes her \n     laundry in her bathtub, using a plunger to clean soiled \n     clothing.\n       But because of her donation, scores of needy black students \n     will be able to go to college because of the hours she spent \n     washing and ironing other people's clothes. Not for a moment \n     does she covet the tens of thousands she earned as a \n     laundress. She doesn't know what's in her bank account--\n     doesn't know, doesn't care. It's estimated her donation is \n     about 60 percent of what she has in the bank.\n       ``The bank people take care of all my business,'' she says, \n     ``my bills, my groceries, everything.''\n       She is a simple woman with simple values and a simple \n     lifestyle.\n       She's lived in the same house for 70 years. She only \n     recently was persuaded to buy two air conditioners for her \n     small wood frame home. A 12-inch black and white TV sits \n     virtually unused in a corner of her living room. The Bible \n     that she reads daily is tattered and held together with \n     scotch tape. She doesn't have a favorite verse, she says, she \n     just opens the good book and lets the Lord have his way.\n       Such simplicity comes from a woman born before World War I, \n     a woman who lived through the Great Depression, and who has \n     seen the administrations of 17 U.S. presidents. McCarty is \n     tiny--she stands about five feet tall and weighs little more \n     than 100 pounds--and until last week, she lived in relative \n     obscurity. Only regular customers of her wash-and-iron \n     business were privy to the small details that are locked up \n     inside her.\n       She doesn't mind talking about details. She's just a little \n     surprised that anyone would care to know. Once they do, she \n     shares her story, little by little, in a voice as soft as a \n     whisper. It is a story about a woman who was introduced to \n     work when she was a toddler.\n       It is a story about a woman who quit school three months \n     shy of finishing the sixth grade to help take care of an \n     ailing grandmother. It is the story of a woman who never \n     married because there was simply too much work to do and not \n     enough time. It is the story of a woman who has lived alone \n     since 1967 when her aunt died.\n       It is also a story of a person who believes life should be \n     lived at its most basic level. The air conditioning, or \n     ``fan'' as she calls it, is only turned on when a visitor is \n     present. The shoes she wears around the house have been cut \n     out to give her toes more breathing room. The 12-inch black \n     and white TV that she seldom watches only picks up one \n     channel.\n       But McCarty isn't looking for sympathy. In her view, she \n     lives a full and prosperous life. Never mind that she could \n     purchase a new car and home without even a hint of a \n     financial strain. She never learned to drive so what good \n     would a new car do any way, she reasons. She wouldn't dream \n     of leaving the home she has lived in since she was a young \n     girl.\n       She wants the money she has earned to educate children, \n     ``so that they won't have to work as hard as I did. I just \n     worked and worked and worked and worked. That's all I ever \n     knew.\n       Each week, McCarty would take her earnings from her laundry \n     business to what is now Trustmark Bank. During the early \n     years, she would charge customers $2 a bundle. But in later \n     years, the bill was $10 and up. Every penny went to the bank. \n     That's where it went and that's where it still sits.\n       The teller asked me about 3 years ago, ``Miss McCarty, \n     anybody ever talk to you about investing?'' I told her I \n     didn't know how to do it. I didn't understand it. I don't \n     understand it now.''\n       Paul Laughlin, an assistant vice president and trust \n     officer at Trustmark Bank, has been one of several bank \n     representatives to advise Miss McCarty. He fondly recalls his \n     conversation with her when she decided to let the bank set up \n     a trust account.\n       ``I said, `Miss McCarty, where do you want the money to go \n     after you pass on?' She said, `Well, I want most of it to go \n     to the college.' Since we have two and I wanted to be \n     absolutely sure, I asked her which college. She said, \n     `Mississippi Southern.'''\n       ``All her life she put her money away,'' Laughlin said. \n     ``It's now such a large amount, she really doesn't appreciate \n     how much money that is.''\n       Since her money is being invested, McCarty can now talk a \n     little about maturing CD accounts. She has no idea that she \n     has enough saved to buy her way out of the low-income \n     neighborhood where she resides. The power of money alludes \n     her. In her mind, cab fares are still too expensive and the \n     bus just doesn't run often enough.\n       But she does know that the amount of money she saved ``just \n     popped up'' and she wants it to help somebody. ``I just don't \n     know how it happened,'' she says, shaking her head. ``I was \n     trying to save for my old days when I wouldn't have to work \n     so hard.''\n       She made her money from loyal customers--lawyers, doctors, \n     teachers, police and military personnel. It was the only \n     business she knew. Her mother, grandmother and aunt all were \n     a part of it. But after each of their deaths, more of the \n     work fell to her. She comes from a farming family from \n     Shubata, Miss., a small town outside of Meridian.\n       Her family left the farm and moved to Hattiesburg when they \n     grew tired of farming. It was then that the laundry business \n     was born. McCarty says no one really taught her how \n\n[[Page S12079]]\n     to work. But being an only child around ``grown folk all the time'' \n     forced her to grow up fast.\n       ``I didn't have no brothers or no sisters. Whatever I saw \n     the grown people do, I tried to do myself. You don't know \n     what you can do until you try,'' she said.\n       Now all she wants is to give young black students a chance; \n     a chance she says she didn't have. She has no ties to USM. \n     She has never visited the campus, only passed by it on \n     occasion. But her demeanor turns serious when she thinks \n     about what her donation might do.\n       ``Our race goes to that school,'' she says. ``Used to be \n     that we couldn't. I want to do the children some good. It \n     won't do me no good because I'm old.''\n       USM's Lucas knows the many students that McCarty's gift \n     will reach. But he said he is as touched by the person as he \n     is by her gift.\n       ``She lives a simple life,'' he said. ``Her enjoyment comes \n     from being independent, saving her resources and not wasting \n     them. She enjoys the simple things in life, going to church, \n     talking to friends. She feels very fulfilled.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/09/senate-section/article/S12077-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. D'AMATO, from the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs, without amendment:\n       S. 883.

A bill to amend the Fair Housing Act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n       the fair housing reform and freedom of speech act of 1995\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Fair \nHousing Reform and Freedom of Speech Act of 1995.\n  Mr. President when I ran for the Senate in 1992, one of the themes of \nmy campaign was that I wanted a return to common sense in Washington, \nDC. The purpose of the bill I am introducing today is to bring a little \ncommon sense to our nation's housing policy, and particularly the way \nthe Clinton administration has conducted housing policy.\n  First, this bill would overturn the recent Supreme Court ruling in \nCity of Edmonds versus Oxford House. In that case, a home for 10 to 12 \nrecovering drug addicts and alcoholics was located in a single family \nneighborhood. The city tried to have the house removed because it \nviolated the city's local zoning code that placed limits on the number \nof unrelated persons living together. the Supreme Court ruled that the \nFair Housing Act was violated by this zoning law.\n  I think the Supreme Court ruled incorrectly in this case. The \nCongress clearly intended an exemption from the Fair Housing Act \nregarding the number of unrelated occupants living together. My bill \nwould clarify that localities can continue to zone certain areas as \nsingle family neighborhoods, by limiting the number of unrelated \noccupants living together. In my opinion, I think families should be \nable to live in neighborhoods without the threat that groups homes--\nunsuitable for single family neighborhoods--can move in next door and \nreceive the protection of the Fair Housing Act.\n  But the most important point is this one; decisions about zoning \nshould be made in cities and towns and not in Washington. If a locality \nwants to permit groups homes in a certain area--it can do so without \nHUD interfering in the decision.\n  Mr. President, my bill would also correct the abuses of the Fair \nHousing Act by the Clinton administration. In the past year, HUD has \ntaken to suing people under the Fair Housing Act who have protested \ngroup homes coming into their neighborhoods. The most well known of \nthese cases was the incident involving three residents in Berkeley, CA. \nHUD's actions were a blatant violation of their right to freedom of \nspeech. HUD's abuse was so bad, that they dropped the suit and promised \nthey wouldn't do it again. HUD even issued new guidelines on the \nsubject so it couldn't happen again.\n  But, just recently--HUD has done it again. This time HUD is suing \nfive Californians who went to court to get a restraining order against \na group home for the developmentally disabled that was planned for \ntheir neighborhood.\n  Mr. President, the issue is not whether the location for this group \nhome is proper, that issue can be decided by the courts. The issue is \nfreedom of speech. I believe anybody has the right to speak their mind \nand to take legal action against what they think is an injustice. HUD \nwon't even let them do that.\n  HUD takes the opposite view. They want to intimidate people into \nsubmission. They want to use the Fair Housing Act as a weapon to \nsilence legitimate speech, not discrimination. In the \n\n[[Page S12080]]\nprocess, they have trivialized real discrimination. They have made a \nlaughing stock of the Fair Housing Act--that it could actually be used \nto silence legal protest. This is wrong and it has to stop.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we can make these reforms to the Fair \nHousing Act. We need to preserve this act to prevent real \ndiscrimination, but we do not need to use the act to pursue a far, far \nleft agenda that defies common sense, and silences free speech.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1133. A bill to amend the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to permit \nparticipating households to use food stamp benefits to purchase \nnutritional supplements of vitamins, minerals, or vitamins and \nminerals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                         food stamp legislation\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation that would give food stamp recipients greater flexibility \nto balance their diets by permitting food stamp purchases of vitamins \nand mineral supplements.\n  The Food Stamp Program is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's \nlargest income security program. Its goal of providing all Americans \naccess to healthy, nutritious diets is pursued by increasing the food \npurchasing power of more than 27 million low-income Americans in 11 \nmillion households each day.\n  While it is possible to receive optimum levels of nutrients through a \ncareful selection of foods, the fact is that most people do not. A \ngovernment survey of 21,000 Americans showed that not a single person \nsurveyed obtained 100 percent of the recommended daily allowance [RDA] \nfor all of the essential vitamins and minerals. Scientific research \nshows that many nutrients play an important role in reducing the risk \nof various common and chronic diseases. So, it is no surprise that \nmillions of Americans regularly take vitamin and mineral supplements to \nassure that they receive appropriate levels of these essential \nnutrients.\n  Unfortunately, food stamp recipients have not been permitted to use \ntheir food stamps to purchase vitamin and mineral supplements. \nTherefore, the legislation I am proposing would permit Food Stamp \nProgram recipients the option of spending the few pennies a day it \ncosts to purchase vitamin and mineral supplements.\n  Mr. President, this legislation would help the people who need \nnutritional help the most--the poor--especially women of childbearing \nage, young children, and the elderly. Their access to vitamin and \nmineral supplements can help them assure they are receiving a \nnutritious diet. I urge my colleagues to consider the positive \ncontribution to public health that can be achieved through permitting \nlow-income Americans access to vitamin and mineral supplements.\n  My legislation is simple, it permits vitamin and mineral supplements \nto be purchased with food stamp coupons. It helps the people who need \nnutritional food the most, the poor and elderly. If food stamp \nrecipients are permitted to use their food stamps to buy nutritional \nsupplements, everybody will be helped. Vitamin and mineral supplements \nare considered an accessory food and therefore would have no effect on \nthe number of stores participating in the Food Stamp Program. I urge \nall of my colleagues to take a look at this legislation and consider \nthe positive health benefits that vitamin and mineral supplements can \nadd to a healthy diet.\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Hatch in introducing legislation today that will \nallow the use of food stamps for the purchase of nutritional \nsupplements. I believe this important legislation can contribute \nsubstantially to improving the nutrition and health of a segment of our \nsociety that too often falls below adequate levels of nutrient \nconsumption.\n  Scientific evidence continues to mount showing that good nutrition is \nessential for normal growth and cognitive development in children, and \nfor improved health and the prevention of a variety of conditions and \nillnesses. That knowledge is the underlying basis for our Federal \nnutrition assistance programs.\n  Studies have also shown, unfortunately, that many Americans do not \nhave sufficient dietary intakes of a number of important nutrients. \nInsufficient dietary intakes are especially critical for children, \npregnant women, and the elderly.\n  A recent study conducted by the Tufts University School of Nutrition, \nand based on government data, showed that millions of poor children in \nthe United States have dietary intakes that are well below the \ngovernment's recommended daily allowance for a number of important \nnutrients. The study found that major differences exist in the intakes \nof poor versus nonpoor children for 10 out of 16 nutrients--food \nenergy, folate, iron, magnesium, thiamin, vitamin A, vitamin B6, \nvitamin C. Vitamin E, and zinc. Moreover, the proportion of poor \nchildren with inadequate intakes of zinc is over 50 percent; for iron, \nover 40 percent; and for vitamin E, over 33 percent. For some \nnutrients, such as vitamin A and magnesium, the proportion of poor \nchildren with inadequate intakes is nearly six times as large as for \nnonpoor children.\n  Pregnant women also have high nutritional needs. For example, after \nyears of concern about inadequate folate intake by pregnant women, the \nPublic Health Service has issued a recommendation regarding consumption \nof folic acid by all women of childbearing age who are capable of \nbecoming pregnant for the purpose of reducing the incidence of spina \nbifida or other neural tube defects.\n  Millions of Americans, including myself, take dietary supplements to \nimprove their health, prevent illness, and ensure that they and their \nfamilies are consuming sufficient levels of key nutrients.\n  This legislation would enable low-income people to have greater \naccess to nutritional supplements to improve their diet. Currently, \nrecipients of food stamps are not allowed to use those\n resources to purchase nutritional supplements. This restriction \nclearly serves as an impediment to adequate nutrition for low-income \npeople who may need supplements to ensure they are consuming sufficient \nlevels of nutrients.\n\n  The current restriction also prevents food stamp recipients from \nexercising their own responsibility and choice to use food stamps for \npurchasing nutritional supplements that they determine are important \nfor the health of their children or themselves. It is a glaring \ninconsistency that food stamps may currently be used to purchase a \nvariety of non-nutritious or minimally nutritious foods but not to \npurchase nutritional supplements--to purchase diet soft drinks having \nno nutritive value, but not to purchase folic acid which may prevent a \nfatal birth defect.\n  Opponents of this legislation will argue that food stamps are most \neffectively used to improve nutrition through purchasing food rather \nthan nutritional supplements, and that if food stamps may be used for \nnutritional supplements, households will be less able to stretch their \nresources to purchase sufficient quantities of food. The available \nevidence indicates, however, that food stamp households actually make \nmore careful and effective use of their resources in purchasing \nnutritious foods than consumers in general. Since food stamp households \nnecessarily have a limited amount of money to spend on food--and \ngenerally already find it difficult to meet their food needs--they \nsimply cannot afford to make unwise or unnecessary purchases of \nnutritional supplements using food stamps which would otherwise be used \nfor food. So I believe the concerns that food stamps will be wasted or \nunwisely used for nutritional supplements is unfounded.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will join in supporting this \nlegislation designed to improve opportunities for low-income Americans \nto ensure adequate nutrition and improved health for their families and \nthemselves.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Mr. Grams, Mr. Dole, Mr. Coats, Mr. \n        Faircloth, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Mack, \n        Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Smith, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \n        Thompson, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Craig, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Bennett):\n\n[[Page S12081]]\n\n  S. 1134. A bill to provide family tax relief; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n               the american family tax relief act of 1995\n\n Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, when the Senate returns from the \nAugust recess we will begin the long, hard budget reconciliation \nprocess. We have already come a long way toward our goal of balancing \nthe Federal budget, but reconciliation is the real test of our \nleadership and our commitment. The spending cuts we will enact will not \ncome without sacrifice from many people. Fortunately, that sacrifice \nwill not go unrewarded, because we intend to cut spending enough to \nbalance the budget, plus provide tax relief to Americans.\n  Today I am pleased to introduce legislation which represents a key \nportion of our promise to reduce taxes on American families. The \nAmerican Family Tax Relief Act will provide a $500 per child tax credit \nto benefit 52 million children in 35 million families nationwide.\n  I am also pleased to say that my legislation is being cosponsored by \nmany of my colleagues, several of which have worked for years to enact \na family tax credit. My cosponsors include long-time family credit \nsponsors Senator Grams and Senator Coats, the Majority Leader Senator \nDole, Senator Faircloth, Senator Kempthorne, Senator Coverdell, Senator \nMack, Senator Thurmond, Senator Gramm, Senator Santorum, Senator Smith, \nSenator Kyl, Senator Thompson, and Senator Inhofe.\n  Mr. President, the Balanced Budget Resolution we passed earlier this \nyear promised that if we do our job, that is if we enact spending cuts \nsufficient to balance the budget by fiscal year 2002, the economy will \nreward us with a fiscal dividend sufficient to reduce the tax burden on \nour citizens by up to $245 billion over 7 years. While many critics \nhave complained that a tax cut of that magnitude is too generous, \nconsider the following facts. Over the next 7 years the Federal \nGovernment will take more than $11.4 trillion out of the pockets of \nAmerican families and businesses. A tax cut of $245 billion is barely 2 \npercent of that amount.\n  With that $245 billion, we are going to reverse the trend of tax \nincreases which have marked the past several years, reduce taxes on \nfamilies and businesses, and increase savings and investment. I firmly \nbelieve, however, that the priority should be on families. At least 60 \nto 70 percent of our fiscal dividend should be family friendly, and \nthat is why I am introducing this legislation.\n  Why is family tax relief important, Mr. President? Primarily because \ntoday's families with children are overtaxed. In 1948, the average \nAmerican family paid only 3 percent of its income in Federal taxes. \nToday, the same family pays over 25 percent. This mounting tax burden \nis caused by many factors, but particularly damaging are heavy payroll \ntaxes and the eroding value of the personal and dependent exemption. In \n1948, the dependent exemption equaled 42.1 percent of per capita \npersonal income, effectively shielding that income from taxation. \nToday's dependent exemption of $2,500 equals only 10.9 percent of per \ncapita personal income. Congress would have raise the exemption to \n$9,657 to provide the same benefit as 1948. Payroll taxes hit families \nwith children particularly hard because most of their income comes in \nthe form of wages. Nearly three-fourths of all taxpayers now pay more \nin payroll taxes than income taxes.\n  Another reason to enact family tax relief is that it can make our tax \nsystem more progressive and literally remove the IRS from the lives of \nmillions of families. A study by the Heritage Foundation based on IRS \nand Bureau of the Census data estimates that a $500 per child tax \ncredit would: eliminate all Federal income tax liability for families \nof four earning between $17,000 and $24,000 per year, cut by 50 percent \nthe income tax burden of a family earning $30,000 per year, cut by 30 \npercent the income tax burden of a family earning $40,000 per year, cut \nby 6.8 percent the income tax burden of a family earning $100,000 per \nyear, and cut by 2.6 percent the income tax burden of a family earning \n$200,000 per year.\n  Heritage further estimates that the typical congressional district \nhas 117,000 children in families eligible for a $500 credit, meaning \n$59 million per year in lower taxes which families can spend on their \nown priorities. Families in the state of Oklahoma stand to gain over \n$322 million. I have no doubt that those Oklahoma parents can spend \nthat money much more wisely than the Federal bureaucracy.\n  Mr. President, the American Family Tax Relief Act is nearly identical \nto the family tax credit passed by the House earlier this year as part \nof the Contract with America. The only difference between our proposals \nis that my bill has no income limit. Because the President and our \nDemocrat colleagues have shown a near rabid desire to turn any tax cut \ninitiative into a class war, I have no doubt that we will discuss this \nissue at length in the Senate Finance Committee and on the Senate \nfloor. However, there is absolutely no economic or tax policy \njustification to limit the family tax credit to certain income levels. \nThe only reasons are political, ones, and even those pale when you \nrealize that almost all children, 94 percent, live in families with \nincomes below $100,000.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I encourage those who have not already \ndone so to join me in this important initiative.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1134\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased that Majority Leader \nDole and Senator Rod Grams  and myself to ensure the passage of a $500 \nper child tax credit by introducing the American Family Tax Relief Act \nof 1995. Many of my colleagues are already familiar with the Family's \nFirst legislation that I introduced earlier this year. The centerpiece \nof this legislation is the $500 per child tax credit which I have been \nproposing for the last 3 years.\n  The $500 per child tax credit already has cleared the House. The \nintroduction of this legislation with strong leadership support is \ngreat news for the hard working families of America. With Majority \nLeader Dole's support and leadership on this issue, I am now confident \nthat the Senate will include a $500 per child tax credit in the \nreconciliation bill later this year.\n  The time has come to show families that they are a priority--for too \nlong we have ignored their cries of help. The federal tax burden on the \ntypical American family has become overwhelming. In 1948, the average \nAmerican family of four paid just 3 percent of its income to the \nFederal Government. By 1992, that tax bill has skyrocketed to 24.5 \npercent of family earnings.\n  This dramatically increased tax burden complicates the family's \nrole--to provide for the social and moral education of children. Family \ntax reform is more than a matter of money. It will help restore the \nfamily to an economic position that allows it to fulfill its most vital \nresponsibilities.\n  In 1993, the bipartisan Commission on America's Urban Families found \nthat ``the trend of family fragmentation drives the nation's most \npressing social problems: crime, educational failure, declining mental \nhealth, drug abuse, and poverty. These, in turn, further fragment \nfamilies.''\n  The Commission continued, ``To date, the nation's basic response has \nbeen policies that attempt to address the negative consequences of this \ntrend. This response has been insufficient. Our principal national goal \nmust be to reverse the trend of family fragmentation.''\n  One of the key policy recommendations of the commission was to \n``increase the self-sufficiency and economic well-being of families by \neither significantly increasing the personal exemption * * * or a child \ntax credit for all children through age 18.''\n  The findings of the National Commission on Urban Families were \nremarkably similar to those advocated 3 years earlier by the Democratic \nProgressive Policy Institute. In an impressive report entitled \n``Putting Children First: A Progressive Family Policy for the 1990s'', \nthis group found:\n\n       America is the only country among the eighteen rich \n     democracies in the world that does not have a family \n     allowance or some other sort of government subsidy per child. \n     Western European countries recognize that nurturance has a \n     great societal value. . . [T]hese societies have acknowledged \n     that there are some things that only families can do and that \n     if families are placed under so much stress that they cannot \n     raise children effectively, the rest of society cannot make \n     up the difference in later years.\n       The United States used to have a form of family allowance; \n     we just did not call it that. In 1948 there was a pro-family \n     government policy based on a simple notion: the government \n     should not tax away that portion of a family's income that is \n     needed to raise children.\n\n  The Progressive Policy Institute concluded, ``We believe that a \nprimary goal of our tax policy should be to bolster families who are \nraising children.''\n  When families fail, the cost to society is enormous. As we have \nlearned in the past decades, programs aimed at fixing the failures are \nnot only expensive, they are often ineffective.\n  I believe that it is time to reassess our priorities. We need to \ndirect our focus, and our funds, to strengthen the family. I believe \nthis legislation takes us on the right course.\n  Obviously, government's role in preserving the family is limited but \nit is not insignificant. Perhaps the single most important thing \ngovernment can accomplish is to alleviate the economic stress on the \nfamily.\n  Economist Eugene Steurle noted that in 1948 the personal exemption \nwas $600 and the median family income was $3,187. This meant that a \nfamily of four paid only 3 percent of its income in federal income \ntaxes. He noted that the net result of the ensuing erosion of the \npersonal exemption has been that ``tax-exempt levels for households \nwithout dependents have been moving closer and closer to tax-exempt \nlevels for households with dependents.''\n  In 1948, the personal exemption shielded 42 percent of family income \nfrom taxes. By 1992, that tax bill had skyrocketed to 24.5 percent of \nfamily earnings, and the value of that exemption has eroded to 11 \npercent of income. In order for the personal exemption to provide the \nsame benefit as it did in 1948 it would have to be raised from $2,500 \nto $9,657.\n  With rising costs and the seemingly never-ending tax burden, it is \nnearly impossible for American families to get ahead today. Families \nare working harder today than ever before. Many Hoosiers continually \ntell me that its just harder and harder to make ends meet. Sometimes \none or both parents are working two jobs which takes more time away \nfrom the family just to pay the tax man.\n  In my home state of Indiana the median income for a family of four is \n$34,082. Of that, nearly $11,000 is devoted to federal, state, and \nlocal taxes. The average family in Indiana pays more in taxes than it \ndoes in housing, food, and clothing expenses combined. The Tax \nFoundation has stated that Indiana families worked 117 days this year \nuntil April 27 to pay Uncle Sam.\n  Some have said that $500 will not go far. To them I say, you have \nbeen inside the beltway for too long. Economists have noted, that \ninvested over the life of the child, it is enough today for a state \ncollege education. It means $80 of grocery money each month. And it may \nbuy time for parents to spend with their children, time to instill the \nvalues of love and discipline that are critical in the formation of \ncitizens of character.\n  Fifty-two million children are eligible for this credit, and 86 \npercent of this tax relief would go to families making less than \n$75,000 per year.\n  The American social fabric is seriously strained. When families fail, \nthe cost to society is enormous. That failure is measured in lost \ndollars and in lost lives. the lessons learned from decades of social \nspending are clear. Government cannot effectively stay the hand of \ndespair and destruction. Strong families can. We simply cannot afford \nto ignore the evidence before us. Family preservation must be paramount \nin our Federal policy. I am pleased that the Majority Leader and \nSenator Nickles have joined the family tax relief effort. I look \nforward to working with them this fall to enact the $500 per child tax \ncredit this year.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mr. Kempthorne):\n  S. 1135. A bill to amend the Federal Crop Insurance Act to include \nseed crops among the list of crops specifically covered under the \nnoninsured crop disaster assistance program, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                         seed crops legislation\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my purpose here today is to \nintroduce a bill that would amend the Federal Crop Insurance Act to \ninclude seed crops among the list of crops specifically covered under \nthe noninsured crop disaster assistance program.\n  It was my understanding that seed crops were to be covered under the \nFederal Crop Insurance Corporation [FCIC] changes that were implemented \nas part of the USDA reorganization in the 103d \n\n[[Page S12083]]\nCongress. Since my understanding differs from the current \nimplementation, I urge my colleagues to accept this amendment and \nrectify the situation.\n  As the origin of all crop production, a stable supply of seeds is an \nabsolute necessity. If seed producers are to continue supplying a \nvaluable product, they must have access to risk management tools, which \nincludes insurance coverage. In my State of Idaho, we are proud to \nproduce the Nation's largest supply of seed for sweet corn, field \nbeans, garden beans, and teff. In addition, Idaho is among the top \nproducers of alfalfa, popcorn, and turf grasses.\n  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in enabling this industry \nto utilize the insurance coverage that is provided to other \nagricultural commodities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1135\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. NONINSURED CROP DISASTER ASSISTANCE COVERAGE OF \n                   SEED CROPS.\n\n       Section 519(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 \n     U.S.C. 1519(a)(2)(B)) is amended by inserting ``seed crops,'' \n     after ``turfgrass sod,''. \n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, the Idaho delegation today is \ntaking steps to right a wrong. Senator Craig and I are joining our \ncolleagues in the House, Representatives Crapo and Chenoweth in \nintroducing legislation to clarify congressional intent regarding the \nFederal crop insurance program reform that the 103d Congress completed.\n  Implementing crop insurance reform has not always been the smoothest \nprocess, as Idaho's agriculture producers can attest. While that reform \nwas a much needed step forward in streamlining the Federal crop \ninsurance program, there is still work to be done. This bill tackles \none part of that remaining effort.\n  When the Federal crop insurance reforms were implemented last year, \nthe agency interpreted the law to be strictly limited to commodities \nthat are consumed directly as foodstuffs. Such an interpretation \nignores some crops which had traditionally been covered under the crop \ninsurance umbrella. Among those are seed crops.\n  I am here today as someone who supported Federal crop insurance \nreform, to say that such an exclusion was not the intent of Congress. \nThe bill Senator Craig and I are introducing today will set the record \nstraight.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Brown, \n        Mr. Kyl, Mr. Abraham, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1136. A bill to control and prevent commercial counterfeiting, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n         the anticounterfeiting consumer protection act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by my \ncolleagues, Senators Leahy, Thurmond, Brown, Kyl, Abraham, and \nFeinstein, in introducing legislation to confront a rapidly growing \nthreat to American industry and to the public: trademark \ncounterfeiting. Stated simply, it is time we knock-out the knock-off \nindustry.\n  We contacted some selected U.S. industries and found that the impact \nof counterfeiting losses are substantial. Companies invest heavily in \ndeveloping and maintaining their reputations. And, the jobs of millions \nof American workers depend on the competitiveness of their employers.\n  Sales of pirated motion pictures cause losses equal to 8 percent of \nall movie sales revenue. The pirates are so efficient that tapes of the \nrecently released ``Apollo 13'' were available the day after the \nmovie's release in theaters. And tapes of the much-hyped \n``Waterworld'', composed mainly of outtakes, was available before the \nmovie's theatrical release.\n  The software industry is particularly affected, with sales of pirated \nsoftware accounting for more than 40 percent of total revenues. Some \nanalysts suggest that is more than the industry's total profits.\n  Perhaps most troubling, however, is the widespread threat \ncounterfeiting poses to public health and safety. Automobile parts are \ncommonly made of substandard material and pose serious risks to \nconsumers. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that a counterfeit GM \nbrake lining composed of wood chips was responsible for an accident \nthat claimed the life of a mother and her child.\n  Media reports on the seizures in 16 States of a counterfeit version \nof the popular infant formula Similac underscore our vulnerability. \nThis bogus formula could kill children who may be allergic to it.\n  Unfortunately, few Americans truly appreciate the significance, \nscope, or consequences of this crime. Only yesterday, Committee \ninvestigators purchased a fake Cartier watch and bogus Ray Ban \nsunglasses one block from the Capitol. It is hard to perceive the \nrelationship between a cheap, fake watch or handbag and public health \nrisks, money laundering, murder, and--if media reports are true--\nterrorism. But it is there.\n  Those who traffic in counterfeit goods can be ruthless members of \ndangerous businesses, and organized crime is increasingly involved. The \nleader of the ``Born to Kill'' crime gang in New York City made an \nestimated $13 million a year\n selling fake Cartier and Rolex watches. This revenue stream was \nprobably useful in financing other nefarious business, as well as being \nprofitable in itself. For the criminal, the lure of counterfeiting is \nnot just the billions of dollars in illegal profit. It is the fact that \nthe risk of being caught, prosecuted, and imprisoned is not high.\n\n  The time has come to make sure that the law provides the tools \nnecessary to fight today's sophisticated counterfeiters. Our bill will \ndo just that. It is called the ``Anticounterfeiting Consumer Protection \nAct of 1995.'' I like to call it the ``Knock-Out the Knock-Offs'' bill.\n  First, it increases criminal penalties by making trafficking in \ncounterfeit goods or services a RICO offense, thereby providing for \nincreased jail time, criminal fines, and asset forfeiture.\n  Second, our bill allows greater involvement by all Federal law \nenforcement in fighting counterfeiting, including enhanced authority to \nseize counterfeit goods and the tools of the counterfeiter's trade.\n  Third, it makes it more difficult for these goods to re-enter the \nstream of commerce once they have been seized.\n  Fourth, our bill also adds teeth to existing statutes by providing \nfor further civil remedies, including civil fines pegged to the value \nof genuine goods and statutory damage awards of up to $1,000,000 per \nmark.\n  The time has come for us to send the message to the public that \ncounterfeiting is a serious crime that involves domestic and \ninternational organized crime rings. It is a crime that robs all \nAmericans. It is time to knock-out the knock-offs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                S. 1136\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The counterfeiting of trademarked and copyrighted \n     merchandise--\n       (1) has been connected with organized crime;\n       (2) deprives legitimate trademark and copyright owners of \n     substantial revenues and consumer goodwill;\n       (3) poses health and safety threats to American consumers;\n       (4) eliminates American jobs; and\n       (5) is a multibillion-dollar drain on the United States \n     economy.\n\n     SEC. 3.

CUSTOMS ENTRY DOCUMENTATION.\n\n       Section 484(d) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. \n     1484(d)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Entries'' and inserting ``(1) Entries''; \n     and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(2) The Secretary, in prescribing regulations governing \n     the content of entry documentation, shall require that entry \n     documentation contain such information as may be necessary to \n     determine whether the imported merchandise bears an \n     infringing trademark in violation of section 42 of the Act of \n     July 5, 1946 (60 Stat. 440, chapter 540; 15 U.S.C. 1124) or \n     any other applicable law, including a trademark appearing on \n     the goods or packaging.''.\n\n     SEC. 13. UNLAWFUL USE OF VESSELS, VEHICLES, AND AIRCRAFT IN \n                   AID OF COMMERCIAL COUNTERFEITING.\n\n       Section 80302(a) of title 49, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``or'' at the end of paragraph (4);\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (5) and \n     inserting ``; or''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(6)(A) A counterfeit label for a phonorecord, computer \n     program or computer program documentation or packaging or \n     copy of a motion picture or other audiovisual work (as \n     defined in section 2318 of title 18);\n       ``(B) a phonorecord or copy in violation of section 2319 of \n     title 18; or\n       ``(C) any good bearing a counterfeit mark (as defined in \n     section 2320 of title 18).''.\n\n     SEC. 14. REGULATIONS.\n\n       Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe such \n     regulations or amendments to existing regulations that may be \n     necessary to implement and enforce this Act.\n                                                                    ____\n\nAnticounterfeiting Consumer Protection Act of 1995--Section-by-Section \n                                Analysis\n\n       The Anticounterfeiting Consumer Protection Act of 1995 \n     proposes a number of statutory amendments to strengthen this \n     country's anticounterfeiting laws in three important areas: \n     criminal law enforcement, civil lawsuits, and Customs Service \n     interdiction. A brief section-by-section analysis of the Act \n     follows.\n       Section 1. Short title.--The proposed legislation is \n     entitled the ``Anticounterfeiting Consumer Protection Act of \n     1995.''\n       Section 2. Findings.--Section 2 summarizes the significant \n     harms associated with counterfeiting, including the link \n     between counterfeiting and organized crime, the resulting \n     losses in revenues and goodwill to U.S. copyright and \n     trademark owners, the threat to consumer health and safety, \n     the loss of American jobs, and the overall drain on the U.S. \n     economy.\n       Section 3. Counterfeiting as racketeering.--Section 3 would \n     make the following crimes ``predicate acts'' for purposes of \n     the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act \n     (``RICO''), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961: (i) trafficking in \n     counterfeit labels for phonorecords, computer programs or \n     computer program documentation or packaging and copies of \n     motion pictures or other audiovisual works, as defined in 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2318\\1\\; (ii) criminal infringement of a \n     copyright in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2319; and (iii) \n     trafficking in counterfeit goods or services, as defined in \n     18 U.S.C. Sec. 2320. This amendment to the RICO statute would \n     allow law enforcement officials in appropriate cases to seize \n     not only counterfeit goods, but also the non-monetary assets, \n     including both personal and real property (e.g., raw \n     materials, tools, equipment, and manufacturing or storage \n     facilities), associated with the criminal counterfeiting \n     enterprise, just as they now can do for a host of other \n     criminal enterprises. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1963.\n     \\1\\Section 4 would amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2318 to prohibit \n     trafficking in counterfeit labels affixed to copies of \n     computer programs or computer program documentation or \n     packaging.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Section 4. Application to computer programs, computer \n     program documentation, or packaging.--Section 4 would extend \n     the criminal prohibitions and penalties of 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2318 to trafficking in counterfeit labels affixed or \n     designed to be affixed to copies of a computer program or \n     computer program documentation or packaging. This amendment \n     would recognize and address the widespread counterfeiting of \n     computer software and international trafficking in \n     counterfeit labels, holograms and other computer software \n     documentation and packaging. Moreover, the amendment would \n     update existing criminal counterfeiting provisions directed \n     at labels for phonorecords and videos \n\n[[Page S12085]]\n     to take into account the significant advancements in technology and \n     thereby empower federal law enforcement agencies to combat \n     the growing counterfeiting trade in computer programs.\n       Section 5. Trafficking in counterfeit goods or services.--\n     Section 5 would amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2320, the statute \n     govering trafficking in counterfeit goods or services, to \n     require the Attorney General to obtain from all United States \n     Attorney's Offices certain statistical information relating \n     to all criminal counterfeiting actions involving (i) \n     trafficking in counterfeit labels for phonorecords, copies of \n     computer programs or computer program documentation or \n     packaging, copies of motion pictures or other audiovisual \n     works; (ii) criminal infringement of copyrights; or (iii) \n     trafficking in goods or services bearing counterfeit marks. \n     The information must then be incorporated into the Attorney \n     General's annual report to Congress mandated by Section 522 \n     of Title 28. This reporting requirement will enable Congress \n     and the American public to assess the extent to which \n     commercial counterfeiting is being vigilantly investigated \n     and prosecuted by our nation's U.S. Attorneys.\n       Section 6. Seizure of counterfeit goods.--Section 6 would \n     amend 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1116 to make clear that, in addition to \n     U.S. marshals and state and local law enforcement officers, \n     any federal law enforcement officer may assist in conducting \n     an ex parte seizure of counterfeit trademarked merchandise \n     (including, by way of example, an officer or agent of the \n     U.S. Customs Service, Secret Service, Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, or Post Office). The present statute provides \n     that seizures of counterfeit merchandise may be conducted by \n     ``a United States marshal or other law enforcement officer.'' \n     15 U.S.C. Sec. 1116(d)(9). Clarification of this provision to \n     include other federal law enforcement officers is necessary \n     to ensure that ex parte seizure orders are executed in a \n     timely manner. At present, significant delays often occur \n     because the Marshal's Service often lacks the manpower to \n     promptly conduct an ex parte seizure. Moreover, the language \n     ``other law enforcement officer'' has been interpreted to \n     mean only state and local police officers, who are not \n     subject to federal judicial mandate and thus cannot be \n     compelled to execute seizure orders granted under federal \n     trademark law. The amendment would avoid this delay by \n     expressly extending seizure authority to any other federal \n     law enforcement officer.\n       Section 7. Recovery for violation of rights.--Section 7 \n     would amend 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1117 to provide statutory damages \n     as an alternative to actual damages in cases involving the \n     use of counterfeit trademarks. The option to elect statutory \n     damages in counterfeit cases ensures that trademark owners \n     and adequately compensated and that counterfeiters are justly \n     punished, even in\n      cases where the plaintiff is unable to prove actual damages \n     because, for example, the defendant engages in deceptive \n     record-keeping. Section 7 provides that a plaintiff may \n     elect, and a court may approve, statutory damages ranging \n     from $500 to $100,000 per mark for each type of \n     merchandise involved, or up to $1,000,000 per mark for \n     each type of merchandise if the violation is willful.\n       Section 8. Disposition of excluded articles.--Section 8 \n     would amend 17 U.S.C. Sec. 603(c) to eliminate the provision \n     allowing the U.S. Customs Service to re-export piratical \n     merchandise, thus ensuring that such goods are not allowed \n     back into the global marketplace where they continue to \n     violate the rights of American copyright owners and endanger \n     American consumers.\n       Section 9. Disposition of merchandise bearing American \n     trademark.--Section 9 would amend 19 U.S.C. Sec. 1526(e) to \n     require the U.S. Customs Service to destroy all counterfeit \n     merchandise that it seizes, unless the trademark owner \n     consents to some other disposition of the merchandise and the \n     merchandise is not a threat to consumer health or safety.\n       Section 10. Civil penalties.--Section 10 would add a new \n     subsection to 19 U.S.C. Sec. 1526 authorizing the U.S. \n     Customs Service to impose a civil fine on persons who are in \n     any way involved in the importation of counterfeit goods for \n     sale or public distribution. For first offenses, the fine \n     would be equal to the market value that the merchandise would \n     have had if it were genuine, according to the manufacturer's \n     suggested retail price. For repeat offenses, the fine would \n     be double that value. The imposition of the fine would be \n     subject to the discretion of the U.S. Customs Service, and \n     would be in addition to any other civil or criminal penalty \n     or other remedy authorized by law.\n       Section 11. Public disclosure of aircraft manifests.--\n     Section 11 would amend section 431(c)(1) of the Tariff Act, \n     19 U.S.C. Sec. 1431(c)(1), to make clear that existing \n     manifest disclosure requirements also extend to information \n     found in aircraft manifests. Under existing regulations, the \n     U.S. Customs Service discloses on a routine basis information \n     relating to shipments by sea, but is not required to disclose \n     information within its possession concerning shipments by \n     air. As a result of this distinction between sea and air \n     information, an entire category of shipping information is \n     shielded from public scrutiny, making it much more difficult \n     to detect and stop numerous counterfeiters and other \n     infringers who ship their merchandise by air. In order to \n     close this informational gap, this amendment would expressly \n     extend these manifest disclosure requirements to aircraft \n     manifests and thus require the Customs Service to amend its \n     regulations accordingly.\n       Section 12. Customs entry documentation.--Section 12 would \n     amend 19 U.S.C. Sec. 1484(d) to require the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, in prescribing regulations governing customs entry \n     documentation, to require importers to disclose on that \n     documentation such information as may be necessary to \n     determine whether the imported merchandise bears an \n     infringing trademark, including, for example, any trademarks \n     appearing on the goods or their packaging. Presently, \n     importers have no obligation to disclose to the Customs \n     Service the identity of any trademark appearing on imported \n     merchandise. By requiring the disclosure of any such \n     trademark or related information, this amendment would \n     facilitate the identification of infringing goods by Customs \n     officials and trademark owners and thus enhance border \n     enforcement of intellectual property rights.\n       Section 13. Unlawful use of vessels, vehicles, and aircraft \n     in aid of commercial counterfeiting.--Section 13 would amend \n     the definition of ``contraband'' in 49 U.S.C. App. Sec. 781 \n     to include (i) a counterfeit label for a phonorecord, \n     computer program or computer program documentation or \n     packaging or copy of a motion picture or other audiovisual \n     work, as defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2318; (ii) a phonorecord \n     or copy in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2319; or (iii) goods \n     bearing counterfeit marks, as defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2320. \n     This amendment would allow law enforcement officials to seize \n     the vehicles used by counterfeiters in transporting \n     counterfeit merchandise, just as they are currently allowed \n     to do with respect to counterfeit currency and government \n     securities.\n       Section 14. Regulations.--Section 14 would require the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe, within six months \n     after the date of enactment, such regulations or amendments \n     to existing regulations as may be necessary to implement and \n     enforce the provisions of the Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 1137. A bill to amend title 17, United States Code, with respect \nto the licensing of music, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                       SMALL BUSINESS LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I introduce legislation designed to \nhelp small business owners by exempting them from paying licensing fees \nfor music copyrights relating to radios and televisions used in their \nestablishments. This bill is common-sense approach which would level \nthe playing field for business owners who currently are faced with \nhaving to pay huge fees for the incidental broadcast of music played in \ntheir business.\n  The issue of licensing fees for copywritten music is extremely \ncomplex. No one disputes the right of performers to be properly \ncompensated for their music or compositions. However, the current law \nregarding music licensing causes confusion and hardship for many \nbusiness owners in my State and across the country. Every year, \nthousands of business owners are charged fees by the performing rights \nsocieties for the television and radio programming they present in \ntheir establishments. Unfortunately, many times these fees are charged \nin a confusing or ambiguous manner, without any oversight or controls.\n  I have heard for folks across Wyoming and the Nation who have \nexperienced trouble with the music licensing organizations. Often the \nfees charged by the organizations for playing radios or televisions \nvary greatly from year to year. In addition, businesses are often \nthreatened with legal action or harassed for doing something they did \nnot realize was against the law.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would exempt these small \nbusiness operators from being charged fees for playing radios and \ntelevisions in their establishments. The bill is designed to address a \nunique problem these folks are experiencing. It clarifies the law so \nthese individuals can operate their businesses without fear of costly \nlitigation. It is also important to note this bill only deals with \nperformances which are incidental to the main purpose of the \nestablishment. Records, tapes jukeboxes or video recordings are not \ncovered by my bill.\n  Finally, this legislation would also require the performing rights \nsocieties to offer radio broadcasters a per programming period license \nto perform nondramatic musical works in the repertoire of the \nperforming rights society. Currently, many specialty radio broadcasters \nsuch as religious and classical stations are forced to purchase a \nblanket license for radio broadcasts although they only play a small \nportion of the repertoire of the performing rights society. My bill \nwould solve this \n\n[[Page S12086]]\nproblem and allow these broadcasters to pay for the copywritten music \nthat is actually played, rather than a broad blanket fee which is \nunnecessary.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is this legislation is designed to \nhelp small business owners solve a very difficult and confusing \nproblem. This bill will help clarify the law and make it understandable \nfor everyone across the Nation. The time has come to address this \nconfusing issue and solve this problem for thousands of folks across \nthe country.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 1138. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide that certain health insurance policies are not duplicative, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              THE MEDICARE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill \nwhich, if enacted, would correct a serious problem created by the \nMedicare anti-duplication provisions contained in the Social Security \nAct Amendments of 1994 (P.L. 103-432) and by subsequent interpretations \nof those provisions by the Health Care Financing Administration.\n  The genesis of this problem is to be found in provisions included in \nOBRA 1990. Those provisions were designed to prohibit the sale of \nMedicare Supplemental Insurance Policies [Medigap policies] to Medicare \nbeneficiaries already covered by another Medigap policy. Even though \nthose provisions were clearly designed to apply only to duplicative \nMedigap policies, they could be interpreted, and were interpreted by \nmany, as prohibiting the sale of any other health insurance product \nthat might duplicate benefits available under Medicare to Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  The Social Security Act Amendments of 1994 contained provisions \ndesigned to clarify the intent of the OBRA 1990 provisions. \nunfortunately, the statute, and recent interpretations of it by the \nHealth Care Financing Administration, have led to further confusion and \npotential disruption of the long term care insurance market as well as \nthe market for other private, non-Medigap, health insurance sold to \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  Rather than determine the extent of actual duplication, HCFA has \narbitrarily deemed all private insurance to be duplicative without \nactual findings of Medicare duplication. A legislative correction is \nnecessary because HCFA was fully aware of the legislative history and \nnevertheless issued a notice clearly in conflict with the legislative \nintent.\n  For private long term care policies, HCFA's interpretation implies \nthat those which coordinate with Medicare are not permitted. \nIronically, coordination of private long term care insurance with \nMedicare is consistent with an emerging national policy that \nduplicative coverages should be discouraged. Most of the health care \nreform bills that addressed long term care required such coordination. \nAnd almost all the congressional proposals that would clarify the tax \ntreatment of long term care insurance have consistently required \ncoordination with Medicare.\n  Under the 1994 amendments, hospital indemnity policies, or policies \nthat pay benefits to policy holders upon the occurrence of a specific \ndisease, may be sold to Medicare beneficiaries only\n if they contain a statement to the effect that they duplicate \nMedicare. However, such policies do not duplicate Medicare. State \ninsurance commissioners have for years advised that consumers be told \nthat such policies are not broad-based health insurance like Medicare \nor MediGap policies. That is, that they are not, by their very nature, \na type of policy that duplicates Medicare. Furthermore, they pay a cash \nbenefit when triggered by a specific event, such as hospitalization, or \ntreatment for a particular disease, regardless of other coverage. Thus, \nthe policy holder receives a direct cash payment even when the medical \nservices received were paid by Medicare. The direct cash payment is not \na payment for those medical services and may be used by the recipient \nfor any purpose.\n\n  Any number of circumstances would lead an individual to desire such \nadditional coverage. For instance, it is frequently the case that \ntreatment of serious diseases generate other, out-of-pocket, expenses \nnot covered by Medicare against which a Medicare beneficiary may wish \nto be protected. Or, an individual may lose wages due to \nhospitalization and wish to be protected against that loss.\n  Requiring confusing disclosure statements may discourage the sale of \nsuch policies to Medicare beneficiaries. This despite the fact that the \nbeneficiary may be inclined to purchase such a policy, and despite the \nfact that the individual may clearly ultimately benefit from holding \nsuch a policy.\n  The bill I am introducing today to correct these problems follows a \nbill sponsored by Senators Packwood and Bentsen (S. 2318) which passed \nthe Senate but was vetoed as part of H.R. 11, the 1992 tax bill. And \nlast year the Ways and Means Committee included in their version of the \nHealth Security Act a similar ``safe harbor'' for policies that always \npay benefits. My bill would:\n  Restore a ``safe harbor'' for those policies that always pay benefits \nregardless of other coverage; and\n  Provide a ``safe harbor'' for long term care and similar policies \nthat coordinate benefits to prevent Medicare duplication.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n          Summary of Medicare Consumer Protection Act of 1995\n\n       1. Continues current Medigap rules.--Prohibits the sale of \n     more than one Medigap policy (unless replacement). Continues \n     current law provisions that also require signed statements \n     from Medicare consumers before replacing Medigap policies.\n       2. Continues anti-duplication rules.--Prohibits \n     ``duplication'' of Medicare benefits by private insurance. \n     Continues current law provision intended to protect Medicare \n     consumers from purchasing private insurance that duplicates \n     Medicare.\n       3. Safeharbor for policies that always pay.--Continues the \n     original 1980 safeharbor for policies that ``always pay'' \n     (also follows the 1992 Bentsen-Packwood proposal, and the \n     1994 Rangel proposal to H.R. 3600). Permits the sale of \n     private health insurance policies that pay benefits \n     regardless of other coverage so Medicare consumers always \n     receive benefits for premiums paid.\n       4. Safeharbor for LTC, home health, other policies.--\n     Establishes a new safeharbor for long-term care, home-health, \n     other similar policies that ``coordinate'' or offset with \n     Medicare to prevent duplication (also requires ``notice'' in \n     outline of coverage). Permits the sale of private health \n     insurance policies covering benefits for only long-term care, \n     nursing home, home health, community-based care, or a \n     combination. Permits continuation of Robert Wood Johnson \n     Partnership plans.\n       5. Clarifies confusing, wrong interpretation.--Removes \n     misleading HCFA disclosure statements published in a June 12 \n     ``notice'' that declares all private insurance to be \n     ``duplicative'' of Medicare. The statements were established \n     without factual findings of duplication and outside federal \n     rulemaking requirements; will confuse beneficiaries over what \n     really ``duplicates'' Medicare; will conflict with current \n     state/NAIC disclosure rules that such policies do not \n     supplement Medicare; and needlessly discourage choice and \n     purchase of private health insurance supplements.\n       6. Clarifies Federal-State role.--Establishes duplication \n     of Medicare as a federal issue. Provides federal penalties to \n     be the exclusive remedy; provides exclusive federal interest \n     in preventing Medicare duplication; and continues State \n     regulation of all other matters relating to health insurance \n     policies under current State law.\n       7. Clarifies effective date.--Establishes safeharbor (only \n     for policies meeting standards) from legal action based on \n     ``unsettled,'' unintended law prior to 1995 and after 1990 \n     drafting ``error.'' This also: prevents frivolous lawsuits \n     that will cost consumers and benefit only lawyers; and \n     provides needed certainty in the marketplace due to \n     misinterpretations of intent and law.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mrs. Hutchison, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mr. Hollings, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Breaux, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 1139. A bill to amend the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n              the maritime reform and security act of 1995\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Maritime \nReform and Security Act of 1995.\n  Maritime reform is vital to our Nation's national and economic \nsecurity. From our beginning history, America has been a maritime \nnation reliant on secure ocean passage and transport for commerce and \nmilitary strength.\n  From the sea battles of the American Revolution through the Persian \nGulf, \n\n[[Page S12087]]\nour seafarers and merchant marine courageously supplied and sustained \nour troops in combat and conflict.\n  The U.S. flag fleet and merchant marine carried our troops and cargo \nthrough World War I, II, Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf.\n  In World War II, more than 6,000 merchant mariners were killed and \nthousands more were wounded.\n  After World War II, the Supreme Allied Commander, Dwight D. \nEisenhower, declared:\n\n       The officers and men of the merchant marine, by their \n     devotion to duty in the face of enemy action, as well as the \n     material dangers of the sea, have brought to us the tools to \n     finish the job. Their contribution to final victory will long \n     be remembered.\n\n  Following the Persian Gulf, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nColin Powell, stated:\n\n       Since I became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I \n     have to appreciate firsthand why our merchant marine has long \n     been called the Nation's fourth arm of defense. The American \n     seafarer provides an essential service to the well-being of \n     the Nation, as was demonstrated so clearly during Operations \n     Desert Shield and Desert Storm.\n\n  In relation to our Nation's economic security, Rear Adm. (Ret.) Tom \nPatterson recently wrote in the Journal of Commerce:\n\n       Throughout history, the Nation that ruled the seas \n     controlled the world's economy. In their time, Egypt, Greece, \n     Phoenicia, Carthage, and Rome, then Spain, Portugal, and \n     Great Britain came and went as the leading naval and \n     commercial powers. When they lost their maritime dominance, \n     they quickly became second rate in terms of economic success \n     and political influence.\n       The United States is in grave danger of going down that \n     same road if it has not done so already. Our perceived \n     economic decline in recent years has been accompanied by an \n     almost suicidal approach to our maritime policy--and \n     specifically to the future of merchant shipping under the \n     American flag . . .\n\n  Over the last 20 years, Congress has failed to pass an effective \nmaritime policy. As a result, we have seen a dangerous decline of the \nU.S. flag fleet, merchant marine, and shipbuilding.\n  Now, we face a situation where if we fail to act in this Congress, \nour national security and international competitiveness will be \nseriously and irreversibly harmed.\n  We could easily lose our U.S.-flag fleet and\n   with it our merchant marine.\n\n  If that occurs, our military readiness and our sealift capacity will \nbe dealt a blow.\n  Numerous jobs would be lost related to the maritime industry and our \nbalance of payments and international competitiveness will suffer.\n  In times of international crisis or war, our historical and \nsuccessful reliance on the U.S. Flag Fleet and merchant marine would \ncome to an end.\n  Personally, I do not want to be a part of that. We have a sobering \nopportunity to do something about it. In introducing this legislation, \nI believe that this Congress and this administration will successfully \nenact maritime reform legislation.\n  Secretary Pena, on behalf of the administration, early this year \nintroduced the Maritime Security Act of 1995. He continues to advocate \nand express the high priority that the administration places on \nmaritime reform.\n  The House National Security Committee has already reported out, H.R. \n1350, The Maritime Security Act of 1995.\n  I look forward to working with the Members of the Senate, the House, \nthe administration as well as the carriers, shipbuilders, and labor in \nworking to enact maritime reform in this Congress.\n  As I introduce this legislation, I would like to state as simply as \npossible what my objectives are.\n  I want to maintain and promote a U.S. flag fleet, built in U.S. \nshipyards and manned by U.S. crews in the most cost effective and \nflexible manner possible.\n  When I go home to Pascagoula, I want to see the greatest amount \npossible of Mississippi agricultural products--rice, cotton, soybeans, \ncatfish, chicken and forest products and other exports moving on U.S.-\nflagged ships built in America.\n  In times of national emergency or war, I want to know that we will \ncontinue the finest tradition of the U.S. flag fleet and merchant \nmarine--secure in the knowledge that our sealift capability is assured \nand confident that our troops will be supplied.\n  The Maritime Reform and Security Act of 1995 will help achieve these \nobjectives by establishing a new maritime security program. The bill \nterminates the previous program, reducing costs by 50 percent. In its \nplace, a more efficient and flexible program will continue the \nsuccessful private commercial partnership with the Departments of \nTransportation and Defense. A partnership which will help promote and \npreserve a modern U.S. flag fleet and merchant marine and one that will \nserve our national security in time of war or emergency.\n  To promote our Nation's underlying shipbuilding infrastructure and \ncapacity, this legislation reforms the title XI loan guarantee program. \nA program which effectively stimulates U.S. shipbuilding, \ncompetitiveness, and jobs.\n  This maritime reform legislation will promote our Nation's national \nand economic security. I thank my colleagues who have joined as \ncosponsors and look forward to working with the full Senate on this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1139\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Maritime Reform and Security \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n                       TITLE I--MARITIME SECURITY\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I support this legislation to \nrevitalize and stabilize our maritime industry. It is long past time \nfor legislation to stop the flight away from the U.S. flag. The United \nStates has a long and honorable maritime heritage and tradition, but we \nare facing the prospect that our maritime industry might only be \nheritage and tradition ad not part of our future.\n  The United States relies on ocean transportation for international \ntrade purposes, and also to protect our national security interests. \nThe continued presence of an active maritime industry ensures that the \nUnited States will not have to rely on the kindness of other nations to \nachieve important national objectives.\n  The United States is the world's only remaining superpower, but we \ncould be put in the position of sending U.S. troops into war with the \npromise that we would supply them, provided that the Department of \nDefense (DOD) can charter vessels willing to deliver cargo into the war \nzone. This position would be simply unacceptable. Ironically, DOD has \nspent billions of dollars in the construction of surge sealift vessels, \nand billions of dollars in maintaining a Reserve Fleet of vessels. \nHowever, DOD has neglected the most important component in marine \ntransportation: who will navigate those ships and deliver the cargo. \nThe commercial U.S.-flag industry provides a labor pool of experienced \npersonnel capable of contributing to any defense logistical support \nneed.\n  Attempts to formulate a maritime reform bill over the years have had \nbipartisan support, and I look forward to continued efforts with my \ncolleagues to revitalize our maritime industry.\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \ncongratulate Senator Lott for his fine work in drafting a maritime bill \nwith bipartisan support. I look forward to working with him to complete \nthe effort that we initiated last year to reform our maritime laws, and \nlook forward to the enactment of legislation preserving our maritime \nindustrial base.\n  The United States has a long and illustrious maritime history from \nthe privateer fleet of the early eighteenth century, to the fast \nclipper ships of the mid-eighteenth century, to the incredible build up \nof Liberty and Victory ships so integral to our victory in World War \nII. In the past, when we called on the U.S. merchant marine, they \ndelivered the goods.\n  Absent some government action, we are facing the prospect of not \nbeing able to call on the merchant marine again. For years, we have \nheaped requirements on the U.S.-flag operators. These requirements have \nmade it more expensive to operate as U.S. flag. \n\n[[Page S12094]]\nMeanwhile, foreign-flag competitors have been allowed to take advantage \nof regulatory regimes that have less stringent safety, tax, and labor \nlaw requirements.\n  The United States is the world's only remaining super power. However, \nwe may be facing the prospect of having to charter foreign-flag vessels \nfor U.S. military support. This may put us in the position of hoping \nthat the next military conflict is internationally supported and \nprovides an opportunity for the safe transportation of foreign-flag \nchartered vessels. The Department of Defense has spent billions of \ndollars building up a reserve fleet of cargo vessels. Unfortunately, a \npolicy to cost-effectively crew those vessels has not been developed. \nAs I speak, U.S. marines on Ready Reserve Force vessels are performing \ntransportation missions in support of Operation Quick Lift, the U.S. \ngovernment's contribution to the United Nations Reaction Force for \nBosnia, while under fire in Croatia. I question whether foreign \nshipping interests would be interested in evacuating military personnel \nand supplies from the war zone.\n  Without the passage of this legislation we will be facing the \nprospect of relying on foreign shipping to achieve our national \nsecurity and economic security objectives.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. EXXON (for himself, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1140. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to terminate \nthe Interstate Commerce Commission and establish the United States \nTransportation Board within the Department of Transportation, and to \nredistribute necessary functions within the Federal Government, reduce \nlegislation, achieve budgetary savings, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n         the interstate commerce commission sunset act of 1995\n\n Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I introduce landmark legislation to \neliminate the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and to transfer its \nresponsibilities to the independent United States Transportation Board \n(USTB) which will be organized under the U.S. Department of \nTransportation.\n  This bill builds on successful legislation I introduced in recent \nyears to bring fairness, efficiency and productivity to the \ntransportation sector. The Negotiated Rates Act, for example, approved \nin 1993 has already saved American businesses billions of dollars in \nso-called undercharge claims and litigation, by relieving small \nbusinesses and charities of undercharge liability and providing for \nfair and expeditious settlement of all other undercharge claims. In \naddition, the Trucking Regulatory Reform Act of 1994 enacted dramatic \nand revolutionary federal regulatory reform in truck and bus \ntransportation. These measures combined with the intra-state truck rate \nand route deregulation provision contained in the 1994 Airport \nImprovement Program Reauthorization bill represent a body of law which \ncomprises one of the most important, dramatic, productive and \nmeaningful regulatory reforms in modern times.\n  As a long time defender and supporter of an independent Interstate \nCommerce Commission, I\n introduce this legislation with some sadness because as one of the few \nMembers of Congress with regular contact with America's oldest \nindependent regulatory agency, I know well the dedication, commitment, \nand hard work of the Commission and all of its employees. In a \ndifferent time, with different fiscal realities, it might have been \npossible to maintain a strong independent regulatory agency.\n\n  That being said, I introduce this legislation with a great deal of \npride and enthusiasm. Not only is this legislation a tribute and \ncompliment to earlier efforts made by the Congress to introduce \ncompetition into the bus, truck, and rail sectors through the Bus Act, \nthe Motor Carrier Act, and the Staggers Act, this legislation opens a \nnew chapter in Federal transportation policy.\n  Mr. President, this bill can serve as a model for other agencies to \nachieve the efficiencies that the people demand, but also do the work \nthat the people expect.\n  One might ask why there is a need for a successor agency to the ICC. \nSimply put, if there were no forum to resolve disputes, oversee \nstandard contract terms, review rail mergers and abandonments, \nestablish national standards, and assure fair treatment for shippers \nand communities America's great, efficient, and productive surface \ntransportation sector will spin into chaos. Each State would develop \nits own rules and transportation companies would become entangled in \nneedless, complicated litigation. The United States Transportation\n Board (USTB) will assure that there is continuity in transportation \npolicy.\n\n  The new USTB--an independent board within the Department of \nTransportation will continue to be the fair referee between shippers, \ncarriers and communities. It will provide interested parties one stop \nshopping and administer a significantly streamlined body of law which \nwould assure that the public interest is protected in transportation \npolicy.\n  This transfer of responsibility and streamlining of authority will \nreduce costs both to taxpayers and the private sector and assure that \nkey transportation safety responsibilities do not ``fall between the \ncracks.''\n  I am hopeful that this legislation represents only a first step to \neven greater consolidation and efficiency of transportation regulation \nand dispute resolution. My vision for the new USTB is that it become a \nfair forum for all modes of transportation. I strongly support the \nincorporation of the Federal Maritime Commission's (FMC's) duties into \nthe responsibilities of the USTB as well as aviation dispute resolution \nduties administered by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n  Senator Inouye is the Senate's leading expert on maritime issues and \nI look forward to working with him and others to promote this \nintermodal concept.\n  In a real sense, the introduction of this legislation represents the \nfirst step in a long journey but a necessary one.\n  Mr. President, our nation takes for granted the blessings of \nAmerica's great transportation system. Every part of the nation has \naccessible transportation service. As the Congress continues its \nefforts to keep regulation to the minimum necessary to protect the \npublic interest, let us not forget what a valuable asset we have and \nhow critically important it is that the Congress carefully choose the \ncorrect course.\n  I urge my colleagues to study this proposal and look forward to \nworking with members from both sides of the aisle to assure that the \nCongress continue its responsible modernization of American \ntransportation policy.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER (for himself and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 1141. A bill to authorize appropriations for the activities of the \nUnder Secretary of Commerce for Technology, and for scientific research \nservices and construction of research facilities activities of the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology, for fiscal years 1996, \n1997, and 1998, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n        the technology administration authorization act of 1995\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Technology \nAdministration Authorization Act of 1995. I am pleased to have Senator \nBurns, chairman of the Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space, \njoin me as an original cosponsor. This bill provides a 3-year \nauthorization for the Commerce Department's Technology Administration \nand its National Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST]. \nSpecifically, the bill provides $755 million for fiscal year 1996 and \n$750 million for each of fiscal years 1997 and 1998 for those programs.\n  As part of our effort to streamline the Department of Commerce, the \nfiscal year 1996 authorization for the Commerce Department's Technology \nAdministration represents a 13-percent cut from the fiscal year 1995 \nlevel of $864 million. To that end, the bill also directs the \nDepartment to establish a plan for eliminating the largely redundant \nOffice of Technology Policy during fiscal year 1996, transferring any \nessential functions to NIST. The bill also makes substantial cuts in \nfunding for the Technology Administration. However, with the exception \nof the Office of Technology Policy, the bill continues all of the \nTechnology Administration's major programs.\n\n[[Page S12095]]\n\n  With regard to NIST, the bill provides $750 million for each of \nfiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998. This authorization is a 12-percent \ncut from the fiscal year 1995 level of $854 million. The bill provides \n$263 million for the NIST internal research programs and standards \nactivities. NIST's standards work may be its most important function. \nIncreasingly, standards are being used by foreign governments to close \ntheir markets to U.S. industries. There is little question that \nstandards will become an increasingly potent trade weapon used to \nhinder market entry by U.S. firms or retaliate against the United \nStates. In recognition of this, the bill fully funds NIST's lab and \nstandards programs from fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 1998 at \ntheir fiscal year 1995 funding level.\n  The bill also provides strong support for NIST's Industrial \nTechnology Services [ITS] account, which funds the agency's Advanced \nTechnology Program and the manufacturing extension partnership. The \nbill authorizes $427 million a year from fiscal year 1996 through \nfiscal year 1998 for the ITS account, a cut of 19 percent from the \nfiscal year 1995 appropriation of $526 million.\n  The bill leaves it to the discretion of the agency how to allocate \nfunding among ATP, MEP, and the quality programs within the ITS \naccount. However, the bill makes clear it does not authorize any \nfunding for ATP grants after October 1, 1995. This limitation reflects \nthe belief that, since it was first funded in fiscal year 1990, the ATP \nhas grown too big, too fast, without demonstrating clear benefits to \nU.S. industry. Many critics of ATP have rightly pointed out that, too \noften, ATP grants have gone to Fortune 500 companies like IBM, Dupont, \nand Texas Instruments instead of the small high-technology ventures for \nwhich the ATP was intended.\n  Regardless of the merits of the program, I believe that ATP-type \ngrant programs cannot boost U.S. competitiveness alone. Rather, they \nmust be a part of a larger national strategy including appropriate \nderegulation, tax incentives, and antitrust and product liability \nreform. Accordingly, the bill only authorizes support for existing \ngrants while Congress has a chance to evaluate more closely the value \nof ATP in our competitiveness strategy.\n  To conduct quality research, you need quality facilities. In that \nconnection, the bill also provides $60 million for each of the 3 fiscal \nyears for the construction of facilities account to fund needed new \nconstruction and renovation at NIST.\n  Mr. President, it is disturbing to this Senator that less populated \nStates, like South Dakota, have had difficulty getting any help from \nNIST in the area of manufacturing assistance. I know of at least two \ninstances in my home State where attempts to obtain assistance from \nNIST have fallen on deaf ears. If these programs are continued in any \nform, they must benefit the entire\n country and not just high-technology corridors or revitalized Rust \nBelt areas in the East and West. To that end, the bill authorizes $10 \nmillion in fiscal year 1996 and $15 million in fiscal year 1997 and \nfiscal year 1998 for a new program at NIST called the Experimental \nProgram to Stimulate Competitive Technology [EPSCOT]. Modeled after \nsimilar programs at the National Science Foundation and other science \nagencies, EPSCOT will provide grants for research and outreach work in \nrural States like my home State of South Dakota. Indeed, at our August \n1 Commerce Committee hearing on the future of the Commerce Department, \nSecretary Brown endorsed the idea of starting an EPSCOT program at \nNIST. Our rural States want to contribute to the technological \nrevolution. EPSCOT will help them do so.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, the bill would make technical changes to the \nFastener Quality Act recommended by the Fastener Advisory Committee. In \n1992, the Fastener Advisory Committee determined that implementing the \nact in its present form--without these changes--would have imposed \ncosts close to $1 billion on the industry. The changes address the \nconcerns of the Fastener Advisory Committee regarding metal chemistry \ntesting, commingling of fasteners in distribution, and acceptance of \nnonconforming fasteners. For the past 3 years, NIST has delayed its \nimplementation of the current law in the hope that Congress would \ncorrect the glaring problems in the current law. The specific language \nin the bill was developed by NIST and the fastener industry. The \nfastener-related provisions in this bill are similar to changes passed \nby the Senate, but not enacted, in 1994 as part of the National \nCompetitiveness Act.\n  As chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, I believe that by \nproviding a 3-year authorization, our bill lends strength and stability \nto the Department of Commerce's important technology and research \nprograms. At the same time, because of the tight budget environment we \nface, the bill forces the Technology Administration to carry out its \ngoals and missions with less funding than before. I am hopeful the \nreduced funding level will motivate the Department of Commerce to \neliminate unnecessary functions such as the Office of Technology Policy \nand operate more efficiently while ensuring all America has the \nopportunity to benefit from its programs. If we are going to reinvent \nthe programs of the Commerce Department, the Technology Administration \nis an excellent starting point. This bill starts us on that path.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \n        Burns, and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 1142. A bill to authorize appropriations for the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n the national oceanic and atmospheric administration authorization act \n                                of 1995\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration Authorization Act of 1995. This \nbill provides a three year authorization for the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration [NOAA]. Specifically, the bill provides \n$1.81 billion for FY96 $2.02 billion for FY97, and $2.03 billion for \nFY98. I am pleased to have join me as original cosponsors on this \nlegislation: Senator Hollings, Ranking Member of the Commerce Committee \nand Senators Stevens, Burns, and Breaux.\n  One of my goals in developing this legislation was to review current \nprograms to see if they could be restructured while improving their \nfunctions. Over the last several months, I have heard people calling \nfor major changes at the Department of Commerce. As Chairman of the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, I conducted a \nhearing on August 1, 1995, and invited Secretary of Commerce Ronald \nBrown to testify. His comments, as well as others', have helped in \ndeveloping a bill that answers that call. This bill downsizes \nbureaucracy. It consolidates duplicative programs. It transfers \nfunctions to other agencies that can manage them better. It terminates \nunnecessary programs. Overall, the bill is a 7 percent decrease from \nthe FY95 appropriations level of $1.95 billion and a 14 percent \ndecrease from the Administration's FY96 request.\n  The mission of NOAA is to explore, map, and chart the global ocean \nand its living resources as well as to manage, use, and conserve these \nresources; to describe, monitor, and predict conditions in the \natmosphere, ocean, sun, and space environments; to issue warnings \nagainst impending destructive natural events; to assess the \nconsequences of inadvertent environmental modification over several \nscales of time; and to manage and disseminate long-term environmental \ninformation.\n  Mr. President, as a Senator representing an agricultural state, I \ncannot overstate the importance of NOAA's weather warnings and \nforecasts to our farmers and ranchers. My colleagues on the Commerce \nCommittee who represent coastal states also know the great value of \nweather warnings as well as the value of NOAA's ocean and fishery \nprograms. Therefore, I believe that the core functions of NOAA need to \nstay together as a single entity. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration Authorization Act of 1995 authorizes just such an \nentity.\n  Mr. President, let me outline the specifics of the bill:\n\n\n            title i: noaa atmospheric and satellite programs\n\n  Section 101 authorizes the operations and research activities of the \nNational \n\n[[Page S12096]]\nWeather Service (NWS) at $477,207,000 (FY96), $491,523,000 (FY97), and \n$484,278,000 (FY98). These activities include meteorological, \nhydrological, and oceanographic public warnings and forecasts, as well \nas applied research in support of such warnings and forecasts.\n  Section 102 authorizes $131,335,000 (FY96), $222,000,000 (FY97), and \n$225,500,000 (FY98) to develop, acquire, and implement public warning \nand forecast systems. These systems include: (1) the Next Generation \nWeather Radar (NEXRAD), which use Doppler technology to provide more \naccurate forecasts and warnings; (2) the Automated Surface Observing \nSystems (ASOS), which will relieve NWS staff from the manual collection \nof weather observations; (3) the Advanced Weather Interactive \nProcessing System (AWIPS), which will provide NWS meteorologists with \nintegrated radar, satellite, and ground data for the first time; and \n(4) the Advanced Computer Technology to enable the development of \nimproved computer weather forecast models.\n  Section 103 authorizes $113,252,000 (FY96), $115,918,000 (FY97), and \n$119,396,000 (FY98) for NOAA to carry out its climate and air quality \nresearch activities. It continues support for NOAA programs designed to \ndevelop the capability to predict interannual (year-to-year) and \nseasonal climate changes over North America and improves NOAA's ability \nto do long-term climate and air quality research and high performance \ncomputing.\n  Section 104 authorizes $46,850,000 for each of FY96, FY97, and FY98 \nfor atmospheric research activities. These activities include efforts \nto improve observational and predictive capabilities for atmospheric \nprocesses, with special emphasis on solar disturbances and their \neffects on the Earth.\n  Section 105 authorizes $449,000,000 for FY96 and $535,000,000 in each \nof FY97 and FY98 for the operation of NOAA's current geostationary \n(GOES) weather satellites and for NOAA's polar orbiting (POES) \nenvironmental satellites as well as for NOAA's related ground station \nsystems. The bill also authorizes funds for the ongoing procurement and \nlaunch of replacement satellites. The weather satellites support the \nforecast and warning activities of the NWS. The environmental \nsatellites are used for global change monitoring and research, for the \nmonitoring of distress signals over land and sea through the Search and \nRescue Satellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) program, and for the \nmonitoring of driftnets in the North Pacific.\n  Section 106 authorizes $40,000,000 for each of the three fiscal years \nfor NOAA's data and information products, services, and assessments. \nThese climate, ocean, geophysical, and environmental data services are \nused by all of NOAA's programs.\n  Section 107 describes the four core responsibilities of the National \nWeather Service (NWS) in its duty of protecting life and property and \nenhancing the national economy as: (1) the sole official source of \nweather warnings; (2) the issuance of storm warnings; (3) the \ncollection, exchange, and distribution of meteorological, hydrological, \nclimatic, and oceanographic data and information; and (4) the \npreparation of hydrometeorological guidance and core forecast \ninformation.\n  Section 108 authorizes the procurement of up to four additional \nGeostationary Operational Environmental NEXT (GOES I-M) satellites and \nsupport systems from the developer of previous GOES-NEXT satellites.\n  Finally, section 109 amends the Land Remote Sensing Act of 1992 to \ndirect the Landsat Program Management Member to retain fees collected \nfrom foreign ground stations, and for Landsat 7 data sales to offset \nthe system's operating costs. It also directs the Secretary of Commerce \n(the Secretary) to examine how NOAA might procure and operate its \nLandsat 7 ground segment in a more inexpensive fashion. It authorizes \nLandsat 7 operations at $10,000,000 annually.\n\n\n               title ii: noaa ocean and coastal programs\n\n  Section 201 authorizes $44,917,000 (FY96), $47,652,000 (FY97), and \n$46,265,000 (FY98) for the National Ocean Service's (NOS) mapping, \ncharting, and geodesy activities, including geodetic data collection \nand analysis. Observation and assessment activities are authorized at \n$66,591,000 (FY96), $68,589,000 (FY97), and $70,646,000 (FY98), of \nwhich $10,943,000 (FY96), $11,271,000 (FY97), and $11,609,000 (FY98) \nare authorized for Coastal Ocean Program (COP) activities. The COP \nefforts contribute to three major elements of NOAA's strategic plan by \nimproving: prediction and knowledge of factors influencing our \nabilities to build and maintain sustainable fisheries; prediction of \ncoastal hazards to protect human life and personal property; and \nprediction of coastal ocean pollution to help correct and prevent \ndegradation.\n  Section 202 authorizes $9,506,000 (FY96), $9,791,000 (FY97), and \n$10,085,000 (FY98) for Ocean and Great Lakes research activities.\n  Section 203 authorizes not more than $53,300,000 (FY96), $54,899,000 \n(FY97), and $56,546,000 (FY98) for the National Sea Grant College \nProgram. This funding goes to the network of 29 Sea Grant institutions \nengaged in research, education, and advisory/extension services.\n  Section 204 authorizes a maximum of $12,000,000 (FY96), $12,360,000 \n(FY97), and $12,731,000 (FY98) for the National Undersea Research \nProgram's (NURP) undersea research activities. These funds are to be \nused only to fund the ongoing operations of existing undersea research \ncenters, each of which is to receive,\n at a minimum, thirteen percent of annual appropriations made under \nthis section.\n\n  Finally, section 205 authorizes programs under the Coastal Zone \nManagement Act. Specifically, monies for Protection of Coastal Waters \n(section 6217) are authorized at $5,000,000 for each of FY96, FY97, and \nFY98. Grants for developing coastal zone management programs (section \n305) are authorized not to exceed $750,000 per grant in each of FY96, \nFY97, and FY98. Those grants for funding, improving, and enhancing \ncoastal zone programs (section 305, 306A, and 309 grants) are \nauthorized not to exceed $45,500,000 (FY96), $46,865,000 (FY97), and \n$48,271,000 (FY98). The section also authorizes amounts not to exceed \n$3,350,000 (FY96), $3,451,000 (FY97), and $3,554,000 (FY98) for section \n315 grants (National Estuarine Research Reserves), and such sums, not \nto exceed $10,000,000 per fiscal year, for FY96, FY97, and FY98 for \nsection 310 (Technical Assistance) grants. Authorization for expenses \nincident to administering the Coastal Zone Program are limited to the \nlesser of either $5,000,000 or eight percent of the total appropriated \namount under this Act, with the additional restriction that \nadministrative monies are not be used to augment grants made under \nother sections of this Act.\n\n\n               title iii: noaa marine fisheries programs\n\n  Section 301 authorizes a total of $99,928,000 (FY96), $102,926,000 \n(FY97), and $106,014,000 (FY98) for NOAA National Marine Fisheries \nService (NMFS) Programs. This includes $49,340,000 (FY96), $50,820,000 \n(FY97), and $52,345,000 (FY98) for Fisheries Information, Collection, \nand Analysis; $28,183,000 (FY96), $29,028,000 (FY97), and $29,899,000 \n(FY98) for Fisheries Conservation and Management, and $22,405,000 \n(FY96), $23,077,000 (FY97), and $23,769,000 (FY98) for State and \nIndustry Cooperative Fisheries Programs.\n  Section 302 authorizes the construction of a fisheries research \nfacility at Fort Johnson, South Carolina and the consolidation of \nfishery research facilities on Auke Cape near Juneau, Alaska.\n  Finally, section 303 provides reform to the fisheries loan guarantee \nprogram by limiting the loan amount to no more than $25,000,000 \nannually and by prohibiting these loans for vessels that will increase \nharvesting capacity within the U.S. exclusive economic zone.\n\n\n              title iv: program administration and support\n\n  Section 401 authorizes $72,847,000 (FY96), $75,032,000 (FY97), and \n$77,283,000 (FY98) for executive direction and administrative \nactivities. Acquisition, construction, maintenance, and operation of \nNOAA facilities are authorized at $54,163,000 for each of FY96, FY97, \nand FY98. Marine services activities, including ship operations, \nmaintenance, and support are authorized at $60,000,000 for each of \nFY96, FY97, and FY98. Aircraft service activities, including aircraft \noperations, maintenance, and support are authorized at $9,500,000 for \neach of FY96, FY97, and FY98.\n  Section 402 requires the Secretary to reduce the Full Time \nEquivalents \n\n[[Page S12097]]\n(FTEs) of NOAA by at least 2,318 from the FY93 FTE base. This 16 \npercent reduction is to be completed by the end of FY99. This section \nalso calls for the reduction of active duty officers of the NOAA \nCommissioned Officer Corps and additional language to facilitate that \ndownsizing.\n\n\n                 title v: cost savings and streamlining\n\n  Section 501 transfers the NOAA Aeronautical Charting and Cartography \nOffice's responsibilities for functions that are necessary or \nincidental for performance by or under the Administration of the \nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) to the FAA.\n  Section 502 directs the Secretary to review regulations issued by \nNOAA prior to January 1, 1995 and to reduce the volume by 45 percent by \nDecember 31, 1997.\n  Section 503 requires the Secretary to submit a revised fleet \nmodernization plan to the appropriate committees of the Senate\n and the House of Representatives. The plan should include proposals \nfor a 50 percent reduction from the current fleet size, including the \nelimination of three existing vessels in fiscal year 1997 and three in \nfiscal year 1998; a 50 percent reduction from the construction costs \nsubmitted in the 1993 fleet modernization plan; the use of chartering \nand contracting out; and the sale of decommissioned vessels where \nfeasible.\n\n  Section 504 directs the Secretary to review all congressionally \nmandated reporting requirements and to recommend legislation by March \n31, 1996 to eliminate at least 50 percent of such reporting \nrequirements that were in effect on January 1, 1995.\n  Section 505 authorizes the Secretary to develop a laboratory \nconsolidation plan for underutilized facilities.\n  Section 506 authorizes the Secretary to convey the NMFS Gloucester, \nMassachusetts laboratory to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for use \nby the Commonwealth's Division of Marine Fisheries resource management \nprogram. The Secretary is authorized to enter into a memorandum of \nunderstanding with the Commonwealth to allow NMFS to continue to occupy \npart of the laboratory for a period not to exceed five years. A \nreversionary clause is included.\n  Section 507 includes a provision authorizing the Secretary of \nCommerce to execute agreements with State and local governments to \nclean up land and property formerly owned by NOAA on the Pribilof \nIslands, Alaska.\n  Finally, section 508 requires amounts received by the United States \nin settlement of, or judgment for, damage claims arising from a past \naccident where a moored NOAA vessel was hit by another vessel to be \ndeposited as offsetting collections in the NOAA Operations, Research, \nand Facilities account. Such funds may not exceed $518,757.09.\n  Mr. President, I would like to commend the ranking member, Senator \nHollings, for his assistance in the development of this bill. Our \ndesire to work in a bipartisan fashion does indeed help in providing \nthe best work product possible.\n  I also would like to commend the efforts of Senator Stevens and \nSenator Burns, the respective Chairmen of our Oceans and Fisheries \nSubcommittee and our Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee, and \ntheir Ranking Members Senator Kerry and Senator Rockefeller. Working \ntogether we can restore some of the needed fiscal austerity to our \nFederal Government--making it smaller, less costly, yet more efficient. \nThis bill moves us in that direction.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Pressler \nand Hollings in introducing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration Authorization Act of 1995.\n  The bill reauthorizes for three years a number of NOAA programs under \nthe jurisdictions of the Senate Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries \n(which I chair) and Senate Subcommittee on Science, Technology and \nSpace (chaired by Senator Burns).\n  The bill proposes significant reductions to the size and cost of NOAA \nwhich will help in meeting the massive reductions in federal spending \nthat we must achieve.\n  Even with the proposed reductions, however, I believe the legislation \nwill strengthen NOAA and the programs within NOAA that have functioned \nvery well together.\n  The bill mandates that NOAA reduce its overall workforce by 2,318 by \nthe end of FY1999. This represents a 17-percent reduction from the FY93 \nlevel.\n  It requires a 50-percent reduction in the size of the NOAA research \nfleet over the next 10 years, including the decommissioning of at least \n6 vessels within the next two years, which will represent a 25-percent \nreduction in the first two years.\n  The bill allows NOAA to partially make up for this reduction in fleet \ncapability through charters with private vessels.\n  The bill also requires that the proposed cost of modernizing the \nvessels that are kept in the fleet be reduced by 50 percent.\n  The bill authorizes the National Undersea Research Program (NURP) for \nthe first time, but caps this program at $12 million per year, which is \n$6 million less than was appropriated by Congress in FY95.\n  We've required that NOAA transfer its aeronautical charting functions \nto the Federal Aviation Administration to eliminate the duplication of \nfunctions between these two agencies.\n  The bill would require the Administrator of NOAA to identify and \neliminate all redundant or obsolete regulations issued by the agency \nwithin the next two years.\n  The bill calls on NOAA to review all Congressionally-mandated \nreporting requirements, and to recommend legislation by March of 1996 \nto reduce these reporting requirements by 50 percent.\n  Many of the reports that Congress has required of NOAA are no longer \nbeneficial yet we have not discontinued them.\n  The bill calls on NOAA to prepare a plan by March of 1996 to \nconsolidate its laboratories to eliminate duplicative functions and to \nreduce costs.\n  The bill would cap the amount of fishing vessel and fishing facility \nloans that NOAA can guarantee, and allows the agency to pay for the \nadministrative costs of the Fishing Vessel Obligation Guarantee Program \nwith the percentage fees that are already being charged to loan \nguarantee recipients.\n  The bill would prohibit new loan guarantees for the construction of \nfishing vessels if the construction of the vessel would increase the \nharvesting capacity within the U.S. exclusive economic zone.\n  A provision has been included in the bill at my request to allow NOAA \nto consolidate its personnel and functions in Juneau, Alaska under one \nroof.\n  NOAA does not currently have its own facility in Juneau, and this new \nfacility will help the agency save the cost of leasing space in various \nJuneau buildings over the long run.\n  The new facility can only be built if NOAA does not have to pay for \nthe property it is built on.\n  The bill also authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to clean up \nproperty formerly owned by NOAA on the Pribilof Islands.\n  Our proposal will allow for the continued modernization of the \nNational Weather Service and the vital functions provided by that \nagency.\n  The bill authorizes 12 percent less in fiscal year 1996 that was \nrequested in the Administration's fiscal year 1996 NOAA budget.\n  In fiscal years 1997 and 1998, the amount authorized for NOAA will \nincrease slightly to cover the out-year costs of the NWS modernization.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the quick passage of this legislation \nwhen we return from the August recess.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1143. A bill to amend the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to permit \nparticipating households to use food stamp benefits to purchase \nnutritional supplements, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                THE FOOD STAMP ACT AMENDMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 1143, a bill \nto amend the Food Stamp Act to allow participants to use food stamp \nbenefits to purchase dietary supplements.\n  This is a slightly broader measure than the McConnell-Harkin bill \njust introduced today, which I also am pleased to support.\n  My legislation would allow purchases with food stamps of all dietary \nsupplements, including vitamins, minerals, herbs, and amino acids. The \nMcConnell bill, companion to Chairman Emerson's H.R. 236 in the House, \nwould cover vitamins and minerals only.\n\n[[Page S12098]]\n\n  If we are to allow food stamps purchases of vitamins and minerals, \nwhich I agree is a good idea, I feel it is also wise to cover all \ndietary supplements.\n  There is ample evidence to show the nutritional benefits of dietary \nsupplements. I direct my colleagues' attention to Senate Report 103-\n410, which accompanied the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act \n[DSHEA] in which we provided abundant references for such studies.\n  Americans use dietary supplements to ensure that their basic \nnutritional requirements are met, to support their health during \nperiods of special risk, and to help protect against chronic disease.\n  In fact, studies have shown that more than 100 million Americans \nregularly use dietary supplements.\n  Increasingly, Americans are using herbal supplements to enhance their \ndiets with substances found in plants and vegetables. Modern diets lack \nmany novel constituents found only in herbal products. In addition, \nresearch has shown that many foodstuffs and substances found in human \ntissues and cells, such as amino acids, also contain compounds \nbeneficial to health.\n  Mr. President, there is an ample body of evidence to show that \nAmericans simply are not consuming healthy diets, and this is true for \nchildren, women, and men.\n  In one Government study of the eating habits of more than 21,000 \npeople, not a single person got the full recommended daily allowance of \n10 key vitamins and minerals.\n  Many other studies have shown that the poor and elderly in our \ncountry are especially likely to have low nutrient intakes, often with \nsignificant health consequences. For example, a 1992 study by a world-\nrenowned authority on immune function reported that giving a modest \nmultivitamin with minerals to a group of men and women over the age of \n65 for a period of 1 year cut the number of sick days in this group in \nhalf compared to an unsupplemented group.\n  Perhaps the best example is folic acid, which the Food and Drug \nAdministration steadfastly resisted revealing to America's women as a \nsignificant protector against birth defects in newborns.\n  For this reason, I think it is entirely appropriate, indeed\n   warranted, that any participant in the Food Stamp Program who wants \nto improve his or her health be allowed to purchase dietary \nsupplements.\n\n  I know that some are concerned that allowing food stamps to be used \nfor nutritional supplements will in some way divert from the purpose of \nthe Food Stamp Program, which is to improve the nutrition of people in \nneed.\n  In fact, at a July 25 hearing before the House Agriculture \nSubcommittee on Department Operations, in arguing against the Emerson \nbill, a representative of the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable \nAssociation [UFFVA] testified that ``The fundamental purpose of the \nFood Stamp Program is to provide to people in need purchasing power to \nbuy foods.''\n  I would suggest that the Congress has already recognized that dietary \nsupplements are considered food, and I direct the UFFVA to section 3 of \nthe Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994--Public Law \n103-417--which clearly reiterates that dietary supplements are to be \nconsidered as foods within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug and \nCosmetic Act. I would also question what the purpose is in allowing \npeople in need to purchase foods if not to improve their nutrition? And \nimproving nutrition is the goal of the legislation we are introducing \ntoday.\n  Another witness at the House hearing, Ms. Yvette Jackson, Deputy \nAdministrator of the Food Stamp Program at the Department of \nAgriculture, said that ``Substituting supplements for food weakens the \ntime-honored link between nutrition benefits and agricultural \nproduction, a link that this Committee has traditionally fought to \npreserve.'' It is interesting to find that the Agriculture Department \nseems to consider food stamps an agricultural price support, rather \nthan a nutritional support.\n  I have found from my study of this issue over the years that people \nwho use dietary supplements are often those who are most interested in \nimproving or maintaining their health. I think this shows that food \nstamps which are used to buy dietary supplements would go for good use.\n  Mr. President, one final point. Many supporters of this legislation \npoint out that, at present, food stamps can be used to purchase so-\ncalled junk food.\n  Given the choice between a Twinkie or a vitamin, I hope that the \nvitamin would win out every time.\n  But that is not a choice afforded to participants of the Food Stamp \nProgram.\n  Only through legislation such as that we are introducing today can \nthis deficiency in the Food Stamp Program be corrected. I invite my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1143\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the dietary patterns of Americans do not result in \n     nutrient intakes that fully meet Recommended Dietary \n     Allowances (RDAs) of vitamins and minerals;\n       (2) the elderly often fail to achieve adequate nutrient \n     intakes from diet alone;\n       (3) pregnant women have particularly high nutrient needs, \n     which they often fail to meet through dietary means alone;\n       (4)(A) many scientific studies have shown that nutritional \n     supplements that contain folic acid (a B vitamin) can prevent \n     as many as 60 to 80 percent of neural tube birth defects;\n       (B) the Public Health Service, in September 1992, \n     recommended that all women of childbearing age in the United \n     States who are capable of becoming pregnant should consume \n     0.4 mg of folic acid per day for the purpose of reducing \n     their risk of having a pregnancy affected with spina bifida \n     or other neural tube birth defects; and\n       (C) the Food and Drug Administration has also approved a \n     health claim for folic acid to reduce the risk of neural tube \n     birth defects;\n       (5) infants who fail to receive adequate intakes of iron \n     may be somewhat impaired in their mental and behavioral \n     development; and\n       (6) a massive volume of credible scientific evidence \n     strongly suggests that increasing intake of specific \n     nutrients over an extended period of time may be helpful in \n     protecting against diseases or conditions such as \n     osteoporosis, cataracts, cancer, and heart disease.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENT OF THE FOOD STAMP ACT OF 1977.\n\n       Section 3(g)(1) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. \n     2012(g)(1)) is amended by striking ``or food product'' and \n     inserting ``, food product, or dietary supplement (as defined \n     in section 201(ff) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \n     Act (21 U.S.C. 321(ff)))''.\n     \n\n

DETERMINING OF MARKET DOMINANCE IN RAIL CARRIER \n                   RATE PROCEEDINGS.\n\n       (a) In this section, ``market dominance'' means an absence \n     of effective competition from other carriers or modes of \n     transportation for the traffic to which a rate applies. Any \n     agricultural shipper without economically competitive \n     railroad or truck alternatives, shall be considered \n     ``captive'' to the market dominant railroad. Further, any \n     agricultural shipper or its representative, that does not \n     have access to two or more competing railroads for shipping \n     the same commodity from the same origin to the same market as \n     other agricultural shippers shipping to the same market, \n     shall be deemed ``captive'' by a market dominant railroad. \n     Competing railroads shall mean two railroads not under common \n     control for rate making purposes.\n       (b) When a rate for transportation by a rail carrier that \n     is subject to the jurisdiction of an appropriate regulatory \n     federal agency, which is designated by Congress, and \n     adequately funded to protect the interests of ``captive'' \n     shippers, is challenged as being unreasonably high, the \n     Agency shall determine, within 90 days after start of \n     proceeding, whether the railroad carrier has market dominance \n     over the transportation to which the rate applies. After a \n     finding by the Agency that the carrier does have market \n     dominance, the affected shipper and traffic shall be \n     classified as ``captive.''\n       (c) When the Agency finds, in any proceeding that a shipper \n     and associated traffic is captive, the Agency shall suspend \n     the carrier established rates and set the maximum reasonable \n     rates that may be charged by the market dominant railroad. \n     The Agency shall set the maximum reasonable rate at that \n     level which will return fair and reasonable profit to the \n     carrier that would have occurred had there been effective \n     transportation competition for the market dominant traffic. \n     This maximum reasonable rate level determination shall be \n     completed within 120 days of the initiation of the \n     proceeding. The Agency shall not set the maximum reasonable \n     rates any higher than earnings for traffic having similar \n     transportation characteristics with rail-to-rail competition \n     moving similar distances. In any event, the Agency will not \n     set the maximum rates higher than 180% of railroad systemwide \n     variable cost of the movement as determined by the Agency.\n\n[[Page S12105]]\n\n       (d) A market dominant carrier will be required to provide \n     its full common carrier obligation on rates and service to a \n     captive shipper without prejudice or preference, and without \n     any economic penalty to captive shippers. In addition, this \n     carrier shall offer identical or substantially similar \n     transportation services to captive shippers that it offers to \n     any other shipper moving a similar product on the market \n     dominant railroad carrier system.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      FEINSTEIN AMENDMENT NO. 2342\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD (for Mrs. Feinstein) proposed an amendment to the bill \nH.R. 2002, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate point in the bill insert:\n       ``Sec.  .

Mr. President, earlier this year, the world \ncommemorated the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz \nconcentration camp. A delegation of Americans, along with delegations \nfrom all over the world, attended memorial services at Auschwitz and in \nBirkeneau--services to remember those who had died, not just the \nindividuals, but the entire peoples, and the disgust of their torture \nand annihilation.\n  But the tragedy of the Holocaust is one we must remember every day, \nnot just on the anniversaries of its specific elements. Because the \nsurvivors of this horror, and their children, live with it every day. \nSoon, they will be gone. We must remember for them. And we, the \ngreatest democracy on Earth, must remember for the world. Only if we \nremember, will the Holocaust occur never again.\n  So today, Mr. President, I wish to share with my colleagues and the \nAmerican people the remarks of Hadassah Lieberman, who was one of the \nU.S. delegates to the 50th anniversary commemoration. Most of us know \nHadassah as the wife of our good friend and my fellow Senator from \nConnecticut. But Hadassah is also the daughter of Holocaust survivors. \nHer father escaped; her mother was liberated from Auschwitz. They \nsurvived to tell the stories. Millions did not.\n  Mr. President, no matter how many times one listens to accounts of \natrocities committed during the Holocaust, the stories remain just as \nawful, just as horrid, as the first time they are heard. I remember the \noutrage I felt, sitting around the dinner table, at stories recounted \nin letters from my father, who served as the executive trial counsel at \nthe Nuremberg trials. So we should be grateful to Hadassah for writing \nabout her intensely personal feelings as she reflected on her mother's \nstories, the crimes endured by her people, and her triumph in being \nalive 50 years later.\n  Indeed, I am glad Hadassah is present to share her experience with \nus, and I ask to have her accounting printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n  Journey to the Planet of Death--A Daughter of Survivors Visits the \n                        Hearth of the Holocaust\n\n                    (By Hadassah Freilich Lieberman)\n\n       It was a Thursday morning, January 19th, and I was at work \n     when the call came from the White House. Would I join the \n     American delegation to the 50th anniversary of the liberation \n     of Auschwitz? The invitation took my breath away, and in a \n     cracked voice I responded, ``If I can go...I have to go.''\n       My first thoughts were of my schedule, job, six-year old \n     daughter Hana, and my husband, Joe. The delegation was \n     leaving in just five days. Not much time to prepare for what \n     might be the most important journey of my life, for my \n     mother, Ella Wieder Freilich, is an Auschwitz survivor.\n       From childhood, I had heard her intersperse stories of that \n     distant, horrific concentration camp in our everyday American \n     lives. I always listened deeply, although she may have \n     thought from my body language that I was removed. I was \n     always afraid she might cry too much if she continued her \n     dark memories...but the dreadful story would end abruptly and \n     we would continue the usual discourse about meals, or \n     clothes, or schools. The stories were seemingly disconnected, \n     plucked at random from her memory, but I had the feeling \n     there was much more there, left unsaid, in the dark, behind \n     curtains--memories that she could not, and perhaps still \n     cannot, find herself.\n       As for my father, Rabbi Samuel Freilich, he was headed for \n     Auschwitz when he organized an escape of 20 men from a forced \n     march of slave laborers. He confronted memories of the \n     Holocaust head on, and wrote a book about it called ``The \n     Coldest Winter.'' But the experience of putting the story on \n     paper seemed to drain him of life, and he died soon after its \n     publication.\n       He and my mother survived Auschwitz. Most of their \n     relatives and friends did not.\n       Yet when the call came, I had not been thinking about the \n     upcoming anniversary. I don't spend my life contemplating \n     these things all the time, despite (or because of?) the fact \n     I am the daughter of survivors. My very existence is a \n     testimony to survival, and there has always been an \n     undercurrent of striving to be strong and successful in my \n     life (a trait I've seen in many children of survivors). But \n     the specific thought of the Holocaust is not often at the \n     front of my mind. I had never been to any of the camps, and \n     had not planned to go. The only place I did visit was \n     Czechoslovakia, because I wanted to go to places where my \n     family had lived and where I was born. I didn't have a desire \n     to go to the places where my family was sent to die.\n       So the invitation took me by surprise. The mundane \n     logistical problems associated with a major trip mixed with \n     the painful memories, made it difficult to decide whether to \n     go. I called my mother, who now lives in Riverdale, New York, \n     and she was very apprehensive. She feared for my safety. Who \n     will go with you? Who will you stand with at the ceremony? \n     Why is it necessary for you to go?\n       But in the end I concluded that she is why it was necessary \n     for me to go. She and my father and their relatives and \n     friends. As I said when the call first came: I had to go.\n       These were my thoughts along the way:\n\n\n              Tuesday, January 24: In-flight to Frankfurt\n\n       The last few days, the only preparation time I have, I cry \n     often. I call Auschwitz survivors, friends of my mother, for \n     words of support and connection. For the most part, they \n     remain quiet, saying simply, ``Go in peace. Bring back \n     peace.''\n       I am on a Delta flight and I've just finished reading some \n     articles from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial in Washington--\n     excruciating material--describing concentration camps in the \n     vicinity of Auschwitz and Birkeneau. I wipe the tears from my \n     eyes, mesmerized by this world of cruelty and torture, \n     realizing I am soon to visit this symbol of all evil.\n       The descriptions of the concentration camps are \n     incomprehensible--they are of another world, another place. \n     The screen above me plays out O.J. Simpson's trial, Japan's \n     earthquake. I watch the survivors from Japan and wonder, how \n     can you not feel for these people? How can you not feel for \n     their homelessness, their cold, their devastation...and I \n     don't understand what happened in these camps.\n       I find myself looking at a picture of Joe in The Washington \n     Post...sweet darling...The picture make me feel stronger. Now \n     Newt Gingrich on the screen. And Chris Dodd. The world is so \n     intrusive and me...makes it hard to come back...so I drink \n     another glass of wine.\n       Before I left, my mother asked me to bring back dirt from \n     Auschwitz. Nearly all of her family was burnt and pulverized \n     into that dirt, that stinking evil earth. . . .do you bring \n     it home? Is this their grave, entire families? Where are they \n     buried? The ovens? The crematoria? The pits? Fifty years \n     later the stench and screams will not be there.\n       How evil can people be? Watch the news and you see in small \n     snippets: Chechnya, Bosnia, the Middle East. But the sheer \n     enormity of this evil that I am traveling to witness is \n     incomprehensible. The enormity and the organization of it \n     all. I know there are criminals who do ugly, horrible things \n     every day. But the Holocaust was the product of a whole \n     criminal society, a society of people who were educated, \n     literate, loved music, loved art, loved literature. And look \n     what they did with such efficiency, with so little evidence \n     of guilt.\n\n\n      wednesday, january 25: frankfurt, germany and warsaw, poland\n\n       A 3-hour layover in the morning in Frankfurt at the new, \n     empty airport. So empty and antiseptic it is somehow scary to \n     me. All the signs are in German. It is my first time in \n     Germany, and I'm feeling guarded inside myself. I speak \n     mostly with a woman from the State Department, telling her \n     about my background, my mother. I pick up the newspaper, the \n     Frankfurter, Allgemeine, Zeitung, and there is a picture of \n     Hitler. It was taken in 1944, and he looked tired, old. It \n     shows him viewing something with a magnifying glass. He knew \n     then his war was failing. But he pushed on with the Final \n     Solution, as furiously as ever. It was 1944 that my mother \n     was herded to the camps. Even as the war effort was \n     faltering, the Nazis pressed on to kill the Jews because it \n     was an ideology, to them, a mission above and beyond the war \n     itself.\n       In the afternoon, we fly to Warsaw and are picked up by \n     embassy people there and brought to the Marriott hotel, where \n     delegates from around the world are also arriving. That \n     evening, I go to a reception at the residence of the U.S. \n     Ambassador to Poland, Nicholas Rey, along with some of the \n     other members of our delegation, including: Miles Lerman of \n     the United States Holocaust Memorial Council and his wife \n     Chris, an Auschwitz survivor; Ambassador John Kordek, now \n\n[[Page S12107]]\n     with DePaul University; and Jan Nowak, director of the Polish American \n     Congress. The head of our delegation. Mobel Peace Prize \n     winner Elie Wiesel, and Assistant Secretary of State Richard \n     Holbrooke are to join us the next day.\n       We begin to talk about the controversy surrounding the \n     ceremony planned for Friday. Since the Communists left, the \n     Poles have been more open about the Jews in the camps. But \n     Auschwitz was initially for Polish political prisoners. Poles \n     look at Auschwitz as a national shrine and museum. And it \n     seems as though they wanted the commemoration to be more of a \n     generic event, with no special emphasis on Jewish deaths. No \n     praying of the Kaddish. In response, some are planning an \n     alternative service on Thursday at Birkeneau. Preposterous, \n     but true, Elie's words ``not all victims were Jews, but all \n     Jews were victims'' need to be repeated over and over again.\n       I am concerned about the controversy but, at the same time, \n     I do not want to lose sight of the larger reason for our \n     being there. I am moved to say that I understand there's \n     controversy around us. But we should not forget how \n     incredible it is that we're all here together, from all over \n     the world, to commemorate something that happened 50 years \n     ago that, at the time, nobody wanted to hear about. We need \n     to talk about the details, but we should not lose sight of \n     the fact that we're here as representatives of our country, \n     bearing witness to what happened to so many people.\n       We decide that those of us who wanted to go to alternative \n     service will meet the next morning in a hotel lobby. I have \n     mixed feelings. As a Jew and the daughter of survivors, I \n     want to go to Birkeneau. As a member of the official American \n     delegation, I am worried that it might detract from protocol \n     if I deviate from the schedule, which includes a ceremony at \n     Jagiellonian University in Krakow. But everyone assures me \n     that the American delegation will be sufficiently represented \n     at the university.\n\n\n       thursday, january 26: warsaw, krakow, birkeneau, auschwitz\n\n       We arrive in Krakow, a city left untouched by bombing. Some \n     say it is a ``small Prague.'' Krakow; over 25% of its \n     population was Jewish and 90% of its Jews were annihilated. \n     Now tours are advertised to show where Spielberg filmed in \n     the Jewish ``ghetto'' area. The Ariel Cafe is booming with \n     Eastern European/Jewish foods and Yiddish music. The \n     synagogue is old--dating back to the 1400's. Stone markers \n     from Jewish cemeteries are preserved as part of the wall.\n       I check into the Forum Hotel in the city. Leaders from all \n     over the world are arriving. . . Ambassadors, Presidents, \n     Kings, Prime Ministers. Security measures are being put into \n     place. Metal detectors put together. Dogs were brought in. I \n     find real irony in the contrast: here it is fifty years \n     later, and all the forces of authority are being marshalled \n     for our protection, whereas before they would have come to \n     seep us up.\n       All the security precautions also remind me of my mother's \n     concerns for my safety. I don't personally feel threatened, \n     but I begin to realize what she was talking about. I \n     understand we have to be careful, and I know what she felt \n     about my coming here, and how horrible it would be if \n     something happens to me where so much had happened to her. \n     The double-suicide bombing in Israel occurred just days \n     before, reminding us that, for Jews, the world can still be a \n     very dangerous place.\n       News of the alternative ceremony has been spreading by \n     word-of-mouth, and interest in it grows. Originally planned \n     by Jewish organizations and Israelis, it takes on a life of \n     its own, and suddenly includes everyone. Not only the \n     American Ambassador and other delegates from the American \n     group, but every delegation from around the world decides to \n     send representatives.\n       And so I go to Birkeneau, 50 years after my mother left.\n       No one bombed the tracks then. No one ``knew.'' No one \n     seemed to care, or reach out. And now, all the nations of the \n     world are represented as the buses travel to Birkeneau. We \n     travel with the Israeli delegation in front of us, escorted \n     by heavy security. Elie Wiesel, Ambassador and Mrs. Rey, Jan \n     Nowak (who tells me he will go because he must go as a Pole \n     and a Catholic. He was one of the first to alert British \n     leaders to the tragedy of the Holocaust in World War II).\n       Our bus pulls into a large parking area and we exit along \n     with hundreds and hundreds of others. We begin to walk in our \n     own groups. I walk with Elie Wiesel, the Ambassador and his \n     wife, and the others over the rocky, muddy ground. I am arm \n     in arm with Sigmund Strochlitz of Birkeneau and Connecticut, \n     a friend of Elie's. He reminds me a little bit of my father.\n       Where are we? I look around and there are mobs of people \n     around us walking in stony silence. We were warned about the \n     coldness of the camps. But the weather is warm in Krakow . . \n     . until we walk further into the camps and then the coldness \n     begins to set in--a different kind of coldness, eerie . . . \n     heavy. Suddenly, I realize we are walking near railroad \n     tracks and Sigmund begins to speak. ``This was where the \n     train ran into the camp. The train was able to take people \n     straight to the end--to the crematoria.'' This is Birkeneau, \n     a death camp. An enormously vast space that was devoted to \n     murder. I thought again of what my mother had told me, vague \n     disorganized references to gassings, chimneys, SS, Kappos. \n     Her entire family exterminated . . . sweet nieces and nephews \n     murdered.\n       My mother's house was one of the homes the Germans occupied \n     in the 1940's. They put phone lines into the walls and set up \n     headquarters for that Carpathian mountain town of Rachov. \n     They posted notes throughout the small town telling its \n     Jewish inhabitants that they were to report to a local public \n     school. They could take whatever they could carry in their \n     hands.\n       They then left for the Hungarian ghetto Mateszalka, where \n     she remembered a German beating her sister's head. They were \n     then told to line up alphabetically to board trains to \n     Koschow. When some of the local people saw them as the trains \n     went by, they shouted ``You'll never return.'' She still \n     remembers the children's screams for food on the four day \n     train ride. They wanted to throw her off the train and a \n     woman who now lives in New Jersey asked them to ``Let her be, \n     she is a beautiful young woman.'' Today my mother says, \n     ``Half of me doesn't want to remember so that I can remain \n     alive.''\n       She told me that when they came to Auschwitz, some of the \n     Jews who worked at the trains said in Yiddish ``You are fools \n     to have come here.'' She remembers how they sent her family \n     in different directions; she was sent one way and the rest of \n     the family went the other way. As soon as her mother \n     realized, she sent an older sister for ``Ella.'' ``Find \n     her.'' And when the older sister found Ella she joined her in \n     the line of life and the two of them remained alive. They \n     sheared everyone's hair . . . she remembers the screams when \n     they were sent to a shower that they thought would be gas and \n     there was a ``mistake'' and they remained alive. She \n     remembers the piles of bodies left in their clothes, a \n     Kappo's beating, the heads and the feet in the bunkers. She \n     remembers falling deathly ill from eating soup that had human \n     bones in the bowl.\n       Auschwitz was not, for my mother, a final destination. She \n     was sent to the Stuttgart vicinity, to the Wehrmacht Fabrik, \n     where they worked as slave laborers at night and slept during \n     the day. When a Nazi asked her what her greatest wish was . . \n     . she was surprised to answer ``sleeping one night''. He put \n     her into the office to work with other women who knew \n     different languages. Eventually, she was liberated from a \n     sub-camp of Dachau, and took a train back to Prague. In the \n     days following her return, she and hundreds of others would \n     run to the train station whenever a new train pulled in, \n     desperately searching for family, friends, familiar faces. \n     But they were never there. And then she stopped running. For \n     two years or more thereafter, she would go to the basement \n     and cry until she couldn't cry anymore. She met my father in \n     post-war Prague and they soon married. Not long after I was \n     born, they traveled to America, sensing--correctly--that the \n     new Communist rulers would not be kind to the Jews.\n       I knew all of this--the nightmares, the casual references \n     like ``They all died,'' the guilt in remaining a survivor, \n     the questions. I think again of the soil she wants me to \n     bring back. ``They have no graves,'' she told me. ``It would \n     have been better if the mothers were separated from the \n     children so they didn't have to see them murdered in front of \n     their eyes.'' So, I should have been prepared, no? I should \n     have been ready. Although we never talked in great detail \n     about the camps, I was totally aware. I always knew about my \n     background. I was always so aware of the Holocaust. I bear \n     some of the hidden scars of a survivor's child. And so, why \n     was I so shocked? Why? Why is the walk into Birkeneau so \n     terrifying? Let me take you with me.\n       First, we crowd together as delegates for the most part, \n     others from the survivors community. I notice a group with a \n     banner that seemed odd. I ask Sigmund and he tells me that \n     this is the banner of ``Mengele's children,'' the survivors \n     of Mengele's experiments--his ``children'' and ``children's \n     children.'' Then Sigmund shows me where Mengele had stood to \n     make his selection. He shows me the women's and men's \n     barracks. We keep walking forward. The ``survivor'' in me \n     stands in awe of what kind of world my parents had lived \n     through.\n       I have arrived at a different planet. This is not the moon. \n     The moon has been explored. This is a distant planet and \n     those who journeyed there for the entire trip are now dead \n     ashes near the crematoria. The others had to repress, to \n     black out, to forget, in order to go on. This planet is one \n     of surrealistic impressions. The smoke stacks. The endless \n     fields with numbered barracks. The latrine house with round \n     holes for toilets in two rows, each nearly touching the other \n     but with enough space for a sadistic Kappo to walk down the \n     middle and whip the women who took too long to defecate. The \n     bunks with beds . . . eight or nine in each small slab. And \n     we continue to walk.\n       I feel the people around me, walking down this frightful \n     road. The American Ambassador to Poland had chosen to walk \n     with us for this ``unofficial'' event. The American in me, \n     yearning to believe and hope that the world will stand united \n     against cruelty of this proportion. The Jew in me, fearful of \n     the repetitions of history . . . the Israeli flag . . . a \n     refuge . . . a homeland. . . . The wife of a United States \n     Senator, proud to be part of the American delegation, led by \n     Elie Wiesel, bearing witness to history.\n       We continue our walk until we arrive at the crematoria. \n     What can I say? I hold Sigmund's arm tightly. What can I say? \n     I \n\n[[Page S12108]]\n     came unequipped to the planet of death, of torture, of ``endless \n     nights'' as our delegation leader describes it. Everything in \n     front of me told me you could never believe anything after \n     this place. ``Where was God?'' I remember my father asking. \n     ``Where was God?'' and he, a Rabbi, believed deeply in Him. \n     How could you ever believe again? ``Faith was the cornerstone \n     of our existence,'' he wrote in his memoirs. ``It was \n     inconceivable to us that a merciful father could ignore the \n     pitiful pleas of his children. When we were delivered to the \n     Nazis and the redemption did not occur, we fell into despair; \n     life lost meaning . . . We became an orphan people without a \n     heavenly father.''\n       All of these people around me walk with us in silence. The \n     program takes place, people speak, people shout. Kaddish is \n     said and we think perhaps it would have been better to keep \n     our silence--just Kaddish and no words. But then we sing \n     Hatikvah and march back to the buses.\n       Auschwitz is next. A tour of one hour. I find a stone for \n     Dad's grave. I decide not to bring the soil back with me. I \n     had brought a plastic bag, thinking I might. But I decide no. \n     I will not bring soil from the planet of death. Several \n     people tell me about the bones found in the soil 50 years \n     later, some of them the bones of babies. If one is a \n     believer, then the souls have ascended to heaven and what is \n     left should be left behind in peace on Earth. These people, \n     the unsuspecting, the victims, the K'doshim (the holy) were \n     not left behind in peace. I will not take their soil. I don't \n     want any part of that soil.\n       Yet a rock endures from the beginning. It waits silently, \n     protectively, coldly. The rock was there before, and the rock \n     is there after and the rock bears witness. This egg-shaped \n     rock will go on my father's grave. It is small, Daddy, but it \n     is tough, like you. It survives. And remember, in your \n     memoirs, when you asked ``who should say the mourner's \n     Kaddish?'' Daddy, we said Kaddish as we stood at Birkeneau * \n     * * our voices, the young, the old, the victims, the \n     onlookers stood together.\n       Elie Wiesel's friend, Pierre of France goes with me to \n     Auschwitz. A burly large man, somewhat irreverent, quite \n     cynical and sarcastic, takes me to his father's place at \n     Auschwitz. Block 11--the death bunker was the destination of \n     his father who knew 12 languages and served as schreiber \n     (translator) for the place. He tells me about his father's \n     story. When his Hungarian father was in Auschwitz, a young \n     beautiful woman was brought in. He helped her for the night. \n     Somehow they managed to fall in love and as she left she told \n     him where she was from in Paris and that she would meet him \n     in Paris after the war. When he survived he went to the \n     address. She was there, they met, they married.\n       Short stories, sweet stories, bitter and unreal. We are \n     shown an enormous room filed with suitcases that are all \n     labeled with the names of the people to whom they once \n     belonged. We see piles of hair. Eyeglasses. Wooden legs. \n     Prayer shawls. It reminds me of the United States Holocaust \n     Memorial Museum in Washington, where similar exhibits exist. \n     I would wonder from time to time why Washington should be the \n     site for such a museum? What is appropriate about the \n     nation's capital? But here in Auschwitz, I see the answer. I \n     understand the importance of keeping evidence of the evil on \n     display, and I also understand that there is a better chance \n     of such a museum remaining open in Washington than in almost \n     any other place in the world. Who knows what will happen here \n     at Auschwitz in years to come? We already know how the \n     Communists kept a lid on the enormity of crimes against the \n     Jews. We do not know what the future will hold, and so it is \n     right for us to have a museum of the Holocaust at the center \n     of the world's oldest, greatest, strongest democracy.\n       Thursday night, we are taken to a concert at the Slowacki \n     Theater in Krakow, where we hear an orchestral piece written \n     in Poland for the occasion. It is so jagged and jarring--\n     deliberately created so, because it was about the camps--that \n     I want to get out of there. I had gotten through the day but \n     now I need to run. It's so stifling. Finally, it's over, and \n     we think, ``oh God, let's just sit down and have some life.'' \n     So we go to the Ariel Cafe. Let me sit here and be part of \n     life again. Elie Wiesel is here and I recall how often he \n     talks about night, and now we're in the land of night and we \n     have to keep a certain part of ourselves in the night so that \n     we don't lost it. Elie writes from that darkness, yet wants \n     us to hope for the future, for our children. Surrounded by \n     the light and life and sights and sounds of the Ariel Cafe, I \n     want to be lively and have hope, but it is so hard.\n\n\n                     Friday, January 27: Auschwitz\n\n       On Friday we take buses that go directly to the crematoria \n     area at Auschwitz. I see Vaclav Havel on my bus. When we \n     arrive, there are so many people packed together, walking \n     forward, that it's hard to stand without being pushed. I \n     think to myself, irreverently, that after 50 years, people \n     are still pushing to get to the front of the line! I think, \n     too, that we could have been those people 50 years ago, told \n     to undress and have our hair cut! They were people like us \n     who walked into this camp.\n       I see all the world's media gathered together, pushing for \n     position, for the best views, wanting to hear every word, and \n     I think, ``where were you 50 years ago when you were truly \n     needed?'' How different things might have been had videotapes \n     been smuggled out and played on television screens around the \n     world!\n       After a few minutes, the crowd settles in. I stand near \n     Richard Holbrooke and Jan Nowak. The program features \n     representatives from many delegations and religions, \n     including our own delegation leader, Elie Wiesel. I am moved \n     when I hear the ceremony begin--after all--with Kaddish and \n     another Hebrew prayer for the dead, El Maleh. It is a change \n     in the program resulting from a meeting Elie had with Polish \n     President Lech Walesa the day before, as was a reference to \n     Jewish deaths in Walesa's speech.\n       The formal tribute begins in the growing cold air. A \n     poignant moment occurs when the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of \n     Poland walk around to give the people hot coffee. The \n     elderly, in particular, reach out for cups. Watching these \n     very young children working so charitably 50 years after the \n     Holocaust gives us a warm feeling about the present and the \n     future, even as it conjures up memories of all the other \n     young children, in different kinds of uniforms, who died in \n     the past at this place. There was the story of the little boy \n     who jumped off a train bound for concentration camp with an \n     apple in his hand. The train was at a station, and the SS \n     caught him, took him by his legs and bashed him against the \n     train until he was dead. A few minutes later, one of the \n     murderers was seen casually eating the apple. And there was \n     the story my own father told me of the parents who tossed \n     their babies from the trains into the arms of strangers along \n     the side of the tracks hoping against hope that those \n     families would make a new home for their children.\n       Tears come to my eyes as I contrast the moments. An \n     international display of solidarity, tribute, apology. Late, \n     painful and yet a moment of hope. Then, it is over, and \n     together we walk to our buses in the mud, past those in \n     prison uniforms, national costumes and mostly, plain street \n     clothes. All shoes and boots are covered with mud.\n\n\n      Friday Night and Saturday, January 27 & 28: Shabbat, Krakow\n\n       When I learned before the trip that I had to remain in \n     Poland for Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest, alone and far \n     from my family and synagogue, I worried about what I would \n     do. But I am not alone, and, as it turns out, staying in \n     Krakow becomes one of the most special Shabbats I have ever \n     experienced. After the marches, the ceremonies, the journey \n     to the other planet, to stop for Shabbat and to share the \n     special moment with people from all over the world gives \n     meaning to us all. And so we sit together on Friday night \n     with the chief rabbis of England, Poland, Ukraine, Italy, and \n     Jews from England, Germany, Krakow, Warsaw, Israel, America. \n     Rabbi Avi Weiss is with us, the activist who protested the \n     original plans for the ceremony and who has become so much of \n     a celebrity that when the police arrested him\n      in Poland for tearing down a sign that said ``Protect the \n     cross against Jews and Masons,'' they asked to take his \n     picture and have his autograph!\n       We all sing and pray together and tell stories. \n     Particularly poignant are the stories of the young Eastern \n     European Jews sitting around the tables. Since the fall of \n     Communism, they are learning of their Jewishness. Their \n     family trees are deeply fractured by the Holocaust; many have \n     no grandparents. Some were born to parents who were hidden \n     with Polish Catholic families when their parents were sent to \n     their death. Another learned just three years ago that he was \n     Jewish. Perhaps some of them are descended from the babies \n     tossed from the death trains. How ironic that Hitler's \n     criteria for determining who was Jewish--in some instances, \n     quite remote--is the same relationship many of these children \n     have to Judaism.\n       The next day, on our way to services, I walk behind Rabbi \n     Weiss and see him with his prayer shawl over his jacket. \n     People along the way, not accustomed to seeing Jews, stop and \n     stare. Some take pictures. And I think, ``is it gaudy, is it \n     showy, is it obnoxious for our group to be so obvious in such \n     a place?'' That is my first reaction, but then I remember \n     Auschwitz and the hanging prayer shawls taken from the Jews \n     who were annihilated, and now the descendants are alive and \n     walking to the synagogue, and it seems right.\n       Our Shabbot services in the hotel are, strangely enough, \n     joyous. We are all happy to be together, to be alive. We feel \n     the history of the tragedy in our depths. We share our common \n     history, common pain. We all have questions and no real \n     answers. As we call out in our prayers, rising above and \n     beyond the evil planet of Auschwitz and Birkeneau, the planet \n     that bears witness to our people's destruction, we all turn \n     to the very God that has not answered the prayers of our \n     parents and their parents as the crematoria burnt their \n     bodies into ashes.\n       Nothing on that planet gives you faith, hope or answers. \n     Nothing there gives you hope for mankind. And yet, as I \n     walked with my fellow travellers that day, as I felt their \n     bodies near me, heard their feet in the mud and stone, \n     walking silently, I knew our walk was a prayer. Our walk \n     might defy--bear witness. Our walk might challenge any evils \n     as great as powerful as wicked, and so, on Friday night, we \n     all felt history around us. We were defying Hitler and his \n     henchmen. I \n\n[[Page S12109]]\n     thought back to 1988, when I joined my husband on his first visit to \n     the historic chamber of the Senate, where the historian \n     lectured us about the famous figures in American history who \n     had occupied these seats. I looked at Joe and asked him what \n     he was thinking and he talked about how proud and honored he \n     was to be part of this rich history. ``What about you? What \n     are you thinking?'' he asked. ``About Hitler,'' I replied. \n     ``About how he tried to annihilate all the Jews, and here I \n     am on the floor of the Senate, the wife of a Senator. I am \n     thinking about throwing my fist up in the air in defiance of \n     Hitler.''\n       That is the feeling I had again, more powerfully than ever \n     before, at Birkeneau and Auschwitz. We were rising above the \n     defiled and tortured and abandoned. We were free Jews singing \n     to God, responsible for one another.\n       Am yisrael chai. The people of Israel live. The Israeli \n     flag was around us and we knew how great our need for a place \n     of refuge; wanting to trust, yet learning the bitter lessons \n     of history. We Americans know how special our country is, a \n     country where a Jew could become a Senator, and where his \n     wife, a survivor, can be chosen by the President to \n     participate in a commemoration of the liberation--the \n     destruction--of the planet of death.\n       I had to go there. No matter how much you read, and how \n     much you hear about it, and how much you talk to your family \n     and parents--even if you are as close to the Holocaust as the \n     child of survivors--you have to go there and see this \n     horrendously evil, evil, evil place that stinks in its \n     profanity, that is so ugly it shakes your belief in \n     everything, your belief in mankind, your faith in God. You \n     will not understand. But you will know.\n       Now, home with my family, I look forward to the day when I \n     will travel to my father's grave in New Jersey and place the \n     stone from Auschwitz on the ground that contains his earthly \n     remains, confident that this spirit survives in eternity, \n     never again to live on a planet of death.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \nColorado State football team and Coach Sonny Lubick.\n  Last year, Coach Lubick and the CSU Rams finished their season with a \n10-and-2 record, the most wins in school history. The team also claimed \nthe school's first Western Athletic Conference championship and its \nfirst trip to the Holiday Bowl. Coach Lubick was named the Western \nAthletic Conference's coach of the year and Sports Illustrated's \nnational coach of the year.\n  His players have distinguished themselves as well. Ten players over \nthe last 2 years have earned first-team all-WAC honors. Demonstrating \nexcellence in the classroom as well as on the field, six were named to \nthe WAC's all-academic team.\n  For the first time since 1978, a Ram--Safety Greg Myers--was named \nfirst-team All-American. Greg goes into the season ranked by The \nSporting News as one of the top five safeties in the Nation.\n  Their success has not gone unnoticed. CSU reports a school-record \n8,000 season tickets sold this year. While that success will bring new \nchallenges, I am confident Coach Lubick and his team will continue to \nreach new heights.\n  As the USA Today wrote: ``In '94, the Rams found a way to win tough \nones.'' That spirit, more than anything, defines the Colorado \nspirit.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/09/senate-section/article/S12109-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             JOSEF GINGOLD\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the late \nviolinist Josef Gingold and his family.\n  Mr. Gingold was a world-renowned violinist and a music professor at \nIndiana University who selflessly devoted his life to teaching music. \nHis distinguished career in the musical arts and his devotion to \nteaching serves as an example of a life of tireless dedication. His \nlegacy continues; many of his students have gone on to careers as \nconductors, musicians, and teachers in major symphonies and schools \nthroughout the world. He also built the program at Indiana University's \nSchool of Music to become recognized internationally as one of the most \nrespected curriculums for the world's next generation of violinists.\n  The Gingold family is a model of strong morals and family values in \ntheir cohesiveness and unity in crisis. Despite having encountered \nstruggles since Mr. Gingold's passing, they have shown dignity and \nperseverence in coming together to grieve and to console one another.\n  Mr. Gingold's son and daughter-in-law, George and Anne Gingold, who \nare residents of the State of Connecticut, have graciously donated a \ncollection of Mr. Gingold's books, music, letters, pictures, \ncompetition notes, and other materials to be available to teachers, \nmusicians, and historians at the Library of Congress.\n  Josef Gingold lived a life that should be an example to all of us. He \nloved and provided for his family while as a professor of music at \nIndiana University. He will long be remembered as a man who touched \nmany and helped countless others through his dedication and devotion to \nmusic and his passion for teaching.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/09/senate-section/article/S12109-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      CODES AND STANDARDS PROGRAM\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the \nCodes and Standards Program as mandated under the Energy Policy Act of \n1992. Federal appliance efficiency standards were established because \nmanufacturers wanted one federal standard as opposed to 50 different, \nand perhaps inconsistent, standards.\n  The consumer benefits from the Codes and Standards program. The \nprogram establishes minimum energy conservation standards for a variety \nof electrical components, electrical consumer goods and building codes.\n  The effects of the Codes and Standards program are significant. For \nexample, new energy standards for clothes washers have the potential to \nsave consumers up to two-thirds of their current energy and water costs \nbefore the end of the decade.\n  The appliance standards adopted to date will save consumers a net of \n$132 billion over the lifetime of the affected products.\n  What is good for the consumer is good for the industry. The further \nbenefits of this program are: The standards also decrease pressure on \nutilities to build new power plants; preserve precious natural fuel \nresources; promote greater water conservation in drought stricken \nstates; make U.S. products more competitive in domestic markets against \nforeign competition.\n  I know that the industry has raised significant criticisms of the \nDepartment of Energy. As a result, the Department has organized \nworkshops and public meetings with manufacturers to work towards \nconsensus. I support continuing a consensus approach to revising \nstandards.\n  Today, the Senate has accepted an amendment that will preclude the \nproposal, issuance or prescription of rules on new or amended appliance \nand equipment standards for one year. After this limited time period \nfor technical review, I urge my colleagues to remain firmly in support \nof the Codes and Standards program.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/09/senate-section/article/S12109-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12109-S12110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  SEYBOURN H. LYNNE FEDERAL COURTHOUSE\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of calendar No. 170, S. 369.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 369) designating the Federal courthouse in \n     Decatur, Alabama, as the ``Seybourn H. Lynne Federal \n     Courthouse,'' and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the Senate and the \nSenate Committee on Environment and Public Works for the unanimous \nsupport given toward the passage of S. 369, a bill which will rename \nthe Federal Courthouse in Decatur, AL, in honor of Senior Judge \nSeybourn Harris Lynne.\n  This bill, which is cosponsored by Senator Richard Shelby honors a \ndistinguished Alabama jurist. Judge Lynne has contributed 45 years of \ndedicated service to the Federal bench, serving on the United States \nDistrict Court for the northern District of Alabama.\n  Judge Lynne is a native for Decatur, AL, where he graduated from \nDecatur High School in 1923. He attended the Alabama Polytechnic \nInstitute, the present-day Auburn University, and he graduated from \nthis outstanding university with highest distinction. Judge \n\n[[Page S12110]]\nLynne then went on to earn his law degree from the University of \nAlabama School of Law in 1930. While he was in law school, he served as \ntrack coach and assistant football coach at the university. Upon \ngraduation from law school, Judge Lynne practiced law in a partnership \nformed with his father, Mr. Seybourn Arthur Lynne.\n  In 1934, Judge Lynne was elected Judge of the Morgan County Court. He \nremained in that position until January 1941, when he took over the \nelected duties of judge of the Eighth Judicial Circuit of Alabama. On \nJune 16, 1937, he married Katherine Donaldson Brandau of Knoxville, TN. \nIn December of 1942, he resigned from the bench to voluntarily enter \nthe military. After earning the rank of lieutenant colonel, he was \nrelieved of active duty in November of 1945 and awarded the Bronze Star \nMedal for meritorious service in operations against the enemy.\n  When an opening occurred on the Federal bench, Alabama Senators \nLister Hill and John Bankhead were called upon to provide an \nappropriate individual to be considered by the White House for this \njudgeship. After discussions and a reveiw of Judge Lynne's background, \nthe decision was made to put forward his name. However, one important \nfactor should be noted, namely that as he was being considered for a \nFederal judgeship, Judge Lynne was still serving his country in the \nSouth Pacific. In these days of self-serving rhetoric, it is refreshing \nto know that the outstanding reputation and attributes of Judge Lynne \nwere already being recognized by his peers.\n  In January 1946, President Harry S. Truman appointed Judge Lynne to \nthe United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. \nIn 1953, he became the Chief Judge, and in 1973 he became Senior Judge.\n  As Chief Judge for the Northern District of Alabama, Judge Lynne was \nknown as an outstanding leader. His knowledge and management skills \nensured a solid, working relationship between the Federal bench and the \nbar. The Northern District was not burdened with a stale and over-ripe \ndocket and the court's caseload was kept timely and up-to-date thanks \nto the leadership of Judge Lynne.\n  In addition to this leadership responsibilities, Judge Lynne worked \nhard and carried a full caseload. In fact, even in senior status, he \ncontinues to work long hours and keeps a complete docket of cases. Over \nthe years, Judge Lynne has been recognized as an outstanding mediator \nwho often was able to reconcile competing interests in order to forge a \nthoughtful compromise. A number of businesses and individuals in \nAlabama are growing and thriving today due to Judge Lynne's abilities \nas an arbiter who was able to settle complex and difficult disputes.\n  In addition to his life on the bench, Judge Lynne has been very \nactive in church, civic, school and professional activities. He has \nserved his church, Southside Baptist Church--Birmingham, AL, As a \nDeacon, A men's bible class teacher, and a trustee. He has also served \nboth the Crippled Children's Clinic of Birmingham and the eye \nFoundation Hospital of Birmingham as trustee. In 1967, he Served as the \npresident of the University of Alabama law school Alumni Association.\n  Therefore, I believe that the naming of this Federal Courthouse is a \nfitting tribute to Judge Seybourne Harris Lynne for his tireless work \non behalf of the State and Federal bench.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered and \ndeemed read the third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
