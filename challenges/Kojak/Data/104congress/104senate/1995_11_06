Just a few days ago, here in the \nrotunda of the Capitol, we heard him speak of his commitment to peace \nas we celebrated the 3,000th anniversary of the city of Jerusalem. Only \na few days before that we saw him sign the peace agreement and seal it \nwith a historic handshake with Yasser Arafat at the White House. All of \nthis was the fruit of his efforts in the negotiations at Oslo and \nsubsequently his leadership in the 1993 agreement with the \nPalestinians. Oh God, this great and gracious man defied the risks and \nfaced the dangers of being a peacemaker among his own people and in the \nMiddle East. All because of the mandate for peace You placed as a \npassion in his heart.\n  We abhor the violent, radical fanaticism that would viciously \nmotivate a countryman to cause Rabin's untimely death. Now Lord, we ask \nYou to stay the evil hand of terrorism in our time. We pray for the \npeace of Jerusalem, for Shimon Peres as he becomes acting Prime \nMinister, for President Clinton, and Secretary of State Christopher as \nthey seek to stabilize the implementation of the peace agreement, may \nthey be encouraged by our support. Oh, Jehovah Shalom, fill our hearts \nand minds with Your peace as we commit ourselves anew to be \npeacemakers. In Your holy name. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/06/senate-section/article/S16699-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, before discussing today's bad news about \nthe Federal debt, how about ``another go,'' as the British put it, with \nour pop quiz. Remember? One question, one answer.\n  The question: How many millions of dollars does it take to add up a \ntrillion dollars? While you are thinking about it, bear in mind that it \nwas the U.S. Congress that ran up the Federal debt that is $27 billion \naway from $5 trillion.\n  To be exact, as of the close of business Friday, November 3, the \ntotal Federal debt--down to the penny--stood at $4,984,800,213,988.31. \nThis figure is approximately $27 billion away from $5 trillion. Another \ndepressing figure means that on a per capita basis, every man, woman, \nand child in America owes $18,922.39.\n  Mr. President, back to our pop quiz, how many million in a trillion: \nThere are a million million in a trillion.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). In my capacity as a Senator from \nthe State of Washington, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/06/senate-section/article/S16699-7", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Con. Res. 31\n\n       Whereas Yitzhak Rabin, a true hero of Israel, was born in \n     Jerusalem on March 1, 1922;\n       Whereas Yitzhak Rabin served in the Israel Defense Forces \n     for more than two decades, and fought in three wars including \n     service as Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces during \n     the Six Day War of June 1967;\n       Whereas Yitzhak Rabin served the people of Israel with \n     great distinction in a number of government positions, \n     including Ambassador to the United States from 1968 to 1973, \n     Minister of Defense from 1984 to 1988, and twice as Prime \n     Minister from 1974 to 1977 and from June 1992 until his \n     assassination;\n       Whereas under the leadership of Yitzhak Rabin, a framework \n     for peace between Israel and the Palestinians was established \n     with the signing of the Declaration of Principles on \n     September 13, 1993, continued with the conclusion of a peace \n     treaty between Israel and Jordan on October 26, 1994, and \n     continues today;\n       Whereas on December 10, 1994, Yitzhak Rabin was awarded the \n     Nobel Prize for Peace for his vision and accomplishments as a \n     peacemaker;\n       Whereas shortly before his assassination, Yitzhak Rabin \n     said, ``I have always believed that the majority of the \n     people want peace and are ready to take a chance for peace . \n     . . Peace is not only in prayers . . . but it is in the \n     desire of the Jewish people.'';\n       Whereas Yitzhak Rabin's entire life was dedicated to the \n     cause of peace and security for Israel and its people;\n       Whereas on November 4, 1995 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin \n     was assassinated in Tel Aviv, Israel: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) Condemns the heinous assassination of Prime Minister \n     Yitzhak Rabin in the strongest possible terms;\n       (2) Extends its deepest sympathy and condolences to the \n     family of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and to all the people \n     of Israel in this moment of tragedy;\n       (3) Expresses it admiration for the historic contributions \n     made by Yitzhak Rabin over his long and distinguished career \n     of public service;\n       (4) Expresses its support for the government of Acting \n     Prime Minister Shimon Peres;\n       (5) Reaffirms its commitment to the process of building a \n     just and lasting peace between Israel and its neighbors;\n       (6) That when the Senate completes its business today, it \n     stand adjourned as a further mark of respect in honor of the \n     late Yitzhak Rabin, and\n       (7) Directs, the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the family of the \n     deceased.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/06/senate-section/article/S16700-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16700-S16701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                   HONORING SOUTH CAROLINA EDUCATORS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to three outstanding South Carolina \nteachers: Barbara Weston, Abraham Funchess and Jeanne Sink. Recently, \nthey were recognized by the Milken Family Foundation of California for \noutstanding work in their South Carolina classrooms.\n  Barbara Weston is a 20-year educator who now teaches at the Five \nPoints School in Columbia. This school is an alternative program \ndesigned to prevent students from dropping out of high school. It is at \nthat school that Mrs. Weston has taken on the role of teacher, \ncounselor, and mentor with relish.\n  The school is small--just 50 students. And Barbara Weston knows them \nall by name--and more. She exchanges phone numbers with parents of her \nstudents and encourages contact. As her students have learned, it is \nhard to get away with nonsense when your teacher knows your parents and \nknows how to find you.\n  Barbara Weston, a native of South Carolina who was raised in \nEastover, teaches English. Her students say she is a caring teacher who \nlives by the creed: ``There's nothing you can't do.'' You cannot expect \nmuch more of a teacher than that. The Milken Foundation is not the \nfirst to recognize her achievements. Last year, she was named the \nRichland District I Teacher of the Year and was a State finalist for \nthe South Carolina Teacher of the Year Award.\n  Mrs. Weston, a graduate of South Carolina State College, is married \nto Samuel Weston and they have two sons.\n  Mr. President, Abraham Funchess is a sixth-grade science teacher at \nJohn Ford Middle School in St. Matthews, the town where he was born, \nraised, and educated.\n  Mr. Funchess has been a fixture in the education system of Calhoun \nCounty for 28 years. He has touched the lives of thousands of children \nthere. He teaches them the joys of nature in his outdoor laboratory \nwhere students plant a garden and watch it grow. On other occasions, \nthey uncover the mysteries of the forest's sights and sounds during \nnearby nature walks.\n  In the classroom, Mr. Funchess guides his students through laboratory \nexperiments and watches their excitement as they compare answers with \nstudents in other cities through a link-up on the Internet.\n  ``I don't teach books; I teach students,'' is the way Mr. Funchess \ndescribes his teaching philosophy. His is a hands-on teaching style \nthat shows every student the joy of learning. There is a motto in large \nletters above his chalkboard that says: ``I see; I hear; I forget. But \nwhen I do, I understand.'' It is a motto Mr. Funchess has embraced and \none for which his students are thankful.\n  Abraham Funchess has been named Teacher of the Year at John Ford \nMiddle School for the past 2 years. He received his undergraduate \ndegree at South Carolina's Claflin College and his master's at South \nCarolina State. \n\n[[Page S 16701]]\n He also has served on the State Board of Education. Mr. Funchess is \nmarried to the former Bernice Legette of Rains, SC, and they have three \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, last but certainly not least, we recognize Jeanne \nSink--a teacher at St. Andrews Parish High School in Charleston where \nmy wife Peatsy used to teach.\n  Mrs. Sink teaches a subject that was not around when I was in high \nschool. She guides students through the world of technology. As we move \ninto the 21st century, this is certainly a subject that our students \nneed to understand, and no one explains it better than Jeanne Sink.\n  She teaches all kinds of practical technology lessons. Gone are the \nold days of written reports. In Jeanne Sink's class, students learn how \nto give multimedia presentations. They have become pros with today's \ncomputer systems and use sophisticated programs to scan pictures, add \nsound and type in text. The presentations they give are polished and to \nthe point.\n  Students in Mrs. Sink's class also employ their technology lessons to \npublish the school newspaper on the Macintosh. As such, they are able \nto practice their English, grammar, journalism, and computer skills all \nat once. Mrs. Sink also teaches special classes for students with a \nhistory of academic difficulties and has piloted a program to work \nclosely with students who have been expelled and are enrolled at other \nschools.\n  Mrs. Sink has been teaching for 17 years and credits the kudos she \nhas received to her philosophy that all students can be successful. Her \nstudents have not always had great academic track records, but she does \nnot let that discourage her--or them. She tries to turn them on to \neducation by showing them affection, respect, and lots of patience.\n  It should come as no surprise to learn that Jeanne Sink has been \nnamed South Carolina Teacher of the Year and has won several other \nteaching awards. She received her undergraduate and graduate degrees at \nthe College of Charleston. She and her husband Eddie have three \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, these three teachers demonstrate the incredible impact \nthat committed teachers can have.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Dole and Daschle, I \nsend to the desk a concurrent resolution in honor of Israeli Prime \nMinister Yitzhak Rabin, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the concurrent resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 31) honoring the life \n     and legacy of Yitzhak Rabin:\n\n       Whereas Yitzhak Rabin, a true hero of Israel, was born in \n     Jerusalem on March 1, 1922;\n       Whereas Yitzhak Rabin served in the Israel Defense Forces \n     for more than two decades, and fought in three wars including \n     service as Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces during \n     the Six Day War of June 1967;\n       Whereas Yitzhak Rabin served the people of Israel with \n     great distinction in a number of government positions, \n     including Ambassador to the United States from 1968 to 1973, \n     Minister of Defense from 1984 to 1988, and twice as Prime \n     Minister from 1974 to 1977 and from June 1992 until is \n     assassination;\n       Whereas under the leadership of Yitzhak Rabin, a framework \n     for peace between Israel and the Palestinians was established \n     with the signing of the Declaration of Principles on \n     September 13, 1993, continued with the conclusion of a peace \n     treaty between Israel and Jordan on October 26, 1994, and \n     continues today;\n       Whereas on December 10, 1994, Yitzhak Rabin was awarded the \n     Nobel Prize for Peace for his vision and accomplishments as a \n     peacemaker;\n       Whereas shortly before his assassination, Yitzhak Rabin \n     said, ``I have always believed that the majority of the \n     people want peace and are ready to take a chance for peace . \n     . . Peace is not only in prayers . . . but it is in the \n     desire of the Jewish people.'';\n       Whereas Yitzhak Rabin's entire life was dedicated to the \n     cause of peace and security for Israel and its people;\n       Whereas on November 4, 1995 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin \n     was assassinated in Tel Aviv, Israel: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) Condemns the heinous assassination of Prime Minister \n     Yitzhak Rabin in the strongest possible terms;\n       (2) Extends its deepest sympathy and condolences to the \n     family of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and to all the people \n     of Israel in this moment of tragedy;\n       (3) Expresses its admiration for the historic contributions \n     made by Yitzhak Rabin over his long and distinguished career \n     of public service;\n       (4) Expresses its support for the government of Acting \n     Prime Minister Shimon Peres;\n       (5) Reaffirms its commitment to the process of building a \n     just and lasting peace between Israel and its neighbors;\n       (6) That when the Senate completes its business today, it \n     stand adjourned as a further mark of respect in honor of the \n     late Yitzhak Rabin; and\n       (7) Directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the family of the \n     deceased.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the concurrent \nresolution and the preamble are agreed to.\n  So the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 31), with its preamble, \nwas agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to comment on \nthe concurrent resolution that has just been adopted, and I do want to \nemphasize that all Senators' names will be added as cosponsors and \nadditional remarks can be placed in the Record until 2 o'clock today.\n  The world truly was shocked by the brutal assassination of Israeli \nPrime Minister Rabin late last Saturday in Tel Aviv. As Israel's \ngreatest war hero and architect of the stunning Israeli victory in the \n1967 war, Rabin was instrumental in turning Israel into a world-class \nmilitary power that was in a position to serve as America's foremost \nally in the crucial Middle East.\n  His equally impressive, and perhaps more important, contributions as \npeacemaker during his two terms as Prime Minister from 1974 to 1977 and \n1992 to 1995--the disengagement agreement with Egypt in 1975; the Oslo \nI, Gaza-Jericho, and Oslo II agreements with the PLO in 1993 to 1995; \nand the peace treaty with Jordan in 1994--helped stabilize the Middle \nEast and strengthen America's position in the region.\n  And by ordering the rescue operation in Entebbe on America's \nbicentennial, Rabin dealt a heavy blow to international terrorism from \nwhich the United States greatly benefited.\n  During the last 3 years, Rabin brought the United States-Israeli \nrelationship to unprecedented heights. At his meeting with President \nBush in Kennebunkport and at several meetings with President Clinton, \nhe established extremely close relations with the two Presidents and \ntheir most senior aides.\n  In all spheres--political, military, and economic--the relationship \nhas blossomed like never before.\n  Prime Minister Rabin will be remembered as a peacemaker. He expressed \nhis vision of peacemaking when he spoke to a joint meeting of Congress \non July 26, 1994:\n\n\n[[Page S 16710]]\n\n       I have come from Jerusalem in the name of our children, who \n     began their lives with great hope and are now names on graves \n     and memorial stones, old pictures in albums, fading clothes \n     in closets. Each year as I stand before the parents whose \n     lips are chanting ``Kaddish,'' the Jewish Memorial Prayer, \n     ringing in my ears are the words of [Archibald] MacLeish who \n     echoes the plea of the young dead soldiers:\n       ``They say: We leave you our deaths. Give them their \n     meaning.''\n       Let us give them meaning. Let us make an end to bloodshed. \n     Let us make true peace. Let us today be victorious in ending \n     war.\n\n  Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin truly was a warrior who became a warrior \nfor peace. ``Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall inherit the \nEarth.''\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, an assassin's gun silenced a great man this \nweekend. When Yitzhak Rabin fell on Saturday in Tel Aviv, his family \nlost a husband and father; Israel lost a great patriot; America lost a \ngreat friend and ally; and, the world lost a brave soldier for peace.\n  I wish to extend my heartfelt sympathy and prayers to the Rabin \nfamily. I know that the people of Utah and all the people of our Nation \nshare with them this deep grief over the violent loss of Prime Minister \nRabin.\n  Yitzhak Rabin was one of the outstanding figures of the modern Jewish \nState. Born in the land he loved, he made history throughout his life, \nas a soldier, general, ambassador, Minister of Defense, and--twice--\nPrime Minister. History will regard him as the brave, sometimes lonely, \nfigure who fought fiercely and brilliantly to secure his beloved \nIsrael, and as the leader who tried to bring his nation into an era of \npeace.\n  His greatest campaign remains unfinished. We cannot now say what the \noutcome of the peace process will be. We could not predict the outcome \n1 month ago, with so many elements of the process uncertain, as we \ncould not predict that we would never be able to greet our friend \nYitzhak Rabin again. What we can say is that we stand with Israel today \nin grief, and we join the millions around the world who mourn the loss \nof a great peacemaker.\n  The pursuit of peace is dangerous. Here in Washington, not even 1 \nmonth ago, Prime Minister Rabin said, at the signing of the latest in \nthe autonomy accords with the Palestinians:\n\n       Today we are more sober. We are gladdened by the potential \n     for reconciliation, but we are also wary of the dangers that \n     lurk on every side.\n\n  Yitzhak Rabin led the life of a hero. As a soldier, he faced battle \ntime and again and, as he often recalled, he saw many people die around \nhim. Having spent over two decades with the defense forces of Israel, \nhe knew the cost of war.\n  Peace would exact a higher personal cost from Prime Minister Rabin. \nHe knew the risks of peace, but because he was a brave man, a hero, he \nspent the last years of his life trying to build a lasting peace in \nthat violent part of the world. He led the peace process because he \ntruly believed the peoples of the region truly wanted peace. He also \nled the peace process because he knew the great cost that the nation of \nIsrael paid to wage violence against its domestic and foreign \nopponents. Minutes before he was shot, Prime Minister Rabin said\n\n       Violence erodes the basis of Israeli democracy. . . It is \n     not the way of the state of Israel.\n\n  Mr. President, Yitzhak Rabin knew that Israel is a land of laws. It \nis a land where the people rule democratically. That is one of the \nreasons our country has always been able to stand by our closest ally \nin that region, the only democracy in the Middle East. No assassin's \nbullet will change that.\n  We will grieve for the loss of Yitzhak Rabin. And we will grieve for \nwhat this loss means for the people of Israel, and for the peace-loving \npeoples of the Middle East. But we need not grieve for the State of \nIsrael, whose strength Prime Minister Rabin built but whose democratic \ninstitutions will not change due to the violence of one hate-filled \nindividual.\n  Let us honor the memory of Yitzhak Rabin today. Let us honor this \ngreat warrior, who died engaged in the greatest battle of his life: the \nbattle for peace. And in honor of his memory, let us rededicate \nourselves to a real peace in the Middle East.\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, the assassination Saturday of \nYitzhak Rabin, Prime Minister of Israel, was a tragic, cowardly act \nthat must serve to strengthen the peace process in the Middle East, not \nslow it down or end it.\n  Rabin was one of the toughest and most successful military leaders in \nhis nation's history. He was a legendary warrior whose leadership \nhelped establish Israel and preserve it through numerous trials, from \nthe Six Day War to the freeing of hostages at Entebbe in 1976.\n  Perhaps it was only a man like Rabin--a warrior forged in conflict \nand steeled in battle--who could have led his nation toward peace with \ntheir historic enemies. Perhaps it was only a man like Rabin who could \nhave persuaded his embattled countrymen to give peace a chance.\n  And that is what he did. And like other great martyrs before him--\nindividuals like Abraham Lincoln, Mohandras Gandhi, and Anwar Sadat--he \ngave his life for his people and for his nation, and for peace. The \npursuit of peace is often more dangerous and difficult than the pursuit \nof war.\n  Now, the heirs of Yitzhak Rabin must stand off the terrorists bent on \nhatred, destruction, and war, and continue with their agenda for peace \nin the Middle East.\n  Israel is a democratic society, and democracies do not depend on a \nsingle, individual leader. While Israel and the world mourn for Yitzhak \nRabin, and for the cause of peace, already his successors are picking \nup his mantle.\n  I am certain that Israel can emerge from the circumstances of this \nheinous crime stronger and even more dedicated to a final and lasting \npeace. Only moments before he was gunned down at the peace rally in Tel \nAviv, Rabin said:\n\n       I believe there is now a chance for peace, a great chance, \n     and we must take advantage of it. . . . Violence . . . should \n     be condemned and wisely expunged and isolated. It is not the \n     way of the state of Israel. There is democracy. Peace is not \n     only in prayers . . . but it is the desire of the Jewish \n     people.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I join with millions around the world to \nexpress my shock and sorrow for the loss of Israeli Prime Minister \nYitzhak Rabin.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the Rabin family and the people of \nIsrael. A family, a nation, a world will be without an extraordinary \nhuman being.\n  Throughout my career in Congress, I always have had a special \ninterest in Israel. A special bond exists between the people of the \nUnited States and the people of Israel. It is bond based on shared \nideals--for freedom, for democracy, and for peace.\n  Yitzhak Rabin made these ideals his own, and sought their \npreservation for future generations. I am fortunate to say I met \nYitzhak Rabin on a number of occasions. Through intelligence, savvy, \nand sheer will, Yitzhak Rabin was a significant participant in \nvirtually every major chapter of Israel's modern existence: He served \nas a brigade commander during Israel's struggle for independence; he \nwas Chief of Staff of the Israeli Army during the 1967 Arab-Israeli \nwar; he was Prime Minster and architect of the legendary Entebbe rescue \nmission in Uganda; and of course, he was Prime Minister during the \nhistoric peace process.\n  On meeting Yitzhak Rabin, it becomes clear why he was a leader of \nIsrael. For in this man, one can see a nation's characteristics: Tough, \nintelligent, fair, determined, and yes, compassionate. Yitzhak Rabin, \nlike all Israelis, loved his country, and was willing to give his life \nto defend his country and bring real peace to his people. Abraham \nLincoln referred to this extreme level of personal sacrifice, ``the \nlast full measure of devotion.'' Indeed, Yitzhak Rabin demonstrated the \nfullness of his devotion to Israel to the very end.\n  Yitzhak Rabin devoted and ultimately gave his life to bring about \nwhat was considered impossible: a lasting peace in Israel and \nthroughout the Middle East. Now the people of Israel need to come \ntogether and see that his cause for peace is achieved and maintained \nfor all time. That is a challenge shared by all nations who have an \ninterest in peace in the Middle East. No man had a greater role in \nshaping the current peace process than Yitzhak Rabin. And no man has \nplayed a greater part in placing the peace process in jeopardy than the \ncowardly thug who \n\n[[Page S 16711]]\nkilled Prime Minister Rabin by shooting him in the back.\n  However, as the people of the United States know all too well, the \ncause of peace and freedom must not fall victim to violence and hate. \nYitzhak Rabin would agree. The pursuit of peace is above any one man's \ncapability to add to it, as well as any one man's audacity to destroy \nit. No matter what form violence may take, it must not stop nor slow \nour collective quest for peace and freedom in the Middle East.\n  Mr. President, again, I extend my best wishes to the Rabin family and \nthe people of Israel. We have lost a great man, but his dream, his \nlegacy of a strong, vibrant Israel at peace with her neighbors is very \nmuch with us still. It must not perish with him.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join the many mourners who share in the \nloss of Israel's Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin. It is ironic that the \nman who has spent his life in working for peace has now given his life \nfor peace. When I first heard the news, my reaction was disbelief. As \nall Americans who lived through the loss of President Kennedy know, the \nloss of a leader at the hands of one of your own, is a great loss to \nbear.\n  But, as this Nation also knows, the best way to honor the loss is to \ncontinue on, and accomplish what has been left undone. It is my hope \nthat Prime Minister Rabin's death will serve a purpose, it will help \nguide Israel and her neighboring nations in the Middle East into a \nlasting peace.\n  A man's life can be ended, Mr. President, but his work, his legacy \ncan live on. Prime Minister Rabin's dedication to peace is alive and \nwell in Israel, and will serve the Israelis well as they work through \nthis very difficult time.\n  There are many moments in a great man's life that we can take time to \nrecall: The award of the Nobel Peace Prize, his life as a soldier, and \nhis life as a leader. Yitzhak Rabin lived a life of service to his \npeople, and the nation of Israel. One only need note the number of \npeople who, at one time his foe, sat beside him in the peace process as \npartners, and who have shared in the mourning of his death.\n  Mr. President, I also would like to add in my support for the work \nthat remains to be done. Shimon Peres, the acting Prime Minister and \npartner in peace with Rabin, having served as his Foreign Minister, \nwill face many challenges in the coming days--may the road ahead rise \nto meet him.\n  Mr. President, before closing I would just note an interesting quote \nin a Washington Times article today from a young Israeli, Eyal \nMandelbaum, age 16:\n\n       We were brought up on the idea that we are a Jewish nation \n     and that never could a Jew kill another Jew . . . in our \n     history, we lost the war against the Romans because we were \n     divided. If we are divided, we lose.\n\n  Mr. President, Mr. Mandelbaum's words carry an important message. I \nhope that it will be heard, because there is a great deal of work that \nremains to be done on the road to peace. Israel and her people are at a \ncritical juncture. I share in the support that has been expressed by \nour President, my colleagues in the Congress, and my fellow Americans, \nto continue to support the Middle East peace process.\n  Mr. President, this will test the strength of peace in the Middle \nEast, but it is my earnest hope that peace, in the end, will win.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to honor the life and legacy of \nPrime Minister Yitzhak Rabin--a great soldier, statesman, and \npeacemaker.\n  I saw the Prime Minister just 10 days ago--at a joyous occasion. It \nwas a ceremony in the U.S. Capitol to celebrate the 3,000th anniversary \nof Jerusalem. It is the city where he was born, where he led the \nIsraeli Army to its greatest victory--and, sadly--where he is now \nburied.\n  The life of Prime Minister Rabin matched the life of Israel. He was \nthe first native-born Israeli Prime Minister. He wanted to be a \nfarmer--but he spent most of his life as a soldier. He fought in \nIsrael's war of independence in 1948. In the six day war, he was the \ngeneral who unified Jerusalem. He was a decorated war hero who helped \nbuild the Israeli Army into one of the best in the world. It had to be. \nFor most of its history, Israel was surrounded by enemies who sought \nnothing less than Israel's destruction.\n  Only a soldier who knew war as he did could ask his country to take \nrisks for peace. Israelis trusted and respected Yitzhak Rabin--and \nenabled him to reach out to those who Israelis had only met across a \nbattlefield. Prime Minister Rabin's courage and perseverance led to the \nhistoric handshakes on the White House lawn between Israel and its \nformer enemies. When he died, the dream of peace was not yet achieved--\nbut it was in sight.\n  I send my deepest sympathy to Prime Minister Rabin's family and to \nthe people of Israel. We in the United States know all too well what \nthey are feeling. The assassination of a leader shakes the nation's \nsense of confidence and security. The pain is all the greater when the \nmurderer is one of their own.\n  But while Yitzhak Rabin's death is a tragedy--his life was a triumph. \nHis legacy is Israel--a country that is strong, free, and confident \nenough to take risks for peace. I will honor his life and legacy by \ncontinuing to stand by Israel as it builds a just and lasting peace \nwith its neighbors.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the names of \nall Senators be added as cosponsors of this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
