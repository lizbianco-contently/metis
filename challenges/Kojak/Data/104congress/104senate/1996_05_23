We remember \nfacing situations that we were certain we could not face, or having to \nface them, could not survive. Yet, by Your providence, we did. And so \nwe begin this new day by praising You for Your sustaining presence, \neven in apparently hopeless situations.\n  We praise You, too, for Your sovereign reminder of Yourself, even \nthrough pain and disaster. We confess, Lord, that for all of our words \nabout problems in our society we are too often quietly and wrongly \nproud of the prosperity of this Nation, feeling that we ourselves are \nsufficient explanations for all the good we see and know. So, Lord God, \nwe praise You and thank You that You use the bounds of our abilities \nand troubles to remind us of the limits of our power. Do not leave us, \nLord, in false beliefs about ourselves, and our roles here, or about \nYou, and Your rightful claims on us.\n  When we are frustrated by injustices we cannot address, remind us, \nLord, of the brevity of this life. And remind us of Your coming \njudgment: of its reality, its certainty, its inevitability, its \nfinality.\n  When we are tempted to be selfish or indifferent to our work, remind \nus of the responsibility You have entrusted to us: to listen, to learn, \nto reflect, to pray, to legislate, to obey.\n  When we are tempted to pride in what we have done--when we see a bill \npassed, a program begun or ended, an initiative completed--and we feel \nsomething of the power of our office, remind us of our complete and \nutter dependence on You.\n  For Your glory, O Lord, restore this land. We know that we are not \nhere finally to fulfill our own desires, or even the desires of our \nconstituents. We know that we are put here to serve You. So, we pray \nthat You would use us--use the business done in this place today, use \nour Government, use our Nation to display Your character, Your glory \nthroughout all Your creation. We ask through Jesus Christ, our Lord. \nAmen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5507-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Senate will immediately resume \nconsideration of Senate Concurrent Resolution 57, the concurrent budget \nresolution, and will begin a series of consecutive rollcall votes on or \nin relation to the pending amendments.\n  Under agreement reached last night, the first series of votes will \ncontinue until 1 p.m. today. There will be no votes, as agreed to, \nbetween the hours of 1 and 2. However, the Senate will proceed with \nanother series of legislative votes beginning at 2 o'clock today.\n  Senators are asked to remain in or around the Senate Chamber \nthroughout these voting sequences in order to facilitate the \ndisposition of amendments as quickly as possible. The first vote in \nboth series will be 15 minutes in length, but all remaining votes will \nbe limited to 10 minutes each. The Senate will complete action on the \nbudget resolution during today's session--hopefully, by late afternoon.\n  I think we have already considered some 34 amendments. We still have, \nI guess, 10 or 12 votes that are likely and probably about 4 hours \nwould be required to complete that.\n  So, if the Members would stay close to the floor and we work hard, I \nknow the managers would appreciate it, and we can get this work done \nbefore late this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. While the acting majority leader is here, I would like to \nclarify a point or two, if I might.\n  First, I think most of us agree that there has been no one who is \nmore cooperative in moving this thing forward than the ranking member \nof the Budget Committee.\n  When I left the floor last night before we adjourned, there had been \na firm announcement that--I thought it was a firm announcement--that we \nwould come in at 10 o'clock this morning, which fit in very well with \nthis Senator's schedule, and I think the schedule of the Senate as a \nwhole. I did not know until after the Senate had adjourned, nor was I \ncontacted, about moving the time from 10 o'clock, as stated by the \nchairman of the committee to the whole Senate half an hour before that.\n  I would simply say that I wish we would follow the customary \nprocedure. I think it is normal to check with the ranking member before \nyou change times after it has been agreed to.\n  Following up on that, I must say that I understood that we could not \nwork\n\n[[Page S5508]]\n\nTuesday night and we could not work Wednesday night, as we had planned \nto do, because of functions. Now we have lost, I think, 2 hours this \nmorning that we could have used constructively.\n  I would simply say that at 4 o'clock this afternoon, for the \ninformation of the whole Senate, there will be a memorial service for \nthe late, great Cece Zorinsky, the wife of the late great Senator from \nNebraska, Senator Edward Zorinsky, in Senate Dirksen G-50, generally \ncalled the Senate auditorium. This Senator will make that affair \nwhether I have to miss votes and abandon my responsibilities here.\n  But I would just inquire at this time, following that memorial \nservice, we have some time between 5 and 6, I believe--and I want to \nattend that--the salute to Senator Dole, which I think has been \narranged by the acting majority leader and the minority leader, Tom \nDaschle. I would just like to inquire. I see the chairman of committee \nis here, also. We have an awful lot of interruptions, and I do not want \nto add to them. The only interruption I am suggesting is that one that \nI intend to carry out that I committed to a long, long time ago.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could just respond briefly, the Senator \nhas enumerated some of the problems we have been trying to deal with, \nand we will try to accommodate as many Senators as we can. We have \nvery, very legitimate things to do. We had the memorial, as you know, \nfor Admiral Boorda. We wanted to do that, and we certainly appreciate \nthe Senator's feeling about Cece Zorinsky. That is what has been \ninvolved. We are just trying to accommodate everybody's schedule. I am \nfinding out more and more. It gets pretty complicated.\n  Your point is well taken. We will continue to try to work with \neverybody, particularly the managers of the bill. We had some \ncomplications, and we did check with the leader. I realize it was late \nlast night, but, again, we are just trying to help everybody.\n  Mr. EXON. You checked with the leader?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, sir. I believe we did.\n  Mr. EXON. I would simply say for the public that you checked with the \nDemocratic leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. The Democrat leader would have properly talked to me. He \ndid not. I will talk to him about that.\n  Mr. LOTT. In his defense, we did it at the last minute, and maybe \nthere just was not enough time or he could not find out. I do not know. \nBut, again, we are just trying to accommodate everybody.\n  You and the chairman have done a great job trying to move this. It \nhas been slow, but there have been a lot of interruptions that we just \ncould not avoid. We want to keep the heat on today so that we can get \nthrough, hopefully, by 4 o'clock. If we could get started voting here \nright quick, maybe we could make it by 4 o'clock or 4:15 p.m. I would \nlike to help you do that.\n  Mr. EXON. Let us seek the miracle.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield just for the \nbriefest of questions, I do not want to delay things, I say to Senator \nDomenici, but could the Senator indicate to us, if we finish these \nblocks of votes on this issue, what is anticipated on the Senate \nschedule beyond this issue?\n  Mr. LOTT. Beyond the budget resolution?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. We are working on that. We will be communicating with the \nDemocratic leadership. Senator Dole will be here later this afternoon. \nWe are looking at several items that could be done. We hope we can get \nthose worked out and do them in a way so that they would not involve \nvotes this afternoon. But the leader will be back. He will be here \nshortly, and he will comment on that.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5507-4", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will now resume consideration of \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 57, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 57) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the U.S. Government for fiscal years \n     1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the concurrent resolution.\n\n       Pending:\n       Harkin (for Specter) amendment No. 4012, to restore funding \n     for education, training, and health programs to a \n     Congressional Budget Office freeze level for fiscal year 1997 \n     through an across the board reduction in Federal \n     administrative costs.\n       Bumpers amendment No. 4014, to eliminate the defense \n     firewalls.\n       Thompson amendment No. 3981, to express the sense of the \n     Senate on the funding levels for the Presidential Election \n     Campaign Fund.\n       Murkowski amendment No. 4015, to prohibit sense of the \n     Senate amendments from being offered to the budget \n     resolution.\n       Simpson (for Kerrey) amendment No. 4016, to express the \n     sense of the Senate on long term entitlement reforms.\n       Chafee/Breaux amendment No. 4018, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Feingold amendment No. 3969, to eliminate the tax cut.\n       Domenici (for McCain) amendment No. 4022, to express the \n     sense of the Senate regarding Spectrum auctions and their \n     effect on the integrity of the budget process.\n       Domenici (for Faircloth) amendment No. 4023, to express the \n     sense of the Senate that any comprehensive legislation sent \n     to the President that balances the budget by a certain date \n     and that includes welfare reform provisions shall also \n     contain to the maximum extent possible a strategy for \n     reducing the rate of out-of-wedlock births and encouraging \n     family formation.\n       Exon (for Roth) amendment No. 4025, to express the sense of \n     the Senate regarding the funding of Amtrak.\n       Domenici amendment No. 4027 (to amendment No. 4012), to \n     adjust the fiscal year 1997 non-defense discretionary \n     allocation to the Appropriation Committee by $5 billion in \n     budget authority and $4 billion in outlays to sustain 1996 \n     post-OCRA policy.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do want to say to my friend, Senator \nExon, and other Senators who might have heard my comments yesterday \nabout when we would meet today, it was not in the form of a unanimous-\nconsent request, but I did intend and say to the Senator that we would \nstart at 10. Actually, by the time the unanimous consent was proposed \nby our acting majority leader, forces beyond the Senator from New \nMexico and Senator Exon went to work on it and it came out 12 o'clock, \nso I am very sorry about that. I had nothing to do with it, and I could \nnot have prevented it, and I am not complaining. It is just that is the \nway it worked out.\n  Mr. President, I understand, and I think Senator Exon agrees, that \nthe next amendment we are going to take up would be the Bumpers \namendment. That is 4014 which would abolish the firewalls.\n  Mr. EXON. I say to my friend, we will get Senator Bumpers here. It \nwas our understanding--and maybe once again we missed communications--\nthat the Senator from New Mexico was going to have an amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are going to set aside for a while Specter-Harkin \nand my second-degree amendment, with the Senator's concurrence.\n  Mr. EXON. Yes. We are setting aside the amendment that we originally \nhad informally intended to bring up. Is that right?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I assume so. I am not sure we had, but nonetheless we \ncan go to anyone that is ready. If Senator Bumpers can get here----\n  Mr. EXON. In view of the fact that the schedule has been changed \nwithout anybody's false intention, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4012, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to modify my second-degree amendment in the form of technical \nchanges to be considered when the Senate considers amendment 4012.\n  Mr. EXON. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I send the modification to the desk.\n\n[[Page S5509]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  The amendment (No. 4012), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 25, line 17, increase the amount by $1,700,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 18, increase the amount by $800,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 16, increase the amount by $300,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 17, increase the amount by $600,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 2, decrease the amount by $3,500,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 3, decrease the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 52, line 14, increase the amount by $5,000,000,000.\n       On page 52, line 15, increase the amount by $1,400,000,000.\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution, on \n     page 52, line 15, the amount is deemed to be \n     $270,923,000,000.

He writes \nand says:\n\n       I thought about you this week when my daughter brought home \n     the enclosed set of rules about Internet use.

It is brief.\n\n       Internet is fun and helpful when you need to research \n     information for reports. However, we are concerned about \n     certain things. Don't use the Internet unless you know what \n     you're doing and where you're going. We not only have to ask \n     Mrs. Yeutter permission to use the Internet but she always \n     asks where we're going. She is in the room when we use the \n     Internet. One or two clicks of the mouse can be powerful. \n     They can take you to places where you shouldn't go. For \n     example, you can get into big trouble by buying stuff you \n     don't want. You can click into things that are inappropriate \n     for kids and adults. Sometimes the words we read are hard to \n     pronounce and understand.\n\n  I thank that second-grader.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We do not need the quorum call because Senator Thompson \nis ready.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. EXON. I withhold my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator withholds his request for a quorum \ncall.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is seeking recognition?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3981\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I call up amendment 3981.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now before the Senate.\n  (The text of the amendment No. 3981 was printed in the Record of May \n20, 1996.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, this amendment reserves the Presidential \nelection campaign fund checkoff system as it is today. The budget \nresolution instructions direct the Finance Committee to terminate the \ncurrent checkoff system which funds the Presidential campaign fund. In \nits place, the Finance Committee is directed to allow taxpayers to make \na voluntary contribution to the fund out of their tax refund, should \nthey have one.\n  This provision in the budget resolution will effectively terminate \nthis post-Watergate reform. It is a system that has worked better than \nany of the rest of our campaign finance system, which is of great \nconcern to many people. I do not think it is wise to single out the \nsystem and the part of it that is working the best and do away with it.\n\n  It has been scandal free. It has made for a more level playing field. \nThree out of the last four challengers to incumbent Presidents have \nwon.\n  The next question is, what do we replace it with if, in fact, this is \nthe demise of the current system? Do we go back to pre-Watergate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will take the same 30 seconds Senator Thompson had.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield time in opposition, and we will be generous \nwith the 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A long 30 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is a vote about whether you want \nto take roughly $300 million over a 4-year period out of financing \npolitical conventions and political campaigns for President of the \nUnited States and apply it to the deficit. The beauty of this proposal \nof the Budget Committee is that it does not end the Presidential \ncheckoff at all. I personally would like to end it. I think it is a \nterrible idea to have taxpayer funding of elections. But the proposal \nof the Budget Committee does not do that. All it says is, when you \ncheck off on your tax return every April 15, you really pay for it. It \nis only $3, and I am confident that those who believe that taxpayer \nfunding of political campaigns is a good idea will be more than happy \nto contribute $3 to this fund.\n  Under the current system the participation in the checkoff has gone \nfrom 29 percent down to 13 percent, and that is when it does not even \ncost the person checking off any money. This is just truth in \nadvertising. If you check off, you pay for it.\n  I close by saying it saves $300 million, adds that to deficit \nreduction, and allows people to really pay for the voluntary checkoff.\n  I hope the Thompson amendment will be defeated.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator want the yeas and nays on this? \nSenator Thompson will accept a voice vote.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I will accept a voice vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. With the provision I could ask for a rollcall vote \nsubsequently.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think you have the right to a rollcall vote in any \nevent after a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will be before the Chair announces the \nresult.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If he does it before the Chair announces the result.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  All in favor say aye. All those opposed, no.\n  The ayes appear to have it.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I call for the yeas and nays.\n  What was the ruling of the Chair? The ayes have it? I withdraw my \nrequest.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. First of all, I have to announce the result.\n  The ayes appear to have it. The ayes do have it.\n  The amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3981) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I apologize, Mr. President, I thought you had already \nruled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the motion to lay on the \ntable is agreed to.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4014\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the yeas and nays have been ordered on \nthis amendment already.\n  This amendment, I say to my colleagues, is one with which you are all \nfamiliar. It is called the defense firewalls. What it says is, no \nmatter how many epidemics, floods, typhoons, earthquakes, no matter how \nmuch of anything you have in this country, you may not take a dollar \nfrom the defense budget with less than 60 votes to put it over in \nsomething that is of a much more dire need.\n  In 1991, and 1992, we had defense firewalls. We took them down in \n1993 and 1994. Nothing untoward happened. I am just offended what this \ndoes. It says that no matter what happens that defense may not be \ntouched. No matter how bloated the defense budget may be, it says you \ncannot take a penny out of defense for any other purpose, no matter \nwhat the emergency is.\n  We are saying we do not trust the Senate; we do not trust the Senate \nwith a 51-vote majority. If you want to take something out of defense, \nyou have to get 60 votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Arkansas has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, since the Senator says this offends him, \nI\n\n[[Page S5511]]\n\nmight say, one man's offense is another man's exhilaration. I think the \nfirewalls are the best thing we have ever done for the defense of our \ncountry. I think we ought to vote the amendment down.\n  Clearly, it is not as the Senator said. The Senate votes on whether \nit wants the defense budget. After you voted it, you cannot take away \nfrom it when you have pressure for domestic spending. That is the \nissue. For typhoons and disasters, it is another issue. The Budget Act \nclearly says you can break the budget for those kinds of items. If you \nhave natural disasters, it does not mean you can take the money from \nthe men and women in the military.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 4014. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.

Mr. President, yesterday the Senate began voting on \namendments to the budget resolution at 9 a.m. and for the next 8\\1/2\\ \nhours, we cast 27 votes and voice-voted 7 other amendments. Out of the \n34 amendments considered, 28 amendments--83 percent--were sense-of-the-\nSenate amendments. And 7 of the 27 rollcall votes--more than one out of \nfour votes were unanimous 100-0.\n  Mr. President, these amendments are not binding; they do not shift a \nsingle dollar from one program to another. They merely allow both \nRepublicans and Democrats to engage in strategies of gamesmanship which \ndeceive the American people about our legislative business.\n  Enough is enough.\n  My amendment simply states that it shall not be in order for the \nSenate to consider sense-of-the-Senate resolutions during debate on the \nbudget resolution.\n  I think we have reached the point where all of us would agree we have \nto abandon these unending, and meaningless, sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions or at least require Senators to state on the floor and tell \nthe American public that these amendments have no binding effect.\n  End this charade on the American public and vote to eliminate these \namendments on budget resolutions.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the Murkowski amendment would create a new \npoint of order that would deprive the minority of its right to amend \nwith the sense-of-the-Senate language. Under the amendment, the \nmajority could report out any sense-of-the-Senate language it wanted, \nbut no Senator could offer a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to change \nthat language or add to it.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the balance of my time. I raise a point \nof order that the pending amendment is not germane and it violates \nsection 305(b) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to waive section 305(b) of the \nBudget Act for the consideration of the Murkowski amendment 4015.\n  Parliamentary inquiry. Do I get an opportunity to speak on my motion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Fellow Senators, I seldom move to violate the Budget \nAct, but it does say if you can get 60 votes you can do it. I believe \nthe time has come to send a signal that we ought not have 40, 50, 60 \nsense-of-the-Senate resolutions on a Budget Act. That is what this will \ndo. This will say we are not going to have them in the future. It \ntreats everybody the same. We will just not have that kind of a \nspectacle on the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. I have 30 seconds. Mr. President, as I understand the \nprocedure, it would require 60 votes to do what the Senator from New \nMexico has just requested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To waive the Budget Act requires 60 votes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to report to all Senators about \nthe ongoing episode of my statement yesterday about the dinner last \nnight and my wife's position. So you will all know, my wife arrives, \nshe wanted to be there very much and she brought a purse. In the purse \nwas a bar of Dial soap. She suggested that maybe I should wash my mouth \nout with Dial soap. I have done that. I hope I have set everything \nstraight. I misstated my wife's position, but it was all in fun, and \nshe did the Dial soap for fun, too.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

I do not expect to persuade a majority, Mr. President. \nThis is an amendment that will have a tremendous impact on the future \nbudget outlays and appropriations of this Congress. As everybody that \nhas examined the facts knows, unless we make changes in these long-term \nentitlement programs, we are simply never either going to get into \nbalance in 7 years, nor are we going to be able to sustain it out in \nthe future.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I oppose the Kerrey amendment. I do this because it \nstates the sense of the Senate that the budget resolution assumes a \nseries of long-term entitlement reforms, including reducing the CPI by \none-half a percentage point each year, which would cut Social Security \nspending by about $38 billion over the next 6 years, and it would \nincrease taxes by about $35 billion over that period.\n  The amendment also calls for increasing the retirement age for \ncivilian and military retirees and Social Security and Medicare \nbeneficiaries, COLA limits for very high civilian and military \npensions, and partial privatization of Social Security.\n  On behalf of Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nI move to table the Kerrey amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Order in the Senate. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I say to the chairman of the committee, \naccording to our scoresheet we have seven amendments left that have \nbeen preagreed to for consideration and votes. Then there are some \nothers that are still outstanding that we still have on the list. Of \nthe seven that are still outstanding, waiting for a vote, and since we \nare cramped for time--I know there are three sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions, one by Senator McCain, one by Senator Faircloth, another \none by Senator Roth, all sense-of-the-Senate resolutions--and since all \nof those Senators voted against considering sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions, I am wondering if they would like to, in good faith, \nwithdraw their sense-of-the-Senate resolutions so that we can \naccomplish what they would like to do in addition to that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Since when is consistency a requirement?\n  Mr. EXON. Senators who have a sense of the Senate outstanding, they, \ntoo, want an expedited procedure. I say this is a good time to do that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will make a trade with the Senator. We will \nreconsider this if you help us and vote for the reconsideration. In the \nfuture there will be no more----\n  Mr. FORD. No.\n  Mr. EXON. In the future? I would like to have done it now.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is what it was.\n  Mr. EXON. If we are going to consider sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions, there are seven amendments that we know about, and three \nof those are sense-of-the-Senate resolutions.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4018\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, could we have order? This is an \namendment that has been worked on very hard by a lot of people. They \ndeserve to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Could we have order so we can move forward? \nThis is the amendment, the Chafee-Breaux amendment, and with 5 minutes \nof debate equally divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. A 10-minute vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten-minute vote.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I ask that everybody please give their attention to the \nproposal we are making.\n\n[[Page S5513]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Could Senators move out of the well, please?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, every Member of this Chamber believes that \nrunning up huge deficits year after year and passing the debt on to our \nchildren is just plain wrong. Every Member of this Chamber knows we \nmust restrain the entitlement programs.\n  The proposal I am offering on behalf of myself, Senator Breaux, and \n19 of our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, balances the budget in \n7 years. It makes significant reforms to entitlement programs. It \nextends the solvency of the Medicare trust fund and provides modest tax \nrelief for working families.\n  These are all sound reasons for supporting it. But there is an \nadditional strong reason I wish to call to your attention. The \nPresident's budget was rejected on nearly a straight party-line vote. \nThe Republican proposal will pass on a straight party-line vote, I \nexpect. But the implementing legislation to the Domenici proposal, the \nimplementing legislation will undoubtedly be vetoed. Thus, its \nentitlement reforms will not become law, just like last year. Our \nbudget, however, has a realistic chance of becoming law. Today with a \n``yes'' vote on the alternative, we can transform talk about deficit \nreduction into action.\n  If we pass the Chafee-Breaux alternative, a balanced budget agreement \ncan be reached this year. If this effort fails, then we will go through \nanother year without solving our Nation's fiscal problems.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, my colleagues, Herb Stein, the economist \nand sometimes humorist, once said, ``If your horse dies, we suggest you \ndismount.'' Mr. President, both parties today are trying to ride a dead \nhorse. We have both been there and done that before. It did not work \nthen. It is not going to work now.\n  If only Democrats vote for the Democratic budget, it will not pass. \nIf only Republicans vote for the Republican plan, it will pass, but it \nis not going to become law. There is another way. Our centrist \ncoalition of over 20 Senators, half Democrat and half Republicans, \nhave, in fact, offered a better way. The American people are watching \nus today and hoping that just once we can come together, meet in the \nmiddle, and get it done.\n  Let me be very honest and acknowledge that our one-half of 1 percent \nadjustment to the Consumer Price Index is politically difficult for \neveryone. But let us all be honest with ourselves and to the American \npeople and acknowledge that it is the right thing to do.\n  If we do nothing, by the year 2012, projected outlays for \nentitlements will consume 100 percent of all the tax revenues we \ncollect leaving nothing for any of the other functions of Government.\n  It is, therefore, very clear which path we must take. The only \nquestion is, will we have the political courage to do the right thing? \nI think that together we can do it.\n  Mr. President, on Monday evening, the senior Senator from Illinois \nasked about the effect of the Chafee-Breaux amendment on student loans. \nI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record prior to the vote \non the amendment a letter from June O'Neill, the Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office which addresses that subject, as well as a \ntable comparing the saving levels in the Chafee-Breaux resolution to \nthe other plans.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 1996.\n     Hon.

Is there anyone who wishes to speak in \nopposition?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield Senator Exon half the time.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I join the chairman of the committee in what \nI think will be a salute to our colleagues from Rhode Island and \nLouisiana for their effort. But I must oppose the amendment. The \nChafee-Breaux budget could cut COLA's, costing a typical Social \nSecurity beneficiary $1,200 over 7 years. Such changes should be done, \nin my opinion, if at all, only in the context of a comprehensive Social \nSecurity reform package. These COLA cuts would also hit EITC, SSI, and \nretired and disabled veterans.\n  The amendment goes after Medicare beneficiaries as well \nunnecessarily. Finally, the Chafee-Breaux budget cuts taxes far more \nthan the President and far more than I think is prudent. For these \nreasons I urge Senators to oppose it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want everyone to know that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico thinks those bipartisan Senators that put this package \ntogether deserve our highest accolades, and obviously, in the scheme of \nthings they performed a very, very important role in providing an \nalternative in a way that may some day become the budget of the United \nStates.\n  But for any member of that coalition to stand up and say since this \nis bipartisan, it is going to become law, let me suggest, sitting over \nin the White House is the President of the United States. The President \nof the United States has had this presented to him. He is not in favor \nof it for the very simple reason that it cuts Social Security. It does \nit in a different way by adjusting the CPI, and it may be something \nthat eventually some commission might say we ought to do that.\n  But, quite frankly, I urge this amendment be defeated unless those \nSenators who vote for it truly want to take on the President of the \nUnited States on the Social Security issue 5 months before an election. \nI think it is doomed. Because I think it is doomed, it seems to me we \nought to adopt the underlying bill and not this one. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I stand today to support many of the goals \nof the Chafee-Breaux amendment to the Budget Act of 1997, but to voice \nconcern regarding how to pay for those goals.\n  On the top of the list of essential tax reforms that this amendment \naddresses is a reduction in the capital gains tax. This tax is \nfundamentally unfair because it is not linked to inflation and taxes \npeople on phantom income. No other nation in the world has a tax on \ncapital gains and at least a reduction in this tax is in order. Because \na clear majority of Americans own their own homes this tax relief lifts \na huge burden off the backs of the middle class. It also allows \nbusinesses to buy and sell property and equipment based on their need \nand not on the Tax Code. It frees money trapped in deteriorating assets \nto be used to invest in new and improved equipment and expand the \neconomy. This in turn benefits all Americans.\n  Another essential tax reform is eliminating the estate and \ninheritance tax. These taxes are very destructive to the family. It \nforces family businesses to be sold and increases the pain already felt \nby the loss of a loved one. The ability for each generation to pass on \nit's family heritage should not be blocked by the Federal Government's \ngrab for money. These taxes must be eliminated.\n  Middle class tax relief was promised by the President in 1992 and by \nthe Congress in 1994. The President vetoed it repeatedly last year, but \nit is just as important now as it was then. It is\n\n[[Page S5514]]\n\ntime to cut taxes for families with children. In the last 30 years it \nhas become increasingly more expensive to raise children. The typical \nchild costs upwards of a quarter of a million dollars to raise and send \nto college. A $250 per child family tax credit would go a long way to \nrelieving some of the stress of raising children in the typical \nAmerican family. Since the average family pays 38.2 percent of its \nincome toward taxes, surely we can agree to give some of it back to \nthose that need it the most.\n  All of these reforms are needed and necessary and I support them \nwithout reservation. However, I am concerned about the way the Breaux-\nChafee amendment pays for these reforms. By tinkering with Federal \nemployees retirement plans, we are in essense breaking our word to \nthem. I believe that the Government should keep its commitment to these \nhard-working folks and not change the rules this late in the game. For \nthis reason, I will cast my vote in opposition to the Breaux-Chafee \namendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I commend Senators Chafee and Breaux for \nthe work they did in putting together a true budget compromise. These \ntwo distinguished Senators successfully coordinated a group of 11 \nDemocrats and 11 Republicans in a good-faith effort to balance our \nNation's budget in a fair and responsible way. And, their work should \nnot go unnoticed.\n  As the people of this country know all too well, Congress has been \nwrangling with the budget issue for more than a year. The debate has \nbeen bitter and, at times, downright rancorous. But, if we step back \nand look beyond all the huffing and puffing, we find that Congress and \nthe President have learned we can balance the budget. It is not an \nimpossible mission. And it is not an idea that must get bogged down \nalong party lines.\n  We all agree the budget must be balanced. We all understand the need \nto get our fiscal house in order. The difficult part, however, is \nmaking sure the budget plan uses good common sense and reflects \nAmerica's core values--the belief we should ensure our quality of life, \neducate our children, and maintain adequate health security for our \nparents and disabled.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate rejected the centrist budget today. \nHowever, the awareness of this plan is just building, and I am pleased \nto note support is growing for this plan. I believe the Chafee-Breaux \nbudget lays the groundwork and sets out the parameters that could be \nused to strike a final compromise on a comprehensive 6-year balanced \nbudget plan.\n  The centrist budget plan is not perfect. It requires serious savings \nin programs I believe in and my friends and family depend on. It asks \neach and every one of us to give a little in order balance the budget. \nIt cuts Medicare, Medicaid; it curtails welfare programs; and it cuts \ntaxes all a little bit more than I would like. But the proposals in \nthis plan are workable. It calls for realistic savings. Savings that \ncan be achieved without risking the safety and security of our friends \nand families--without stripping away the safety net that catches our \nmost needy.\n  Mr. President, let me just say, last year I was opposed to cutting \nback Medicaid because it provides health care for our poorest children \nand it ensures quality nursing home standards for our parents. But, \nafter talking to health care experts in Washington State, I concluded \nmy home State could still serve our most vulnerable populations as long \nas we do not have drastic cuts to Medicaid. I am willing to concede \nthat point, and I know now that if we all give a little, we can reach \ncompromise.\n  The key to any balanced budget proposal is making sure the numbers \nfit the policy decisions. In other words, we cannot just arbitrarily \nslash important programs simply to balance the budget. We need to make \nsure we can reform the programs in a way that saves money while still \nserving the public. The Chafee-Breaux plan will accomplish that goal--\nit proposes realistic numbers that can be achieved.\n  Given this, let me say that I will work to make sure the Chafee-\nBreaux plan is balanced and reflects America's priorities. While I \nsupport the overall effort to put aside partisan differences and find \ncommon ground, there are very important matters we cannot afford to \noverlook.\n  I just want to remind my colleagues and our State legislators who \nseem to be clamoring for more State control of Medicaid and Welfare, \nthat our children's needs do not change with shifting political winds.\n  We need a balanced budget. Saying that is the easy part. But we must \ncompromise to get one, and that is the hard part. The American people \nclearly are willing to sacrifice to make this happen. And, I voted \ntoday in support of a bipartisan budget agreement that asks for shared \nsacrifice. The numbers in the Breaux-Chafee proposal are reasonable. \nHow the proposal gets to the numbers still raises large concerns for \nme, and should for all of us.\n  On welfare, there will be cuts. People will see reduced services from \ntheir Government. There will be new requirements on adults to do more \nin order to get help, and if this breaks down the disincentives in our \ncurrent welfare system, then I support it. That is one reason I voted \nfor this amendment.\n  But how we achieve savings is a very important question, as is \nwhether we want to penalize people. And I think this amendment and \nevery other welfare proposal goes the wrong way when it comes to \nremoving national standards for a basic guarantee of service.\n  According to CBO, removing entitlement status for cash assistance \ndoes not save money in this proposal. I can understand saving money and \nmaking programs run more efficiently. I can see why people in this \ncountry want to impose work requirements on those getting public \nassistance. I just do not understand why children have to suffer \nbecause their parents are poor.\n  The Breaux-Chafee proposal cuts food stamps, SSI eligibility, and \nmany other things that will make our children's lives harder, day to \nday. I do not think this is wise. But in the interest of getting a \nbudget agreement, and in the spirit of shared sacrifice, some of these \nproposals are reasonable.\n  But, block-granting and capping welfare payments to States is not \nreasonable. When the economy in Wisconsin or Washington turns sour, we \nwill see how fast the States want help from the Federal Treasury. \nRemoving the guarantee to a basic hand-up in need--this is not \nreasonable, and Congress should not be doing it in this budget or any \nother.\n  On Medicaid, the Breaux-Chafee plan will change early health \ntreatment for kids under EPSDT, which will hinder our long-term \npreventative health efforts for children. We will be less likely to \nstop easy ailments before they become serious and costly illnesses. We \nknow this is going in. The trick will be to find a way to make sure \nthat does not happen.\n  There are many other concerns I have with this section of the budget. \nThe overall funding level looks reasonable, but we need to watch \nMedicaid for its impact on children.\n  I am also deeply concerned about the proposals included in this \nbudget that would target our federal and postal employees. These people \nwho serve our country have already been hit hard through Government \nshutdowns and delayed COLA's. This budget also adjusts contributions \nand collections from the CSRS and FERS retirement plans, and it \nincrease retirement ages--improperly placing a large burden on the \nbacks of Federal workers. We must end the continued 3-month delay in \nretiree COLA's and honor the contract our Nation formed with our valued \nFederal workers.\n  Mr. President, I will not forget the concerns I just raised. As we \nreform these programs, we must remember what works and what needs to be \nchanged. Last year, we learned the American people do not want reckless \nchanges. They want wise decisionmaking. They want us to craft budgets \nthat reflect their priorities. And I am confident that with good common \nsense we can meet their expectations.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will oppose the Breaux-Chafee substitute. \nI want to commend those who have been involved in that effort and \nsupport the objective they seek. Senator Chafee and Senator Breaux \ndeserve our praise for showing the country that we do not need partisan \nbickering to reach a budget agreement. I would very much like to have \nbeen able to join their ranks and pass a budget on a bipartisan basis.\n\n[[Page S5515]]\n\n  I wish more of our Republican friends would have joined me in \nsupporting the President's balanced budget. It is a sad commentary that \nnot one Member of the other party could work with us on a plan which \nhas proven to cut the deficit in half while keeping our economy moving \nat a robust clip. The President and the Democrats have crafted a budget \nwhich eliminates the deficit and works for middle-class Americans.\n  Mr. President, I wish I could join my friends. I have discussed this \nproposal with a number of its proponents, but Mr. President, I cannot \nsign on to a plan at this time which arbitrarily changes the Consumer \nPrice Index or its application to benefits that are by law adjusted for \ninflation.\n  As you know, the CPI is one of the country's most widely watched \neconomic indices. The CPI, which measures the changes in the cost of \nliving, is determined by economists at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nThese analysts are continually adjusting the CPI and the methodology \nthey employ to ascertain it.\n  There are a number of prominent economists--including Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan--who tell us the CPI overstates the actual cost \nof living and is therefore an inaccurate estimate for the rate of \ninflation. They call for the CPI to be adjusted downward. I know the \nproponents of this budget are responding to these calls when they \narbitrarily lower the CPI and derive more than $100 billion to spend on \ntax breaks or to apply to deficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, I think this action--which will affect millions of \nAmerican taxpayers, Social Security beneficiaries, and other retirees--\nis premature.\n  As changing the CPI will affect millions of Americans, we should \nstudy it carefully before we enact any change in the way it is \ncalculated as part of a deficit reduction plan. Perhaps at some point \nin the future, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will determine that the \nCPI exaggerates the cost of living and adjust the index downward. Or \nperhaps the Congress, after rigorous study, will thoroughly debate a \nlegislative change in the CPI and subsequently enact a change. As you \nknow, Mr. President, the Finance Committee has established a \nnonpartisan commission to study the accuracy and methodology of the \nConsumer Price Index. This Commission is due to release its final \nreport this summer. We should wait at least until the Commission has \nreported its findings before legislating changes to this index.\n  At least until then, Mr. President, legislation to change the CPI is \nnot needed and would be extremely unwise. We can and should balance the \nbudget without changing the CPI. The President has shown us that it is \npossible to balance the budget by the year 2002 without changing the \nCPI. I voted for his balanced budget proposal as did many of the \nproponents of this change in the CPI.\n\n  I also have considerable concerns about the level and impact of cuts \nin the Breaux-Chafee budget from the level needed to maintain current \nMedicare and Medicaid services, as well as the discretionary programs \nthat are so vital to investment in our future, ranging from education \nto infrastructure, from environmental protection to high-technology \nresearch and development.\n  I am also very concerned about the size of the Medicare cuts in the \nChafee-Breaux proposal which would reduce this essential program by \n$154 billion by 2002. These cuts will result in inadequate health care, \nmore expensive health care, or no care at all. Although cuts this large \ncould be implemented in a number of ways, and all of those would have a \nconsiderable negative impact because of the magnitude, the Chafee-\nBreaux proponents have advocated doubling Medicare premiums for middle \nand upper income seniors, requiring most participants to bear the \nburden of paying 31.5 percent of the part B program's costs. Forcing \nthe elderly to pay an unfair share of deficit reduction is the wrong \napproach.\n  And all for those reasons, I regretfully concluded I cannot join in \nsupporting this budget alternative, and I must oppose the Chafee-Breaux \nsubstitute.\n  I do hold out hope, however, Mr. President, that those of us who \nsupported the President's budget, which balances the budget by the year \n2002, will be able to work with the proponents of this budget \nalternative to secure final Senate action that will be far preferable \nfor our Nation's sake than the budget the Republican majority will ram \nthrough both Houses of Congress this week.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the Chafee-Breaux amendment as a \nsubstitute for the underlying budget offered by the majority.\n  The Chafee-Breaux amendment is a bipartisan effort to find a \ncompromise to the budget dilemma. It provides a more moderate reduction \nin discretionary spending and includes a national guarantee of coverage \nin Medicaid for the elderly, the disabled, and disadvantaged children \nand pregnant women.\n  I do not agree with all aspects of the Chafee-Breaux amendment, \nhowever. I do not agree with the 0.5-percent adjustment to the Consumer \nPrice Index--0.3 percent in the outyears. I do not believe that such a \nchange should be made in the calculation of the CPI without careful \nstudy and analysis showing a disparity between the CPI and the rate of \ninflation and a resulting recommendation from the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics that Congress make such a change. Also, I do not agree with \nthe Chafee-Breaux defense discretionary spending level which is $11 \nbillion more than the President requested. I am also concerned by the \nChafee-Breaux's assumption of a 40-percent cap on direct student loans.\n  While I support the Chafee-Breaux amendment as a substitute for the \nmajority's budget, I would need to see these concerns addressed before \nvoting for it on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The pending question is amendment No. 3969.\n  Senator Feingold is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, our amendment offers a clear choice: tax \ncuts or deficit reduction. It strikes the $122 billion tax cut and \napplies every penny to deficit reduction. I think that is our highest \neconomic priority. This is not just a partisan issue. The Republican \nand Democratic plans have had this flaw. The bipartisan plan has this \nflaw. This has been endorsed by the Concord Coalition.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Feingold amendment strikes $122 \nbillion in family tax credit from this resolution. Therefore, it will \nbe a bill without any special emphasis for the families across America. \nI believe this\n\n[[Page S5516]]\n\nshould be tabled, and we should proceed through and have a budget that \ndoes something for American families, along with reducing the deficit. \nI believe it should be tabled.\n  Therefore, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this resolution abuses reconciliation--\nextending use in an entirely inappropriate way. In sanctioning that \nabuse, the Chair has made a faulty judgment that could have a vast \nimpact on the Senate.\n  The Chair has ruled that reconciliation can be used solely to \nincrease spending, solely to cut taxes, solely to increase the deficit.\n  That is an absolutely unacceptable distortion of the reconciliation \nprocess; expanded use threatens all Senators' rights to debate and \namend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President and fellow Senators, I think the Chair's \nruling should be sustained. Senator Daschle's point of order was based \non his view that the budget resolution cannot contain separate \nreconciliation instructions, that there can be just one. The \nParliamentarian ruled that you could have multiple reconciliation bills \ndirected by a budget resolution.\n  I think the Parliamentarian is right and we should support him. \nTherefore, I urge that you vote ``no'' on this appeal--vote ``aye'' on \nthis appeal. Excuse me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the decision of the \nChair stand as the judgment of the Senate?

Senators Faircloth and Moynihan have an amendment, No. \n4023. It has been cleared on both sides. There is no need for a \nrollcall vote.\n  I yield any time I might have in opposition.\n  Mr. EXON. We yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the Senate will now \nproceed to consider amendment No. 4023.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMoynihan be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, let me say how pleased I am to offer \nthis amendment along with the senior Senator from New York. It was \nSenator Moynihan's ground-breaking research 30 years ago that first \ndrew attention to a situation that has gone from a developing trend to \nwhat I consider to be a real crisis.\n  This amendment simply states that it is the sense of the Senate that \nif welfare reform is included in balanced budget legislation, that \nthose provisions contain a strategy to reduce the incidence of out of \nwedlock births as well as encourage family formation.\n  I strongly believe that welfare reform that does not seek to reverse \nthe rising rate of out-of-wedlock births, will not break the cycle of \nwelfare dependency that is consuming more and more of our young people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4023) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4037\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, for Senator Biden, I send an amendment to \nthe desk and ask unanimous consent the amendment be considered, agreed \nto, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table. This has been \ncleared on both sides.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand Senator Hatch is a \ncosponsor of that amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, Senator Hatch is a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A RESOLUTION REGARDING THE SENATE'S SUPPORT FOR \n                   FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:\n       (1) Our Federal, State and local law enforcement officers \n     provide essential services that preserve and protect our \n     freedoms and security;\n\n[[Page S5517]]\n\n       (2) Law enforcement officers deserve our appreciation and \n     support;\n       (3) Law enforcement officers and agencies are under \n     increasing attacks, both to their physical safety and to \n     their reputations;\n       (4) Federal, State and local law enforcement efforts need \n     increased financial commitment from the Federal Government \n     for funding and financial assistance and not the slashing of \n     our commitment to law enforcement if they are to carry out \n     their efforts to combat violent crime;\n       (5) The President's Fiscal Year 1996 budget requested an \n     increase of 14.8% for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \n     10% for United States Attorneys, and $4 milllion for \n     Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces; while this \n     Congress has increased funding for the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation by 10.8%, 8.4% for United States Attorneys, and \n     a cut of $15 million for Organized Crime Drug Enforcement \n     Task Forces;\n       (6) On May 16, 1996, the House of Representatives has \n     nonetheless voted to slash $300 million from the President's \n     $5 billion budget request for the Violent Crime Reduction \n     Trust Fund for Fiscal Year 1997 in H. Con. Res. 178; and\n       (7) The Violent Crime reduction Trust Fund as adopted by \n     the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 \n     fully funds the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act \n     of 1994 without adding to the federal budget deficit.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions and the functional totals underlying this \n     resolution assume the Federal Government's commitment to fund \n     Federal law enforcement programs and programs to assist State \n     and local efforts shall be maintained and funding for the \n     Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund shall not be cut as the \n     resolution adopted by the House of Representatives would \n     require.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it seems to be ``deja vu all over again'' \nto quote Yogi Berra--last year we had to fight an effort on the House \nside to slash funds for the crime law trust fund, and it looks like we \nare going to have to do the same this year.\n  The amendment which I propose today gives the entire Senate the \nopportunity to express its support for full funding of the violent \ncrime control trust fund enacted in the 1994 crime law. Let me point \nout that the Senate budget resolution offered by Chairman Domenici does \nthe right thing on the trust fund--Chairman Domenici fully funds the \nPresident's $5 billion request for the trust fund for 1997. This \nrecognizes that the $5 billion for the trust fund is already paid for \nby the reduction of the Federal work force by 272,000 employees.\n  The problem is that the budget resolution proposed by the Republican \nleadership of the House of Representatives which passed just last week \nby a narrow, partisan vote of 226 to 195--221 Republicans voted for it, \n4 against; 190 Democrats voted against, 5 voted for it--cut the \nPresident's $5 billion request for the trust fund by $300 million.\n  This is less than the $900 million cut that had been proposed by the \nRepublican leadership of the House--but this is still a significant cut \nthat I must oppose.\n  If the House proposed cut of $300 million is allowed to stand there \ncan be only one result--fewer Federal dollars will be available to \ncombat crime. As my colleagues know, the general numbers of the budget \nresolution do not specify which programs will be cut--but it is clear \nthat some programs must be cut.\n  What specifically might this mean? Let us just review the law \nenforcement efforts funded by the crime law trust fund:\n  Federal prosecutors, $55 million;\n  FBI, $40 million; DEA, $200 million; border enforcement and deporting \naliens who break the law, $525 million; violence against women efforts \nincluding more police and prosecutors and more shelters for battered \nwomen, $254 million; $1 billion for constructing prisons and \nreimbursing States for imprisoning criminal aliens; and an additional \n$2.6 billion to aid State and local law enforcement--whether it is \nthrough the 100,000 Cops Program I favor or the block grant favored by \nthe other side, I do not believe that any Senator favors a smaller \ntotal for State and local law enforcement.\n  We all know there is no free lunch--so if there is a cut in the total \nfor the trust fund, at least some of the pieces of the trust fund must \nbe cut. For that reason, I call upon the entire Senate to go on record \nas opposing the House cut to the President's $5 billion request for the \ncrime law trust fund.\n  But, let me also point out that even if we pass the resolution I am \noffering today, and even if the House Republican majority ultimately \nagrees to fully fund the President's request for the trust fund--even \nif all that happens, a massive shortfall in the President's request for \ncrime fighting resources will still have been made by the budget \nresolutions adopted by the Republican majority.\n  To quickly review the facts on the total ``administration of \njustice'' account--compare what the Senate and House budget resolutions \noffer for the non-trust fund portion of the ``administration of \njustice'' account that pays for the entire Justice Department--FBI, \nDEA, prisons, everything--and the courts:\n\n                                                                Billion\nPresident request.................................................$18.5\nHouse budget resolution............................................17,4\nSenate budget resolution...........................................16.7\n\n  These are massive cuts--the House proposes to slash the President's \nrequest for crime fighting dollars by $1.1 billion; the Senate proposes \na cut $1.8 billion.\n  What happened to all this ``tough on crime'' rhetoric we have been \nhearing from all sides? It seems that the President held up his end of \nthe bargain--requesting the largest-ever annual budget for the FBI, \nDEA, U.S. attorneys, and help for State and local prisons and police. \nBut, the Congress controlled by the other party has been ``AWOL--absent \nwithout law enforcement.''\n  Unless there is a major change to restore these funds when the House \nand Senate budget conferees meet--we can expect but one result when the \nappropriators develop their bills later this year. Massive cuts in \nFederal law enforcement because the appropriators will have no choice--\nif we shrink the budget pie for law enforcement, there is no way to \nprovide all the slices. It is just that simple.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment I am \noffering on behalf of myself, and Senators Leahy, Kohl, and Hatch.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join as a sponsor in this amendment to \nthe budget resolution. Last year I offered a similar amendment that was \nadopted by the Senate. Unfortunately, Congress did not follow through \non our commitment. Last year the budget for fighting crime was never \nfinalized. It was only recently that we arrived at a budget resolution \nfor a fiscal year now more than half over. This had a devastating \nimpact on anticrime grant programs and should not be repeated.\n  I am glad to join with Senator Biden in this resolution to preserve \nthe violent crime reduction trust fund. Our purpose is to reaffirm our \ncommitment and appreciation for Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement and the outstanding job that they do under the most \ndifficult and dangerous circumstances, and to reject the House's \nattempts drastically to cut our financial support for their efforts.\n  Over the last few years there has been a lot of public debate and \ncomment about the activities of law enforcement and the rhetoric that \nhas been used to disparage and malign these dedicated public servants \nand the law enforcement agencies in which they serve. I submit that law \nenforcement deserves better. We owe these men and women our respect, \nappreciation and public, moral and financial support.\n  The gruesome fact is that there are increasing threats against the \nsafety and lives of law enforcement officers--the bombing of offices in \nTexas only yesterday, the Oklahoma City bombing, reports of attacks \nagainst park rangers, Forest Service employees, Treasury employees and \nothers. The dedicated men and women in Federal, State, and local \ngovernment and law enforcement work long hours for limited financial \nreward in order to serve the public, protect us and preserve our \nfreedom.\n  It is in this context that I am concerned that the House of \nRepresentatives has again voted to cut law enforcement resources. The \nHouse voted on May 16 to cut $300 million from the President's request \nfor the violent crime reduction trust fund for fiscal year 1997. Last \nyear the House voted to offset certain tax reduction proposals by \ncutting $5 billion from the violent crime reduction trust fund. \nInvading the violent crime reduction trust fund makes it impossible to \npay for the law enforcement and crime prevention programs of the \nViolent Crime Control Act of 1994. This is bad policy and will\n\n[[Page S5518]]\n\nlead to weakened law enforcement. I hope and trust that our Senate \ncolleagues will reject this cut in funding to Federal law enforcement \nand Federal assistance to State and local efforts.\n  When we passed the Violet Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act in \n1994, we paid for its programs. A trust fund was established from the \ndownsizing of the Federal Government by some 250,000 jobs. The violent \ncrime reduction trust fund contains funds dedicated to law enforcement \nand crime prevention programs, and is intended in large part to provide \nFederal financial assistance to critical Federal, State and local \nneeds. Since passage of the Violent Crime Control Act, the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice has been doing a tremendous job getting these \nresources to the field. I commend the Associate Attorney General John \nSchmidt and Chief Joe Brann, who direct the community policing \nprograms, for their quick work. I know that funding to assist local law \nenforcement to hire additional officers went out almost immediately \nbased on a simple, one-page application. Vermont received commitments \nof over $3 million toward 64 new officers in 34 jurisdictions, for \nexample.\n  The House would have us turn our backs on law enforcement and \nprevention programs and the commitments we made in the Violent Crime \nControl Act. Law enforcement and community-based programs cannot be \nkept on a string like a yo-yo if they are to plan and implement crime \ncontrol and prevention programs. Funding for important programs \nimplementing the Violence Against Women Act and our rural crime \ninitiatives should not be delayed or cut again. What we need to do is \nto follow through on our commitments, not to breach them and violate \nour pledge to law enforcement, State and local government and the \nAmerican people. Invading trust funds dedicated to crime control \npurposes is no way to proceed and no way to restore people's trust and \nrespect for government and the commitments that it makes.\n  I will continue to work with the Attorney General and my Senate \ncolleagues to reject the ill-advised House action. I will work to \npreserve the violent crime reduction trust fund so that we can fulfil \nthe promise of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and \nour commitment to do all that we can to reduce violent crime in our \nlocal communities. This is not the time to undercut our support for \nFederal law enforcement or the assistance provided State and local law \nenforcement. We offer this amendment as an embodiment of the Senate's \nresolve against the House-passed cuts to the violent crime reduction \ntrust fund and reductions in funding of Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement. The House-passed cuts to law enforcement funding are not \nthe way to show our support for those women and men whom we ask to \nprotect public safety and preserve our precious freedoms.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4037) was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4027 to amendment No. 4012\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I call up the second-degree amendment \nNo. 4027 to the Harkin-Specter amendment 4012.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, then, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment 4027 as an amendment to 4012.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will take my 30 seconds in support of \nthe amendment. This would take the place of the Specter-Harkin \namendment which had added $2.7 billion, more or less, to one function \nof the Government. Instead of doing that, the Senator from New Mexico \nadds $4 billion to the overall budget and it can be used for education \nand the other purposes within it. This can amount to a nondefense \ndiscretionary freeze spending level and we have arrived at that as a \nfreeze off the 1996 consolidated rescissions bill. Once one had it all \nfigured out, this is the amount of money required to make it a freeze.\n  Mr. EXON. I will yield our 30 seconds to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Senator Domenici is proposing a second-degree amendment \nwhich increases funding for education, job training and health by $2 \nbillion and funding for nondefense discretionary programs by $5 billion \noverall. The Domenici amendment is not all the funding we need for the \nprograms including title I and Head Start and I would propose the \noptions in my amendment; however I do support this amendment and its \nmodification because it is an important step in the right direction. I \ndo support the amendment.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, is there time available in opposition to \nthe amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There should have been. I yield 30 seconds to the \nSenator to speak in opposition.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am strongly opposed to this amendment. I \nwant my colleagues to look at some simple numbers. Last year in the \nbudget resolution for fiscal year 1996 we adopted a budget that called \nfor spending on discretionary nondefense accounts in fiscal year 1997 \nof $255 billion. The budget before us now calls for discretionary \nspending for the same year of $267 billion, so that we have increased \nnondefense discretionary in this budget $12 billion above last year's \nbudget resolution. If we adopt this amendment we will be at $271 \nbillion, and we will have increased nondefense discretionary spending \nby $16.7 billion above the level we called for in last year's budget \nresolution.\n  Either we are serious about controlling spending or we are not. It is \nsomething we are capable of controlling. I strongly oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be granted 30 \nseconds. The Senator from Texas spoke for a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think he would give it to me anyway. I should not say \nthat about how long he took.\n  Fellow Republicans, I want to speak to you first. The estimates on \ntax receipts are up $15 billion over what is in this budget resolution. \nWhat I am trying to do, so you will all know, is to make sure we do not \nend up like we did last year. I have talked to John Kasich, chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, and they want us to pass this so we can \nfigure out exactly where we are, rather than end up precisely where we \nwere last year. If you want to end up that way, you vote with Senator \nGramm. If you want to give us a chance to get by without last year, you \nvote for my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 10 seconds for \nthe Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senate will please \ncome to order.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, all I want to say is this is still below \nthe CBO freeze. Period.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question now occurs on agreeing to \nAmendment No. 4012, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 4012), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think we have an understanding that \nSenator Roth will proceed with his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Before Senator Roth starts, I ask the chairman of the \ncommittee, we have how many amendments left that we are going to vote \non? As I understand it, we have Byrd that requires a vote, Roth that \nrequires a vote, and McCain, and final passage.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Correct. That is what I understand.\n  Mr. EXON. What we have agreed to earlier, we are trying to get out of \nhere for at least one-half hour, between 4 to 4:30. It seems to me that \nwe could probably have final passage by no later than 5:15.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think that is probably correct, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. EXON. Is that the assumption under which we are working, then? We \nhave one more vote at least, and then go to a half-hour recess?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Are we going to have a half-hour recess?\n  Mr. EXON. That is what I agreed to with both the majority leader and \nthe minority leader.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right. If our leader agreed it to, I am all for it. \nI asked the Senator to ask him. That is fine. We are going to vote on \nRoth, and then recess for 30 minutes. All right.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4025\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the Roth resolution simply states that \nCongress would give Amtrak a secure and reliable source of funding for \ncapital expenditures. The rail trust fund would be funded by \ntransferring revenues from the 0.5-cent excise tax that is currently \ngoing into the mass transit account to a newly created rail trust fund.\n  While Amtrak would have $2.8 billion for capital expenditure over 5 \nyears, the existing $5.4 billion surplus in the mass transit account--\nthe mass transit would continue to have billions of dollars in excess \nof its anticipated appropriations.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Grassley wants to speak in opposition. I yield \nto Senator Grassley 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This budget resolution, all 50 hours of debate and all \nthe many hundreds of pages, is about balancing the budget, which is \nlong overdue and it is something that we should do. The Roth amendment, \nthe next amendment, establishes a whole new entitlement, something we \nshould not do.\n  OMB expresses concern that this new funding source for Amtrak is \nwrong and it takes money from your local mass transit for Amtrak, \nsomething we should not do. So why threaten the solvency of our mass \ntransit accounts? Balance the budget. No more entitlements.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Delaware.\n  As my colleagues will recall, I offered a similar amendment last year \non the budget resolution. Unfortunately, we lost by one vote. I have \nbeen pressing the concept of a dedicated revenue source for Amtrak for \nquite some time now and I welcome the opportunity to voice this support \nagain.\n  Mr. President, the resolution before us is a sense of the Senate \nresolution that Congress should provide Amtrak with the revenue from \none-half penny of the Federal gas tax that is now directed to mass \ntransit.\n  This revenue will provide Amtrak with a steady, dedicated revenue \nsource. This is very important if Amtrak is to be able to make long-\nterm planning decisions that will enable it to become financially \nviable in the future.\n  Amtrak is a key component of this Nation's transportation system. In \nmy home State of Montana, many residents rely on Amtrak's service to \ntravel to and from the State. Amtrak means jobs. It means increased \ntourism. And it means increased access and mobility for Montanans.\n  And for any of you who have ever traveled on the Empire Builder \nthrough the northern tier of my State, you know the tremendous beauty \nalong the Montana hi-line.\n  Some will argue that redirecting the one-half penny from mass transit \nto Amtrak will adversely affect mass transit programs. That is simply \nnot true. There is an over $5.4 billion cash surplus in excess of \nobligations in the mass transit account. That is more than enough to \nfund mass transit programs for the foreseeable future.\n  Mr. President, rural transportation programs seem to be constantly \nunder attack. Rural areas are struggling. We continue to see a decline \nin rural transportation options--funding for rural air service, rural \ntransit and highway programs is declining. This amendment is one small \nstep forward in turning back this trend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 4025.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I correct my statement? I understand that all we \nhave agreed to--we do not have to go in recess. The next vote will \noccur at 4:30.\n  Mr. EXON. After the Roth vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The next vote after this one will occur at 4:30. I ask \nunanimous consent for that.\n\n[[Page S5520]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Mr. President, today's action by the House of \nRepresentatives removes one of the Republican's obstacles to successful \naction on the minimum wage. An overwhelming majority of House \nRepublicans, 81 percent, tried to kill the increase by attaching a \n``poison pill'' to exempt all workers of small business, but 43 \ncourageous Republicans stood up to the extremists in their party and \nspit out the poison pill.\n  As the price for accepting an increase, House Republicans tried to \ndeny any minimum wage at all for millions of men and women who work for \nsmall business. It was a Republican sneak attack on the minimum wage, \nand it did not deserve to pass. The minimum wage is supposed to be a \nfloor. It is wrong for Republicans to try to turn that floor into a \ntrap door.\n  The Republican philosophy seems to be the only good minimum wage is \nno minimum wage. It is bad enough that in today's economy, America has \nto compete with sweatshop labor overseas. If the Republicans have their \nway, American workers and American employers will have to compete with \nsweatshop labor right here in our own backyard. How very Republican. \nEvery previous Congress that dealt with the minimum wage voted to \nexpand coverage and give the benefits of the law's protection to more \nand more Americans. Now is no time to roll back that progress. It is \ntime to end the Republican war on hard-working American families, and I \nam confident the Senate will also reject any Republican scheme to roll \nback the minimum wage. No one who works for a living should have to \nlive in poverty.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, within an hour or so, we will be adjourning \nand out for the Memorial Day recess. But when we return, it is my plan \nto mark up legislation in the Public Lands and Forestry Subcommittee \nthat I chair, dealing with forest health, the health of the forests of \nour country.\n  For well over a decade now, we have studied the issue of how to \nmanage our forests in light of the recurrence of wild storm style \nforest fires that continue to devastate our forests across the Pacific \nNorthwest and across the Southwest every time we get into a dry period, \nespecially the kind the Southwest, New Mexico and Arizona and Colorado, \nare experiencing at this moment.\n  What we have found, Mr. President, is that in our great ability to \nput out fires, we have allowed to build up on our forest floors, \nmassive amounts of fuel in the form of dead and dying trees as a result \nof bug kill, as a result of fungus, or simply as a result of the \noverpopulation of our trees and therefore their death because of lack \nof moisture. In my State of Idaho and across the inland West, where \nbefore man came to that region we had tremendously healthy forests and \npopulations of trees of 40 or 50 or 60 trees per acre, now, because of \nour ability to put out fires, we are finding that we have 300 and 400 \ntrees per acre. Of course, there is only so much moisture. When we get \ninto a drought cycle, there is not enough moisture to keep all of those \ntrees alive.\n  What we are finding is that before we had this tremendous ability to \nput out fires, fires would come along on a relatively regular basis, \ncaused by lightning strikes or actually caused by native Americans who \nsaw the useful tool of fire. It would burn at a low rate, at a low \npace, burn off the shrubbery and the brush, allow the mature trees to \nstand and allow young trees that had reached a certain age to survive. \nThat kept the forests, primarily of the West, in a very productive and \nrather pastoral form.\n  But that changed and it has changed dramatically over the last 50 \nyears, as we learned to put out fires. But we did not go in and do what \nMother Nature was doing, and that was to thin trees or to take down the \nunderbrush. As a result of that, we have had a massive fuel loading in \nmany of the forests of the West and Southwest.\n  Mr. President, you and I have witnessed, in the last several months, \nfires in New Mexico and Arizona and now in Colorado that, by our forest \nscientists'\n\n[[Page S5521]]\n\nestimation, are the most intense and hottest wild fires we have ever \nexperienced. As a result, Mother Nature is not served well. These fires \ndevastate the forests, leaving not even a snag standing, destroy the \necosystems, and scald the soil in a way there is little to no recovery \nfor a period of years and years. Those are not normal fires. They are \nabnormal fires, as a result of massive fuel buildup.\n  I was visiting with the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, \nabout the fires in his State. One of those areas that was burned had \nbeen devastated by beetles. Better than 50 percent of the stand was \ndead. Yet, because of current law and because of certain interest \ngroups, we were not allowed to go in and thin and clean and allow new \ngrowth to start. As a result of that, fire swept through there and \ndestroyed the whole area.\n  S. 391, the bill that I have worked for over a year to craft, \nvisiting with scientists, holding hearings, and making sure we build a \nstrong bipartisan effort, better known as forest health legislation, \nthe kind I want to mark up as soon as we get back here in early June \nand bring it to the floor for a debate, hopefully it can become law and \nbecome the public policy and a new management tool for our U.S. Forest \nService.\n  It would allow the Forest Service to go in and look at these lands \nand under current environmental law assure they have the flexibility to \ngo in and thin and remove brush and actually even use fire in a \nselective way, to assure that our forests can regain their health and \nregain their vitality in an environmental way and not be swept away and \ndestroyed, as the forests we have seen under fire in the last few weeks \nthroughout the Southwest. Of course, in the State of Colorado last \nweek, when man got in the way of the fire, or man's dwellings, they, \ntoo, were swept away, as was true in the State of Idaho in 1994 when we \nsaw wildfires, as a result of our forest health, that were beyond man's \nrecognition.\n  So I hope when we come back, we can join the wisdom of the Spokesman-\nReview newspaper that editorialized yesterday in my area, in the inland \nWest, saying that we ought to pass S. 395, we ought to make good public \npolicy, and we ought to allow, once again, strong multiple-use \nenvironmental standards to return to our public forests and to the \nmanagement of those public forests. So it is my wish we mark up S. 395 \nand move it to become public law.\n  I hope in early June we can have it here on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate for a good debate and passage.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5520-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5521-S5551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the concurrent \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I voted for the amendment that Mr. Domenici \noffered earlier. It was a good amendment. But, unlike the Domenici \namendment which scattershots funds for many popular programs, my \namendment targets $1.5 billion for the safe operation of our parks and \n$5 billion for the cleanup of our water and construction of our sewer \nsystems, which are being neglected and run down. Our water is dirty; \nour parks are rundown. This is a\n\n[[Page S5522]]\n\ndisgrace. There is a $25 billion backlog in clean water and sewer needs \nalone in this country, and the Domenici amendment does not answer this \ngrowing crisis.\n  Mr. President, this amendment to the budget resolution, which I offer \non behalf of myself and Senators Bingaman and Lautenberg, will provide \nan additional $5 billion for rural water and sewer programs and $1.5 \nbillion for our national park system. These funds are critically \nnecessary to protect the most basic of services to America.\n  All across America, millions of residents in rural communities \ncontinue to suffer from inadequate water and sewer services. This need \nis a direct link to health, sanitation, and environmental problems in \nall States. This need must be addressed to provide economic vitality to \nthese regions, to allow new job opportunities, increase the tax base, \nand improve the quality of life for millions of Americans.\n  Water and sewer loan programs have a proven track record because of \ntheir nearly zero-default rate, the best of all Federal loan programs. \nThe grant portion of these programs allows impoverished communities and \nrural areas to provide their citizens the most basic of human services. \nThese are services that most Americans take for granted every day.\n  A recent Federal study listed my own State of West Virginia among the \nfive worst States in the Nation in terms of the availability of safe \ndrinking water. There are some places in my State where the condition \nof the water supply is appalling, and where people are relying on water \nsupplies from systems operating in violation of safe drinking water \nstandards, or wells that have been contaminated. In certain West \nVirginia communities, on some days, tap water runs black, but families, \nwith no other water source, are forced to bathe and launder in it.\n  As we approach the 21st Century, we must take steps to ensure that \nvast regions of our Nation will not be relegated to the living \nstandards of a Third World Nation.\n  Mr. President, the estimate is that there are 3 million households in \nthe United States in need of safe, clean drinking water. The estimated \ncost to provide this water is about $10 billion. It is estimated that \n$3.5 billion is necessary for drinking water needs deemed ``critical'', \nand the balance for ``serious'' requirements. At current levels, only \napproximately $3.5 billion would be provided over the next six years \ntoward providing clean drinking water for our people.\n  An equally pressing requirement, Mr. President, is the need to \nprovide basic sewer facilities for small communities. Millions of \nAmericans in rural areas and small communities live without adequate \nsewer infrastructure. The overall cost estimates to meet these needs \nexceed $20 billion. At least $7.3 billion should be provided over the \nnext 6 years to meet some of the most critical needs. My amendment will \nnot fund all of these backlogs, but it will help address the critical \nrequirement for the most basic of amenities that each of us takes for \ngranted every day.\n  The second part of this amendment provides an additional $1.5 billion \nfor day-to-day operations in our national parks. These funds will be \nused for the services Americans ought to be provided when they visit \ntheir national parks. Within the amount, $400 million is for \nrestoration of the Everglades ecosystem in South Florida. The need to \nprotect the fragile and decaying resources of the Everglades has been \nsupported in recent years by both sides of the aisle.\n  The National Park Service has been entrusted with responsibility for \n368 different historic, cultural, scenic, natural resource, and \nrecreation sites. These locations represent a mosaic of the most \nAmerican of resources, from the historic sites of our country's birth--\nIndependence Hall, Minute Man, Valley Forge, and Yorktown--to the \ncelebration of our cultural heritage at places such as Aztec Ruins, \nFort McHenry, and the Natchez Trace Parkway, to the scenic beauty and \nsplendor of places like Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, Big Bend, the \nEverglades, Crater Lake, Mount Rushmore, Acadia, and Redwood National \nParks.\n  But the fate of these parks is dependent on providing the necessary \nresources to protect the parks--to serve the visitors; to maintain the \nbuildings, roads, and campgrounds; and to house the employees who must \nlive within the national parks. As dollars are frozen or reduced, the \nparks must still pay for increased costs for people, supplies, \nequipment, and other tools necessary to keep the parks open. Failure to \nprovide the funding for these activities means fewer park rangers, \ndeferred maintenance, closed facilities and trails, and possibly \ndangerous conditions for park visitors.\n\n  The start of the summer vacation season, is upon us. It is at this \ntime of year that Americans load the family into the car and depart for \na visit to the parks. Providing operating dollars for the National Park \nService will help keep all sites open, and will contribute to a safer \nexperience for all Americans.\n  What does it mean to have inadequate resources to maintain the \nfacilities which support visitors to the parks? Let me provide an \nexample--if the funding isn't available to pay the people who drive the \ntrash trucks and clean the restrooms in the park campgrounds, trash and \nunsanitary conditions accumulate. Build-ups of trash can attract bears, \nwhich then create a safety hazard. The presence of a safety hazard \nwould cause the Park Service to close the campground--thereby denying \nvisitors the opportunity to camp in a park they might have driven 1,000 \nmiles in order to visit.\n  In fiscal year 1996, Members from both sides of the aisle urged \nadequate funding for our national parks. If the necessary allowances \nare not provided to address our park requirements, the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee will have little choice but to turn to \nother programs in order to find the resources necessary to protect our \nparks. This could mean reductions in programs such as low-income \nweatherization assistance, Forest Service timber sales, Smithsonian and \nother museum operations, payments in lieu of taxes, and operations of \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  Mr. President, many Members of Congress have worked on behalf of \ntheir constituents to see that park facilities are well-maintained and \ntaken care of properly. When water and sewer systems fail, they have \nsought money to fix the problem. When visitor facilities were necessary \nfor new parks, the Appropriations Committee has provided the resources \nto build campgrounds, visitor centers, and rehabilitate historic \nbuildings. But once the construction is over, and the ribbon-cutting \nceremonies completed, there is still a need to operate these facilities \non a day-to-day basis.\n  In order to pay for its increase in spending, my amendment provides \nfor corresponding increases in revenues over the 6-year period of this \nbudget resolution. These revenues can be attained by closing corporate \nloopholes and by changes in tax expenditures.\n  I encourage the support of Senators for my amendment. A vote against \nthis amendment is a vote against the Statue of Liberty, Yellowstone, \nIndependence Hall, the Grand Canyon, the Everglades, and all of the \nother 360 plus national park units. A vote against my amendment is a \nvote against the most basic amenities which a civilized country can \nprovide for its people, clean, safe drinking water and adequate sewage \nfacilities.\n  I urge the adoption of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. There is \ntime in opposition. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, relative to the budget resolution, the \nByrd amendment would increase taxes and spending by $6.5 billion. I \nremind everyone, there is nothing in the resolution which would cause a \nshutdown of the national parks. Our resolution assumes full funding for \nthe parks, for rural water service, and for sewer programs.\n  In addition, might I say, even if you think you are voting for the \nspecific targeted items, this money will go to the appropriations to be \nused by the Appropriations Committee where it sees fit. We already \nadded $5 billion in budget authority and $4 billion in outlays. I think \nthat is fair enough for today, and we ought to defeat this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe\n\n[[Page S5523]]\n\nRecord certain newspaper articles, together with a breakdown of the \nDomenici amendment, which was at the table when we voted on that \namendment. I voted for it, as I say. I would like to have a breakdown \nin there to show what those moneys will go for, purported.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Parks Offer More Muck, Less Help--Weather, Budgets Hit National Sites\n\n       Fallen trees are left piled by the sides of roads. \n     Campgrounds are being closed. Beaches are full of debris and \n     river muck. And there aren't as many lectures on how a geyser \n     erupts.\n       Tight budgets are bringing hard times to America's national \n     parks and recreational areas, and a severe winter and \n     flooding in many parts of the country are making this spring \n     even worse as park officials prepared for the summer vacation \n     rush.\n       Some of the millions of visitors to the national parks this \n     year may be in for a shock as they get reduced services or \n     find fewer park rangers, reduced hours of operation or parks \n     still cluttered with fallen trees and washed-out trails from \n     winter storms and floods.\n       ``Historically, we've cut the lawns every week and made the \n     place trim and neat,'' said Bob Kirby, assistant \n     superintendent of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation \n     Area in eastern Pennsylvania. ``Today you see the grass in \n     most places is a foot high. The picnic areas and playgrounds \n     are completely, with one exception, filled with river \n     flotsam, sticks and mud.''\n       The park, along 45 miles of the Delaware River, attracts \n     nearly 5 million visitors a year, many of them escaping the \n     urban sprawl from New York to Philadelphia. While costs of \n     operation have jumped 13 percent, the park's budget has \n     stayed the same.\n       Federal officials and private watchdog groups say \n     deterioration and money shortages are imperiling parks across \n     the country as superintendents have had to make harsh choices \n     on how to meet expenses. Often it means reducing the number \n     of rangers and other workers.\n       ``Everybody likes ribbon cutting. Nobody wants to fix the \n     roof,'' said Roger Kennedy, director of the National Park \n     Service.\n       This summer some of those problems will begin to have an \n     impact on park visitors, whose numbers are expected to exceed \n     270 million this year.\n       ``Visitors are going to find trails closed. They're going \n     to find portions of parks closed, campgrounds \n     closed.'' Kennedy said. ``They're going to see signs that \n     say `Don't drink the water' in some places. They're going \n     to find there are no ranger talks. The little things that \n     make these places parklike''.\n       Problems are everywhere.\n       At Yellowstone in Wyoming, tow museums have been closed. A \n     shortage of park rangers means visitors are left largely on \n     their own in the massive park's northern sector. Lectures at \n     the Norris Geyser Basin Museum on how a geyser works are a \n     thing of the past.\n       At Delaware Water Gap, workers are struggling to fix the \n     damaged toilets inundated by floodwaters, and only a last-\n     minute infusion of $43,000 prevented the firing of the park's \n     lifeguards.\n       To save money, 2 of the 10 campsites at the Great Smoky \n     Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee won't \n     open this summer. There are three seasonal rangers instead of \n     10, and 17 fewer maintenance workers.\n       Fewer rangers are at the Sequoia National Park in \n     California, and the season has been shortened. At another \n     great northern California park, Yosemite, and at many other \n     parks and recreational areas around the country, trash won't \n     be picked up or toilets cleaned as frequently.\n       ``We can no longer do more with less,'' said Mike Finley, \n     Yellowstone's superintendent. Each year, he complained, the \n     park is expected to ``absorb increasing costs and maintain \n     the same levels of . . . services'' for a growing number of \n     visitors.\n       Similar sentiments are expressed daily by park officials \n     and rangers across the country.\n       With Congress mindful of the parks' popularity, the \n     National Park Service has avoided the deep budget cutting \n     faced by some other Interior Department agencies. The park \n     service received $1.08 billion, about 1 percent more than \n     last year, to operate its parks and will get an additional \n     $46 million for storm and flood damage repairs.\n       But park supporters maintain that more money is needed.\n       The budget ``doesn't keep up with inflation,'' said Paul \n     Pritchard, president of the National Parks and Conservation \n     Association, a private watchdog group. ``It's not one region. \n     It's the whole national park system that is being neglected.\n       The association Tuesday released the findings of a poll it \n     commissioned that showed the public by a 4-to-1 margin would \n     not oppose increasing federal funding for operation of \n     national parks.\n       Park superintendents have had to make tough choices. At \n     most parks the number of seasonal workers--both rangers \n     and maintenance workers--has had to be reduced. Many parks \n     have cut back in garbage collection and toilet cleaning. \n     Fewer park rangers are faced with a growing number of \n     visitors and a wider array of law enforcement problems, \n     leaving less time for tours and educational lectures.\n       ``All the parks are struggling,'' said Elaine Sevy, \n     National Park Service spokeswoman in Washington. She said \n     more than 900 authorized jobs are unfilled throughout the \n     system because there's no money to pay for them.\n\n\n                      Parks Hit in the Pocketbook\n\n       A sampling of conditions at national parks, monuments and \n     recreational areas around the country:\n       Great Smoky Mountains in North Carolina-Tennessee--Two of \n     10 campsites and adjoining picnic areas are closed and won't \n     open this summer. Both remote, they are the 92-site Look Rock \n     Campground in Tennessee and the 46-site Balsam Mountain \n     Campground in North Carolina. The number of seasonal \n     maintenance workers has been cut from 65 to 48, the number of \n     seasonal rangers from 10 to three. One of the three visitors \n     centers has been turned over to a private group to operate. \n     Cleanup from extensive winter storm damage has been \n     postponed. Some will not be completed this summer, although \n     $1.4 million recently was allocated to the effort.\n       Yellowstone in Wyoming--The Norris Campground will be \n     closed in the northern part of the park, eliminating 116 of \n     2,100 campsites. Two museums in the same area--Norris Geyser \n     Basin Museum and the Museum of the National Park Rangers--are \n     closed. Visitors can travel in the northern area but have \n     neither tours nor ranger briefings available. Seasonal \n     employees will work shorter schedules, and garbage collection \n     is less frequent. A four-hour hike to the petrified forest on \n     Specimen Ridge is being discontinued. A ban on overtime has \n     delayed snowplowing, keeping some roads blocked later than \n     normal.\n       Yosemite in California--A pothole-spotted road leading to \n     Yosemite's Lower Pines Campground is unlikely to be repaired \n     this year. Work to renovate restrooms and upgrade the park's \n     amphitheater has been put off. Garbage collection and toilet \n     cleaning have been cut back. Officials hope to repair flood \n     damage that closed part of the park. Hours have been cut back \n     for tours and at visitor centers. Fewer rangers patrol \n     mountainous trails, but spokesman Scott Gedlman said \n     essential services--law enforcement, clean drinking water, \n     emergency medical aid--are being maintained.\n       Delaware Water Gap Recreation Area in Pennsylvania--The \n     park has been hit by ``a double whammy,'' said Bob Kirby, \n     assistant superintendent--first the budget crunch, then \n     severe floods that put under water much of the 40-mile \n     stretch along the Delaware River in eastern Pennsylvania. Its \n     budget wasn't increased, but the park's costs jumped 13 \n     percent. Kirby said extensive storm damage to beaches and \n     trails along the river must be repaired. Grass isn't being \n     cut as often, and flooding left debris and mud on the beaches \n     and inundated public restroom facilities and picnic areas.\n       Sequola in California--The tight budget means fewer park \n     rangers and a shorter summer season. Park spokeswoman Malinee \n     Crapsey said many of the recreational facilities may open a \n     week later than usual. Rangers will conduct fewer tours. Park \n     officials also are turning more toward private groups to help \n     sponsor programs.\n       Cape Hatteras Seashore in North Carolina--Trash collection \n     has been cut in half, but some slack has been taken up by \n     private volunteer groups. Park spokesman Bob Woody said \n     visitor services are being maintained, and the park has more \n     educational programs than last year. But tourists trying to \n     call the Hatteras ranger station near the famed striped \n     Hatteras Lighthouse often have to talk to an answering \n     machine because rangers are busy elsewhere.\n       Acadia in Maine--Eight or nine fewer summer employees are \n     being hired, and fewer nature briefings and tours are being \n     conducted by park rangers. But most visitors ``will not \n     notice any reduction in service,'' said Len Bobinchock, the \n     park's deputy superintendent. ``These programs are so \n     popular, we've had to put a limit on the number of people who \n     can participate anyway.'' Hours are not being changed.\n       Crater of the Moon in Idaho--Park officials say they \n     haven't been hit very hard. The area features a broad swath \n     of lava formations from old volcanoes, and some walking \n     trails have buckled and need to be repaired. The monument is \n     building a scenic motoring loop, and some areas may be closed \n     by the construction.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                It's a Fact: Rural America Still Exists\n\n                  (By Larry Rader, Program Specialist)\n\n         [From West Virginia Rural Water Magazine--Spring 1996]\n\n       It was a dreary, rainy February day, the kind you only find \n     at the bottom of a deep hollow and I was standing in mud up \n     to my ankles looking at a dilapidated water treatment plant. \n     I had been in this same scene a hundred times over the past \n     ten years, but this time there was something different. I had \n     company and a lot of it. Jim Anderson of RECD (I'mIIA to \n     those of us who can't get used to the name change) had called \n     me the previous week and requested that I take part in a fact \n     finding tour of McDowell County, West Virginia on February \n     22, 1996. Jim is RECD's state project officer for Water 2000. \n     The Water 2000 initiative is a combined effort of federal, \n     state and local agencies committed to providing potable \n     drinking to all\n\n[[Page S5524]]\n\n     rural residents of the United States by the year 2000.\n       The McDowell fact finding tour was initiated by Senator \n     Robert C. Byrd and planned by Bobby Lewis, State Director of \n     RECD. Mr. Lewis is from McDowell county and rightly felt that \n     this area of the state typifies many of the problems facing \n     not only West Virginia, but rural areas across the country. \n     Senator Byrd is also from a rural area of Raleigh County and \n     realizes that the view from Washington sometimes becomes a \n     little clearer when taken from the bottom of a hollow in the \n     mud and rain. The tour consisted of both staff members and \n     elected officials federal, state and local. Those who needed \n     help and those who could provide it, all in the same hollow, \n     same rain, same mud and same good spirits. It was an \n     opportunity to reaffirm the existence of rural America and \n     its needs. McDowell County PSD operates a mish-mash of twelve \n     dilapidated systems abandoned by various coal companies over \n     the years. System personnel must travel 120 miles each day \n     just to check the small treatment plants. And forget water \n     loss percentages! Just keeping water in the decaying lines is \n     a triumph. It is a minute by minute struggle most of us could \n     never envision.\n       Water quality and quantity in the old systems are \n     inconsistent at best, however, right smack in the middle of \n     this drinking water nightmare sets two water treatment \n     facilities which would be the pride of any community. The new \n     facilities at Coalwood and Caretta, both treatment and \n     distribution, were designed by Stafford Consultants and \n     completed in 1994. Almost overnight 350 households had access \n     to something most people take for granted, a dependable \n     supply of safe drinking water. Although the Coalwood and \n     Caretta systems were funded primarily through RECD in the \n     form of loans and grants, McDowell PSD has applied to ARC, \n     AML, Small Cities Block Grants as well as RECD, all of \n     whom were represented on that wet day in an attempt to \n     upgrade the remaining 12 communities.\n       Rural people have always been willing to share in the cost \n     of providing essential services. However, they must have \n     access to agencies, both federal and state, which understand \n     their problems and are sympathetic to the uniqueness of their \n     situation.\n       Beginning in the 1950's RECD for instance, has provided \n     over $203,000,000 in low interest loans and grants to over \n     200 water and waste water systems statewide and is either \n     wholly or partially responsible for most of the rural systems \n     built in West Virginia since that time. But you occasionally \n     need to remind other people that not only does the need still \n     exist, so do the possibilities.\n       We are very proud that WVRWA was included in the February \n     22, 1996 Fact Finding Tour of McDowell County. We are always \n     ready to plead the case for rural America and it gave me the \n     opportunity to visit with people who can and do make a \n     difference. As always, I am extremely proud of the people at \n     McDowell PSD. Jeannie, Ralph, Bill, Randy, the other \n     employees along with that PSD Board of Directors and the \n     McDowell County Commission are proof that it can work in \n     rural areas.

Cryser)\n\n       It would take $162.3 million to clean up and provide \n     potable water to approximately 79,000 West Virginians, \n     according to a study conducted by a federal agency.\n       It would take another $405.7 million to meet the worsening, \n     but not yet critical, drinking water supply situation of \n     about 476,000 West Virginians.\n       And amid all of these problems, the federal government is \n     cutting federal grants and loans for water projects. West \n     Virginia will lose approximately $5 million in loans and $3.2 \n     million in grants for water and sewer projects in 1996, \n     according to Bobby Lewis, state director for Rural Economic \n     and Community Development.\n       ``The cuts overall are devastating to a state like West \n     Virginia that has always been at the bottom of the list for \n     funding for projects,'' Lewis said.\n       These figures come from the West Virginia Water 2000 \n     assessment, part of the Clinton administration's high-\n     priority Water 2000 initiative. The program is aimed at \n     providing safe drinking water to the 1 million Americans \n     without water piped directly into their homes.\n       Clay, Barbour, Boone, Fayette and Lincoln counties are \n     ranked as the counties with the worst drinking-water problems \n     in the state, Lewis said. Most of the problems stem from \n     untreated water or people using wells that are \n     semicontaminated or not treatable, he said.\n       The study was conducted by the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture and state and local government agencies. The West \n     Virginia Rural Water Association and the Regional Planning \n     and Development Council helped to develop a list of more than \n     200,000 households with water that is undrinkable.\n       ``There are still people out there we didn't get on our \n     list,'' Lewis said.\n       He estimates that at least half of West Virginians have \n     water systems that pump out water that should not be \n     consumed.\n       ``Some places you can hardly bathe in it,'' he said.\n       Lewis said the study will help draw attention to deplorable \n     water conditions in the state. The project could also help \n     qualify some areas for USDA-funded projects under the Water \n     2000 project guidelines.\n       ``There is a serious need for some type of assistance for \n     these small communities in rural West Virginia,'' he said, \n     ``If you don't have water, you can't attract industry or \n     people.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\nWhere the Commonplace Is Prized--Quarter of West Virginians Lack Access \n                           to Municipal Water\n\n                         (By Michael Janofsky)\n\n       For nearly a century, most residents of this tumbledown \n     mountain hamlet have been drawing their drinking water from a \n     common well on a hillside just above the town's 70 houses.\n       Three years ago state officials found that the water was \n     contaminated with pollutants, and issued an order to boil it \n     before drinking.\n       Like most other people in Campbelltown, Carroll Barlow says \n     it is high time that she and her neighbors are finally hooked \n     up to the municipal water system in Marlinton, less than a \n     mile away. But neither the state nor the local governments \n     can afford to pay for the pipes or the pumps to carry the \n     water up the valley.\n       ``I hope I live long enough to get safe water in this \n     house,'' said Ms. Barlow, 55, who says she has to clean her \n     sinks and toilet twice a day to deal with rust-colored stains \n     that the water from the well leaves behind.\n       State officials say no medical problems can be traced to \n     the water, but Ms. Barlos is not taking any chances. She uses \n     the well water only for washing and buys drinking water in \n     69-cent gallon jugs at the Foodland grocery store in \n     Marlinton.\n       From small communities like Campbelltown to isolated \n     hollows with no names, access to reliable supplies of clean \n     drinking water has long been a problem in West Virginia. The \n     state's rugged geography, coupled with the endemic poverty of \n     rural Appalachia, has strictly limited the ability of both \n     local and state government to extend water lines everywhere. \n     Neither the state nor the Federal Government is required to \n     connect isolated residents to existing water systems, and, \n     given the nation's tight-budget environment, money to build \n     water or sewage systems to our spur economic development in \n     rural areas is likely to become increasingly scarce.\n       ``We just can't do everything,'' said W.D. Smith, a \n     director of the Appalachian Regional Commission, a Federal \n     agency that helps promote economic development but is a \n     perennial target of budget-cutters in Congress.\n       Mr. Smith said that with so many communities seeking \n     financing for new systems, only those that can demonstrate an \n     unusually urgent need or immediate economic benefit will \n     succeed.\n       ``We've got a third-world situation here,'' he said. ``I've \n     seen human suffering, old people, people coming to me in \n     tears. But I always have to ask them, `What's so unusual \n     about your situation?' It's not enough anymore just to say \n     they don't have any water.''\n       A recent study by the Agriculture Department concluded that \n     more than a million people living in rural sections around \n     the country, including large parts of the Mississippi Delta \n     and areas along the Mexican border, did not have clean \n     drinking water piped into their homes. But experts say no \n     other state has so large a percentage of its population \n     unserved by municipal systems as West Virginia. By the \n     state's own estimate, almost a quarter of its 1.8 million \n     people have no access to municipal water, and 40 percent are \n     not served by public sewerage.\n       West Virginians who do not get municipal water rely mostly \n     on wells; in places, a single well serves an entire \n     community. Water drawn from these wells must in some cases be \n     boiled or chemically treated to remove impurities like \n     contaminants that seep into underground water reservoirs from \n     abandoned coal mines. People living near active mines are \n     especially vulnerable to pollution; even subtle shifts in \n     rock formations can unloose new contaminants into the \n     aquifers that supply well water, or even destroy the \n     aquifers.\n       Despite Senator Robert C. Byrd's legendary ability to \n     funnel Federal money home for West Virginia's highway system \n     and other programs, officials say state agencies have only \n     recently focused on water and sewerage needs to bolster \n     economic development. Last year, voters approved a $300 \n     million bond issue for water and sewerage.\n       ``More people are being served now,'' said Amy Swann, a \n     division director at West Virginia's Public Service \n     Commission. ``But there will always be people who won't be \n     served. It's just too expensive to spend $1\n\n[[Page S5525]]\n\n     million to construct a water line to hollows where 12 people \n     live.''\n       State officials say water problems exist in all 55 of West \n     Virginia's counties but most acutely in the rugged eastern \n     half of the state. Here, amid thick forests of maple, elm and \n     oak trees, gurgling rivers and dazzling scenic overlooks, \n     dozens of small communities, some with fewer than 100 \n     residences, straddle narrow mountain roads that once served \n     rich coal mines and timber fields.\n       The coal and timber industries are long past their peak, \n     but many of the children and grandchildren of the workers \n     remain, drawing from the same wells or roadside springs, some \n     in use for more than 60 years. Most of the people are now too \n     old, too poor or too proud to move.\n       In Marlinton itself, the latest problem is that officials \n     do not have the $3 million needed to carry water from the \n     town's water plant to the new hospital, which was built on a \n     hill to keep it high and dry above the flood-prone banks of \n     the Greenbrier River.\n       For now, the hospital, scheduled to open this summer, will \n     draw its water from the well that serves the local school, \n     across the street. ``We're struggling to find the funding,'' \n     said Douglas Dunbrack, the Marlinton Mayor, who doubts that \n     the well water supply will be adequate for the hospital, \n     intended to serve some 9,000 people in eastern West Virginia. \n     ``We need a big-time grant, but there's just no money \n     available.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              Water Supply Unsafe for Many West Virginians\n\n       The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), through its \n     Rural Economic and Community Development (RECD) offices in \n     West Virginia, has completed a four-month assessment of the \n     state's most pressing safe drinking water system investment \n     needs. The assessment is part of the Clinton administration's \n     high priority Water 2000 initiative, which, according to RECD \n     state Director Bobby Lewis, ``aims to deliver safe drinking \n     water to the estimated one million rural Americans currently \n     living without water piped directly into their homes.''\n       In a related development, the U.S. Congress recently sent \n     to President Clinton a 1996 appropriations bill that produces \n     a 30 percent funding cut below 1995 levels for safe drinking \n     water and sanitary sewer project construction.\n       West Virginia's Water 2000 assessment results show that the \n     state's rural towns have come a long way in solving their \n     safe drinking water problems over the past quarter century, \n     but still have a lot of gaps to fill. According to the \n     results, the 50 West Virginia communities with the most \n     pressing needs require a combined investment of $162.3 \n     million to serve approximately 79,000 people who now have \n     serious drinking water quality or quantity problems. \n     Additionally, some $405.7 million will be required to meet \n     the worsening but not yet critical drinking water supply \n     situation of some 476,000 West Virginians in 443 communities.\n       The Water 2000 assessment was conducted by USDA's West \n     Virginia-based personnel, together with state and local \n     government agencies, and representatives of two non-profit \n     organizations--the West Virginia Rural Water Association and \n     the Regional Planning and Development councils.\n       Historically, the USDA's water and sewer loan and grant \n     program has been the primary funding source for rural \n     communities seeking to improve their public health, job \n     development and fire protection situations by constructing \n     and improving water and sewer systems. The USDA's Rural \n     Utilities Service (RUS), as part of Water 2000, has begun \n     to better target its loans and grants to lower income, \n     remote rural communities with the nation's most pressing \n     drinking water quality and quantity problems. The USDA's \n     water and sewer loan program, in its 55-year history, has \n     loaned out $14 billion, and lost only $14 million--a loss \n     rate of one-tenth of one percent.\n       Wally Beyer, Washington-based administrator of the RUS, \n     said that West Virginia water and sewer projects received \n     $16.8 million in loans and $10.5 million in grants in fiscal \n     year (FY) 1995 from this federal source. Approximately 60 \n     percent of those funds were invested in safe drinking water \n     projects. According to Beyer, based on funding cuts recently \n     approved by Congress and signed into law, West Virginia will \n     lose approximately $5 million in loans and $3.2 million in \n     grants for such projects in FY 1996, which started on October \n     1.\n       ``These cuts will hurt rural West Virginia towns that need \n     to invest in very basic community drinking water improvements \n     for their residents.'' Beyer said. ``At the level of funding \n     the Congress has provided for 1996, it will take at least 14 \n     years to solve West Virginia's most critical rural drinking \n     water problems, and at least 35 years to make all of the \n     improvements identified in the just-completed Water 2000 \n     assessment.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   Rural Water Needs To Be Addressed\n\n       A U.S. Department of Agriculture official will be in \n     McDowell County today, examining rural drinking water needs, \n     Sen. Robert C. Byrd's office reported.\n       John Romano, USDA assistant administrator for rural \n     utilities service, will be joined in his tour by local \n     leaders including Bobby Lewis, the USDA's state director for \n     Rural Economic and Community Development.\n       ``In follow-up to a recent study conducted by the USDA on \n     the nation's water needs, which ranked West Virginia among \n     the five states in greatest need of safe drinking water, I \n     urged Agriculture Department officials to take a fact-finding \n     trip to West Virginia,'' Byrd said in a prepared statement.\n       Byrd said current funding for the rural development portion \n     of the USDA cannot keep up with the demand for safe drinking \n     water, yet it is one of the programs suffering in the battle \n     for a balanced federal budget.\n       ``It is important for federal officials to understand the \n     challenge we are certain to face if our nation continues to \n     neglect our infrastructure investment deficit,'' Byrd said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Domenici Amendment\n\n       Increase non-defense discretionary spending limits in FY \n     1997 by: $5 billion in budget authority, $4.1 billion in \n     outlays.\n       Changes (in millions) the following areas in FY 1997:\n\n                                                                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       Budget           \n                                                     Authority   Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScience, Space.....................................        200       100\nEnergy.............................................        900       200\nAgriculture........................................        300       200\nCommerce and Housing...............................        400       300\nTransportation.....................................      1,500       700\nComm. and Reg.

Mr. President, I cannot support this budget resolution for \n1997 fiscal year.\n  While I am encouraged that the majority was able to moderate their \nbalanced budget plan from last year because of stronger economic \nestimates from the Congressional Budget Office, this budget resolution \nstill falls short. It cuts Medicare and Medicaid more than is necessary \nto achieve a balanced budget. And it cuts education and environment \nfunding while increasing defense spending--which is unacceptable in \ntoday's post-cold war world.\n  This Republican budget cuts Medicare by $167 billion, $50 billion \nmore than the President's budget over the next 6 years. These cuts \nwould reduce Medicare spending growth per-beneficiary far below \nprojected private sector growth rates. I am disappointed that the \nmajority persists in cutting a program that is vital to 83,000 \nVermonters, 12 percent of whom live below the poverty level.\n\n[[Page S5526]]\n\n  The Senate Republican budget resolution ignores the fact that it is \nnot just Medicare costs that are rising. All health care costs are \nrising. And by just cutting Medicare--and Medicaid for that matter--a \nhuge cost-shift of medical expenses will result and make sure that all \nVermonters pay more for health care.\n  The Republican Medicare cuts are short sighted. Simply cutting \nMedicare does not make its problems go away. To reduce Medicare costs, \nwe must reduce health care costs throughout the system, which can only \nbe achieved by true health care reform. I look forward to sitting down \nat a table with Members from both sides of the aisle and hammering out \na plan to deal with the issue of comprehensive health care reform. But \nin the meantime, simply cutting Medicare is not the answer.\n  This Republican budget includes $72 billion in Medicaid cuts, $18 \nbillion more in cuts than the President's budget over the next 6 years. \nThe resolution does not describe how these savings would be achieved, \nbut it appears the Republicans still intend to block grant Medicaid. \nThis will simply blow a hole in the safety net for our most neediest \ncitizens.\n  This Republican budget also proposes capping the Federal direct \nstudent loan program at 20 percent of loan volume. Since schools \nparticipating in the direct loan program currently handle 40 percent of \nloan volume, many will be forced out of the program. The resolution \nonly increases overall education funding by $3 billion over a freeze \nbaseline over the next 6 years--hardly an investment in the one of the \nNation's most important resources.\n  Unfortunately, the majority refused to moderate its cuts in \nprotecting the environment during debate on this resolution. Compared \nto the President, the Republican budget cuts overall funding for \nenvironment and natural resources programs by 16 percent in the year \n2002. The Republicans cut National Park Service operations by 20 \npercent. Compared to President, the Republican budget cuts funding for \nEPA's enforcement and operations by 23 percent in the year 2002.\n  The people of the United States never voted to gut environmental \nspending in the last election. They overwhelmingly want to make sure \nGovernment provides basic safeguards for a clean environment. This is a \njob that Government can do and needs to do.\n  The environment will not take care of itself. We have to step up and \nbe responsible about the future we pass to our children. We must not \nstep back from the bipartisan commitments made in the past 25 years to \nprotect our air, water, streams, and natural resources.\n  Moreover, this budget ignores corporate welfare. President Clinton \nproposed that $40 billion be raised from corporate reforms and loophole \nclosing legislation. But the majority has caved to special interests, \nand its budget remains silent on corporate welfare. Closing tax \nloopholes should be part of any fair balanced budget plan.\n  Finally, the Republican plan includes $17 billion in cuts to the \nearned income tax credit, which helps low-income working families stay \noff welfare and out of poverty. The President's budget proposes only $5 \nmillion in reforms to cut down on earned income tax credit fraud.\n  This Federal tax increase will raise taxes in seven States that have \na State earned income tax credit tied to the Federal credit, including \nmy home State of Vermont. The resolution could raise both State and \nFederal taxes on 27,000 Vermont working families earning less than \n$28,500 a year. It is very doubtful that the Vermont General Assembly \ncan afford to increase the State earned income tax credit to make up \nthis loss, with even more Federal cuts on the way.\n  At a time when many working Americans are struggling to make ends \nmeet, the Senate Republican budget would hike Federal taxes on low and \nmoderate-income working families. It would also raise some State taxes \non these same working families. This is a double whammy on working \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, this budget resolution is better than last year's \nextreme budget, but it still cuts programs for elderly, young, and low-\nincome Vermonters more than is necessary to balance the budget. We can \ndo better than this budget.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, on April 23, 1996, the Senate, by a \nvote of 100 to 0, passed the Health Insurance Reform Act, a bill that \nwill make health insurance more available to more Americans, end job \nlock, and end concerns regarding pre-existing conditions. That same \nbipartisan approach is what is needed now if this Senate is to do what \nthe American people expect us to do--restore real, lasting discipline \nto the Federal budget.\n  In the last Congress, I served on the Bipartisan Commission on \nEntitlement and Tax Reform. The first finding in that Commission's \ninterim report to the President, which was overwhelmingly endorsed by \nboth the Democratic and Republican members of the Commission, stated:\n\n       To ensure that today's debt and spending commitments do not \n     unfairly burden America's children, the Government must act \n     now. A bipartisan coalition of Congress, led by the \n     President, must resolve the long-term imbalance between the \n     Government's entitlement promises and the funds it will have \n     available to pay for them.\n\n  The Commission, however, did much more than simply make a rhetorical \ncase for bi-partisan cooperation to address our budget problems. It \nalso did extensive work to document the nature of the budget problem we \nface, because no consensus solution to our budget problems is possible \nunless there is first a consensus on what our real budget problems are.\n  The Commission laid out the kind of budget future we face, and the \nunderlying causes of our budget problems, in considerable detail. \nPerhaps the Commission's most important finding was that, unless we \nbegin to act now, the portion of the gross domestic product of the \nUnited States consumed by the Federal Government will rise from \napproximately 21.4 percent of GDP in 1995 to over 37 per cent of GDP by \nthe year 2030.\n  Now, thinking about percentages of GDP is not very meaningful to most \nAmericans. It might be useful, therefore, to think about what that \nfigure might mean for the Federal Government and Federal deficits if we \ntranslate those percentages into the fiscal year 1995 Federal budget.\n  In fiscal 1995, the Federal Government spent approximately $1.5 \ntrillion dollars. If that year's budget took up 37 percent of GDP, as \nthe Commission forecast for 2030, total fiscal year 1995 spending for \nthe Federal Government would have been over $1.15 trillion higher, or \n$2.65 trillion. The Federal deficit would explode from the $163 billion \nactually reported in fiscal 1995 to over $1.3 trillion. The Federal \ndeficit, under this scenario, would amount to almost 87 percent of the \ntotal amount the Federal Government actually spent in fiscal 1995.\n  Domestic discretionary spending would not account for a single penny \nof that increase; It would consume only $252 billion of that \ntheoretical budget, or approximately 11 percent of total Federal \nspending. Nor would defense spending account for any part of that \nincrease. It would continue to account for only $273 billion of the \ntotal $2.65 trillion budget.\n  What would increase is interest on the national debt, which would \nmore than triple from the $232 billion the Federal Government actually \nspent on interest expense in fiscal 1995 to almost $700 billion. Social \nSecurity would double from the roughly $330 billion actually spent in \nfiscal 1995 to well over $650 billion. Medicare would also double, from \napproximately $150 billion to over $310 billion. And Medicaid would \ndouble as well, going from $90 billion to $180 billion.\n  That kind of budget is impossible. The Federal Government could not \nsell the new Government bonds that would be necessary to support \ndeficits of that size. Essentially, the Federal Government would have \nto declare bankruptcy long before the budget ever reached that point. \nThe members of the Commission, of course, all knew that. But it was the \nCommission's judgment--one that I fully endorsed--that it was important \nto lay out the budget trends the Federal Government is facing, because \nonly then can the President and Congress, working together, do \nsomething to change those trends.\n  The Commission's work, however, did much more than identify the \ntrends, though. The Commission went on to clearly lay out the \nunderlying causes for those trends--rising health care costs and the \naging of the baby boomers.\n\n[[Page S5527]]\n\n  The Commission found that Federal health care expenses rose by double \ndigit rates in the late 1980's and early 1990's, and it forecast that \ntotal Federal health care expenses would triple to 11 percent of GDP by \nthe year 2030, unless appropriate policy changes are made. Even more \nfrighteningly, it found that total Federal health care expenses will at \nleast double as a percentage of GDP even if health care cost inflation \nis brought under control.\n  Changes in the American population are even a more powerful engine, \none that is driving overall Federal spending ever-higher. Americans are \nnow living much longer than they did in 1935 when Social Security \nbegan. The average life expectancy was 61.4 years then. It is 75.8 \nyears now, and it is projected to be 78.4 years by 2025. In 1935, the \nlife expectancy of a person reaching the age of 65 was 12.6 years. Now \nit is 17.5 years, and by 2025, it will be 18.8 years.\n  These figures represent a real triumph for our American community. \nWhat they tell us is that the American system works. But these figures \nalso help explain why that triumph is not cost-free. In 1990, there \nwere almost five workers for each Social Security retiree; by the year \n2030, there will be less than three. More and more people are drawing \nSocial Security benefits, and drawing them for a longer period. More \nand more people are using Medicare and Medicaid, and using them for a \nlonger period of time. And those facts mean higher costs.\n  These are the fundamental truths we must all face, Mr. President, if \nwe really want to address our budget problems--if we really want to \nbalance the budget in a way that makes sense and that will work. We \nhave to decide together--on a bipartisan basis--what our priorities \nare, what we think Government can do and must do, and what we are \nwilling to pay. The only way to make these decisions is to be honest \nwith the American people about what the problems are, and about what \nvarious options for solution of these problems would entail.\n  I would like to be able to say that the resolution now before us is \nbased on that kind of bipartisan approach to the budget issue. I would \nlike to be able to say that it is based on the bipartisan analysis \ncontained in the Commission's report. And I would like to say that it \nis an attempt to present the American people with a set of proposals \nthat face the underlying budget trends and their causes, but I cannot.\n  The American people want bipartisanship in approaching our budget \nproblems. Unfortunately, however, this budget is not a bipartisan \nbudget. It does not reflect an agreement between Congress and the \nPresident, or even between the Democrats and Republicans here in the \nSenate. Instead, as the straight party line vote in the Budget \nCommittee on this resolution demonstrated, it is instead based on the \npartisan approach to the budget that was so in evidence last year--an \napproach that gave us three Government shutdowns, 13 continuing \nresolutions funding the Government for as little as a day at a time, \nand, in the end, no real progress toward dealing with our most \nsignificant budget problems.\n\n  This is a large budget resolution, and it covers six fiscal years, \nbut it is easy to tell it is not based on the Bipartisan Commission's \nanalysis of our budget problems. This budget resolution, for example, \nobtains fully half of its deficit reduction from domestic discretionary \nspending.\n  Mandatory spending--principally Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, \nfederal retirement, and interest on the national debt--has risen from \n32.4 percent of the total Federal budget in 1963 to 64.1 percent now, \nand it will account for fully 72 percent of the Federal budget in the \nyear 2003. Domestic discretionary spending, on the other hand, has been \nshrinking as a percentage of the total Federal budget, and it has been \ngenerally stable as a percentage of GDP. It is not the primary source \nof our budget problem. At roughly 17 percent of the overall Federal \nbudget, it certainly does not account for 50 percent of our budget \nproblem.\n  Perhaps the most compelling way to demonstrate that fact is to go \nback to the Entitlement Commission's report. The Commission found that \nafter the year 2012, even if every single domestic discretionary \nspending program is cut to zero, and even if the Defense Department's \nbudget is cut to zero, the Federal Government would still run deficits \nevery year thereafter, unless we act to address our core budget issues.\n  The American people do not want that to happen, Mr. President. They \ndo not want the Federal Government to be without resources to address \nimportant national priorities like education and the environment. They \nknow that Federal investment in education is a public good. They know \nthat Federal investment in highways and mass transit and aviation \nsafety is a public good. They know that Federal investment in health \nresearch is a public good. They know that Federal stewardship of our \nnational parks, including such national treasures as Yellowstone and \nthe Grand Canyon, represents a public good. And they know that Federal \naction to protect our environment and clean up our air, our water, and \ntoxic waste sites is a public good.\n  When American communities experience floods, or hurricanes, or \ntornados or earthquakes, they want the Federal Government to be able to \nact. What they don't want is a situation where the Federal Government \nis unable to act because of our failure to address the Federal \nGovenment's budget problems. Yet, if deficit reduction efforts continue \nto focus in such a disproportionate way on this already shrinking of \nthe Federal budget, while avoiding coming to grips with the real budget \nproblems in the mandatory spending part of the budget, that will be the \ninevitable result.\n  Domestic discretionary spending is not the only area where this \nbudget resolution falls short. In Medicare, it proposes reductions in \nspending that total $167 billion, cuts that are, at the same time, too \nlarge and too small.\n  That may seem like a contradiction, but it's not. And the reason it \nis not goes back to the underlying forces driving up federal spending--\nhealth care inflation and demographics.\n  We need to sit down together on a bipartisan basis, and to work \ntogether to develop an approach to Medicare--and for that matter, \nMedicaid--that will actually reduce the Federal health care cost \ninflation rate. Then, based on what we believe we can actually achieve, \nwe should include those savings in the budget resolution. This \nresolution does exactly the opposite. It sets an arbitrary amount of \nbudget savings, and essentially caps Medicare spending, without knowing \nwhat those arbitrary caps will do to quality of care, access to care, \naffordability of care, or choice of provider. And while it does not \nincrease direct costs to beneficiaries, it does assume major cuts in \npayments to hospitals and home health providers that serve \nbeneficiaries, which will clearly have an impact on quality and access.\n\n  Moreover, the figures in the resolution are not based on any real \nanalysis of how much health care inflation can be reduced, and how much \ntime it will take to accomplish. Instead, the resolution is like an old \nSoviet 5-year plan--except it covers 6 years. It simply says this shall \nhappen. Like the old Soviet 5-year plans, therefore, it has only the \nvaguest connection with economic--and in this case, health care--\nreality.\n  At the same time, however, the proposals assumed in the budget \nresolution do not in any way come to grips with the underlying \ndemographic trends, which is why they are both too large and too small. \nThey start at levels higher than can be justified based on reining in \nhealth care inflation, but they do not even attempt to begin to \nanticipate what needs to be done to handle the retirement of the baby \nboomer generation. We have to do better than that.\n  This resolution also contains a tax cut. It is a smaller tax cut than \nin last year's resolution, but it suffers from the same flaws. I am the \nfirst to agree that Americans ought to have more money in their \npockets. More and more Americans are being priced out of the American \ndream. More and more Americans are losing their ability to purchase a \nhome, a new car, or to provide a college education for their children. \nIt is clear that more and more Americans are being priced out of the \ndream market. Between 1980 and 1995, for example:\n\n       the average price of a home increased from about $76,000 to \n     over $150,000, an increase of more than 100 percent; the \n     average price of a car went from about $7,000 to about \n     $20,000, an increase of over 285 percent, and the number of \n     weeks an American had to work to pay\n\n[[Page S5528]]\n\n     for the average car increased from about 18 weeks to over 27 \n     weeks, an increase of about 150 percent; and the cost of a \n     year's tuition at a publicly supported college increased from \n     $635 to $2,860, an increase of almost 450 percent, and a \n     year's tuition at a private college increased from an average \n     of $3,498 to $12,432, an increase of 355 percent.\n\n  These cost increases have continued into the 1990's, but income \ngrowth has not kept pace. Economic stagnation and rising income \ndisparity are now facts of life. Just last month, for example, it was \nreported that Americans now have to work a record number of weeks--27, \nas I stated earlier--to purchase a new car. What that fact means, of \ncourse, is that more and more Americans are being pushed out of the new \ncar market altogether.\n  Given these cost trends, Americans justifiably want to see higher \ntake-home pay. Government can make an important contribution that can \nhelp Americans achieve that goal by helping to create a climate where \nproductivity can increase, because increases in productivity lead to \nincreases in wealth, and because in our country, it is private markets, \nand not Government fiat, that determines people's incomes.\n  Some people may assume that tax cuts automatically increase \nproductivity, but it is worth remembering that, Federal taxes took are \nlower now than they were in 1969--one full percentage point of GDP \nlower. In 1969, the top Federal income tax rate was 77 percent; now \nit's 39 percent. Since 1969, the amount raised by Federal income tax on \nindividuals has dropped by almost 11 percent, and the amount raised by \nthe corporate income tax has been cut almost in half, as a percentage \nof GDP. Yet, the U.S. economy generally, and the standard of living of \nthe average American, grew more quickly then.\n\n  The truth is that, if we want to increase national savings, and \nthereby help increase the pool of capital that is necessary to support \nproductivity growth, the most efficient way to do that is to address \nour core budget problems, and not to cut taxes now. The most important \nreason not to do a tax cut now, however, has nothing to do with tax \npolicy, national savings rates, or productivity. The most important \nreason not to do a tax cut now is that a tax cut sends a totally wrong \nmessage to the American people about the scope and extent of our budget \nproblem.\n  A tax cut now is like President Johnson's guns and butter policy in \nthe 1960's. It says that our budget problems are easy to solve, so easy \nthat we can afford tax cuts while we balance the budget with one hand \ntied behind our backs. But that's not the case. We can continue to \nignore the facts for a few more years if we want, but ignoring the \ntruth will not make it go away. It will only make the day of reckoning \nthat much worse.\n  It need not be so. While tough steps will be needed, and while \nserious costs are involved, if we work together on a bipartisan basis, \nif we think about the long-term, and if we keep our focus on the \npriorities of the American people, we can address our budget problems \nin a way that will allow this great Nation to protect the retirement \nsecurity of Americans--now and in the future. We can do so in a way \nthat will allow the United States to meet the health care priorities of \nAmericans--now and in the future. And we can do so in a way that \nretains resources for other essential investments--like education and \nthe environment.\n  The budget resolution now before this Senate cannot accomplish these \ngoals because it is not bipartisan and because it is not based on the \nbudget realities we are facing. I urge my colleagues, therefore, to \njoin me in voting to put this resolution aside. And much more \nimportantly, I urge my colleagues to come together in a bipartisan way \nto begin the process of putting together the kind of budget the \nAmerican people expect of us.\n\n\n               THE ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE [ANWR]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe ranking member of the Budget Committee on the issue of ANWR?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I would be happy to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It has come to my attention that the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee has been instructed to achieve close to $1 billion \nin savings that are not highlighted as part of the mandatory \nassumptions section of the environment and natural resources function \nof the committee report on the budget resolution. Can the Senator from \nNebraska confirm that this is true?\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator from Montana is correct. in fact, this billion \ndollars of savings amounts to almost 75 percent of the required savings \nthe Energy and Natural Resources must produce in order to comply with \nthe Republican budget resolution.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It also has come to my attention that the latest CBO \nsavings estimate for opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \n[ANWR] for oil drilling is just under $1 billion. Does the Senator from \nNebraska find it odd that there is no mention of ANWR in this year's \nbudget resolution?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes, I do find that strange. The committee report for last \nyear's budget resolution cited ANWR as the major mandatory savings \nassumption for the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. indeed, it's \ninclusion in the final reconciliation bill was one of the major reasons \nwhy the President vetoed that bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to inquire of Senator Exon, \nis it fair for me to assume that in order for the Energy and Natural \nResource Committee to meet its reconciliation instructions this year, \nthe Republican majority is planning to include drilling in ANWR?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes, I do believe that the Senator from Montana is correct \nin making that assumption. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nhas a limited amount of mandatory programs under its jurisdiction to \ntarget for savings as part of a reconciliation bill. With the exception \nof privatizing the Power Marketing Administrations, a proposal that was \nsoundly rejected during last year's debate, I might add with the \nSenator Montana's leadership. I can think of no other policy under \ntheir jurisdiction that could generate a $1 billion in savings.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Since this is indeed the case, I wonder why our friends \non the Republican side were not willing to highlight their proposal to \ndrill for oil in the Arctic Refuge as the leading assumption in their \nreport, given the fact that it accounts for 75 percent of the savings \nfor the Energy and Natural Resources Committee?\n  Mr. EXON. It might be due to the fact that a clear majority of the \nAmerican people do not support opening up the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge for oil and gas exploration. It appears to me that the \nRepublicans are trying to find a clever way to cover up all the damage \ntheir budget will do to the environment.\n  Senator BAUCUS. I believe that the Senator from Nebraska is correct. \nThe American people, by a two to one margin, oppose opening up ANWR for \noil and gas drilling. No wonder that proponents of drilling do not want \nto confront the issue head-on.\n  Our citizens understand, even if some members of this body may not, \nthat leasing the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge risks serious harm to \none of our national treasures. It squanders the natural resources that \nwe should be leaving for future generations. And it is another example \nof public lands policies that favor special interests over the \ninterests of ordinary families.\n  The irony is that we do not need to take these risks to ensure \nadequate supplies of energy. There are new oil fields being developed \nin the Gulf of Mexico right now, in very deep water, that can produce \noil without the environmental disruptions that would surely accompany \ndrilling in ANWR.\n  Last year, the Office of Management and Budget, hardly an \nenvironmentally zealous group, stated that:\n\n       Exploration and development activities would bring physical \n     disturbances to the area, unacceptable risks of oil spills \n     and pollution, and long-term effects that would harm wildlife \n     for decades.\n\n  That is not the kind of legacy we should be leaving for our children. \nYet that is what could well be in store for this country if the \nreconciliation instructions in this budget are carried out as the \nSenator from Nebraska has indicated. I thank the Senator for his \nobservations.\n\n\n              Wellstone Education Tax Deduction Amendment\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I voted for the amendment of my colleague \nfrom Minnesota because I support providing a tax deduction to parents \nto\n\n[[Page S5529]]\n\nhelp defray the costs of a higher education for their kids. Senator \nWellstone's amendment would also permit taxpayers who pursue additional \neducation to deduct all or a portion of the related costs. This is \nimportant for taxpayers who lose their job and need additional skills \nto get reemployed or who want to advance to a higher paying job. In \nfact, Mr. President, I introduced S. 1312 earlier this year to provide \na $5,000 deduction for higher education costs.\n  I do have one concern with Senator Wellstone's amendment. The only \ntax cuts permitted under its language are a child tax credit and the \ndeduction for higher education costs. There are a number of other tax \ncuts that merit consideration Mr. President, and I hope we can get to \nthem this year. For example, an increase in section 179 expensing for \nsmall businesses, expansion of IRA's to encourage savings, and estate \nand gift tax relief for family-owned businesses.\n  I look forward to working with my distinguished colleague from \nMinnesota on the child tax credit and the higher education deduction as \nwell as a number of other tax cuts that will benefit taxpayers in \nMinnesota and Montana as well as the entire Nation.\n\n\n         kyl amendment requiring a supermajority to raise taxes\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Sense of the Senate amendment of my \ncolleague from Arizona notes that the current tax system is overly \ncomplex and burdensome and that action must be taken to produce a tax \nsystem that is fairer, flatter and simpler. I couldn't agree more and I \nlook forward to working with him and the rest of my colleagues to \nreform a tax system that is badly in need of repair.\n  I was unable however, Mr. President, to vote for Senator Kyl's \namendment because of the provision requiring a supermajority vote to \nraise taxes. Ironically, I believe this proposal could impeded \nmeaningful tax reform. It could have the effect of locking in existing \nloopholes unless those of us who want real tax reform could muster a \nsupermajority. Congress may ultimately determine that in fact more than \na simple majority of its members should be required to increase taxes. \nHowever, a number of questions need to be addressed before we take such \naction.\n  What is a supermajority? Two thirds of the members, or perhaps three-\nfourths?\n  Can the supermajority requirement be waived in the event of a \nnational emergency? How would we define a national emergency?\n  And how do we define what it means to ``raise'' taxes? Does closing a \ncorporate loophole--which would increase the taxes paid by the \ncompanies benefitting from the loophole--require a supermajority? If it \ndoes, Congress will be hard pressed to close corporate loopholes.\n  I do agree with the language in my distinguished colleague's \namendment calling for tax reform, and I may agree in time with the need \nfor a ``supermajority'' before taxes can be ``raised,'' but cannot at \nthis time vote for his amendment calling for that supermajority.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the debate surrounding this year's \nbudget resolution is tame compared to the debate we heard last year at \nthis time. But we should not be lulled by this relative quiet. This \nyear's model is not much different from the one produced last year.\n  In one key regard, it may be worse.\n  The warnings many of us made last year have come true. Rather than \nfocusing on eliminating the deficit and finally balancing the Federal \nbudget, this year's budget resolution has one overarching goal, namely \nto provide an election year tax cut.\n  Mr. President, on this issue, the hands of both parties are dirty. \nRepublicans and Democrats both have engaged in this tax cut bidding \nwar. Even the so-called bipartisan budget proposal revolves around a \n$130 billion tax cut.\n  Mr. President, we have lost a real opportunity.\n  After the debate of the last year, one might have thought that we had \nreached a consensus that balancing the Federal budget was our most \nimportant task. The negotiations that took place between the Republican \nCongressional leadership and the White House appeared to be moving the \nparties closer together. Each side had agreed to similar ground rules \nand a timetable for a balanced budget; each side had offered a budget \nplan that actually reached balance.\n  Sadly, negotiations broke off, and there was no agreement reached on \na plan to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, a central reason for the failure of those negotiations \nwas that the shared goal of deficit reduction was weighed down with \nother competing agendas--the structure of Medicare, whether Medicaid \nshould be a block grant, welfare reform, and the amount and structure \nof the tax cut. All of a sudden, it wasn't enough to balance the \nbudget. Eliminating the deficit took a back seat to those other \npriorities.\n  Mr. President, of course these other matters have an impact on our \nability to achieve and maintain a balanced budget. I support reforms to \nMedicare and Medicaid not only for their own sake but for the very \nreason that such reforms are needed if we are to achieve a balanced \nbudget.\n  But we cannot afford to divert our attention from what must be the \nimmediate business of Congress--balancing the budget.\n  Of all the distractions, Mr. President, by far the most dangerous is \nthe promise of a major tax cut. It is already difficult to get \nagreement on the spending cuts needed to eliminate the deficit. The \nwork of balancing the budget is not pleasant, and it is all too easy to \nfind excuses not to do that work.\n  Proposals to cut taxes make it even more difficult to stay focused on \nthat unpleasant but necessary task. How much easier it is to speak \nabout how one might cut taxes, and by how much.\n  Mr. President, as I noted earlier in this debate, we are now obsessed \nwith enacting tax cuts, no matter what the cost to the integrity of the \nbudget. Every time you turn around you bump into another proposal for \nsome tax cut. Some come clothed as tax reform, such as the so-called \nflat tax. Others are less subtle. The Wall Street Journal recently \nreported that a ``trendier'' tax cut plan is a 15 percent across-the-\nboard cut in income tax rates, phased in over 3 years. And I have no \ndoubt that the nominees of both parties will each have their own tax \ncut plan to tout this summer.\n  We've just spent 2 weeks debating the issue of a 4.3 cent gas tax \ncut, and the other body has sent us a 1.7 billion dollar special \nadoption tax credit and is working on another 7 billion dollar tax cut \nfor small businesses.\n  Everyone is eager to float a tax cut plan. Mr. President, would that \nthey were equally as eager to offer plans to cut spending and balance \nthe budget.\n  This budget resolution aids and abets this fiscally reckless and \nirresponsible agenda. Its structure of consecutive reconciliation \nbills, finishing with a tax cut extravaganza just a few weeks before \nthe election, is a guarantee that it cannot hope to lead to a balanced \nbudget, only political posturing.\n  The budget resolution has other flaws as well. The Medicare and \nMedicaid programs are underfunded, the direct result of the need to \nfund the tax cut and to add even more funding to a Defense Department \nthat instead should be asked for significantly more cuts. And as with \nlast year's budget resolution, there is no effort to limit some of the \ncorporate welfare that responsible members of both parties have \nidentified as a top priority for cutting.\n  Mr. President, I suspect that some of this year's budget resolution \nis the result of the special political dynamics of presidential \nelection year politics. If that is the case, I earnestly hope that once \nthat election is behind us, both parties will seize the opportunity and \nreach out for a bipartisan plan to balance the budget. I am confident \nthat a majority of the Senate and the other body would support such a \nplan.\n  Until that time, Mr. President, I will continue working with members \nform both sides of the aisle to identify areas where we can find \nsavings that will move us closer to completely eliminating our Federal \nbudget deficit.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, as we conclude debate, I cannot help but be \nstruck by the futility of this Republican budget. It is a tragic repeat \nof last year's Republican budget fiasco. It is a fool's errand twice \nover.\n  A year ago, many of us stood on the Senate floor imploring our \nRepublican colleagues to temper their harsh views and to join with us \nto create a bipartisan balanced budget. We predicted a\n\n[[Page S5530]]\n\ntrain wreck otherwise. We got not one, but two train wrecks, including \nthe longest Federal Government shutdown in the history of our Nation.\n  We will soon vote on this so-called new Republican budget. But no one \nshould be fooled as to its novelty. It is at best a hybrid of the old \nRepublican budget grafted onto some slick parliamentary procedures. It \nwill spin out not one, but three, reconciliation bills, because the \nRepublican Majority wants to create a web of budgetary intrigue in \nwhich to trap the President. They want to amplify partisan \nconfrontation over the summer and into the fall elections.\n  Some call this the silly season. It would be silly, if it were not so \nsad for our Nation.\n  Once again, the congressional majority is squandering an opportunity \nto balance the budget. Last year, all the Republicans wanted was for \nPresident Clinton to submit a 7-year, CBO-certified, balanced budget. \nPresident Clinton delivered with a fair and reasonable balanced budget. \nBut no, the Republicans claimed that it was not good enough for them--\neven though it was good enough for the Republican-selected CBO \nDirector.\n  Perhaps this debate did serve one larger purpose. With amendments \nfrom this side of the aisle, the American people could see that there \nis another vision for the future of our Nation. There is a way to \nbalance the budget, but without jeopardizing quality health care for \nour seniors, without fouling the environment, without limiting the \nlearning horizons of our children. But on this floor, the American \npeople saw the Republican majority oppose moderation time and time \nagain.\n  It has been said that the definition of insanity is doing the same \nthing over and over again and expecting a different result. This budget \nwould be insane, except that no one expects a different result. This is \na senseless repetition of a failed budget. Because of its extremism, it \ndeserves to fail. I urge my colleagues to reject it once again.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I intend to vote against the Republican \nFederal budget proposal. This budget is nearly the same as the one \nproposed last year by Republicans, and I feel that the interests of the \nNation continue to be poorly served by the guidelines specified in this \nsort of ideologically driven legislation.\n  Both last year's Republican budget proposal and the one we are voting \non today represent a misguided set of priorities for the next century \nby cutting resources for education, job training, the environment, and \nMedicaid in order to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy and unneeded \ndefense programs.\n  Over 7 years, the Republican proposal slashes Medicare by $226.8 \nbillion, a number only slightly different from their proposal last year \nto cut Medicare by $228.2 billion. Reductions in the earned income tax \ncredit will result in increasing taxes on lower income working families \nby $21 billion over 7 years, compared to the $20-billion tax increase \nproposed last year.\n  I am also very concerned about proposals in this legislation that \nwould allow States to make significant cuts in their own contributions \nto Medicaid in the rules governing block grants from the Federal to \nState governments. These policies threaten guarantees of coverage for \nchildren, people with disabilities, and older Americans. This series of \nproposals represents an alarming trend away from providing the most \nrudimentary safety net for those in need toward further enriching those \nwho are the most prosperous in our country.\n  The President's budget proposal as well as a centrist alternative \nbudget crafted primarily by Senators Breaux and Chafee do a far better \njob of balancing the needs of the most disadvantaged in our society \nwith the objective of reaching a balanced budget by 2002. The \nPresident's budget secures the integrity of the Medicare trust fund \nthrough 2005, and it does so without ravaging this important program. \nIn contrast, the Republican budget cuts Medicare by $50 billion more \nthan the President's plan.\n  Education and job training--Head Start, Basic Education Assistance-- \ntitle 1--School-to-Work, and Job Training for Dislocated Workers--\nremain high priorities of our Government, as they should be, in the \nPresident's budget. In contrast, the Republicans slash more than $60 \nbillion from these programs.\n\n  The President does not raise taxes on low-income working Americans. \nIn contrast, the Republicans, by cutting EITC by $21 billion over the \nnext 7 years, intend to raise taxes for between 6 to 10 million \nAmericans.\n  I think it is possible to balance the budget by 2002 without \nabandoning America's priorities--and without abandoning those most in \nneed. We can clearly preserve paycheck security, health security and \nretirement security for America's working families without abandoning \nour commitment to a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, I must also add that I am impressed with the efforts \nof Senator John Breaux and Senator John Chafee in leading the way on \nyet another alternative budget to that proposed by the Republican \nmajority. This 7-year bipartisan alternative budget proposal, which I \nhave voted to support, is a conscientious, bipartisan effort that does \na much better job of maintaining the right priorities for our country. \nI do have concerns about whether cutting the CPI by \\1/2\\ percent is \nthe best approach to dealing with the question of getting a better, \nmore accurate inflation indicator, and I think that any adjustment in \nour cost growth measure must be progressive in its application.\n  While the Breaux-Chafee alternative does not contain everything I \nwould want in a budget, the process of bringing both Democrats and \nRepublicans together to seriously confront the problem of achieving a \nfair yet balanced budget is much better than what we ended up with--\nnamely, the Republicans trying to force the same old budget down our \nthroats.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe Republican budget resolution for fiscal year 1997. Quite simply, \nthis budget resolution does not reflect the priorities and values held \nby most Americans--the belief that we need to ensure our quality of \nlife, educate our children, and care for our elderly and disabled.\n  I regret that this vote will not be bipartisan, because I believe we \nhave made great progress over the past year. Unfortunately, this \nRepublican budget falls short. It fails to meet us halfway, and it \nproposes deep cuts in Medicare, education, Medicaid, and the \nenvironment while increasing defense spending. These cuts are not \nnecessary to balance the budget; rather, they are punitive and unwise.\n  Mr. President, when discussing the budget, we must step back and look \nat where we were just a year ago. A year ago, the President's budget \nwas not balanced and the Republican budget called for even deeper cuts \nin important programs--cuts as big as $250 billion out of Medicare. \nSince that time, however, the President has submitted a CBO-certified \nbalanced-budget that includes modest, but realistic, cuts in Medicare \nand Medicaid. And Republicans have acknowledged the need to increase \nfunding for Medicare, education, the environment, Cops on the Street \nand Americorps.\n  A year ago, I was opposed to cutting back Medicaid because it \nprovides health care for our poorest children and it ensures quality \nnursing home standards for our parents. After working with health care \nexperts in Washington State, I concluded my home State could still \nserve our most vulnerable populations as long as we don't have drastic \ncuts to Medicaid. I'm willing to concede that point, and I know now \nthat if we all give a little, we can reach compromise. But Republican \ncuts still go too far.\n  Republican Medicaid cuts appear to be shrinking, but, unfortunately \nyou are not seeing the whole story. The $72 billion cut mentioned in \nthe bill, by itself, would force changes in eligibility and services \nfor Americans on Medicaid. But in addition, this bill would allow \nStates to walk away from paying their fair share in this successful \nState and Federal partnership. Between State and Federal share \nreductions, over $250 billion would be cut from health care coverage \nfor poor and working families.\n  The majority party contends their Medicaid provisions would be \nendorsed by the National Governor's Association. They would not. Among \nother problems, this bill is a block grant, with no way for States to \nbe reimbursed for extra costs resulting from\n\n[[Page S5531]]\n\nnatural disaster or economic downturn. Even if their were no problems, \nand there are many, I could not support these cuts. States need \nflexibility, and the types of flexibility sought by my State are \nreasonable. But we in Congress are here to assure that every child in \nthis country can get basic health services, no matter which State they \nlive in.\n  On welfare, Republicans cut $53 billion and removes the guarantee to \npublic assistance, but they are not very clear about where the money \ncomes from. We can only assume they will do the same as last year--deep \ncuts in food aid and nutrition programs. I am interested in real \nwelfare reform--reform that gives people alternatives and assistance to \nmove people off of public assistance in a way that allows them to \nsupport themselves. This Republican budget is an attack on poor \nfamilies, and I cannot support it.\n  Mr. President, let us remember exactly where we are on this road to \nending the deficit. Since 1993, we have made great progress toward \nreducing this Nation's deficit. CBO estimates the 1996 deficit will \nfall to $130 billion--the fourth straight year the deficit has \ndeclined. We have cut the budget deficit in half in less than 4 years, \nand today's annual deficit stands as the lowest percentage of our gross \ndomestic product since 1980. I'm proud of this fact. I am proud to have \nbeen involved in crafting the budget package of 1993. That deficit \nreduction package has us on the right track.\n  Our need to do more, however, spawned a bipartisan group of Senators, \nwho have come together and formulated a well-reasoned, well-balanced \nbudget proposal. I commend Senators Chafee and Breaux for their \nleadership and hard work on this matter. I voted for their budget \nalternative because it is exactly the kind of bipartisan teamwork \nCongress needs to see more of. Certainly, I would like to see less \nsavings come out of discretionary accounts that include education, job \ntraining, trade promotion, and the environment. And the tax cuts may be \ntoo generous. The Chafee-Breaux plan may not be perfect, but I believe \nit is probably the most realistic compromise one could craft. I am \nhopeful this Centrist plan will become the framework for future budget \nnegotiations.\n  Mr. President, this past year has taught us we can reach a balanced \nbudget. We learned we can formulate a budget that uses common sense and \nreflects America's values and priorities. That is why Senator Kerry and \nI offered an amendment to restore education and job training funds in \nthe Republican budget. As my colleagues know, this amendment failed \ndespite the fact that the Republican budget will cut education spending \n20 percent from current levels.\n  Americans understand how important education and job training \ninvestments are for our children, and the future success of this \nNation. A recent USA Today poll found that education has become the \nmost important issue for Americans--ranking above crime, the economy \nand the quality of one's job.\n  As a former teacher, mother, and PTA member, I know from personal \nexperience the value and importance of Head Start, vocational education \nand education, technology programs. I have seen these programs work, \nand I have seen the satisfaction on the faces of children who are \nfinally getting a chance to excel and succeed.\n  And, Mr. President, this Republican budget takes a serious step \nbackwards in our efforts to preserve our environment and ensure our \nquality of life. Unfortunately, the Senate rejected several amendments \nthat would have softened this budget's impact on the environment. \nFirst, I oppose a change in the way sales of Federal assets are treated \nin this resolution. For the last decade, Congress has recognized that \nour public lands and other Federal assets were too precious to sell or \nlease unless Congress or the administration decided that so doing was \nin the best interest of the public. That is good policy and one that \ntraditionally has enjoyed strong bi-partisan support. I cosponsored the \nBumpers-Bradley amendment which would have preserved our national \nheritage for generations to come, and would have rejected this approach \nto the disposition of our Federal assets.\n\n  I also supported the amendment offered by Senators Lautenberg and \nKerry that would have increased funding by $7.3 billion over 6 years \nfor Function 300, which funds the National Park Service, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and other environmental programs. This \namendment would have restored balance to the budget. It would have \nprovided a stable, strong level of funding to protect our national \ntreasures and clean up our environment.\n  Senator Wyden's Sense of the Senate amendment would have eliminated \ntax deductions for fines, penalties, and damages arising from a failure \nto comply with Federal and State environmental or health protection \nlaws. That common sense approach to balancing the budget would have \nraised up to $100 million annually. The amendment provided an excellent \nopportunity to express our support for law-abiding companies who do not \nbreak environmental and safety laws by closing a tax loophole enjoyed \nby those who do break our laws.\n  Mr. President, last year's budget debate was painful for all of us. \nIt was especially painful for our constituents--our hard-working \nfriends and neighbors. They didn't know why the budget debate forced \nthe Government to shut down twice--one time for three straight weeks. \nThey didn't see that as progress. Instead, they saw it as just another \nexample of what is wrong with Congress and the Government today.\n  It is my hope this year's budget and appropriations process will be \nmore orderly. It is my hope the American people will not be used as \npawns during our budget negotiations. And it is my hope that my \ncolleagues will remember the budget debate requires compromise if we \nhope to really serve the people. In the end last year, we learned our \nGovernment is truly a democracy. We learned any successful budget \nagreement will need to be as broad and bipartisan as possible.\n  We have a lot of work to do if we are going to reach a balanced \nbudget. But the truth of the matter is that both parties have agreed to \nenough savings that we could balance the budget today if we really want \nto. When considering the entire budget, the difference between the two \nparties amounts to less than 1 percent of the Federal Government's \nspending. A balanced budget plan is possible. All we need is the \ncourage to find compromise.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Appropriations \nand Budget Committees in order to make sure this Congress' spending \npriorities are balanced and in line with our constituents' wishes. \nUnfortunately, today's budget resolution fails to strike a balance. \nIt's simply a replay of last year's failed Republican budget. And I \nwill be fighting to make sure this Congress does not lose sight of what \nis truly important to our friends and families.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me make a simple observation on the \nRepublican budget resolution before the Senate: it does not reflect the \npriorities of the American people. For that reason, I will oppose this \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, as you know, I attempted throughout the past several \ndays to amend this Republican budget so it meets the needs of working \nAmericans. I attempted to ensure that the violent crime reduction trust \nfund will be fully funded and that sufficient funds will be allocated \nto the community policing initiative. But this amendment was rejected \nalong party lines.\n  I tried to add back some of the cuts the Republicans have made to \nenvironmental protection and conservation efforts. But the amendment \nwas rejected along party lines. I attempted to add back funds for \neducation that the Republicans cut from the budget --the largest \neducation cut in history. But the amendment was rejected along party \nlines.\n  Time and again, the Republican party moved in lockstep to prevent us \nfrom providing services that the American people urgently need.\n  The President of the United States has proposed a budget that \nbalances in 6 years. It protects the environment. It secures our \nneighborhoods by putting more cops on the beat. It gives assistance to \nfamilies trying to care for elderly parents and educate their children. \nI voted for that budget, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S5532]]\n\n  The President s budget continues the sound economic and fiscal policy \nput in place in 1993 which has halved the deficit, kept interest rates \nand inflation low and created more than 8 million jobs. This is the \nright way to balance the budget.\n  The Republicans' budget continues the smoke-and-mirror gimmicks \nvetoed by the President and rejected by the American people. It slashes \nMedicare, cripples education programs and opens tax loopholes for big \ncorporations. This is the wrong way.\n  Mr. President, let me give you an example of why I am wary of the \nbudget the Republicans have presented this year despite all the pleas \nthat they have learned their lesson and corrected their past mistakes. \nLast year, the Senate voted that 90 percent of any tax cut should go to \npeople making less than $100,000 per year. Yet, the Republican budget, \nwhich the President wisely vetoed, devoted almost 48 percent of the tax \ncuts to people earning more than $100,000. So, Mr. President, here we \ngo again. My parents taught me an old saying which guides me in my \ndecision to reject the Republican plan before us: ``once bitten, twice \nshy.'' The Republican plan--then as now--raises Medicare premiums on \nour seniors, makes our environment vulnerable to the whims of \npolluters, denies Medicaid coverage to veterans who would have been \nineligible for VA medical care, and prevents children of many middle \nincome Americans from getting a loan to go to college.\n  That is the wrong set of priorities for our Nation, for our economy \nand for hard-working American families, Mr. President. I reject this \nbudget as I rejected the Republican plan last year, as the President \nrejected the Republican plan last year, and as the American people \nrejected the Republican plan last year.\n  I hope my colleagues oppose the Republican plan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 57, the concurrent resolution on the budget for \nfiscal year 1997. While I support the committee's efforts to balance \nthe budget, I cannot agree with the means by which that balance is \nachieved.\n  It is ironic that the committee's proposed budget resolution appears \nto soften the hard edge of many of the funding cuts proposed in last \nyear's vetoed reconciliation legislation. The committee recognized the \nneed to make the cuts look less draconian, yet, cuts similar to those \nfrom last year's failed attempt remain.\n  The committee's budget resolution merely pays lipservice to the fact \nthat it could not garner the support it needed to succeed last year, \nbecause it tries to include similar cuts by disguising them in a 6-year \nrather than a 7-year program, by rescoring the cuts to make them look \nsmaller, and, in the instance of Medicaid, by reformulating the way the \ncut is made so that the true cut can be made at the State level rather \nthan at the Federal level.\n  I guess we are to chalk it up to election year politics, but the \nbudget resolution before us asks us to ignore our experience last year \nwhen we witnessed the so-called train wreck that caused the Government \nto shut down twice.\n  And, we are to ignore the progress, albeit, limited in some areas, \nmade in negotiations between the congressional leadership and the White \nHouse. This budget resolution, in many instances, marks a disavowal of \nthe last offer made in January by the majority in the ongoing budget \nnegotiations. Instead, particularly in the case of welfare and other \nnondefense discretionary spending, we are asked to support a return to \nthe kinds of funding decisions that closed the Government twice last \nyear.\n  When you make an apples-to-apples comparison with last year's failed \nwelfare measure, the combined cuts to welfare programs, like aid to \nfamilies with dependent children, supplemental security income and food \nstamps, are essentially the same.\n  The cuts in nondefense discretionary funding are deeper than the \nJanuary offer made to the President but not quite as deep as the vetoed \nreconciliation bill. However, since the House adopted the deepest cuts \nyet proposed in nondefense discretionary funding, it seems an almost \ncertainty that we are headed back to the levels contemplated in last \nyear's failed reconciliation bill when we get to conference.\n  The Republican budget continues its attack on education and training. \nThe budget resolution caps the direct student loan program at 20 \npercent and, to use the majority's convenient euphemism, it freezes \nfunding for Pell grants work study programs. Further, the budget \nresolution terminates funding for the AmericaCorps National Service \nProgram.\n  Mr. President, these changes to higher education would continue the \nmajority's efforts to make it harder for working families and their \nchildren to finance a college education. If these proposed cuts and \nchanges are to become law, many students will see the doors closed to \nthe opportunities and choices a college education can open up for them. \nOther students and their families will see their options for financing \nan education narrowed. OMB estimates that the student loan cap would \neliminate 1,100 schools and 1.6 million students from participation, \njust in the upcoming academic year. When extended over the life of the \nbudget program, this cap would deny direct lending opportunities to 7 \nmillion borrowers.\n  Mr. President, that's not what this country stands for. We must \nensure that working middle-income families will be able to afford to \nprovide higher educational opportunities to their children.\n  The Republican budget again proposes to cut all funding for the first \nmajor new education reform bill passed by Congress in the past two \ndecades. Goals 2000 is a comprehensive national attempt to help our \nschools achieve their goals of producing informed citizens and a \nskilled, competitive work force for the future. I believe it is \nextremely shortsighted for the Republicans to continue to propose \neliminating this important program.\n  The budget resolution freezes funding--again, there's that euphemism \nfor what amounts to a cut--for Head Start and chapter 1, the most \nsuccessful programs designed to get our children ready for school and \nfor teaching basic skills, hampering our efforts to reform public \neducation in this country. I cannot support these proposals which will \nscale back our commitment to public education in this country.\n  In another critical area in nondefense discretionary funding, Mr. \nPresident, the budget resolution uses funding cuts to weaken \nenvironmental protection and to decrease the Government's ability to \nimprove public health and safety.\n  While targeting environmental programs for particularly harsh cuts, \nthis budget resolution also effectively makes policy changes that \nshould be enacted through regular legislative means. This measure \nassumes revenues from opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for \noil exploration and development. The Coastal Plain of this wildlife \nrefuge is one of our few remaining ecological treasures, containing 18 \nmajor rivers, and providing a habitat for 36 species of land mammals \nand over 30 fish species. The wilderness and environmental values of \nthis area are irreplaceable. The environmental values of this area are \nfar greater than any short-term economic gain from oil and gas \ndevelopment.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, these are the kinds of tradeoffs, \ntaking away educational opportunities at all levels, from preschool \nthrough postsecondary education, gutting environmental programs, and \nruining ecological treasures, all in order to make a politically \nexpedient tax cut and, as we'll see when we move to the defense \nauthorization bill, to waste billions of dollars in the defense \naccounts on programs we don't need. I can't agree to this, Mr. \nPresident. But, sadly, this is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n  Let's take a look at the proposed cut to the earned income tax \ncredit, a tax credit designed to assist low-income working families \nstay off the welfare rolls. It's true that the proposed cut is less \nthan last year's failed reconciliation package, but it is significantly \ndeeper than that proposed by the majority in January during the budget \nnegotiations. Moreover, it is almost twice as large as the cut proposed \nby the National Governor's Association. And, curiously, it seems to be \nat odds with a proposal made during the minimum wage debate in the \nHouse that the earned income tax credit should be expanded as an \nalternative to raising the\n\n[[Page S5533]]\n\nminimum wage. The majority party says it is offering a tax cut. With \nthe proposed cuts in the earned income tax credit, never mind the \nadvertised tax cut, the best some working families can hope for is that \ntheir taxes won't go up.\n  A similar sleight of hand occurs with respect to Medicaid. The amount \nof Federal funding proposed to be cut is less than the latest budget \noffer made in January. The hitch is, the budget resolution changes the \ncontribution that States are required to make. This change allows 80 \npercent of the cuts proposed last year to be made.\n  Moreover, not only does the budget resolution cut Federal Medicaid \npayments to the States by $72 billion, it does not specify how the cuts \nwould be made. I assume that the Republicans still support block \ngranting Medicaid funds. I am opposed to this proposal because of the \nadverse impact it would have on children in low-income families, the \ndisabled, and the elderly who require nursing home care.\n  When you get to Medicare, again, you have to pay attention to the \nfine print. The size of the cut, $168 billion, is the same as that \nproposed in the last offer but the difference here is the cut is taken \nin a shorter period of time, over a 6-year program rather than a 7-year \nprogram. So, the majority again greatly reduces Medicare funding for \nthe elderly in order to provide a tax cut for wealthy Americans. The \nbudget resolution's reduction of $168 billion in Medicare means that \nthe growth in spending per beneficiary will be less than the projected \ngrowth in spending in the private sector which insures a younger, \nhealthier population. I am concerned that these cuts and the proposed \nchanges in the structure of the Medicare Program will adversely impact \nthe quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries and will make it more \nexpensive to individuals.\n  Mr. President, we have debated this budget resolution over the course \nof several days and have had vigorous debate over a series of \namendments which would have restored necessary funding in areas such as \nhealth care, education, job training, and environmental protection. \nRegrettably, these efforts did not succeed. But, the votes really have \nbeen just a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is clear that the majority \nisn't looking to compromise or learn from our painful experience last \nyear. This legislation was never designed to engender my support and I \ncertainly will not lend my support to it.\n  In addition to the funding issues I have described, Mr. President, I \nfeel compelled to discuss the unusual instruction contained in the \nbudget resolution concerning the reporting out of three separate \nreconciliation bills. This instruction is objectionable because it \nunnecessarily expands the role of reconciliation in the budgeting \nprocess. Perhaps, more importantly, it is objectionable because it goes \nso far as to instruct the reporting out of a reconciliation bill that \nnot only will not lower the deficit but undoubtedly will raise the \ndeficit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4022\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business before the Senate is now \nthe McCain amendment No. 4022.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to the Senator who has the amendment, Senator \nMcCain.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Doesn't the opposition speak first, Mr. President, the \nother side?\n  Mr. EXON. I yield Senator Hollings the 30 seconds on our side on the \nMcCain amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona and I are agreed substantially with his sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution. In every one of the auctions, Mr. President, what we \ndo on them is not to maximize the revenues but to protect the public \ninterest. We want to increase the efficiency and enhance the \ncompetition.\n  So I welcome this particular sense-of-the-Senate resolution. But I \nhave to add, of course, the fundamental of the public interest, which I \nam sure the Senator from Arizona is interested in, is stipulated in the \nCommunications Act of 1934, section 309, and now in the new \nTelecommunications Act it is also to be adhered to. So I move the \nadoption of the resolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection to the resolution.\n  Mr. EXON. We have no objection.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the sense-of-the-Senate resolution \noffered by my friend from Arizona encourages the Federal Communications \nCommission [FCC] to move forward expeditiously on a number of pending \nproceedings. In doing so, would the Senator from Arizona agree that \nsection 309 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, is the \nprovision of law that authorizes the FCC's use of auctions as a \nlicensing procedure?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Would the Senator further agree that the FCC should \nfollow the statute in conducting auctions?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, I agree that the FCC should follow the law.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4041 to Amendment No. 4022\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Parliamentary inquiry. Did we adopt the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have not adopted the amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent it be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a pending second-degree amendment \nthat has not been read.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] for himself, Mr. \n     Warner, Mr. McCain, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. Smith, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4041 to amendment No. 4022.\n       Strike all after the word ``Sec.'' and insert:\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) The Founding Fathers were committed to the principle of \n     civilian control of the military;\n       (2) Every President since George Washington has affirmed \n     the principle of civilian control of the military;\n       (3) Twenty-six Presidents of the United States served in \n     the United States Armed Forces prior to their inauguration \n     and none of them claimed the Presidency represented a \n     continuation of their military service;\n       (4) No President of the United States prior to May 15, 1996 \n     has ever sought relief from legal action on the basis of \n     serving as Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed \n     Forces;\n       (5) President Clinton is the subject of a sexual harassment \n     lawsuit filed on May 6, 1994 in Federal District Court in \n     Little Rock, Arkansas involving allegations about his conduct \n     in May, 1991;\n       (6) On May 15, 1996, a legal brief filed on behalf of the \n     President of the United States in the United States Supreme \n     Court asserted the President of the United States may be \n     entitled to the protections afforded members of the United \n     States Armed Forces under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief \n     Act of 1940 (50 U.S.C. 501 et. al); and\n       (7) The purpose of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief \n     Act of 1940 is to enable members of the military services \n     ``to devote their entire energy to the defense needs of the \n     nation.''\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying this resolution include that the President of the \n     United States should state unequivocally that he is not \n     entitled to and will not seek relief from legal action under \n     the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, and that \n     he will direct removal from his legal brief any reference to \n     the protections of the Act.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each side gets 30 seconds. The Senator from \nAlaska has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. I asked for a quorum.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask for the yeas and nays. Mr. President, along with \nSenators Warner, Chafee and McCain, who are cosponsors, I believe what \nwe have here is an assertion without precedent. The President of the \nUnited States claims in a brief filed in the Supreme Court that a \npending sexual harassment lawsuit against him should be delayed \nindefinitely. He claims he is entitled to the protection afforded \nmembers of the military under the Soldiers and Sailors Act of 1940.\n  For the President to make the claim that he is a member of the Armed \nForces is simply beyond comprehension.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, regular order.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It flies in the face of the 207-year-old tradition \nestablished by George Washington that the U.S. military should be under \ncivilian control.\n\n[[Page S5534]]\n\n  Mr. FORD. Regular order.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. As the commander of the American Legion said: ``We've \nhad plenty of great Americans take off a military uniform to assume the \nPresidency. None has ever put on a uniform after Inauguration Day.''\n  As a former member of the U.S. Coast Guard, I respectfully request \nthat the President should immediately direct his attorney to drop this \nabsurd claim.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the Senator is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. My apologies to those I told we would be out of here by \n5:10.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is obvious that we are not going to be \nable to work out an agreement as to how a vote can be obtained on this \nissue this afternoon. The budget resolution is very important to the \nAmerican people. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe withdrawn following 4 minutes of debate equally divided between the \namendment sponsor and the Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I wonder \nif our leader will further say, when that is done what will happen, so \nwe all know.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe, Mr. President, from the chairman, we have one \namendment left that will be voice voted, and we will be prepared to go \nto final passage immediately after that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the unanimous-consent request include the last \nstatement about the sequencing?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the sequence \nafter this exchange be, we have a voice vote on the pending McCain \namendment and we go immediately to final passage of the budget \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the revised unanimous \nconsent request? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in the interest of moving the budget \nprocess along, I am withdrawing my amendment, but I want to assure my \ncolleagues, until our President orders his legal counsel to drop this \nargument in court, I will be raising this issue on every bill.\n\n  As we go out for this Memorial Day recess, I urge all of us to \nreflect on the significance of this particular issue.\n  I yield the remaining time split between Senator McCain and Senator \nWarner.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to read from the \nCongressional Record, October 7, 1940, referring to this act. It reads:\n\n       The term ``person in military service'' and the term \n     ``persons in the military service of the United States,'' as \n     used in this Act, shall include the following persons and no \n     others: All members of the Army of the United States, the \n     United States Navy, the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard and all \n     officers of the Public Health Service detailed by proper \n     authority for duty either with the Army or the Navy. The term \n     ``military service,'' as used in this Act, shall signify \n     Federal service on active duty with any branch of service. * \n     * *\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not know if the President of the \nUnited States knew that this was part of the defense prepared by his \nlawyers. I hope very strongly that he will have this taken from it. It \nis an issue which is very emotional to a lot of Americans, and I hope \nthat by us raising this issue that the issue will be dispensed with \nvery quickly by the President of the United States.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me read a statement, first of all, by \nRobert Bennett, the attorney representing the President:\n\n       * * * my petition on the President's behalf references the \n     Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act as one of five \n     illustrative examples of the types of stays that can \n     temporarily defer lawsuits. The President does not rely on \n     the Act, and has no intention of doing so, as the basis for \n     requesting relief in this case. Our petition does not rely on \n     the Act, but is based instead on important constitutional \n     principles. We have no intention of changing our approach in \n     the future.\n\n  Mr. President, I submit for the Record the brief submitted on behalf \nof the President, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the brief was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n    [In the Supreme Court of the United States, October term, 1995]\n\n    William Jefferson Clinton, Petitioner, vs. Paula Corbin Jones, \n                               Respondent\n\n       On Petition For A Writ Of Certiorari To The United States \n     Court Of Appeals For The Eighth Circuit.\n\n\n                   petition for a writ of certiorari\n\n                          Questions Presented\n\n       1.

Sec. 1331, 1332 and 1343 \n     (1994).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Footnotes at end of brief.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The President moved to stay the litigation or to dismiss it \n     without prejudice to its reinstatement when he left office, \n     asserting that such a course was required by the singular \n     nature of the President's Article II duties and by principles \n     of separation of powers. The district court stayed trial \n     until the President's service in office expired, but held \n     that discovery could proceed immediately ``as to all persons \n     including the President himself.'' Pet. App. 71.\n       The district court reasoned that ``the case most applicable \n     to this one is Nixon v. Fitzgerald, [457 U.S. 731 (1982)],'' \n     (Pet. App. 67) which held that a President is absolutely \n     immune from any civil litigation challenging his official \n     acts as President. While the holding of Fitzgerald did not \n     apply to this case because President Clinton was sued \n     primarily for actions taken before he became President, the \n     court stated that ``[t]he language of the majority opinion'' \n     in Fitzgerald\n       ``is sweeping and quite firm in the view that to disturb \n     the President with defending civil litigation that does not \n     demand immediate attention . . . would be to interfere with \n     the conduct of the duties of the office.''\n       Pet. App. 68-69. The district court further found that \n     these concerns ``are not lessened\n\n[[Page S5535]]\n\n     by the fact that [the conduct alleged] preceded his \n     Presidency.'' Id. Invoking Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 40 \n     and the court's equitable power to manage its own docket, the \n     district judge stayed the trial ``[t]o protect the Office of \n     President . . . from unfettered civil litigation, and to give \n     effect to the policy of separation of powers.'' Pet. App. \n     72.\\2\\\n       The trial court, observing that the plaintiff had filed \n     suit three years after the alleged events, further concluded \n     that the plaintiff would not be significantly inconvenienced \n     by delay of trial. Pet. App. 70. However, it found ``no \n     reason why the discovery and deposition process could not \n     proceed,'' and said that this would avoid the possible loss \n     of evidence with the passage of time. Pet. App. 71.\n       The President and respondent both appealed.\\3\\ A divided \n     panel of the court of appeals reversed the district court's \n     order staying trial, and affirmed its decision allowing \n     discovery to proceed. The panel issued three opinions.\n       Judge Bowman found the reasoning in Fitzgerald ``inapposite \n     where only personal, private conduct by a President is at \n     issue,'' (Pet. App. 11), and determined that ``the \n     Constitution does not confer upon an incumbent President any \n     immunity from civil actions that arise from his unofficial \n     acts.'' Pet. App. 16. He also wrote that\n       ``[t]he Court's struggle in Fitzgerald to establish \n     presidential immunity for acts within the outer perimeter of \n     official responsibility belies the notion . . . that beyond \n     this outer perimeter there is still more immunity waiting to \n     be discovered.''\n\n     Pet. App. 9.\n       Judge Bowman further concluded that it would be an abuse of \n     discretion to stay all proceedings against an incumbent \n     President, asserting that the President ``is entitled to \n     immunity, if at all, only because the Constitution ordains \n     it. Presidential immunity thus cannot be granted or denied by \n     the courts as an exercise of discretion.'' Pet. App. 16. \n     Ruling that the court of appeals had ``pendent appellate \n     jurisdiction'' to entertain respondent's challenge to the \n     stay of trial issued by the district court, (Pet. App. 5 n.4) \n     (citing Kincade v. City of Blue Springs, Mo., 64 F.3d 389, \n     394 (8th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 1996 WL 26287 (Apr. 29, \n     1996)), Judge Bowman accordingly reversed that stay as an \n     abuse of discretion. Pet. App. 13 n.9.\n       In reaching these conclusions, Judge Bowman put aside \n     concerns that the separation of powers could be jeopardized \n     by a trial court's exercising control over the President's \n     time and priorities, through the supervision of discovery and \n     trial. He stated that any separation of powers problems could \n     be avoided by ``judicial case management sensitive to the \n     burdens of the presidency and the demands of the President's \n     schedule.'' Pet. App. 13.\n       Judge Beam ``concur[red] in the conclusions reached by \n     Judge Bowman.'' Pet. App. 17. He stated that the issues \n     presented ``raise matters of substantial concern given the \n     constitutional obligations of the office'' of the Presidency. \n     Pet. App. 17. He also acknowledged that ``judicial branch \n     interference with the functioning of the presidency should \n     this suit be allowed to go forward'' is a matter of ``major \n     concern.'' Pet. App. 21. He expressed his belief, however, \n     that this litigation could be managed with a ``minimum of \n     impact on the President's schedule.'' Pet. App. 23. This \n     could be accomplished, he suggested, by the President's \n     choosing to forgo attending his own trial or becoming \n     involved in discovery, or by limiting the number of pre-trial \n     encounters between the President and respondent's counsel. \n     Pet. App. 23-24. Judge Beam stated that he was concurring \n     ``[w]ith [the] understanding'' that the trial judge would \n     have substantial latitude to manage the litigation in a way \n     that would accommodate the interests of the Presidency. Pet. \n     App. 25.\n       Judge Ross dissented, stating that the ``language, logic \n     and intent'' of Fitzgerald\n       ``directs a conclusion here that, unless exigent \n     circumstances can be shown, private actions for damages \n     against a sitting President of the United States, even though \n     based on unofficial acts, must be stayed until the completion \n     of the President's term.''\n       Pet. App. 25. Judge Ross observed that ``[n]o other branch \n     of government is entrusted to a single person,'' and \n     determined that\n       ``[t]he burdens and demands of civil litigation can be \n     expected * * * to divert [the President's] energy and \n     attention from the rigorous demands of his office to the task \n     of protecting himself against personal liability. That result \n     * * * would impair the integrity of the role assigned to the \n     President by Article II of the Constitution.''\n       Pet. App. 26.\n       Judge Ross also stated that private civil suits against \n     sitting Presidents\n       ``create opportunities for the judiciary to intrude upon \n     the Executive's authority, set the stage for potential \n     constitutional confrontations between courts and a President, \n     and permit the civil justice system to be used for partisan \n     political purposes.''\n       Pet. App. 28. At the same time, he reasoned, postponing \n     litigation ``will rarely defeat a plaintiff's ability to \n     ultimately obtain meaningful relief.'' Pet. App. 30. Judge \n     Ross concluded that litigation should proceed against a \n     sitting President only if a plaintiff can ``demonstrate \n     convincingly both that delay will seriously prejudice the \n     plaintiff's interests and that * * * [it] will not \n     significantly impair the president's ability to attend to the \n     duties of his office.'' Pet. App. 31.\n       The court of appeals denied the President's request for a \n     rehearing en banc, with three judges not participating and \n     Judge McMillian dissenting. Judge McMillian said the \n     majority's holding had ``demean[ed] the Office of the \n     President of the United States.'' Pet. App. 32. He wrote that \n     the panel majority ``would put all the problems of our nation \n     on pilot control and treat as more urgent a private lawsuit \n     that even the [respondent] delayed filing for at least three \n     years,'' and would ``allow judicial interference with, and \n     control of, the President's time.'' Pet. App. 33.\n\n\n                   REASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION\n\n       This case presents a question of extraordinary national \n     importance, which was resolved erroneously by the court of \n     appeals. For the first time in our history, a court has \n     ordered a sitting President to submit, as a defendant, to a \n     civil damages action directed at him personally. We believe \n     that absent exceptional circumstances, an incumbent President \n     should never be placed in this position. And surely a \n     President should not be placed in this position for the first \n     time in our history on the basis of a decision by a \n     fragmented panel of a court of appeals, without this Court's \n     review.\n       The decision of the court below is erroneous in several \n     respects. It is inconsistent with the reasoning of Nixon v. \n     Fitzgerald and with established separation of powers \n     principles. The panel majority's suggested cure for the \n     separation of powers problems--``judicial case management \n     sensitive to . . . the demands of the President's schedule'' \n     (Pet. App. 13)--is worse than the disease: it gives a trial \n     court a general power to set priorities for the President's \n     time and energies. The panel majority also grossly overstated \n     the supposedly extraordinary character of the relief that the \n     President seeks. The deferral of litigation for a specified, \n     limited period is far from unknown in our judicial system, \n     and it is routinely afforded in order to protect interests \n     that are not comparable in importance to the interests the \n     President advances here.\n       Now is the appropriate time for the Court to address these \n     issues. If review is declined, the President would have to \n     undergo discovery and trial while in office, which would \n     eviscerate the very interests he seeks to vindicate. \n     Moreover, if the decision below is allowed to stand, federal \n     and state courts could be confronted with more private civil \n     damage complaints against incumbent Presidents. Such \n     complaints increasingly would enmesh Presidents in the \n     judicial process, and the courts in the political arena, to \n     the detriment of both.\n\n A. The Decision Below Is Inconsistent With This Court's Decisions And \n                  Jeopardizes The Separation Of Powers\n\n       1. The President ``occupies a unique position in the \n     constitutional scheme.'' Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457. 731, 749 \n     (1982). Unlike the power of the other two branches, the \n     entire ``executive Power'' is vested in a single individual, \n     ``a President,'' who is indispensable to the execution of \n     that authority. U.S. CONST. art. II, Sec. 1. The President is \n     never off duty, and any significant demand on his time \n     necessarily imposes on his capacity to carry out his \n     constitutional responsibilities.\n       Accordingly, ``[c]ourts traditionally have recognized the \n     President's constitutional responsibilities and status as \n     factors counseling judicial deference and restraint.'' \n     Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 753. Indeed, ``[t]his tradition can be \n     traced far back into our constitutional history.'' Id, at 753 \n     n.34. The form of ``judicial deference and restraint'' that \n     the President seeks here--merely postponing the suit against \n     him until he leaves office--is modest. It is far more \n     limited, for example, than the absolute immunity that \n     Fitzgerald accorded all Presidents for action taken within \n     the scope of their presidential duties.\n       The panel majority concluded that because the Fitzgerald \n     holding was limited to civil damages claims challenging \n     official acts, the President should receive no form of \n     protection from any other civil suits. This conclusion is \n     flatly inconsistent with the reasoning of Fitzgerald. The \n     Court in Fitzgerald determined that the President was \n     entitled to absolute immunity not only because the threat of \n     liability for official acts might inhibit him in the exercise \n     of his authority (id. at 752 & n.32), but also because, in \n     the Court's words, ``the singular importance of the \n     President's duties'' means that ``diversion of his energies \n     by concern with private lawsuits would raise unique risks to \n     the effective functioning of government.'' Id. at 751,\n       The panel majority ignored this second basis for the \n     holding of Fitzgerald. The first basis of Fitzgerald--that \n     the threat of liability might chill official Presidential \n     decision making--is, of course, largely not present here, and \n     accordingly, the President does not seek immunity from \n     liability.\\4\\ But the second danger to the Presidency \n     emphasized by Fitzgerald--the burdens inevitably attendant \n     upon being a defendant in a lawsuit--clearly exists here. the \n     court of appeals simply disregarded this ``unique risk[] to \n     the effective functioning of government.''\n       2. As the Fitzgerald Court demonstrated, the principle that \n     a siting President may not be subjected to private civil \n     lawsuits has deep roots in our traditions. See 457 U.S. at \n     751 n.31. Justice Story stated that\n       ``[t]he president cannot . . . be liable to arrest, \n     imprisonment, or detention, while he is in the discharge of \n     the duties of his office; and for this purpose his person \n     must be\n\n[[Page S5536]]\n\n     deemed, in civil cases at least, to possess an official \n     inviolability.''\n       3 Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the \n     United States Sec. 1563, pp. 418-19 (1st ed. 1833) (emphasis \n     added), quoted in Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 749. Senator Oliver \n     Ellsworth and then-Vice President John Adams, both delegates \n     to the Constitutional Convention, also agreed that\n       ``the President, personally, was not . . . subject to any \n     process whatever . . . For [that] would . . . put it in the \n     power of a common justice to exercise any authority over him \n     and stop the whole machine of Government.''\n       Journal of William Maclay 167 (E. Maclay ed., 1890), quoted \n     in Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 751 n.31.\n       President Jefferson was even more emphatic:\n       ``The leading principle of our Constitution is the \n     independence of the Legislature, executive and judiciary of \n     each other. . . . But would the executive be independent of \n     the judiciary, if he were subject to the commands of the \n     latter, & to imprisonment for disobedience; if the several \n     courts could bandy him from pillar to post, keep him \n     constantly trudging from north to south & east to west, and \n     withdraw him entirely from his constitutional duties?''\n       10 The Works of Thomas Jefferson 404 n. (Paul L. Ford ed., \n     1905), quoted in Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 751 n.31. As the \n     Court said in Fitzgerald, ``nothing in [the Framers'] debates \n     suggests an expectation that the President would be subjected \n     to the distraction of suits by disappointed private \n     citizens.'' 457 U.S. 751 n.31.\n       3. The panel majority minimized the separation of powers \n     concerns that so troubled the Framers. It ruled that these \n     problems can never be addressed by postponing litigation \n     against the President until the end of his term. Pet. App. \n     16. Instead, the panel majority's solution was ``judicial \n     case management sensitive to the burdens of the presidency \n     and the demands of the President's schedule.'' Pet. App. 13. \n     Rather than solving the separation of powers problems raised \n     by allowing a suit to go forward against a sitting President, \n     the panel's approach only exacerbates them.\n       The panel majority envisioned that, throughout the course \n     of litigation against him, a President could ``pursue motions \n     for rescheduling, additional time, or continuances'' if he \n     could show that the proceedings ``interfer[ed] with specific, \n     particularized, clearly articulated presidential duties.'' \n     Pet. App. 16. If the President disagreed with a decision of \n     the trial court, he could ``petition [the court of appeals] \n     for a writ of mandamus or prohibition.'' Pet. App. 16. In \n     other words, under the panel's approach, a trial court could \n     insist, before considering a request by the President for \n     adjustment in the litigation schedule, that the President \n     provide a ``specific, particularized'' explanation of why he \n     believed his official duties prevented him from devoting his \n     attention to the litigation at that time. The court would \n     then be in the position of repeatedly evaluating the \n     President's official priorities--precisely what Jefferson so \n     feared.\n       This approach is an obvious affront to the complex and \n     delicate relationship between the Judiciary and the \n     Presidency. Neither branch should be in a position where it \n     must approach the other for approval to carry out its day-to-\n     day responsibilities. Even if a trial court discharged this \n     mission with the greatest judiciousness, it is difficult to \n     think of anything more inconsistent with the separation of \n     powers than to put a court in the position of continually \n     passing judgment on whether the President is spending time in \n     a way the court finds acceptable.\n       4. The panel majority similarly attempted to downplay the \n     demands that defending private civil litigation would impose \n     on the President's time and energies. Pet. App. 13-15. The \n     concurring opinion in particular likened the defense of a \n     personal damages suit to the few instances when Presidents \n     have testified as witnesses in judicial or legislative \n     proceedings. Pet. App. 22-23. This notion is implausible on \n     its face; there is no comparison between being a defendant in \n     a civil damages action and merely being a witness. Even so, \n     Presidents have been called as witnesses only in cases of \n     exigent need, and only under carefully controlled \n     circumstances designed to minimize intrusions on the \n     President's ability to carry out his duties.\n       A sitting President has never been compelled to testify in \n     civil proceedings. Presidents occasionally have been called \n     upon to testify in criminal proceedings, in order to preserve \n     the public's interest in criminal law enforcement \n     (Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 754) and the defendant's \n     Constitutional right to compulsory process (U.S. Const. \n     amend. VI; United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 30, 33 \n     (C.C.D. Va 1807) (No. 14,692d))--factors that are, of \n     course, not present here. But even in those compelling \n     cases, as Chief Justice Marshall recognized, courts are \n     not ``required to proceed against the president as against \n     an ordinary individual.'' United States v. Burr, 25 F. \n     Cas. 187, 192 (C.C.D. Va. 1807) (No. 14,694). Instead, \n     courts have required a heightened showing of need for the \n     President's testimony, and have permitted it to be \n     obtained only in a manner that limits the disruption of \n     his official functions, such as by videotaped \n     deposition.\\5\\\n       In any event, there is an enormous difference between being \n     a third-party witness and being a defendant threatened with \n     financially ruinous personal liability. This is true even for \n     a person with only the normal business and personal \n     responsibilities of everyday life--which are, of course, \n     incalculably less demanding than those of the President. A \n     President as a practical matter could never wholly ignore a \n     suit such as the present one, which seeks to impugn the \n     President's character and to obtain $700,000 in putative \n     damages from the President personally. ``The need to defend \n     damages suits would have the serious effect of diverting the \n     attention of a President from his executive duties since \n     defending a lawsuit today--even a lawsuit ultimately found to \n     be frivolous--often requires significant expenditures of time \n     and money, as many former public officials have learned to \n     their sorrow,'' Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 763 (Burger, C.J., \n     concurring).\n       Judge Learned Hand once commented that as a litigant, he \n     would ``dread a lawsuit beyond anything else short of \n     sickness and death.'' \\6\\ In this regard the President is \n     like any other litigant, except that a President's \n     litigation, like a President's illness, becomes the nation's \n     problem.\n\n   B. The Court of Appeals Erred in Viewing the Relief Sought by the \n                       President As Extraordinary\n\n       The court below appears to have viewed the President's \n     claim in this case as exceptional, both in the relief that it \n     sought and in the burden that it imposed on respondent.\\7\\ In \n     fact, far from seeking a ``degree of protection from suit for \n     his private wrongs enjoyed by no other public official (much \n     less ordinary citizens)'' (Pet. App. 13), the relief that the \n     President seeks--the temporary deferral of litigation--is far \n     from unknown in our system, and the burdens it would impose \n     on plaintiffs are not extraordinary.\n       There are numerous instances where civil plaintiffs are \n     required to accept the temporary postponement of litigation \n     so that important institutional or public interests can be \n     protected. For example, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil \n     Relief Act of 1940, 50 U.S.C. app. Sec. Sec. 501-25 (1988 & \n     Supp. V 1993), provides that civil claims by or against \n     military personnel are to be tolled and stayed while they are \n     on active duty.\\8\\ Such relief is deemed necessary to enable \n     members of the armed forces ``to devote their entire energy \n     to the defense needs of the Nation.'' 50 U.S.C. app. Sec. 510 \n     (1988). President Clinton here thus seeks relief similar to \n     that to which he may be entitled as Commander-In-Chief of the \n     Armed Forces, and which is routinely available to service \n     members under his command.\n       The so-called automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy \n     Code similarly provides that litigation against a debtor is \n     to be stayed as soon as a party files a bankruptcy petition. \n     That stay affects all litigation that ``was or could have \n     been commenced'' prior to the filing of that petition, 11 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 362 (1994), and ordinarily will remain in effect \n     until the bankruptcy proceeding is completed. Id. \\9\\ Thus, \n     if respondent had sued a party who entered bankruptcy, \n     respondent would automatically find herself in the same \n     position she will be in if the President prevails before the \n     Court--except that the bankruptcy stay is indefinite, while \n     the stay in this case has a definite term, circumscribed by \n     the constitutional limit on a President's tenure in office.\n       It is well established that courts, in appropriate \n     circumstances, may put off civil litigation until the \n     conclusion of a related criminal prosecution against the same \n     defendant.\\10\\ That process may, of course, take several \n     years, and affords the civil plaintiff no relief. The \n     doctrine of primary jurisdiction, where it applies, compels \n     plaintiffs to postpone the litigation of their civil claims \n     while they pursue administrative proceedings, even though the \n     administrative proceedings may not provide the relief they \n     seek. This process too can take several years. See, e.g., \n     Ricci v. Chicago Mercantile Exch., 409 U.S. 289, 306-07 \n     (1973). And public officials who unsuccessfully raise a \n     qualified immunity defense in a trial court are entitled, in \n     the usual case, to a stay of discovery while they pursue an \n     interlocutory appeal. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 \n     (1982). Such appeals can routinely delay litigation for a \n     substantial period.\n       We do not suggest that all of these doctrines operate in \n     exactly the same way as the relief that the President seeks \n     here. But these examples thoroughly dispel any suggestion \n     that the President, in asking that this litigation be \n     deferred, is somehow placing himself ``above the law,'' or \n     that holding this litigation in abeyance would impermissibly \n     violate a plaintiff's entitlement to access to the courts. \n     More specifically, these examples demonstrate that what the \n     President is seeking--the temporary deferral of litigation--\n     is relief that our judicial system routinely provides when \n     significant institutional or public interests are at stake, \n     as they manifestly are here.\n\n    C. The Panel Majority Erred In Asserting Jurisdiction Over, And \n  Reversing, The District Court's Discretionary Decision To Stay The \n           Trial Until After President Clinton Leaves Office\n\n       1. Respondent cross-appealed to challenge the district \n     court's order to stay trial. Ordinarily, a decision by a \n     district court to stay proceedings is not a final decision \n     for purposes of appeal. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. \n     Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 10 n.11 (1983). Such \n     orders may be reviewed on an interlocutory basis only by writ \n     of mandamus. See U.S.C. Sec. 651 (1994).\\11\\ Inserting that \n     jurisdiction existed for her cross-appeal, the respondent did \n     not seek such a writ or contend that the stay was \n     appealable under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291 (1994) as a final \n     order, or as a collateral\n\n[[Page S5537]]\n\n     order under Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 \n     U.S. 541, 546 (1949). Instead respondent asserted, and the \n     panel majority found, that the Court of Appeals had \n     ``pendent appellate jurisdiction'' over respondent's \n     cross-appeal. Pet. App. 5 n.4.\n       In Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n, 115 S. Ct. 1203 (1995), \n     this Court ruled that the notion of ``pendent appellate \n     jurisdiction,'' if viable at all, is extremely narrow in \n     scope (see id. at 1212), and is not to be used ``to parlay \n     Cohen-type collateral orders into multi-issue interlocutory \n     appeal tickets.'' Id. at 1211. The panel majority sought to \n     avoid Swint by declaring that respondent's cross-appeal was \n     ``inextricably intertwined'' with the President's appeal. \n     Pet. App. 5 n.4. This conclusion is incorrect.\n       The question of whether the President is entitled, as a \n     matter of law, to defer this litigation is analytically \n     distinct from the question of whether a district court may \n     exercise its discretion to stay all or part of the \n     litigation. The former question raises an issue of law, to be \n     decided based on the President's constitutional role and the \n     separation of powers principles we have discussed; the latter \n     is a discretionary determination to be made on the basis of \n     the particular facts of the case. Moreover, the legal \n     question of whether a President is entitled to defer \n     litigation is one on which the district court's determination \n     is entitled to no special deference; a court's exercise of \n     discretion to stay proceedings is a determination that can be \n     overturned only for abuse of that discretion.\n       The district court, in deciding to postpone trial in this \n     case, explicitly invoked its discretionary powers over \n     scheduling (Pet. App. 71 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 40 and ``the \n     equity powers of the Court'')), and based its decision not \n     only on the defendant's status as President--certainly a \n     relevant and valid factor--but also on a detailed discussion \n     of the particular circumstances of this case:\n       ``This is not a case in which any necessity exists to rush \n     to trial. It is not a situation, for example, in which \n     someone has been terribly injured in an accident . . . and \n     desperately needs to recover . . . damages. . . . It is not a \n     divorce action, or a child custody or child support case, in \n     which immediate personal needs of other parties are at stake. \n     Neither is this a case that would likely be tried with few \n     demands on Presidential time, such as an in rem foreclosure \n     by a lending institution.''\n       ``The situation here is that the Plaintiff filed this \n     action two days before the three-year statute of limitations \n     expired. Obviously, Plaintiff Jones was in no rush to get her \n     case to court. . . . Consequently, the possibility that Ms. \n     Jones may obtain a judgment and damages in this matter does \n     not appear to be of urgent nature for her, and a delay in \n     trial of the case will not harm her right to recover or cause \n     her undue inconvenience.''\n       Pet App. 70.\n       Review of the district court's discretionary decision to \n     postpone the trial--unlike review of its decision to reject \n     the President's position that the entire case should be \n     deferred as a matter of law--must address these particular \n     facts of this case. Thus the respondent's cross-appeal raised \n     issues that, far from being ``inextricably intertwined'' with \n     the President's submission, can be resolved separately from \n     it. The panel majority's expansion of the court of appeals' \n     jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal was in error.\n       2. The decision to reverse the district court also was \n     incorrect on the merits. As Justice Cardozo explained for \n     this Court in Landis v. North Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248 (1936), a \n     trial judge's decision to stay proceedings should not be \n     lightly overturned:\n       ``[T]he power to stay proceedings is incidental to the \n     power inherent in every court to control the disposition of \n     the causes on its docket. . . . How this can best be done \n     calls for the exercise of judgment, which must weigh \n     competing interests and maintain an even balance.''\n       Id. at 254-55. Indeed, the Court in Landis specifically \n     stated that\n       ``[e]specially in cases extraordinary public moment, the \n     [plaintiff] may be required to submit to delay not immoderate \n     in extent and not oppressive in its consequences if the \n     public welfare or convenience will thereby be promoted.''\n       Id. at 256.\n       The panel majority justified its reversal of the district \n     court with a single sentence in a footnote: ``Such an order, \n     delaying the trial until Mr. Clinton is no longer President, \n     is the functional equivalent of a grant of temporary immunity \n     to which, as we hold today, Mr. Clinton is not \n     constitutionally entitled.'' Pet. App. 13 n.9. It is unclear \n     what the panel meant by labeling the district court's order \n     the ``functional equivalent'' of ``temporary immunity'', \n     inasmuch as the district court held that the litigation could \n     go forward through all steps short of trial. But it is \n     entirely clear that the panel majority, in its sweeping and \n     conclusory ruling, did not begin to conduct the kind of \n     careful weighing of the particular facts and circumstances \n     that might warrant a conclusion that the trial court here \n     abused its discretion.\n\n D. The Court Should Grant Review Now To Protect The Interests Of The \n                               Presidency\n\n       This is the only opportunity for the Court to review the \n     President's claim and grant adequate relief. If review is \n     declined at this point, the case will proceed in the trial \n     court, and the interests the President seeks to preserve by \n     having the litigation deferred--interests ``rooted in the \n     constitutional tradition of the separation of powers''--will \n     be irretrievably lost. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 743, 749. \n     Should the President prevail on the merits below, this Court \n     will not even have the opportunity to provide guidance for \n     future cases.\n       Now, a court for the first time in history has held that a \n     sitting President is required to defend a private civil \n     damages action. This holding breaches historical \n     understandings that are as appropriate today as ever \n     before.\\12\\ The court in Fitzgerald specifically anticipated \n     the threat posed by suits of this kind. Because of ``the \n     sheer prominence of the President's office,'' the Court \n     noted, the President ``would be an easily identifiable target \n     for suits for civil damages.'' 457 U.S. at 752-53. Chief \n     Justice Burger added: ``When litigation processes are not \n     tightly controlled . . . they can be and are used as \n     mechanisms of extortion. Ultimate vindication on the merits \n     does not repair the damage.'' Id. at 763 (concurring \n     opinion). In these circumstances, the fact that there is ``no \n     historical record of numerous suits against the President''--\n     as there was no comparable record before Fitzgerald (id. \n     at 753 n.33)--provides no reassurance at all that this \n     case will be an isolated one.\n       There is no question that the issues raised by this case \n     will have profound consequences for both the Presidency and \n     the Judiciary. The last word on issues of this importance \n     should not be a decision by a splintered panel of a court of \n     appeals--a decision that is inconsistent with the precedents \n     of this Court and with the constitutional tradition of \n     separation of powers. The Court has recognized that a \n     ``special solicitude [is] due to claims alleging a threatened \n     breach of essential Presidential prerogatives under the \n     separation of powers.'' Id. at 743. The Court should grant \n     review now, to protect those prerogatives.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we respectfully request that the \n     President's petition for writ of certiorari be granted.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                                 Robert S.

May 15, 1996.\n       Attorneys for the Petitioner President William Jefferson \n     Clinton.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ The first two counts allege that in 1991, when the \n     President was Governor of Arkansas and respondent a state \n     employee, he subjected respondent to sexual harassment and \n     thereby deprived her of her civil rights in violation of 42 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1983, 1985 (1994). A third claim alleges \n     that the President thereby inflicted emotional distress upon \n     respondent. Finally, the complaint alleges that in 1994, \n     while he was President, petitioner defamed respondent through \n     statements attributed to the White House Press Secretary and \n     his lawyer, denying her much-publicized allegations against \n     the President.\n     Arkansas State Trooper Danny Ferguson was named as \n     codefendant in two counts. Respondent alleges that Trooper \n     Ferguson approached her on the President's behalf, thereby \n     conspiring with the President to deprive the respondent of \n     her civil rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1985. \n     Respondent also alleges that Mr. Ferguson defamed her in \n     statements about a woman identified only as ``Paula,'' which \n     were attributed to an anonymous trooper in an article about \n     President Clinton's personal conduct published in The \n     American Spectator magazine. Neither the publication nor the \n     author was named as a defendant in the suit.\n     \\2\\ The stay of trial encompassed the claims against Trooper \n     Ferguson as well, because the court found that there was \n     ``too much interdependency of events and testimony to proceed \n     piecemeal,'' and that ``it would not be possible to try the \n     Trooper adequately without testimony from the President.'' \n     Pet. App. 71.\n     \\3\\ Jurisdiction for the President's appeal was founded on 28 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1291 (1994) and the collateral order doctrine, as \n     articulated in Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985) \n     and Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 743 (1982). In our \n     view, however, the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to \n     entertain respondent Jones' cross-appeal. See infra pp. 16-\n     19. The district court stayed the litigation as to both \n     defendants pending appellate review. Pet. App. 74.\n     \\4\\ The President reserved the right below to assert at the \n     appropriate time, along with certain common law immunities, \n     the defense of absolute immunity to the defamation claim that \n     arose during his Presidency.\n     \\5\\ See e.g., United States v. McDougal, No. LR-CR-95-173 \n     (E.D. Ark. Mar. 20, 1996) (videotaped deposition at the White \n     House); United States v. Poindexter, 732 F.

Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 941 (1991); United \n     States v. Fromme, 405 F. Supp. 578, 583 (E.D.

Pet. App. 6.\n     \\8\\ Specifically, a lawsuit against an active-duty service \n     member is to be stayed unless it can be shown that the \n     defendant's ``ability . . . To conduct his defense is not \n     materially affected by reason of his military service.'' 50 \n     U.S.C. app. Sec. 521 (1988).\n     \\9\\ Indeed, a bankruptcy judge's discretion has been held \n     sufficient to authorize a stay of third-party litigation in \n     other courts that conceivably could have an effect on the \n     bankruptcy estate, even if the debtor is not a party to the \n     litigation and the automatic stay is not triggered. See 11 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 105 (1994); 2 Collier on Bankruptcy para.105.02 \n     (Lawrence P. King ed., 15th ed. 1994), and cases cited \n     therein.\n     \\10\\ See, e.g., Koester v. American Republic Invs., 11 F.3d \n     818, 823 (8th Cir. 1993); Wehling v. Columbia\n\n[[Page S5538]]\n\n     Broadcasting Sys., 608 F.2d 1084 (5th Cir. 1979); United \n     States v. Mellon Bank, N.A., 545 F.2d 869 (3d Cir. 1976).\n     \\11\\ Some courts recognize that exceptions may exist in cases \n     in which a stay is ``tantamount to a dismissal'' because it \n     ``effectively ends the litigation.'' See, e.g., Boushel v. \n     Toro Co., 985 F.2d 406, 408 (8th Cir. 1993); Cheyney State \n     College Faculty v. Hufstedler, 703 F.2d 732, 735 (3d Cir. \n     1983). Even assuming that this exception should be allowed, \n     it is not applicable here, where the district court's order \n     clearly contemplated further proceedings in federal court. \n     See Boushel, 985 F.2d at 408-09.\n     \\12\\ Heretofore, there have been no private civil damage \n     suits initiated or actively litigated while defendant was \n     serving as President. While there are recorded private civil \n     suits against Theodore Roosevelt, Harry Truman and John F. \n     Kennedy, all were underway before the defendant assumed \n     office. The first two were dismissed by the time the \n     defendant became President; after each took office, the \n     dismissal as confirmed on appeal. See New York ex rel. Hurley \n     v. Roosevelt, 179 N.Y. 544 (1904); DeVault v. Truman, 194 \n     S.W.2d 29 (Mo. 1946). The Kennedy case was filed while he was \n     a candidate, and was settled after President Kennedy's \n     inauguration, without any discovery against the Chief \n     Executive. See, Bailey v. Kennedy, No. 757200, and Hills v. \n     Kennedy, No. 757201 (Los Angeles County Superior Court, both \n     filed Oct. 27, 1960).\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we all ought to recognize this for what \nit is. This is politics; this is an effort to embarrass the President \nof the United States. We all understand that. We all fully appreciate \nwhat is going on here.\n  The fact is, the President has said over and over that the \nConstitution is his source on all that he does. And certainly in this \ncase, that principle is again articulated in the statement made by Mr. \nBennett.\n  The brief refers to five illustrative examples. That is all. They are \nillustrative, they are analogous. In no way does the President rely on \nthe Soldiers' and Sailors' Act for any defense or any exemption from \nlegal action. So this resolution is based on a completely false premise \nand is totally misdirected.\n  We look forward to the opportunity of having many of these debates in \nthe coming months, because if we are going to be devoting our attention \nto this kind of minutiae and this kind of politicization of our debate \nin the coming months, as our colleagues apparently plan to do, we will \nget nothing done in this Senate. But that may be their choice.\n  The fact is, the President clearly has made his case. This amendment \nis in error, and we will have more opportunities to talk about it in \nthe future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment of the \nSenator from Alaska is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 4041) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4022\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of \n     the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required in the \n     Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under this section.\n       (e) Determination of Budget Levels.--For purposes of this \n     section, the levels of new budget authority, outlays, new \n     entitlement authority, and revenues for a fiscal year shall \n     be determined on the basis of estimates made by the Committee \n     on the Budget of the Senate.\n\n     SEC. 202. TAX RESERVE FUND IN THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the Senate, revenue and spending \n     aggregates may be reduced and allocations may be revised for \n     legislation that reduces revenues by providing family tax \n     relief, fuel tax relief, and incentives to stimulate savings, \n     investment, job creation, and economic growth if such \n     legislation will not increase the deficit for--\n       (1) fiscal year 1997;\n       (2) the period of fiscal years 1997 through 2001; or\n       (3) the period of fiscal years 2002 through 2006.\n       (b) Revised Allocations.--Upon the consideration of \n     legislation pursuant to subsection (a), the Chairman of the \n     Committee on the Budget of the Senate may file with the \n     Senate appropriately revised allocations under sections \n     302(a) and 602(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and \n     revised functional levels and aggregates to carry out this \n     section. These revised allocations, functional levels, and \n     aggregates shall be considered for the purposes of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 as allocations, functional \n     levels, and aggregates contained in this resolution.\n       (c) Reporting Revised Allocations.--The appropriate \n     committee shall report appropriately revised allocations \n     pursuant to sections 302(b) and 602(b) of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974 to carry out this section.\n\n     SEC. 203. SUPERFUND RESERVE FUND IN THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--After the enactment of legislation that \n     reforms the Superfund program and extends Superfund taxes, in \n     the Senate, budget authority and outlays allocated to the \n     Committee on Appropriations under sections 302(a) and 602(a) \n     of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the appropriate \n     functional levels, the appropriate budget aggregates, and the \n     discretionary spending limits in section 201 of this \n     resolution may be revised to provide additional budget \n     authority and the outlays flowing from that budget authority \n     for the Superfund program, pursuant to this section.\n       (b) Deficit Neutral Adjustments.--\n       (1) Allocations.--\n       (A) Committee allocations.--In the Senate, upon reporting \n     of an appropriations measure, or when a conference committee \n     submits a conference report thereon, that appropriates funds \n     for the Superfund program in excess of $1,302,000,000, the \n     chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may \n     submit revised allocations, functional levels, budget \n     aggregates, and discretionary spending limits to carry out \n     this section that adds to such allocations, levels, \n     aggregates, and limits an amount that is equal to such \n     excess. These revised allocations, levels, aggregates, and \n     limits shall be considered for the purposes of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 as the allocations, levels, \n     aggregates, and limits contained in this resolution.\n       (B) Committee suballocations.--The Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate may report appropriately revised \n     suballocations pursuant to sections 302(b)(1) and 602(b)(1) \n     of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 following the \n     revision of the allocations pursuant to subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Limitations.--The adjustments under this subsection \n     shall not exceed--\n       (A) the net revenue increase for a fiscal year resulting \n     from the enactment of legislation that extends Superfund \n     taxes; and\n       (B) $898,000,000 in budget authority for a fiscal year and \n     the outlays flowing from such budget authority in all fiscal \n     years.\n\n     SEC. 204. SCORING OF EMERGENCY LEGISLATION.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 606(d)(2) of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974, the determinations under sections 302, \n     303, 311, and 602 of such Act shall take into account any new \n     budget authority, new entitlement authority, outlays, \n     receipts, or deficit effects as a consequence of the \n     provisions of sections 251(b)(2)(D) and 252(e) of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\n     SEC. 205. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.\n\n       The Congress adopts the provisions of this title--\n\n[[Page S5544]]\n\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such \n     they shall be considered as part of the rules of each House, \n     or of that House to which they specifically apply, and such \n     rules shall supersede other rules only to the extent that \n     they are inconsistent therewith; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change those rules (so far as they relate to \n     that House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same \n     extent as in the case of any other rule of that House.\n TITLE III--SENSE OF THE CONGRESS, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND SENATE\n\n     SEC. 301. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON SALE OF GOVERNMENT ASSETS.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the prohibition on scoring asset sales has discouraged \n     the sale of assets that can be better managed by the private \n     sector and generate receipts to reduce the Federal budget \n     deficit;\n       (2) the President's fiscal year 1997 budget included \n     $3,900,000,000 in receipts from asset sales and proposed a \n     change in the asset sale scoring rule to allow the proceeds \n     from these sales to be scored;\n       (3) assets should not be sold if such sale would increase \n     the budget deficit over the long run; and\n       (4) the asset sale scoring prohibition should be repealed \n     and consideration should be given to replacing it with a \n     methodology that takes into account the long-term budgetary \n     impact of asset sales.\n       (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``sale of an asset'' shall have the same meaning as under \n     section 250(c)(21) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\n     SEC. 302. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS THAT TAX REDUCTIONS SHOULD \n                   BENEFIT WORKING FAMILIES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that this concurrent \n     resolution on the budget assumes any reductions in taxes \n     should be structured to benefit working families by providing \n     family tax relief and incentives to stimulate savings, \n     investment, job creation, and economic growth.\n\n     SEC. 303. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON A BIPARTISAN COMMISSION ON \n                   THE SOLVENCY OF MEDICARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Trustees of medicare have concluded that ``the \n     medicare program is clearly unsustainable in its present \n     form'';\n       (2) the Trustees of medicare concluded in 1995 that ``the \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which pays inpatient hospital \n     expenses, will be able to pay benefits for only about 7 years \n     and is severely out of financial balance in the long range'';\n       (3) preliminary data made available to the Congress \n     indicate that the Hospital Trust Fund will go bankrupt in the \n     year 2001, rather than the year 2002, as predicted last year;\n       (4) the Public Trustees of medicare have concluded that \n     ``the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund shows a rate \n     of growth of costs which is clearly unsustainable'';\n       (5) the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform \n     concluded that, absent long-term changes in medicare, \n     projected medicare outlays will increase from about 4 percent \n     of the payroll tax base today to over 15 percent of the \n     payroll tax base by the year 2030;\n       (6) the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform \n     recommended, by a vote of 30 to 1, that spending and revenues \n     available for medicare must be brought into long-term \n     balance; and\n       (7) in the most recent Trustees' report, the Public \n     Trustees of medicare ``strongly recommend that the crisis \n     presented by the financial condition of the medicare trust \n     funds be urgently addressed on a comprehensive basis, \n     including a review of the program's financing methods, \n     benefit provisions, and delivery mechanisms.''.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that in order to meet the aggregates and levels in this \n     budget resolution--\n       (1) a special bipartisan commission should be established \n     immediately to make recommendations concerning the most \n     appropriate response to the short-term solvency and long-term \n     sustainability issues facing the medicare program; and\n       (2) the commission should report to Congress its \n     recommendations prior to the adoption of a concurrent budget \n     resolution for fiscal year 1998 in order that the committees \n     of jurisdiction may consider these recommendations in \n     fashioning an appropriate congressional response.\n\n     SEC. 304. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON CONSIDERING A CHANGE IN THE \n                   MINIMUM WAGE IN THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) proposals to increase the minimum wage have important \n     economic and budgetary consequences, as there are about \n     3,600,000 workers at or below the minimum wage under current \n     law, according to the Congressional Budget Office (``CBO'');\n       (2) S. 413, a bill to increase the minimum wage, would \n     increase costs for State and local governments by \n     $1,030,000,000 over the period 1996 to 2000, according to the \n     CBO, and would, therefore, violate section 425(a)(2) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 regarding unfunded \n     intergovernmental mandates;\n       (3) S. 413 would increase costs for the private sector by \n     $12,300,000,000 over the period 1996 to 2000 and would reduce \n     jobs by between 100,000 and 500,000, according to the CBO;\n       (4) increasing the minimum wage would have significant \n     interactions with other Federal spending and tax programs, \n     including welfare programs and the earned income credit;\n       (5) States have the authority to increase the minimum wage \n     in their States, and, as of February 1996, 10 States, plus \n     Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., had minimum wages above the \n     Federal minimum wage;\n       (6) although raising the minimum wage will increase incomes \n     for some workers, it is a poorly targeted approach to helping \n     poor and low-income families because--\n       (A) it will eliminate jobs for some minimum- and low-wage \n     workers;\n       (B) 85 percent of workers in poor families are paid more \n     than the minimum wage, and nearly 60 percent are paid more \n     than $5.25 per hour, according to the CBO;\n       (C) most minimum wage workers are not poor, with some 70 \n     percent in households with incomes above 150 percent of the \n     poverty line, according to the CBO; and\n       (D) most minimum wage workers do not stay at the minimum \n     wage very long, with two-thirds getting a pay raise within \n     the first year, according to the CBO;\n       (7) the best approach to increasing wages and incomes for \n     working families is to promote policies that enhance economic \n     growth and job creation, such as increasing net national \n     savings and investment by balancing the Federal budget and \n     promoting private savings and investment through fundamental \n     tax reform;\n       (8) legislation to change the minimum wage should be \n     considered in the Senate in an orderly manner as part of the \n     regular consideration of matters related to the budget and \n     the economy and not as an unscheduled amendment to unrelated \n     legislation;\n       (9) there are important issues which should be considered \n     in the same legislation and in conjunction with proposals to \n     raise the minimum wage, such as allowing for improvements in \n     the workplace by enabling cooperative efforts between labor \n     and management as provided for in S. 295, the Team Work for \n     Employees and Management Act of 1995, and maintaining a \n     training wage to minimize job loss for new entrants into the \n     job market; and\n       (10) the Senate should schedule consideration of \n     legislation that addresses in the same bill, as a single \n     proposal, the minimum wage and the provisions of S. 295 no \n     later than the month of June 1996.\n\n     SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON LONG-TERM PROJECTIONS IN \n                   BUDGET ESTIMATES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the report accompanying a concurrent resolution on the \n     budget should include an analysis, prepared after \n     consultation with the Director of the Congressional Budget \n     Office, of the concurrent resolution's impact on revenues and \n     outlays for entitlements for the period of 30 fiscal years; \n     and\n       (2) the President should include in his budget each year, \n     an analysis of the budget's impact on revenues and outlays \n     for entitlements for the period of 30 fiscal years, and that \n     the President should also include generational accounting \n     information each year in the President's budget.\n\n     SEC. 306. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON MEDICARE TRANSFERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) home health care provides a broad spectrum of health \n     and social services to approximately 3,500,000 medicare \n     beneficiaries in the comfort of their homes;\n       (2) the President has proposed reimbursing the first 100 \n     home health care visits after a hospital stay through \n     medicare part A and reimbursing all other visits through \n     medicare part B, shifting responsibility for $55,000,000,000 \n     of spending from the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund to the \n     general revenues that pay for medicare part B;\n       (3) such a transfer does nothing to control medicare \n     spending, and is merely a bookkeeping change which \n     artificially extends the solvency of the Hospital Insurance \n     Trust Fund;\n       (4) this transfer of funds camouflages the need to make \n     changes in the medicare program to ensure the long-term \n     solvency of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which the \n     Congressional Budget Office now states will become bankrupt \n     in the year 2001, a year earlier than projected in the 1995 \n     report by the Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare \n     Trust Funds;\n       (5) Congress will be breaking a commitment to the American \n     people if it does not act to ensure the solvency of the \n     entire medicare program in both the short- and long-term;\n       (6) the President's proposal would force those in need of \n     chronic care services to rely upon the availability of \n     general revenues to provide financing for these services, \n     making them more vulnerable to benefits changes than under \n     current law; and\n       (7) according to the National Association of Home Care, \n     shifting medicare home care payments from part A to part B \n     would deemphasize the importance of home care by eliminating \n     its status as part of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, \n     thereby undermining access to the less costly form of care.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that in \n     meeting the spending targets specified in the budget \n     resolution, Congress should not accept the President's \n     proposal to transfer spending from one part of medicare to \n     another in its efforts to preserve, protect, and improve the \n     medicare program.\n\n     SEC. 307. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON REPEAL OF THE GAS TAX.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the President originally proposed a $72,000,000,000 \n     energy excise tax (the so-called BTU tax) as part of the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 93) which \n     included a new tax on transportation fuels;\n       (2) in response to opposition in the Senate to the BTU tax, \n     the President and the Congress adopted instead a new 4.3 \n     cents per gallon transportation fuels tax as part of OBRA 93, \n     which represented a 30 percent increase in the existing motor \n     fuels tax;\n\n[[Page S5545]]\n\n       (3) the OBRA 93 transportation fuels tax has cost American \n     motorists an estimated $14,000,000,000 to $15,000,000,000 \n     since it went into effect on October 1, 1993;\n       (4) the OBRA 93 transportation fuels tax is regressive, \n     creating a larger financial impact on lower and middle income \n     motorists than on upper income motorists;\n       (5) the OBRA 93 transportation fuels tax imposes a \n     disproportionate burden on rural citizens who do not have \n     access to public transportation services, and who must rely \n     on their automobiles and drive long distances, to work, to \n     shop, and to receive medical care;\n       (6) the average American faces a substantial tax burden, \n     and the increase of this tax burden through the OBRA 93 \n     transportation fuels tax represented and continues to \n     represent an inappropriate and unwarranted means of reducing \n     the Nation's budget deficit;\n       (7) retail gasoline prices in the United States have \n     increased an average of 19 cents per gallon since the \n     beginning of the year to the highest level since the Persian \n     Gulf War, and the OBRA 93 transportation fuels tax \n     exacerbates the impact of this price increase on consumers;\n       (8) continuation of the OBRA 93 transportation fuels tax \n     will exacerbate the impact on consumers of any future \n     gasoline price spikes that result from market conditions; and\n       (9) the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution will assume a \n     net tax cut totaling $122,000,000,000 over six years, which \n     exceeds the revenue impact of a repeal of the OBRA 93 \n     transportation fuels tax, and will establish a reserve fund \n     which may be used to provide other forms of tax relief, \n     including relief from the OBRA 93 transportation fuels tax, \n     on a deficit neutral basis.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the revenue levels and procedures in this resolution \n     provide that--\n       (1) the Congress and the President should immediately \n     approve legislation to repeal the 4.3 cents per gallon \n     transportation fuels tax contained in the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1993 through the end of 1996;\n       (2) the Congress and the President should approve, through \n     the fiscal year 1997 budget process, legislation to \n     permanently repeal the 4.3 cents per gallon transportation \n     fuels tax contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act \n     of 1993; and\n       (3) the savings generated by the repeal of the 4.3 cents \n     per gallon transportation fuels tax contained in OBRA 93 \n     should be fully passed on to consumers.\n\n     SEC. 308. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MEDICARE TRUSTEES REPORT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Trustees of the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) \n     Trust Fund serve as fiduciaries for one of the Federal \n     Government's most important programs, and as fiduciaries \n     provide critically important information each year to the \n     Congress and the public on the financial status of the \n     Medicare HI Fund;\n       (2) the Trustees are required to issue a report on the \n     financial status of the medicare HI Trust Fund by April 1 of \n     each year;\n       (3) the April 1995 Trustees Report stated that the Medicare \n     HI Trust Fund would go bankrupt in the year 2002, but in 1995 \n     the Congress and the President could not agree on a plan to \n     extend the solvency of the medicare program;\n       (4) in 1996, the Congress and the public require timely \n     information on the full and exact nature of medicare's \n     financial condition in order to understand what actions must \n     be taken to extend the solvency of the of the Medicare HI \n     Trust Fund; and\n       (5) despite the April 1 deadline, the 1996 Medicare \n     Trustees Report has not yet been issued, and each day of \n     delay further jeopardizes Congress' ability to respond \n     appropriately to forestall the program's bankruptcy.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this budget resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Medicare Trustees should discharge their fiduciary \n     and statutory responsibilities and issue their 1996 report as \n     soon as possible; and\n       (2) in light of the Trustees' delay thus far, the Chief \n     Actuary of the Medicare Trust Fund should share with Congress \n     immediately any preliminary information on the current \n     financial status of the Trust Fund.\n\n     SEC. 309. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING CHANGES IN THE \n                   MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that, in achieving the \n     spending levels specified in this resolution--\n       (1) the public trustees of medicare have concluded that \n     ``the medicare program is clearly unsustainable in its \n     present form'';\n       (2) the President has said his goal is to keep the medicare \n     hospital insurance trust fund solvent for more than a decade, \n     but his budget transfers $55,000,000,000 of home health \n     spending from medicare part A to medicare part B;\n       (3) the transfer of home health spending threatens the \n     delivery of home health services to 3.5 million medicare \n     beneficiaries;\n       (4) such a transfer increases the burden on general \n     revenues, including income taxes paid by working Americans, \n     by $55,000,000,000;\n       (5) such a transfer artificially inflates the solvency of \n     the medicare hospital insurance trust fund, misleading the \n     Congress, medicare beneficiaries, and working taxpayers;\n       (6) the Director of the Congressional Budget Office has \n     certified that, without such a transfer, the President's \n     budget extends the solvency of the hospital insurance trust \n     fund for only one additional year; and\n       (7) without misleading transfers, the President's budget \n     therefore fails to achieve his own stated goal for the \n     medicare hospital insurance trust fund.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that, in achieving the spending levels specified in this \n     resolution, the Congress assumes that the Congress would--\n       (1) keep the medicare hospital insurance trust fund solvent \n     for more than a decade, as recommended by the President; and\n       (2) accept the President's proposed level of medicare part \n     B savings of $44,100,000,000 over the period 1997 through \n     2002; but would\n       (3) reject the President's proposal to transfer home health \n     spending from one part of medicare to another, which \n     threatens the delivery of home health care services to 3.5 \n     million medicare beneficiaries, artificially inflates the \n     solvency of the medicare hospital insurance trust fund, and \n     increases the burden on general revenues, including income \n     taxes paid by working Americans, by $55,000,000,000.\n\n     SEC. 310. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FUNDING TO ASSIST YOUTH AT \n                   RISK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) there is an increasing prevalence of violence and drug \n     use among this country's youth;\n       (2) recognizing the magnitude of this problem the Federal \n     Government must continue to maximize efforts in addressing \n     the increasing prevalence of violence and drug use among this \n     country's youth, with necessary adherence to budget \n     guidelines;\n       (3) the Federal Bureau of Investigation reports that \n     between 1985 and 1994, juvenile arrests for violent crime \n     increased by 75 percent nationwide;\n       (4) the United States Attorney General reports that 20 \n     years ago, fewer than half our cities reported gang activity \n     and now, a generation later, reasonable estimates indicate \n     that there are more than 500,000 gang members in more than \n     16,000 gangs on the streets of our cities resulting in more \n     than 580,000 gang-related crimes in 1993;\n       (5) the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention reports that in 1994, law enforcement \n     agencies made over 2,700,000 arrests of persons under age 18, \n     with juveniles accounting for 19 percent of all violent crime \n     arrests across the country;\n       (6) the Congressional Task Force on National Drug Policy \n     recently set forth a series of recommendations for \n     strengthening the criminal justice and law enforcement \n     effort, including domestic prevention efforts reinforcing the \n     idea that prevention begins at home;\n       (7) the Office of National Drug Control Policy reports that \n     between 1991 and 1995, marijuana use among 8th, 10th, and \n     12th graders has increased and is continuing to spiral \n     upward; and\n       (8) the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention reports that \n     in 1993, substance abuse played a role in over 70 percent of \n     rapes, over 60 percent of incidents of child abuse, and \n     almost 60 percent of murders nationwide.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying this concurrent \n     resolution on the budget assume that--\n       (1) sufficient funding should be provided to programs which \n     assist youth at risk to reduce illegal drug use and the \n     incidence of youth crime and violence;\n       (2) priority should be given to determine ``what works'' \n     through scientifically recognized, independent evaluations of \n     existing  programs to maximize the Federal investment; and\n       (3) efforts should be made to ensure coordination and \n     eliminate duplication among federally supported at-risk youth \n     programs. \n\n     SEC. 311. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE USE OF BUDGETARY \n                   SAVINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in August of 1994, the Bipartisan Commission on \n     Entitlement and Tax Reform issued an Interim Report to the \n     President, which found that, ``To ensure that today's debt \n     and spending commitments do not unfairly burden America's \n     children, the Government must act now. A bipartisan coalition \n     of Congress, led by the President, must resolve the long-term \n     imbalance between the Government's entitlement promises and \n     the funds it will have available to pay for them'';\n       (2) unless the Congress and the President act together in a \n     bipartisan way, overall Federal spending is projected by the \n     Commission to rise from the current level of slightly over 22 \n     percent of the Gross Domestic Product of the United States \n     (hereafter in this section referred as ``GDP'') to over 37 \n     percent of GDP by the year 2030;\n       (3) the source of that growth is not domestic discretionary \n     spending, which is approximately the same portion of GDP now \n     as it was in 1969, the last time at which the Federal budget \n     was in balance;\n       (4) mandatory spending was only 29.6 percent of the Federal \n     budget in 1963, but is estimated to account for 72 percent of \n     the Federal budget in the year 2003;\n       (5) social security, medicare and medicaid, together with \n     interest on the national debt, are the largest sources of the \n     growth of mandatory spending;\n       (6) ensuring the long-term future of the social security \n     system is essential to protecting the retirement security of \n     the American people;\n       (7) the Social Security Trust Fund is projected to begin \n     spending more than it takes in by approximately the year \n     2013, with Federal budget deficits rising rapidly thereafter \n     unless appropriate policy changes are made;\n       (8) ensuring the future of medicare and medicaid is \n     essential to protecting access to high-quality health care \n     for senior citizens and poor women and children;\n       (9) Federal health care expenses have been rising at double \n     digit rates, and are projected to triple to 11 percent of GDP \n     by the year 2030 unless appropriate policy changes are made; \n     and\n       (10) due to demographic factors, Federal health care \n     expenses are projected to double by the year 2030, even if \n     health care cost inflation is restrained after 1999, so that \n     costs for each person of a given age grow no faster than the \n     economy.\n\n[[Page S5546]]\n\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that budget savings in the mandatory spending area should be \n     used--\n       (1) to protect and enhance the retirement security of the \n     American people by ensuring the long-term future of the \n     social security system;\n       (2) to protect and enhance the health care security of \n     senior citizens and poor Americans by ensuring the long-term \n     future of medicare and medicaid; and\n       (3) to restore and maintain Federal budget discipline, to \n     ensure that the level of private investment necessary for \n     long-term economic growth and prosperity is available.\n\n     SEC. 312. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE TRANSFER OF \n                   EXCESS GOVERNMENT COMPUTERS TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS.\n\n       (a) Assumptions.--The figures contained in this resolution \n     are based on the following assumptions:\n       (1) America's children must obtain the necessary skills and \n     tools needed to succeed in the technologically advanced 21st \n     century;\n       (2) Executive Order 12999 outlines the need to make modern \n     computer technology an integral part of every classroom, \n     provide teachers with the professional development they need \n     to use new technologies effectively, connect classrooms to \n     the National Information Infrastructure, and encourage the \n     creation of excellent education software;\n       (3) many private corporations have donated educational \n     software to schools, which are lacking the necessary computer \n     hardware to utilize this equipment;\n       (4) current inventories of excess Federal Government \n     computers are being conducted in each Federal agency; and\n       (5) there is no current communication being made between \n     Federal agencies with this excess equipment and the schools \n     in need of these computers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals and reconciliation instructions in \n     this budget resolution assume that the General Services \n     Administration should place a high priority on facilitating \n     direct transfer of excess Federal Government computers to \n     public schools and community-based educational organizations.\n\n     SEC. 313. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FEDERAL RETREATS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the functional totals in this resolution assume \n     that all Federal agencies will refrain from using Federal \n     funds for expenses incurred during training sessions or \n     retreats off of Federal property, unless Federal property is \n     not available.\n\n     SEC. 314. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ESSENTIAL AIR \n                   SERVICE PROGRAM OF THE DEPARTMENT OF \n                   TRANSPORTATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the essential air service program of the Department of \n     Transportation under subchapter II of chapter 417 of title \n     49, United States Code--\n       (A) provides essential airline access to isolated rural \n     communities across the United States;\n       (B) is necessary for the economic growth and development of \n     rural communities;\n       (C) connects small rural communities to the national air \n     transportation system of the United States;\n       (D) is a critical component of the national transportation \n     system of the United States; and\n       (E) provides air service to 108 communities in 30 States; \n     and\n       (2) the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive \n     Airline Industry established under section 204 of the Airport \n     and Airway Safety, Capacity, Noise Improvement, and \n     Intermodal Transportation Act of 1992 recommended maintaining \n     the essential air service program with a sufficient level of \n     funding to continue to provide air service to small \n     communities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the essential air service program of the Department of \n     Transportation under subchapter II of chapter 417 of title \n     49, United States Code, should receive a sufficient level of \n     funding to continue to provide air service to small rural \n     communities that qualify for assistance under the program.\n\n     SEC. 315. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING EQUAL RETIREMENT \n                   SAVINGS FOR HOMEMAKERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that the assumptions of \n     this budget resolution take into account that--\n       (1) by teaching and feeding our children and caring for our \n     elderly, American homemakers are an important, vital part of \n     our society;\n       (2) homemakers retirement needs are the same as all \n     Americans, and thus they need every opportunity to save and \n     invest for retirement;\n       (3) because they are living on a single income, homemakers \n     and their spouses often have less income for savings;\n       (4) individual retirement accounts are provided by the \n     Congress in the Internal Revenue Code to assist Americans for \n     retirement savings;\n       (5) currently, individual retirement accounts permit \n     workers other than homemakers to make deductible \n     contributions of $2,000 a year, but limit homemakers to \n     deductible contributions of $250 a year;\n       (6) limiting homemakers individual retirement account \n     contributions to an amount less than the contributions of \n     other workers discriminates against homemakers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the revenue level assumed in this budget resolution \n     provides for legislation to make individual retirement \n     account deductible contribution limits for homemakers equal \n     to the individual retirement account deductible contribution \n     limits for all other American workers, and that the Congress \n     and the President should immediately approve such legislation \n     in the appropriate reconciliation vehicle.\n\n     SEC. 316. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NATIONAL \n                   INSTITUTE OF DRUG ABUSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Institute on Drug Abuse (hereafter \n     referred to in this section as ``NIDA'') a part of the \n     National Institutes of Health (hereafter referred to in this \n     section as ``NIH'') supports over 85 percent of the world's \n     drug abuse research that has totally revolutionized our \n     understanding of addiction.\n       (2) One of NIDA's most significant areas of research has \n     been the identification of the neurobiological bases of all \n     aspects of addiction, including craving.\n       (3) In 1993, NIDA announced that approval had been granted \n     by the Food and Drug Administration of a new medication for \n     the treatment of heroin and other opiate addiction which \n     breaks the addict of daily drug-seeking behavior and allows \n     for greater compliance because the patient does not need to \n     report to a clinic each day to have the medication \n     administered.\n       (4) Among NIDA's most remarkable accomplishments of the \n     past year is the successful immunization of animals against \n     the psycho-stimulant effects of cocaine.\n       (5) NIDA has also recently announced that it is making \n     substantial progress that is critical in directing their \n     efforts to identify potential anti-cocaine medications. For \n     example, NIDA researchers have recently shown that activation \n     in the brain of one type of dopamine receptor suppresses \n     drug-seeking behavior and relapse, whereas activation of \n     another, triggers drug-seeking behavior.\n       (6) NIDA's efforts to speed up research to stem the tide of \n     drug addition is in the best interest of all Americans.\n       (7) State and local governments spend billions of dollars \n     to incarcerate persons who commit drug related offenses.\n       (8) A 1992 National Report by the Bureau of Justice \n     Statistics revealed that more than 3 out of 4 jail inmates \n     reported drug use in their lifetime, more than 40 percent had \n     used drugs in the month before their offense with 27 percent \n     under the influence of drugs at the time of their offense. A \n     significant number said they were trying to get money for \n     drugs when they committed their crime.\n       (9) More than 60 percent of juveniles and young adults in \n     State-operated juvenile institutions reported using drugs \n     once a week or more for at least a month some time in the \n     past, and almost 40 percent reported being under the \n     influence of drugs at the time of their offense.\n       (10) This concurrent resolution proposes that budget \n     authority for the NIH (including NIDA) be held constant at \n     the fiscal year 1996 level of $11,950,000,000 through fiscal \n     year 2002.\n       (11) At such appropriation level, it would be impossible \n     for NIH and NIDA to maintain research momentum through \n     research project grants.\n       (12) Level funding for NIH in fiscal year 1997 would reduce \n     the number of competing research project grants by nearly \n     500, from 6,620 in fiscal year 1996 to approximately 6,120 \n     competing research project grants, reducing NIH's ability to \n     maintain research momentum and to explore new ideas in \n     research.\n       (13) NIH is the world's preeminent research institution \n     dedicated to the support of science inspired by and focused \n     on the challenges of human illness and health.\n       (14) NIH programs are instrumental in improving the quality \n     of life for Americans through improving health and reducing \n     monetary and personal costs of illnesses.\n       (15) The discovery of an anti-addiction drug to block the \n     craving of illicit addictive substances will benefit all of \n     American society.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that amounts appropriated for the National Institutes of \n     Health--\n       (1) for fiscal year 1997 should be increased by a minimum \n     of $33,000,000;\n       (2) for fiscal year 1998 should be increased by a minimum \n     of $67,000,000;\n       (3) for fiscal year 1999 should be increased by a minimum \n     of $100,000,000;\n       (4) for fiscal year 2000 should be increased by a minimum \n     of $100,000,000;\n       (5) for fiscal year 2001 should be increased by a minimum \n     of $100,000,000; and\n       (6) for fiscal year 2002 should be increased by a minimum \n     of $100,000,000;\n\n     above its fiscal year 1996 appropriation for additional \n     research into an anti-addiction drug to block the craving of \n     illicit addictive substances.\n\n     SEC. 317. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE EXTENSION OF THE \n                   EMPLOYER EDUCATION ASSISTANCE EXCLUSION UNDER \n                   SECTION 127 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF \n                   1986.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) since 1978, over 7,000,000 American workers have \n     benefited from the employer education assistance exclusion \n     under section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by \n     being able to improve their education and acquire new skills \n     without having to pay taxes on the benefit;\n       (2) American companies have benefited by improving the \n     education and skills of their employees who in turn can \n     contribute more to their company;\n       (3) the American economy becomes more globally competitive \n     because an educated workforce is able to produce more and to \n     adapt more rapidly to changing technologies;\n       (4) American companies are experiencing unprecedented \n     global competition and the value and necessity of life-long \n     education for their employees has increased;\n       (5) the employer education assistance exclusion was first \n     enacted in 1978;\n       (6) the exclusion has been extended 7 previous times;\n       (7) the last extension expired December 31, 1994; and\n       (8) the exclusion has received broad bipartisan support.\n\n[[Page S5547]]\n\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the revenue level assumed in the Budget Resolution \n     accommodate an extension of the employer education assistance \n     exclusion under section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1996.\n\n     SEC. 318. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ECONOMIC \n                   DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION PLACING HIGH \n                   PRIORITY ON MAINTAINING FIELD-BASED ECONOMIC \n                   DEVELOPMENT REPRESENTATIVES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Economic Development Administration plays a crucial \n     role in helping economically disadvantaged regions of the \n     United States develop infrastructure that supports and \n     promotes greater economic activity and growth, particularly \n     in nonurban regions.\n       (2) The Economic Development Administration helps to \n     promote industrial park development, business incubators, \n     water and sewer system improvements, vocational and technical \n     training facilities, tourism development strategies, \n     technical assistance and capacity building for local \n     governments, economic adjustment strategies, revolving loan \n     funds, and other projects which the private sector has not \n     generated or will not generate without some assistance from \n     the Government through the Economic Development \n     Administration.\n       (3) The Economic Development Administration maintains 6 \n     regional offices which oversee staff that are designated \n     field-based representatives of the Economic Development \n     Administration, and these field-based representatives provide \n     valuable expertise and counseling on economic planning and \n     development to nonurban communities.\n       (4) The Economic Development Administration Regional \n     Centers are located in the urban areas of Austin, Seattle, \n     Denver, Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Chicago.\n       (5) Because of a 37-percent reduction in approved funding \n     for salaries and expenses from fiscal year 1995, the Economic \n     Development Administration has initiated staff reductions \n     requiring the elimination of 8 field-based positions. The \n     field-based economic development representative positions \n     that are either being eliminated or not replaced after \n     voluntary retirement and which currently interact with \n     nonurban communities on economic development efforts cover \n     the States of New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, North Dakota, \n     Oklahoma, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Connecticut, Rhode \n     Island, and North Carolina.\n       (6) These staff cutbacks will adversely affect States with \n     very low per-capita personal income, including New Mexico \n     which ranks 47th in the Nation in per-capita personal income, \n     Oklahoma ranking 46th, North Dakota ranking 42nd, Arizona \n     ranking 35th, Maine ranking 34th, and North Carolina ranking \n     33rd.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals and reconciliations instructions \n     underlying this budget resolution assume that--\n       (1) it is regrettable that the Economic Development \n     Administration has elected to reduce field-based economic \n     development representatives who are fulfilling the Economic \n     Development Administration's mission of interacting with and \n     counseling nonurban communities in economically disadvantaged \n     regions of the United States;\n       (2) the Economic Development Administration should take all \n     necessary and appropriate actions to ensure that field-based \n     economic development representation receives high priority; \n     and\n       (3) the Economic Development Administration should \n     reconsider the planned termination of field-based economic \n     development representatives responsible for States that are \n     economically disadvantaged, and that this reconsideration \n     take place without delay.\n\n     SEC. 319. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Corporations and individuals have clear responsibility \n     to adhere to environmental laws. When they do not, and \n     environmental damage results, the Federal and State \n     governments may impose fines and penalties, and assess \n     polluters for the cost of remediation.\n       (2) Assessment of these costs is important in the \n     enforcement process. They appropriately penalize wrongdoing. \n     They discourage future environmental damage. They ensure that \n     taxpayers do not bear the financial brunt of cleaning up \n     after damages done by polluters.\n       (3) In the case of the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster in \n     Prince William Sound, Alaska, for example, the corporate \n     settlement with the Federal Government totaled $900,000,000.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that assumptions in this resolution assume an appropriate \n     amount of revenues per year through legislation that will not \n     allow deductions for fines and penalties arising from a \n     failure to comply with Federal or State environmental or \n     health protection laws.\n\n     SEC. 320. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.\n\n       The assumptions underlying functional totals and \n     reconciliation instructions in this budget resolution \n     include:\n       (1) Findings.--The Senate finds that:\n       (A) Violence against women is the leading cause of physical \n     injury to women. The Department of Justice estimates that \n     over 1 million violent crimes against women are committed by \n     domestic partners annually.\n       (B) Domestic violence dramatically affects the victim's \n     ability to participate in the workforce. A University of \n     Minnesota survey reported that one-quarter of battered women \n     surveyed had lost a job partly because of being abused and \n     that over half of these women had been harassed by their \n     abuser at work.\n       (C) Domestic violence is often intensified as women seek to \n     gain economic independence through attending school or job \n     training programs. Batterers have been reported to prevent \n     women from attending such programs or sabotage their efforts \n     at self-improvement.\n       (D) Nationwide surveys of service providers prepared by the \n     Taylor Institute of Chicago, Document, for the first time, \n     the interrelationship between domestic violence and welfare \n     by showing that between 50 percent and 80 percent of women in \n     welfare to work programs are current or past victims of \n     domestic violence.\n       (E) The American Psychological Association has reported \n     that violence against women is usually witnessed by their \n     children, who as a result can suffer severe psychological, \n     cognitive and physical damage and some studies have found \n     that children who witness violence in their homes have a \n     greater propensity to commit violent acts in their homes and \n     communities when they become adults.\n       (F) Over half of the women surveyed by the Taylor Institute \n     stayed with their batterers because they lacked the resources \n     to support themselves and their children. The surveys also \n     found that the availability of economic support is a critical \n     factor in women's ability to leave abusive situations that \n     threaten themselves and their children.\n       (G) Proposals to restructure the welfare programs may \n     impact the availability of the economic support and the \n     safety net necessary to enable poor women to flee abuse \n     without risking homelessness and starvation for their \n     families.\n       (2) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that:\n       (A) No welfare reform provision should be enacted by \n     Congress unless and until Congress considers whether such \n     welfare reform provisions would exacerbate violence against \n     women and their children, further endanger women's lives, \n     make it more difficult for women to escape domestic violence, \n     or further punish women victimized by violence.\n       (B) Any welfare reform measure enacted by Congress should \n     require that any welfare to work, education, or job placement \n     programs implemented by the States address the impact of \n     domestic violence on welfare recipients.\n\n     SEC. 321. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING STUDENT LOANS\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) over the last 60 years, education and advancements in \n     knowledge have accounted for 37 percent of our nation's \n     economic growth;\n       (2) a college degree significantly increases job stability, \n     resulting in an unemployment rate among college graduates \n     less than half that of those with high school diplomas;\n       (3) a person with a bachelor's degree will average 50-55 \n     percent more in lifetime earnings than a person with a high \n     school diploma;\n       (4) education is a key to providing alternatives to crime \n     and violence, and is a cost-effective strategy for breaking \n     cycles of poverty and moving welfare recipients to work;\n       (5) a highly educated populace is necessary to the \n     effective functioning of democracy and to a growing economy, \n     and the opportunity to gain a college education helps advance \n     the American ideals of progress and social equality;\n       (6) a highly educated and flexible work force is an \n     essential component of economic growth and competitiveness;\n       (7) for many families, Federal Student Aid Programs make \n     the difference in the ability of students to attend college;\n       (8) in 1994, nearly 6 million postsecondary students \n     received some kind of financial assistance to help them pay \n     for the costs of schooling;\n       (9) since 1988, college costs have risen by 54 percent, and \n     student borrowing has increased by 219 percent; and\n       (10) in fiscal year 1996, the Balanced Budget Act achieved \n     savings without reducing student loan limits or increasing \n     fees to students or parents.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the aggregates and functional levels included in this budget \n     resolution assume that savings in student loans can be \n     achieved without any program change that would increase costs \n     to students and parents or decrease accessibility to student \n     loans.\n\n     SEC. 322. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REDUCTION OF THE \n                   NATIONAL DEBT.\n\n       (a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) S. Con. Res. 57 projects a public debt in fiscal year \n     1997 of $5,400,000,000,000;\n       (2) S. Con. Res. 57 projects that the public debt will be \n     $6,500,000,000,000 in the fiscal year 2002 when the budget \n     resolution projects a unified budget surplus; and\n       (3) this accumulated debt represents a significant \n     financial burden that will require excessive taxation and \n     lost economic opportunity for future generations of the \n     United States.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that any comprehensive \n     legislation sent to the President that balances the budget by \n     a certain date and that is agreed to by the Congress and the \n     President shall also contain a strategy for reducing the \n     national debt of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 323. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING HUNGRY OR HOMELESS \n                   CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions in \n     this budget resolution assume that Congress will not enact or \n     adopt any legislation that would increase the number of \n     children who are hungry or homeless.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the assumptions in \n     this budget resolution assume that in the event legislation \n     enacted to comply with this resolution results in an increase \n     in the number of hungry or homeless children by the end of \n     fiscal year 1997, the Congress would revisit the provisions \n     of said legislation which caused such increase and would, as \n     soon as practicable thereafter, adopt legislation which would \n     halt any continuation of such increase.\n\n[[Page S5548]]\n\n     SEC. 324. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON LIHEAP.\n\n       (a) Findings--The Senate finds that:\n       (1) Home energy assistance for working and low-income \n     families with children, the elderly on fixed incomes, the \n     disabled, and others who need such aid is a critical part of \n     the social safety net in cold-weather areas during the \n     winter, and a source of necessary cooling aid during the \n     summer;\n       (2) LIHEAP is a highly targeted, cost-effective way to help \n     millions of low-income Americans pay their home energy bills. \n     More than two-thirds of LIHEAP-eligible households have \n     annual incomes of less than $8,000, more than one-half have \n     annual incomes below $6,000; and\n       (3) LIHEAP funding has been substantially reduced in recent \n     years, and cannot sustain further spending cuts if the \n     program is to remain a viable means of meeting the home \n     heating and other energy-related needs of low-income \n     families, especially those in cold-weather States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--The assumptions underlying this \n     budget resolution assume that it is the sense of the Senate \n     that the funds made available for LIHEAP for fiscal year 1997 \n     will be not less than the actual expenditures made for LIHEAP \n     in fiscal year 1996.\n\n     SEC. 325. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING ADDITIONAL CHARGES \n                   UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) senior citizens must spend more than 1 dollar in 5 of \n     their limited incomes to purchase the health care they need;\n       (2) \\2/3\\ of spending under the medicare program under \n     title XVIII of the Social Security Act is for senior citizens \n     with annual incomes of less than $15,000;\n       (3) senior citizens cannot afford physician fee mark-ups \n     that are not covered under the medicare program or premium \n     overcharges; and\n       (4) senior citizens enrolling in private insurance plans \n     receiving medicare capitation payments are currently \n     protected against excess charges by health providers and \n     additional premium charges by the plan for services covered \n     under the medicare program.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It the sense of the Congress \n     that any reconciliation bill considered during the second \n     session of the 104th Congress should maintain the existing \n     prohibitions against additional charges by providers under \n     the medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security \n     Act (``balance billing''), and any premium surcharges for \n     services covered under such program that are levied on senior \n     citizens enrolled in private insurance plans in lieu of \n     conventional medicare.\n\n     SEC. 326. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING NURSING HOME \n                   STANDARDS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) prior to the enactment of subtitle C of title IV of the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, deplorable \n     conditions and shocking abuse of senior citizens and the \n     disabled in nursing homes was widespread; and\n       (2) the enactment and implementation of such subtitle has \n     brought major improvements in nursing home conditions and \n     substantially reduced abuse of senior citizens.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It the sense of the Congress \n     that any reconciliation bill considered during the second \n     session of the 104th Congress should not include any changes \n     in Federal nursing home quality standards or the Federal \n     enforcement of such standards.\n\n     SEC. 327. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS CONCERNING NURSING HOME CARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) under current Federal law--\n       (A) protections are provided under the medicaid program \n     under title XIX of the Social Security Act to prevent the \n     impoverishment of spouses of nursing home residents;\n       (B) prohibitions exist under such program to prevent the \n     charging of adult children of nursing home residents for the \n     cost of the care of such residents;\n       (C) prohibitions exist under such program to prevent a \n     State from placing a lien against the home of a nursing home \n     resident, if that home was occupied by a spouse or dependent \n     child; and\n       (D) prohibitions exist under such program to prevent a \n     nursing home from charging amounts above the medicaid \n     recognized charge for medicaid patients or requiring a \n     commitment to make private payments prior to receiving \n     medicaid coverage as a condition of admission; and\n       (2) family members of nursing home residents are generally \n     unable to afford the high cost of nursing home care, which \n     ranges between $30,000 and $60,000 a year.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that provisions of the medicaid program under title XIX of \n     the Social Security Act that protect families of nursing home \n     residents from experiencing financial ruin as the price of \n     securing needed care for their loved ones should be retained, \n     including--\n       (1) spousal impoverishment rules;\n       (2) prohibitions against charging adult children of nursing \n     home patients for the cost of their care;\n       (3) prohibitions against liens on the homes of nursing home \n     residents occupied by a spouse or dependent child; and\n       (4) prohibitions against nursing homes requiring private \n     payments prior to medicaid coverage as a condition of \n     admission or allowing charges in addition to medicaid \n     payments for covered patients.\n\n     SEC. 328. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING REQUIREMENTS THAT \n                   WELFARE RECEIPTS BE DRUG-FREE.\n\n       In recognition of the fact that American workers are \n     required to be drug-free in the workplace, it is the sense of \n     the Congress that this concurrent resolution on the budget \n     assumes that the States may require welfare recipients to be \n     drug-free as a condition for receiving such benefits and that \n     random drug testing may be used to enforce such requirements.\n\n     SEC. 329.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON DAVIS-BACON.\n\n       Notwithstanding any provision of the committee report on \n     this resolution, it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     provisions in this resolution assume reform of the Davis-\n     Bacon Act.\n\n     SEC. 331. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON REIMBURSEMENT OF THE UNITED \n                   STATES FOR OPERATIONS SOUTHERN WATCH AND \n                   PROVIDE COMFORT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) as of May 1996, the United States has spent \n     $2,937,000,000 of United States taxpayer funds since the \n     conclusion of the Gulf War in 1991 for the singular purpose \n     of protecting the Kurdish and Shiite population from Iraqi \n     aggression;\n       (2) the President's defense budget request for 1997 \n     includes an additional $590,100,000 for Operations Southern \n     Watch and Provide Comfort, both of which are designed to \n     restrict Iraqi military aggression against the Kurdish and \n     Shiite people of Iraq;\n       (3) costs for these military operations constitute part of \n     the continued budget deficit of the United States; and\n       (4) United Nations Security Council Resolution 986 (1995) \n     (referred to as ``SCR 986'') would allow Iraq to sell up to \n     $1,000,000,000 in petroleum and petroleum products every 90 \n     days, for an initial period of 180 days.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that--\n       (1) the President should instruct the United States \n     Permanent Representative to the United Nations to ensure any \n     subsequent extension of authority beyond the 180 days \n     originally provided by SCR 986, specifically mandates and \n     authorizes the reimbursement of the United States for costs \n     associated with Operations Southern Watch and Provide Comfort \n     out of revenues generated by any sale of petroleum or \n     petroleum-related products originating from Iraq;\n       (2) in the event that the United States Permanent \n     Representative to the United Nations fails to modify the \n     terms of any subsequent resolution extending the authority \n     granted by SCR 986 as called for in paragraph (1), the \n     President should reject any United Nations' action or \n     resolution seeking to extend the terms of the oil sale beyond \n     the 180 days authorized by SCR 986;\n       (3) the President should take the necessary steps to ensure \n     that--\n       (A) any effort by the United Nations to temporarily lift \n     the trade embargo for humanitarian purposes, specifically the \n     sale of petroleum or petroleum products, restricts all \n     revenues from such sale from being diverted to benefit the \n     Iraqi military; and\n       (B) the temporary lifting of the trade embargo does not \n     encourage other countries to take steps to begin promoting \n     commercial relations with the Iraqi military in expectation \n     that sanctions will be permanently lifted; and\n       (4) revenues reimbursed to the United States from the oil \n     sale authorized by SCR 986, or any subsequent action or \n     resolution, should be used to reduce the Federal budget \n     deficit.\n\n     SEC. 332. ACCURATE INDEX FOR INFLATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) a significant portion of Federal expenditures and \n     revenues are indexed to measurements of inflation; and\n       (2) a variety of inflation indices exist which vary \n     according to the accuracy with which such indices measure \n     increases in the cost of living; and\n       (3) Federal Government usage of inflation indices which \n     overstate true inflation has the demonstrated effect of \n     accelerating Federal spending, increasing the Federal budget \n     deficit, increasing Federal borrowing, and thereby enlarging \n     the projected burden on future American taxpayers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying this budget resolution \n     include that all Federal spending and revenues which are \n     indexed for inflation should be calibrated by the most \n     accurate inflation indices which are available to the Federal \n     Government.\n\n     SEC. 333. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SOLVENCY OF THE MEDICARE \n                   TRUST FUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that repeal of certain \n     provisions from the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 \n     would move the insolvency date of the HI (Medicare) Trust \n     Fund forward by a full year.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that no provisions in this Budget Resolution should worsen \n     the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.\n\n     SEC. 334. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS THAT THE 1993 INCOME TAX \n                   INCREASE ON SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS SHOULD BE \n                   REPEALED.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that the assumptions \n     underlying this resolution include that--\n       (1) the fiscal year 1994 budget proposal of President \n     Clinton to raise Federal income taxes on the Social Security \n     benefits of senior citizens with income as low as $25,000, \n     and those provisions of the fiscal year 1994 recommendations \n     of the Budget Resolution and the 1993 Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act in which the One Hundred Third Congress \n     voted to raise Federal income taxes on the Social Security \n     benefits of senior citizens with income as low as $34,000 \n     should be repealed;\n       (2) the Senate Budget Resolution should reflect President \n     Clinton's statement that he believed he raised Federal taxes \n     too much in 1993; and\n\n[[Page S5549]]\n\n       (3) the Budget Resolution should react to President \n     Clinton's fiscal year 1997 budget which documents the fact \n     that in the history of the United States, the total tax \n     burden has never been greater than it is today, therefore\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the assumptions underlying this Resolution include--\n       (1) that raising Federal income taxes in 1993 on the Social \n     Security benefits of middle-class individuals with income as \n     low as $34,000 was a mistake;\n       (2) that the Federal income tax hike on Social Security \n     benefits imposed in 1993 by the One Hundred Third Congress \n     and signed into law by President Clinton should be repealed; \n     and\n       (3) President Clinton should work with the Congress to \n     repeal the 1993 Federal income tax hike on Social Security \n     benefits in a manner that would not adversely affect the \n     Social Security Trust Fund or the Medicare Part A Trust Fund, \n     and should ensure that such repeal is coupled with offsetting \n     reductions in Federal spending.\n\n     SEC. 335. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ADMINISTRATION'S \n                   PRACTICE REGARDING THE PROSECUTION OF DRUG \n                   SMUGGLERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) drug use is devastating to the Nation, particularly \n     among juveniles, and has led juveniles to become involved in \n     interstate gangs and to participate in violent crime;\n       (2) drug use has experienced a dramatic resurgence among \n     our youth;\n       (3) the number of youths aged 12-17 using marijuana has \n     increased from 1.6 million in 1992 to 2.9 million in 1994, \n     and the category of ``recent marijuana use'' increased a \n     staggering 200 percent among 14- to 15-year-olds over the \n     same period;\n       (4) since 1992, there has been a 52 percent jump in the \n     number of high school seniors using drugs on a monthly basis, \n     even as worrisome declines are noted in peer disapproval of \n     drug use;\n       (5) 1 in 3 high school students uses marijuana;\n       (6) 12- to 17-year-olds who use marijuana are 85 percent \n     more likely to graduate to cocaine than those who abstain \n     from marijuana;\n       (7) juveniles who reach 21 without ever having used drugs \n     almost never try them later in life;\n       (8) the latest results from the Drug Abuse Warning Network \n     show that marijuana-related episodes jumped 39 percent and \n     are running at 155 percent above the 1990 level, and that \n     methamphetamine cases have risen 256 percent over the 1991 \n     level;\n       (9) between February 1993 and February 1995 the retail \n     price of a gram of cocaine fell from $172 to $137, and that \n     of a gram of heroin also fell from $2,032 to $1,278;\n       (10) it has been reported that the Department of Justice, \n     through the United States Attorney for the Southern District \n     of California, has adopted a policy of allowing certain \n     foreign drug smugglers to avoid prosecution altogether by \n     being released to Mexico;\n       (11) it has been reported that in the past year \n     approximately 2,300 suspected narcotics traffickers were \n     taken into custody for bringing illegal drugs across the \n     border, but approximately one in four were returned to their \n     country of origin without being prosecuted;\n       (12) it has been reported that the United States Customs \n     Service is operating under guidelines limiting any \n     prosecution in marijuana cases to cases involving 125 pounds \n     of marijuana or more;\n       (13) it has been reported that suspects possessing as much \n     as 32 pounds of methamphetamine and 37,000 Quaalude tablets, \n     were not prosecuted but were, instead, allowed to return to \n     their countries of origin after their drugs and vehicles were \n     confiscated;\n       (14) it has been reported that after a seizure of 158 \n     pounds of cocaine, one defendant was cited and released \n     because there was no room at the Federal jail and charges \n     against here were dropped;\n       (15) it has been reported that some smugglers have been \n     caught two or more times--even in the same week--yet still \n     were not prosecuted;\n       (16) the number of defendants prosecuted for violations of \n     the Federal drug laws has dropped from 25,033 in 1992 to \n     22,926 in 1995;\n       (17) this Congress has increased the funding of the Federal \n     Bureau of Prisons by 11.7 percent over the 1995 \n     appropriations level; and\n       (18) this Congress has increased the funding of the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service by 23.5 percent over \n     the 1995 appropriations level.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n     (1) the functional totals underlying this resolution assume \n     that the Attorney General promptly should investigate this \n     matter and report, within 30 days, to the Chair of the Senate \n     and House Committees on the Judiciary; and\n       (2) the Attorney General should ensure that cases involving \n     the smuggling of drugs into the United States are vigorously \n     prosecuted.\n\n     SEC. 336. CORPORATE SUBSIDIES AND SALE OF GOVERNMENT ASSETS.\n\n       (a) Corporate Subsidies.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional levels and aggregates in this budget \n     resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Federal budget contains tens of billions of dollars \n     in payments, benefits and programs that primarily assist \n     profit-making enterprises and industries rather than provide \n     a clear and compelling public interest;\n       (2) corporate subsidies can provide unfair competitive \n     advantages to certain industries and industry segments;\n       (3) at a time when millions of Americans are being asked to \n     sacrifice in order to balance the budget, the corporate \n     sector should bear its share of the burden; and\n       (4) Federal payments, benefits, and programs which \n     predominantly benefit a particular industry or segment of an \n     industry, rather than provide a clear and compelling public \n     benefit, should be reformed or terminated in order to provide \n     additional tax relief, deficit reduction, or to achieve the \n     savings necessary to meet this resolution's instructions and \n     levels.\n       (b) Sale of Government Assets.--\n       (1) Budgetary treatment.--\n       (A) In general.--For the purposes of any concurrent \n     resolution on the budget and the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974, no amounts realized from the sale of an asset shall be \n     scored with respect to the level of budget authority, \n     outlays, or revenues if such sale would cause an increase in \n     the deficit as calculated pursuant to subparagraph (B).\n       (B) Calculation of net present value.--The deficit estimate \n     of an asset sale shall be the net present value of the cash \n     flow from--\n       (i) proceeds from the asset sale;\n       (ii) future receipts that would be expected from continued \n     ownership of the asset by the Government; and\n       (iii) expected future spending by the Government at a level \n     necessary to continue to operate and maintain the asset to \n     generate the receipts estimated pursuant to clause (ii).\n       (2) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``sale of an asset'' shall have the same meaning as under \n     section 250(c)(21) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (3) Treatment of loan assets.--For the purposes of this \n     subsection, the sale of loan assets or the prepayment of a \n     loan shall be governed by the terms of the Federal Credit \n     Reform Act of 1990.\n\n     SEC. 337. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION \n                   CAMPAIGN FUND.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the functional totals in this resolution assume \n     that when the Finance Committee meets its outlay and revenue \n     obligations under this resolution the committee should not \n     make any changes in the Presidential Election Campaign Fund \n     or its funding mechanism and should meet its revenue and \n     outlay targets through other programs within its \n     jurisdiction.\n\n     SEC. 338. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING WELFARE REFORM.\n\n       (a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) S. Con. Res. 57 assumes substantial savings from \n     welfare reform; and\n       (2) children born out of wedlock are five times more likely \n     to be poor and about ten times more likely to be extremely \n     poor and therefore are more likely to receive welfare \n     benefits than children from two parent families; and\n       (3) high rates of out-of-wedlock births are associated with \n     a host of other social pathologies; for example, children of \n     single mothers are twice as likely to drop out of high \n     school; boys whose fathers are absent are more likely to \n     engage in criminal activities; and girls in single-parent \n     families are three times more likely to have children out of \n     wedlock themselves; therefore\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that any comprehensive \n     legislation sent to the President that balances the budget by \n     a certain date and that includes welfare reform provisions \n     and that is agreed to by the Congress and the President shall \n     also contain to the maximum extent possible a strategy for \n     reducing the rate of out-of-wedlock births and encouraging \n     family formation.\n\n     SEC. 339. A RESOLUTION REGARDING THE SENATE'S SUPPORT FOR \n                   FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) our Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers \n     provide essential services that preserve and protect our \n     freedoms and security;\n       (2) law enforcement officers deserve our appreciation and \n     support;\n       (3) law enforcement officers and agencies are under \n     increasing attacks, both to their physical safety and to \n     their reputations;\n       (4) Federal, State, and local law enforcement efforts need \n     increased financial commitment from the Federal Government \n     for funding and financial assistance and not the slashing of \n     our commitment to law enforcement if they are to carry out \n     their efforts to combat violent crime;\n       (5) the President's fiscal year 1996 budget requested an \n     increase of 14.8 percent for the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, 10 percent for United States Attorneys, and \n     $4,000,000 for Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces; \n     while this Congress has increased funding for the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation by 10.8 percent, 8.4 percent for \n     United States Attorneys, and a cut of $15,000,000 for \n     Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces;\n       (6) on May 16, 1996, the House of Representatives has \n     nonetheless voted to slash $300,000,000 from the President's \n     $5,000,000,000 budget request for the Violent Crime Reduction \n     Trust Fund for fiscal year 1997 in House Concurrent \n     Resolution 178; and\n       (7) the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund as adopted by \n     the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 \n     fully funds the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act \n     of 1994 without adding to the Federal budget deficit.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions and the functional totals underlying this \n     resolution assume the Federal Government's commitment to fund \n     Federal law enforcement programs and programs to assist State \n     and local efforts shall be maintained and funding for the \n     Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund shall not be cut as the \n     resolution adopted by the House of Representatives would \n     require.\n\n     SEC. 340. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE FUNDING OF \n                   AMTRAK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) a capital funding stream is essential to the ability of \n     the National Rail Passenger Corporation (``Amtrak'') to \n     reduce its dependence on Federal operating support; and\n\n[[Page S5550]]\n\n       (2) Amtrak needs a secure source of financing, no less \n     favorable than provided to other modes of transportation, for \n     capital improvements.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) revenues attributable to one-half cent per gallon of \n     the excise taxes imposed on gasoline, special motor fuel, and \n     diesel fuel from the Mass Transit Account should be dedicated \n     to a new Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund during the \n     period January 1, 1997, through September 30, 2001;\n       (2) revenues would not be deposited in the Intercity \n     Passenger Rail Trust Fund during any fiscal year to the \n     extent that the deposit is estimated to result in available \n     revenues in the Mass Transit Account being insufficient to \n     satisfy that year's estimated appropriation levels;\n       (3) monies in the Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund \n     should be generally available to fund, on a reimbursement \n     basis, capital expenditures incurred by Amtrak; and\n       (4) amounts to fund capital expenditures related to rail \n     operations should be set aside for each State that has not \n     had Amtrak service in such State for the preceding year.\n\n     SEC. 341. SENSE OF THE SENATE--TRUTH IN BUDGETING.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) The Congressional Budget Office has scored revenue \n     expected to be raised from the auction of Federal \n     Communications Commission licenses for various services;\n       (2) For budget scoring purposes, the Congress has assumed \n     that such auctions would occur in a prompt and expeditious \n     manner and that revenue raised by such auctions would flow to \n     the Federal treasury;\n       (3) The Resolution assumes that the revenue to be raised \n     from auctions totals billions of dollars;\n       (4) The Resolution makes assumptions that services would be \n     auctioned where the Federal Communications Commission has not \n     yet conducted auctions for such services, such as Local \n     Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS), licenses for paging \n     services, final broadband PCS licenses, narrow band PCS \n     licenses, licenses for unserved cellular, and Digital Audio \n     Radio (DARS), and other subscription services, revenue from \n     which has been assumed in Congressional budgetary \n     calculations and in determining the level of the deficit; and\n       (5) The Commission's service rules can dramatically affect \n     license values and auction revenues and therefore the \n     Commission should act expeditiously and without further delay \n     to conduct auctions of licenses in a manner that maximizes \n     revenue, increases efficiency, and enhances competition for \n     any service for which auction revenues have been scored by \n     the Congressional Budget Office and/or counted for budgetary \n     purposes in an Act of Congress.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The Presiding Officer appointed Mr. Domenici, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \nNickles, Mr. Gramm of Texas, Mr. Bond, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Exon, Mr. \nHollings, Mr. Johnston, and Mr. Lautenberg.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 57, the Senate budget resolution, be put back on \nthe calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is getting late and I normally have a \nlot of wrap-up but I will not do that tonight. I believe it is \nimperative that I express my deep appreciation to my friend, the \nranking member, the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Exon. This is the \nlast resolution after 16 years of service in the Senate and his State \nof Nebraska.\n  I am not sure that he would cherish being part of six or eight more \nbudgets, the way this one has gone. It has taken a long time and has \ntaken a big toll on us. I just thank him for everything he has done and \nfor his help during the last 4, 5 days. I thank all my fellow Senators \non the Budget Committee. They were a great help, great guides, and \ntheir suggestions permitted us to maneuver our way through all of the \nproblems and get this important resolution adopted.\n  Mr. President, let me first express my deep appreciation to my friend \nand ranking member Senator Exon. This will be his last budget \nresolution after 16 years of distinguished service to the U.S. Senate \nand his beloved State of Nebraska.\n  I would also like to thank my fellow Senators on the Budget Committee \nfor their help, guidance, and suggestions this last week as we \nmaneuvered our way through this important resolution. Particular thanks \nto Senators Gorton and Abraham for their help here on the floor.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to take a moment to thank the staff \non both sides of the aisle. Bill Dauster and his staff have done an \nexcellent job for that side of the aisle. In light of the increasingly \npartisan nature of the budget, I am always impressed by the working \nrelationship between our staffs. We spent nearly the entire 50 hours \nand a full 7 days on this budget resolution. We will have considered \nnearly 100 amendments on myriad of topics. I want to thank the staff \nfor the long hours and hard work that went into this budget resolution. \nI also want to thank the Republican floor staff and the cloakroom \nstaff. Their assistance gets us through this difficult process. Each of \nthe Budget Committee staff deserves a great deal of credit for the \nsuccess of this budget resolution.\n  I want to publicly express my appreciation to my staff director and \nhis two assistants here on the floor this last week, Austin Smythe and \nBeth Felder. There are other staff behind the scenes that have worked \ntirelessly to bring this resolution about. Instead of thanking each of \nmy Budget Committee staff individually, I ask unanimous consent that a \nlist of the names of the majority staff be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                             majority staff\n\n       Brian Benczkowski; Jim Capretta; Amy Call; Lisa Cieplak; \n     Christy Dunn; Beth Felder; Alice Grant; Jim Hearn; Keith \n     Hennessey; William Hoagland; Carol McQuire; Anne Miller; \n     Mieko Nakabayashi; and Denise G. Ramonas.\n       Cheri Reidy; Ricardo Rel; Karen Ricoy; J. Brian Riley; Mike \n     Ruffner; Melissa Sampson; Anrea Shank; Amy Smith; Austin \n     Smythe; Bob Stevenson; Beth Wallis; and Winslow Wheeler.\n\n\n                          administrative staff\n\n       Diane Bath; Victor Block; Alex Greene; Deena McMullen; \n     Lynne Seymour; and George Woodall.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, before my friend, the chairman of the \ncommittee, leaves, I want to thank him for his kind remarks. Yes, this \nis my last budget resolution forever. Sometimes I wonder if the \nchairman of the committee might like to say the same without giving up \nthe leadership of the organization. But it has been a pleasure for 18 \nyears to work with Pete Domenici.\n  As I said the other day, we do not always agree, but we have always \nbeen agreeable with each other as we have debated the issues. I thank \nhim for all of his courtesies when we were in the majority and now that \nhe is in the majority. I appreciate it very much.

First, I want to \nexpress my deep appreciation to our esteemed leader of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici of New Mexico, for doing an outstanding \njob. My appreciation also goes to Senator Exon for his steadfastness \nand to the members of the staff, who have done a remarkable job. It has \nbeen a pleasure and a real treat to work with them. It has been an \nextremely difficult measure, but they did it very well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5521-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, a truly historic moment occurred in \nMilwaukee today when the United States and the Federal Republic of \nGermany formally signed an open skies agreement which will liberalize \nair service between our two countries. To underscore the importance of \nthis agreement, I was pleased both President Clinton and Chancellor \nKohl were on hand to sign it.\n  As I have said before, the U.S./German open skies agreement is a \ngreat economic victory for both countries and a very welcome \ndevelopment for consumers. Under the agreement, airlines of both \ncountries will be free to operate to any points in either country, as \nwell as third countries, without limitation. It also liberalizes \npricing, charter services and further liberalizes the open skies cargo \nregime already in place. In short, it allows market demand, not the \nheavy hands of governments, to decide air service between the United \nStates and Germany.\n  In addition to direct benefits, I have long said such an agreement \nwould serve as a catalyst for liberalizing air service markets \nthroughout Europe. Recent news reports indicate the competitive impact \nof the U.S./German open skies agreement is already being felt. For \ninstance, since last October the British government, which is highly \nprotective of the restrictive U.S./U.K. bilateral aviation agreement, \nexpressed no willingness to seek to improve air service opportunities \nbetween the United States and the United Kingdom. This week, however, \nBritish negotiators came to Washington whistling a very different tune.\n  The competitive impact of the U.S./German open skies agreement also \nis being felt in U.S./France aviation relations. Since the French \nrenounced our bilateral aviation agreement in 1992, the French \ngovernment had shown no interest in negotiating a new air service \nagreement with the United States. Like the British, the French too are \nwhistling a different tune as a result of the U.S./German open skies \nagreement.\n  I welcome reports the Government of France finally has expressed an \ninterest in discussing a liberal bilateral aviation agreement. No doubt \nthis abrupt change in course is due to the competitive reality that \nFrance is now virtually surrounded by countries enjoying open skies \nagreements with the United States. Like a huge magnet, these countries \nwith open skies regimes are drawing passenger traffic away from French \nairports.\n  For instance, last year combined traffic at the two major Paris \nairports, Orly and Charles de Gaulle, fell nearly 1 percent. What makes \nthis statistic remarkable is elsewhere in Europe--particularly in \ncountries with open skies relations with the United States--passenger \ntraffic growth has been robust at major airports. For instance, \npassenger traffic rose 8.7 percent at Frankfurt Main Airport, 7.6 \npercent at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, and 11 percent at Brussels \nZaventem Airport.\n  Clearly, the French realize the U.S./German open skies agreement is \nonly going to make the problem of passenger traffic diversion much \nworse. As I have said repeatedly, competition will be our best ally in \nopening the remaining restrictive air service markets in Europe. At \ngreat cost to its economy, the French are learning this lesson \nfirsthand.\n  Mr. President, I commend to my colleagues an article describing the \ncompetitive impact of the U.S./German open skies agreement which \nappeared today in the Aviation Daily. I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of that article be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Let me conclude by saying the U.S./German open skies \nagreement is unquestionably our most important liberalized air service \nagreement to date. I again praise the bold and steadfast leadership of \nSecretary of Transportation Federico Pena and German Transport Minister \nMatthias Wissmann in securing this agreement. Both the United States \nand Germany will benefit greatly from their leadership which turned an \nexcellent opportunity into a truly historic trade agreement between our \ntwo countries.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  [From Aviation Daily, May 23, 1996]\n\n   New Carrier Alliances Fuel Hopes For U.S.-U.K., Europe Open Skies\n\n       The emergence of powerful, antitrust-immunized alliances \n     and increasingly open aviation regimes in fueling \n     expectations of breakthroughs in U.S.-U.K. and U.S.-European \n     Union relations. In a Senate floor speech Tuesday, Commerce \n     Committee Chairman Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) said ``a truly \n     historic opportunity may be at hand to finally force the \n     British to join us on the field of free and fair air service \n     competition.'' The chief catalyst for this opportunity is the \n     potential alliance between American and British Airways. With \n     published reports saying BA and American are close to \n     announcing ``a major business alliance,'' British officials \n     ``came to Washington [Monday] to assess the price tag for the \n     regulatory relief the new alliance would require,'' said \n     Pressler. ``I am pleased initial reports indicate [DOT] \n     reaffirmed its longstanding position: Nothing short of full \n     liberalization of the U.S./U.K. air service market would be \n     acceptable,'' he said. ``If the administration stands firm, \n     as I believe it must, the current restrictive U.S.-U.K. \n     bilateral aviation agreement will be cast into the great \n     trash heap of protectionist trade policy, where it belongs.''\n       Pressler traced the potential for a U.K. breakthrough to \n     the U.S.-Germany open skies agreement, struck early this \n     year. ``Simply put, the possible British Airways/American \n     Airlines alliance is a competitive response to the U.S./\n     Germany open skies agreement and the grant of antitrust \n     immunity to the United Airlines/Lufthansa alliance,'' he \n     said. Pressler was active in developing the U.S.-Germany \n     pact, a point underscored on the Senate floor by Sen. Trent \n     Lott (R-Miss.), who said Pressler's ``steadfast leadership \n     was instrumental in securing'' the open skies agreement. Lott \n     made public letters from DOT Secretary Federico Pena, who \n     praised Pressler's ``bipartisan leadership role'' on the \n     issue, and German Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann, who \n     called Pressler ``a cornerstone in this development.''\n       In his speech, Pressler said, ``If the Delta alliance with \n     three smaller European carriers is granted a final antitrust \n     immunity order later this month, that alliance--in \n     combination with the United and Northwest alliances--will \n     mean nearly 50% of the passenger traffic between the United \n     States and Europe will be carried on fully integrated \n     alliances.'' This will leave BA ``with no choice but to \n     respond. It now appears to be doing so by seeking to ally \n     itself with the strongest U.S. carrier available and \n     ultimately, to seek antitrust [immunity] for its new \n     alliance.'' The price tag for the regulatory relief for such \n     an alliance ``must be nothing less than immediate open \n     skies,'' said Pressler.\n       Industry observers are looking toward next week's European \n     Transport Ministers Conference and a meeting of the European \n     Union Council of Ministers in mid-June for possible progress \n     in EU-U.S. aviation relations. Delta Chairman, President and \n     Chief Executive Ronald Allen urged the EU to move ``boldly \n     and swiftly'' toward an open skies relationship with the U.S. \n     as ``the next necessary step forward for world aviation. It \n     is important that we take the step soon.'' In a speech \n     yesterday before the European Aviation Club in Brussels, \n     Allen praised EU Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock's \n     proposal that the European Commission be given a mandate to \n     negotiate EU-wide open skies with the U.S. ``He is trying to \n     open the door to meaningful transatlantic competition and \n     integration,'' Allen said. Some observers believe Kinnock \n     will gain at least limited authority at the Council of \n     Ministers Meeting.\n       Allen said Delta backed a number of proposals that may help \n     the talks, including an increase in permissible foreign \n     ownership of U.S. carriers from 25% to 49%. He said the \n     carrier will work for changes in U.S. bankruptcy laws that \n     allow airlines to continue operating while avoiding financial \n     responsibilities, but the EU must also change its policy \n     allowing state subsidies for troubled carriers. ``Both these \n     assistance measures distort marketplace competition and \n     penalize carriers that have made the difficult choices \n     necessary to make their companies competitive and financially \n     sound,'' said Allen. He added that the EU also must resist \n     moves to hamper competition through ``safety net'' \n     regulations.\n\n[[Page S5552]]\n\n\n\n                     NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Introduction\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA'' or \n     ``Act'') was enacted into law on January 23, 1995. In \n     general, the CAA applies the rights and protections of eleven \n     federal labor and employment law statutes to covered \n     Congressional employees and employing offices. Section 220 of \n     the CAA addresses the application of chapter 71 of title 5, \n     United States Code (``chapter 71''), relating to Federal \n     Service Labor-Management Relations. Section 220(a) of the CAA \n     applies the rights, protections, and responsibilities \n     established under sections 7102, 7106, 7111 through 7117, \n     7119 through 7122, and 7131 of chapter 71 to employing \n     offices, covered employees, and representatives of covered \n     employees. These provisions protect the legal right of \n     certain covered employees to organize and bargain \n     collectively with their employing offices within statutory \n     and regulatory parameters.\n       Section 220(d) of the Act requires the Board of Directors \n     of the Office of Compliance (``Board'') to issue regulations \n     to implement section 220 and further states that, except as \n     provided in subsection (e), such regulations ``shall be the \n     same as substantive regulations promulgated by the Federal \n     Labor Relations Authority (``FLRA'') to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) except--\n       (A) to the extent that the Board may determine, for good \n     cause shown and stated together with the regulations, that a \n     modification of such regulations would be more effective for \n     the implementation of rights and protections under this \n     section, or\n       (B) as the Board deems necessary to avoid a conflict of \n     interest or appearance of conflict of interest.''\n\n     The Board has separately published a Notice of Proposed \n     Rulemaking with respect to the issuance of regulations \n     pursuant to section 220(d).\n       Section 220(e)(1) of the CAA requires that the Board also \n     issue regulations ``on the manner and extent to which the \n     requirements and exemptions of chapter 71 [] should apply to \n     covered employees who are employed in the offices listed in'' \n     section 220(e)(2). The offices listed in section 220(e)(2) \n     are:\n       (A) the personal office of any Member of the House of \n     Representatives or of any Senator;\n       (B) a standing select, special, permanent, temporary, or \n     other committee of the Senate or House of Representatives, or \n     a joint committee of Congress;\n       (C) the Office of the Vice President (as President of the \n     Senate), the Office of the President pro tempore of the \n     Senate, the Office of the Majority Leader of the Senate, the \n     Office of the Minority Leader of the Senate, the Office of \n     the Majority Whip of the Senate, the Conference of the \n     Majority of the Senate, the Conference of the Minority of the \n     Senate, the Office of the Secretary of the Conference for the \n     Majority of the Senate, the Office of the Secretary for the \n     Minority of the Senate, the Majority Policy Committee of the \n     Senate, the Minority Policy Committee of the Senate, and the \n     following offices within the Office of the Secretary of the \n     Senate: Offices of the Parliamentarian, Bill Clerk, \n     Legislative Clerk, Journal Clerk, Executive Clerk, Enrolling \n     Clerk, Official Reporters of Debate, Daily Digest, Printing \n     Services, Captioning Services, and Senate Chief Counsel for \n     Employment;\n       (D) the Office of the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the Office of the Majority Leader of the \n     House of Representatives, the Office of the Minority Leader \n     of the House of Representatives, the Offices of the Chief \n     Deputy Majority Whips, the Offices of the Chief Deputy \n     Minority Whips, and the following offices within the Office \n     of the Clerk of the House of Representatives: Offices of \n     Legislative Operations, Official Reporters of Debate, \n     Official Reporters to Committees, Printing Services, and \n     Legislative Information;\n       (E) the Office of the Legislative Counsel of the Senate, \n     the Office of the Senate Legal Counsel, the Office of the \n     Legislative Counsel of the House of Representatives, the \n     Office of the General Counsel of the House of \n     Representatives, the Office of the Parliamentarian of the \n     House of Representatives, and the Office of the Law Revision \n     Counsel;\n       (F) the offices of any caucus or party organization;\n       (G) the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of \n     Technology Assessment, and the Office of Compliance; and;\n       (H) such other offices that perform comparable functions \n     which are identified under regulations of the Board.\n       These offices shall be collectively referred to as the \n     ``section 220(e)(2) offices.''\n       Section 220(e)(1) provides that the regulations which the \n     Board issues to apply chapter 71 to covered employees in \n     section 220(e)(2) offices ``shall, to the greatest extent \n     practicable, be consistent with the provisions and purposes \n     of chapter 71 [] and of [the CAA].'' To this end, section \n     220(e)(1) mandates that such regulations ``shall be the same \n     as substantive regulations issued by the Federal Labor \n     Relations Authority under such chapter'' with two separate \n     and distinct provisos:\n       First, section 220(e)(1), like every other CAA section \n     requiring the Board to issue implementing regulations (i.e., \n     sections 202(d)(2), 203(c)(2), 204(c)(2), 205(c)(2), \n     206(c)(2), 215(d)(2)), authorizes the Board to modify the \n     FLRA's regulations ``(A) to the extent that the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown and stated together with the \n     regulation, that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.''\n       Second, independent of section 220(e)(1), section 220(e)(2) \n     requires the Board to issue regulations that ``exclude from \n     coverage under this section any covered employees who are \n     employed in offices listed in [section 220(e)(2)] if the \n     Board determines that such exclusion is required because of--\n       (i) a conflict of interest or appearance of a conflict of \n     interest; or\n       (ii) Congress' constitutional responsibilities.''\n       The provisions of section 220 are effective October 1, \n     1996, except that, ``[w]ith respect to the offices listed in \n     subsection (e)(2), to the covered employees of such offices, \n     and to representatives of such employees, [section 220] shall \n     be effective on the effective date of regulations under \n     subsection (e).''\n\n             II. The Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\n\n           A. Issues for Comment that Relate to Section 220(e)\n\n       The Board sought comment on two issues related to section \n     220(e)(1)(A): (1) Whether and to what extent the Board should \n     modify the regulations promulgated by the FLRA for \n     application to employees in section 220(e)(2) offices? (2) \n     Whether the Board should issue additional regulations \n     concerning the manner and extent to which the requirements \n     and exemptions of chapter 71\n\n[[Page S5553]]\n\n     apply to employees in section 220(e)(2) offices?\n       The Board sought comment on four issues related to section \n     220(e)(1)(B): (1) What are the constitutional \n     responsibilities and/or conflicts of interest (real or \n     apparent) that would require exclusion of employees in \n     section 220(e) offices from coverage under section 220 of the \n     CAA? (2) Whether determinations as to such exclusions should \n     be made on an office-wide basis or on the basis of job duties \n     and functions? (3) Which job duties and functions in section \n     220(e) offices, if any, should be excluded from coverage, and \n     what is the legal and factual basis for any such exclusion? \n     (4) Are there any offices not listed in section 220(e)(2) \n     that are candidates for the application of the section \n     220(e)(1)(B) exclusion and, if so, why?\n       In seeking comment on the issues related to section 220(e) \n     regulations, the Board emphasized that it needed detailed \n     legal and factual support for any proposed modifications in \n     the FLRA's regulations and for any additional proposed \n     regulations implementing sections 220(e)(1)(A) and (B).\n\n                     B. Summary of Comments Received\n\n        The Board did not receive any comments on issues arising \n     under section 220(e)(1)(A), and received only two comments on \n     issues arising under section 220(e)(1)(B). These two comments \n     addressed the issue of whether the Board should grant a \n     blanket exclusion for all covered employees in the section \n     220(e)(2) offices. The Board summarizes those two comments \n     here.\n       One commenter argued that nothing in the CAA warrants any \n     categorical exclusions from coverage. The commenter argued \n     that the CAA's instruction to the Board to issue regulations \n     which ``to the greatest extent practicable'' are ``consistent \n     with the provisions and purposes of chapter 71'' invites \n     coverage as broad in scope as chapter 71 provides for \n     Executive Branch employees. The commenter argued that section \n     220(e)(1)(B) is an exception to the general rule mandating \n     coverage and that Congress did not purport to find that any \n     covered employees necessarily qualified for application of \n     such an exception. The commenter further argued that the \n     legislative history of section 220(e) indicates that Congress \n     simply authorized the Board to determine whether covered \n     employees in section 220(e)(2) offices should be excluded \n     without in any way suggesting that they should be excluded.\n       The commenter then pointed out that, like Congress, the \n     President is charged with constitutional responsibilities and \n     that executive branch employees (other than statutorily \n     excepted employees) are nonetheless free to join and be \n     represented by unions of their choice. The commenter urged \n     that there is nothing in the functions of the legislative \n     branch that suggests that union representation of legislative \n     branch employees is any different than union representation \n     of executive branch employees (or that it poses any unique \n     concerns). From this argument, the commenter concluded that \n     no blanket exemption of all of the employees in section \n     220(e)(2) offices is warranted; and the commenter urged that \n     its conclusion is supported by the overall policy of the CAA \n     to bind Congress to the same set of rules that other \n     employers face.\n       The second commenter took the position that all of the \n     covered employees in a number of the section 220(e)(2) \n     offices should receive a blanket exemption from coverage \n     under section 220. In support of this argument, the commenter \n     first described the Senate's constitutional responsibilities \n     to exercise the legislative authority of the United States; \n     to ``make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for \n     carrying into Execution'' its enumerated powers; to advise \n     and consent to treaties and certain presidential nominations; \n     and to try matters of impeachments. The commenter then stated \n     that, in fulfilling these responsibilities, the Senate must \n     be ``free from improper influence from outside sources so \n     that Members can fairly represent the interests of the United \n     States and its citizens.'' The commenter asserted that \n     exclusion from coverage of all employees in Senators' \n     personal offices is necessary to insulate the legislative \n     process from improper influence by outside parties.\n       In so stating, the commenter recognized that a number of \n     such employees would already be excluded under chapter 71, \n     but argued that the participation of any employee of a \n     Senator's office in a labor organization would ``interfere \n     with the Senator's constitutional responsibilities, [] allow \n     unions to obtain an undue advantage in the legislative \n     process and to exercise improper influence over Members, and \n     [] create conflicts of interest.'' The commenter asserted \n     that allowing such employees to organize would ``provide \n     labor unions with unprecedented access to and influence over \n     the operations and legislative activities of Senators' \n     personal offices'' and turn the collective bargaining \n     process into ``a lobbying tool of organized labor.''\n       The commenter contended that union representation of \n     employees in a Senator's personal office also could create \n     significant conflicts of interest, both because legislation \n     that affects union or management rights may have a direct \n     impact on a Senator's bargaining position with an employee \n     union, and because a Senator's voting position may be tainted \n     by the appearance that he or she is affected by the position \n     of the employee union. The commenter also claimed that \n     payment of union dues by a Senator's employees could create \n     the perception of a conflict of interest, because Senate \n     employees may not make political contributions to their \n     employer, but the employees may nonetheless pay dues to a \n     union that, in turn, contributes to that employer. The \n     commenter further argued that, if a Senator's employees are \n     permitted to organize, they may develop conflicting loyalties \n     that could render them politically incompatible with the \n     Senator for whom they work. The commenter contended that it \n     would be an unfair labor practice for an employer to \n     discharge an employee because of union affiliation even if \n     that union affiliation led to political incompatibility, thus \n     allegedly eviscerating section 502 of the CAA (which is said \n     to authorize an employing office to discharge an employee \n     based on such incompatibility). Finally, the commenter \n     asserted that, if employees of Senators' offices are granted \n     the right to organize, they will be the only employees of \n     federal elected officials who are organized.\n       The commenter also took the position that the concerns \n     stated regarding union organization in Senators' personal \n     offices are equally applicable to employees in Senate \n     leadership and committee offices. The commenter further \n     asserted that employees in offices under the jurisdiction of \n     the Secretary of the Senate (Offices of the Parliamentarian, \n     Bill Clerk, Legislative Clerk, Journal Clerk, Executive \n     Clerk, Enrolling Clerk, Official Reporters of Debate, Daily \n     Digest and Printing Services, Office of Senate Chief Counsel \n     for Employment) should be excluded from coverage because they \n     allegedly occupy confidential positions that are integral to \n     the Senate's constitutional functions. The commenter also \n     asserted that employees in the Office of Senate Chief Counsel \n     for Employment should be excluded because attorneys in that \n     office will engage in labor negotiations on behalf of \n     management in Senate offices and because all employees in the \n     office have access to privileged and confidential \n     information. The commenter similarly stated that employees in \n     the Office of the Legislative Counsel and the Office of the \n     Senate Legal Counsel should be excluded because they have \n     direct access to privileged and confidential information \n     relating to the constitutional functions of the Senate.\n       Finally, the commenter contended that, pursuant to \n     220(e)(2)(H), employees in four other offices should be \n     subject to a blanket exclusion: Employees in the Executive \n     Office of the Secretary of the Senate, because they are privy \n     to confidential information about both the legislative \n     functions of the Senate and the labor management policies of \n     the Office of the Secretary; employees in the Office of \n     Senate Security, because they have access to highly sensitive \n     and confidential information relating to the constitutional \n     responsibilities of the Senate, as well as to matters of \n     national security; employees in the Senate Disbursing Office, \n     because they have access to confidential financial \n     information that could enhance a union's bargaining position; \n     and employees in the Administrative Office of the Sergeant at \n     Arms, because they have access to confidential information \n     about the office and the Senate.\n\n                   III. Notice of proposed rulemaking\n\n       In developing its proposed regulations, the Board has \n     carefully considered both its responsibilities under section \n     220(e) and the two directly contradictory comments that the \n     Board received concerning the regulations that it must issue. \n     For the reasons that follow, the Board's judgment is that a \n     blanket exclusion of all of the employees in the section \n     220(e)(2) offices is not ``required'' under the stated \n     statutory criteria. But the Board will propose regulations \n     that allow the exclusion issue to be raised with respect to \n     any particular employee in any particular case. The Board \n     also urges commenters who support any categorical exclusions, \n     in commenting on these proposed regulations, to explain why \n     particular jobs or job duties require exclusion of particular \n     employees so that the Board may exclude them by regulation, \n     where appropriate. Through this initial regulation and any \n     categorical exclusions that may appropriately be included in \n     its final regulations, the Board intends to carry out its \n     statutory responsibility under section 220(e) to exclude \n     employees from coverage where required, and to make changes \n     in the FLRAs regulations where necessary.\n\n                        A. Section 220(e)(1)(A)\n\n       Section 220(e)(1)(A) authorizes the Board to modify the \n     FLRA's regulations ``to the extent that the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown and stated together with the \n     regulation, that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under [section 220(e)].'' No commenter took the \n     position that there was good cause to modify the FLRA \n     regulations for more effective implementation of section \n     220(e). Equally important, no commenter took the position \n     that a blanket exclusion of all of the covered employees in \n     any of the section 220(e) offices would be ``more effective \n     for the implementation of the rights and protections under \n     [section 220(e)].'' And, at present, the Board has not \n     independently found any basis to exercise its authority to \n     modify the FLRA regulations for more effective implementation \n     of section 220(e). The Board therefore does not propose to \n     issue separate regulations pursuant to section 220(e)(1)(A)--\n     that is, except as to employees whose exclusion from coverage \n     under section 220 is required, the Board proposes that the \n     regulations that it issues under section 220(d) will apply to\n\n[[Page S5554]]\n\n     employing offices, covered employees, and their \n     representatives under section 220(e).\n\n                        B. Section 220(e)(1)(B)\n\n       Section 220(e)(1)(B) provides that the Board ``shall \n     exclude from coverage under [section 220] any covered \n     employees in [section 220(e)(2) offices] if the Board \n     determines that such exclusion is required because of--\n       (i) a conflict of interest or appearance of a conflict of \n     interest; or\n       (ii) Congress' constitutional responsibilities.''\n\n     The question here for resolution, then, is to what extent the \n     Board should exclude covered employees in the section \n     220(e)(2) offices from coverage.\n     1. The statutory language and legislative history indicate \n         that exclusions are proper only where ``required'' by the \n         stated statutory criteria\n       Section 220(e)(1)(B) states that the Board ``shall'' \n     exclude any covered employee of a section 220(e)(2) office \n     where such exclusion is ``required'' by the stated statutory \n     criteria. The statutory specification that the exclusion be \n     ``required'' by Congress' constitutional responsibilities or \n     a conflict of interest is telling. In this context, the term \n     ``required'' means ``insist[ed] upon usu[ally] with certainty \n     and urgency.'' See Webster's Third New International \n     Dictionary (1986); see also Black's Law Dictionary (4th ed. \n     1968) (``direct[ed], order[ed], demand[ed], instruct[ed], \n     command[ed]''). Thus, merely being helpful to or in \n     furtherance of the stated statutory criteria is \n     insufficient; rather, the exclusion must be necessary to \n     the conduct of Congress' constitutional responsibilities \n     or to the avoidance of a conflict of interest (real or \n     apparent).\n       Although legislative history should always be consulted \n     with due care and regard for its limitations, the scant \n     legislative history directly attached to section 220(e)(1)(B) \n     here appears to confirm that exclusions are proper only where \n     necessary to achieve the stated statutory criteria. See 141 \n     Cong. Rec. S626 (section-by-section analysis of CAA). What is \n     now section 220(e) was added to a predecessor to the CAA in \n     October 1994 in the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. \n     The Committee's Report explains that this provision was added \n     in response to several Members' concerns that the application \n     of labor laws to the legislative offices might interfere with \n     Congress' ability to fulfill its constitutional functions:\n       ``For example, there was a concern that, if legislative \n     staff belonged to a union, that union might be able to exert \n     undue influence over legislative activities or decisions. \n     Even if such a conflict of interest between employees' \n     official duties and union membership did not actually occur, \n     the mere appearance of undue influence or access might be \n     very troubling. Furthermore, there is a concern that labor \n     actions could delay or disrupt vital legislative \n     activities.'' [S. Rep. No. 397, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 8 \n     (1994).]\n       The Report went on to explain that the proposed bill \n     addressed the Members' concerns in two ways: First, rather \n     than applying the National Labor Relations Act (``NLRA'') to \n     Congress, the bill would apply chapter 71 whose ``provisions \n     and precedents . . . address problems of conflict of interest \n     in the governmental context and . . . prohibit strikes and \n     slowdowns.'' Second, ``as an extra measure of precaution,'' \n     the bill would not apply to the section 220(e)(2) offices \n     ``until the Board has conducted a special rulemaking to \n     consider such problems as conflict of interest.'' Id. at 8.\n       The above-described Senate Report does not reveal--either \n     expressly or implicitly--any congressional expectation that \n     exclusions would necessarily result as a consequence of the \n     Board's special rulemaking. Instead, the Report explains that \n     the concerns of several Members were principally addressed by \n     the incorporation of chapter 71 (rather than the NLRA) in the \n     bill and that, ``as an extra measure of precaution,'' the \n     Board should consider in a special rulemaking whether \n     application of even chapter 71 to employees in section 220(e) \n     would defeat Congress' responsibilities or cause insoluble \n     conflicts of interest (real or apparent). See 141 Cong. Rec. \n     S444-45 (remarks of Senator Grassley). Indeed, the section-\n     by-section analysis of the bill that became the CAA states \n     that section 220(e) should not be construed as ``a \n     standardless license to roam far afield from [the] executive \n     regulations.'' See 141 Cong. Rec. S626.\n       These legislative materials suggest that section 220(e) \n     requires the Board to exclude employees in section 220(e)(2) \n     offices only where ``required'' by the statutory criteria--\n     i.e., where exclusion is necessary to the accomplishment of \n     the statutory criteria. The legislative materials leave no \n     room for the exclusion of covered employees in the absence of \n     a demonstrated and substantial need for doing so.\n     2. Exclusion of all employees in section 220(e) offices is \n         not required by Congress' constitutional responsibilities \n         or concerns about real or apparent conflicts of interest\n       On the basis of the comments received to date, the Board is \n     unable to find a demonstrated and substantial need for the \n     blanket exclusion of all employees in the section 220(e)(2) \n     offices. Such a blanket exclusion of all covered employees \n     does not appear to be required by either Congress' \n     constitutional responsibilities or any real or apparent \n     conflicts of interest.\n       a. Exclusion is not necessitated by Congress' \n           constitutional responsibilities\n       The key premise of the commenter's argument that exclusion \n     of all section 220(e)(2) office employees is required by \n     Congress' constitutional responsibilities is the assertion \n     that collective bargaining rights for section 220(e) \n     employees are categorically inconsistent with the effective \n     functioning of the Legislative Branch. But the legislative \n     judgment embodied in chapter 71 is that collective bargaining \n     rights are entirely consistent with--and, indeed, enhance--\n     the efficient and effective functioning of the Executive \n     Branch. See 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7101. More to the point, the \n     legislative judgment in chapter 71 is that collective \n     bargaining is consistent with--and, indeed, supportive of--\n     the Executive Branch's fulfillment of the President's \n     constitutional responsibility faithfully to execute the laws \n     of the United States. The Board has not yet been presented \n     with any facts or legal argument that would support a \n     determination that, in contrast to the situation in the \n     Executive Branch, all employees of the section 220(e)(2) \n     offices must be excluded from collective bargaining in order \n     for the Legislative Branch to be able to fulfill its \n     constitutional charge.\n       For example, although the commenter asserts that, if a \n     Senator is required to bargain with his or her employees' \n     union, the employees' union will obtain an undue advantage in \n     the legislative process by dint of its members' special \n     access to the Senator and its members' influence over the \n     Senator's legislative positions, the Board does not believe \n     that a Senator can be brought to his constitutional knees so \n     easily. The commitment of our Nation's elected \n     representatives to the performance of their constitutional \n     duties is great; and, access or no access by unions, it must \n     be presumed that our elected representatives will carry out \n     their constitutional responsibilities with fervor. Moreover, \n     it must also be recognized that, in doing so, our elected \n     representatives will be supported by many employees who \n     simply do not have the right to organize. Supervisors--\n     defined as individuals with authority to hire, direct, \n     assign, promote, reward, transfer, furlough, layoff, recall, \n     suspend, discipline, or remove employees, or to adjust their \n     grievances, or to effectively recommend such action--are not \n     even covered by chapter 71 as applied by the CAA. See \n     sections 7103(a)(2)(iii) & 7103(a)(10). Likewise, management \n     officials--defined as individuals in positions whose duties \n     and responsibilities require or authorize the individual to \n     formulate, determine, or influence the policies of their \n     employer--are not covered. See sections 7103(a)(2)(iii) & \n     7103(a)(11). Furthermore, confidential employees--defined as \n     employees who act in a confidential capacity with respect to \n     individuals who formulate or effectuate management policies \n     in the field of labor-management relations--and employees \n     engaged in personnel work are not covered. See sections \n     7112(b)(2),(3) & 7103(a)(13). Finally, employees whose \n     participation in the management of a labor organization or \n     whose representation of a labor organization results in a \n     conflict or apparent conflict of interest or is otherwise \n     incompatible with law or with official job duties are not \n     covered. See section 7120(e). Cumulatively, these exclusions \n     undermine the claim that all employees of a section 220(e)(2) \n     office--including secretaries and messengers--must be \n     excluded from coverage in order for the Legislative Branch to \n     fulfill its constitutional charge; to the extent that a union \n     obtains access, it will be on behalf of employees who are not \n     at the center of the Senator's management core.\n       The commenter supporting blanket exclusion for all \n     employees in certain section 220(e)(2) offices also argued \n     that, absent such an exclusion, a Senator's employees would \n     be able to influence a Senator's legislative position in \n     exchange for concessions at the bargaining table. This \n     argument, however, ignores the fact that, for those employees \n     not exempted (such as certain secretaries and messengers), \n     chapter 71 provides only a limited set of labor relations \n     rights. Once organized, employees may bargain about their \n     conditions of employment. But they may not bargain about \n     matters ``specifically provided for by Federal statute,'' a \n     category which includes inter alia a number of restrictions \n     on pay, health insurance, and retirement benefits for \n     legislative employees. See sections 7102(2), 7103(a)(12), \n     7103(a)(14)(C). Moreover, they may only bargain about their \n     ``terms and conditions of employment''; their Senator's \n     legislative positions are not properly on the table. And in \n     the event that nonexempt employees in section 220(e)(2) \n     offices fail to come to terms with an employing office about \n     their terms and conditions of employment, the employees do \n     not have the principle coercive weapons that organized labor \n     uses to further its employment goals, see Allis Chalmers v. \n     NLRB, 388 U.S. 175 (1967), because they lack the right to \n     strike or slow down. See sections 7103(a)(2)(v), 7311. These \n     limitations make it clear that exclusion of all additional \n     employees in a section 220(e)(2) office (such as certain \n     secretaries and messengers) is not necessary to prevent the \n     allegedly improper influence that concerns the commenter; and \n     they make self-evident that such a blanket exclusion of all \n     section 220(e)(2) office employees is not required by \n     Congress constitutional responsibilities.\n       The commenter supporting blanket exclusion of all employees \n     in section 220(e)(2) offices further argued that all members \n     of a Senator's staff--no matter how routine their job \n     duties--are privy to inside information about the Senator, \n     including information about the Senator's legislative \n     positions.\n\n[[Page S5555]]\n\n      The commenter expressed a concern that a Senator's organized \n     employees might reveal this confidential information to their \n     union and that a union might then use the confidential \n     information to exert improper influence on the Senator and \n     thus on the legislative process. The commenter also feared \n     that a Senator's organized employees would not wholeheartedly \n     perform their duties if the Senator were to take a position \n     inimical to the interests of unions. But, again, these \n     concerns are not sufficient to justify blanket exclusions, if \n     only because they can be addressed by other means.\n       The confidentiality of information and loyal performance of \n     duties can be ensured without exclusion of all section \n     220(e)(2) office employees. Nothing in federal law, and \n     certainly nothing in chapter 71 or the CAA, limits a Member's \n     right to establish neutral work rules designed to assure \n     productivity, discipline, and confidentiality and to \n     discipline and/or discharge any employee who violates those \n     rules. An employee who violates one of these work rules may \n     be discharged for that reason.\n       This point answers the commenter's argument that \n     categorical exclusion is necessary because a Senator would \n     not be able to discharge or discipline an employee who leaks \n     confidential information, or one who openly and actively \n     supports legislation that the Senator opposes. If the Senator \n     had in place and enforced a work rule neutrally forbidding \n     such conduct, then he or she could discipline or discharge an \n     employee who engaged in the forbidden conduct without regard \n     to the employee's union membership or activity (so long as \n     the employee's constitutional rights were not violated). The \n     Senator would only violate section 220 of the CAA if he or \n     she simply forbid inconsistent conduct that related to union \n     membership or activities or enforced a facially neutral rule \n     in a discriminatory manner. Exclusion of all covered \n     employees is thus not ``required'' to address the \n     confidentiality and loyalty concerns that have been \n     advanced here.\n       b. Exclusion of all employees in section 220(e)(2) offices \n           is not ``required'' by any real or apparent conflicts \n           of interest\n       Nor is the Board prepared at this point to accept the \n     argument that blanket exclusion of all employees in section \n     220(e)(2) offices is ``required'' to avoid conflicts of \n     interest, real or apparent. The exclusions in chapter 71 for \n     supervisory, confidential and other such employees are \n     sufficient to take care of most potential conflict of \n     interest questions created by employee organization; indeed, \n     chapter 71 itself allows exclusion of employees with \n     additional insoluble conflicts of interest. While the Board \n     is prepared to exclude appropriate categories of employees \n     where required by conflicts of interest, the suggestion that \n     all employees in section 220(e)(2) offices must be excluded \n     because of such alleged conflicts does not appear well-\n     founded.\n       The commenter expressed a fear that organized employees \n     would necessarily have a loyalty to the union and to union \n     goals that would be inconsistent with loyal service to a \n     Member and to his or her legislative positions. There may \n     indeed be such tensions and potential conflicts that arise \n     from union membership of covered employees. But such tensions \n     and conflicts also arise in connection with a covered \n     employee's membership and participation in other special \n     interest groups, such as the Sierra Club, the National Rifle \n     Association, the National Right to Work Foundation, or the \n     National Organization of Women. Indeed, an employee's outside \n     associations--whatever they may be--all give rise to a \n     possible tension between the employee's interests and \n     loyalties (as expressed by outside associations) and the \n     Member's legislative positions. Nonetheless, Congress has not \n     imposed a blanket prohibition on employee membership and \n     participation in outside associations; and, under chapter 71, \n     the tensions and potential conflicts that arise in connection \n     with union membership have not been enough to justify a \n     blanket exclusion of all employees from organization in the \n     Executive Branch. While the Board is prepared to consider \n     whether such associations might preclude organization rights \n     for particular employees in particularly sensitive positions, \n     it cannot accept the suggestion that the possible tensions \n     between employee interests and loyalties and Member positions \n     ``requires'' the blanket exclusion of all employees in \n     section 220(e)(2) offices; there are surely less restrictive \n     means for mitigating these potential conflicts for many, if \n     not all, of the employees of section 220(e)(2) offices.\n       The commenter also asserted that exclusion of all employees \n     is required by an apparent conflict of interest for Members \n     voting on legislation that affects unions: according to the \n     commenter, if the Members support the legislation, they may \n     be perceived as caving to union pressure; if they oppose it, \n     they may be perceived as attempting to enhance their \n     bargaining positions with the union; in either instance, they \n     would not be perceived as serving their constituents. But \n     this situation does not appear to differ from that faced by \n     the President when he or Executive Branch officials acting on \n     his behalf take a position on pending labor legislation. That \n     apparent conflict is inherent to employee organization in the \n     public sector; and yet chapter 71 reflects a judgment that \n     this apparent conflict does not require the categorical \n     exclusion of all employees from collective organization. The \n     judgment in chapter 71, which Congress incorporated by \n     reference in the CAA, prevents the Board from accepting any \n     argument that this apparent conflict requires exclusion of \n     all employees in a section 220(e)(2) office.\n       Indeed, with respect to both alleged conflicts of interest, \n     the Board finds it significant that, in chapter 71's \n     statement of congressional findings and purpose, Congress \n     expressly found that ``labor organizations and collective \n     bargaining in the civil service are in the public interest'' \n     because they ``safeguard[] the public interest,'' \n     ``contribute[] to the effective conduct of public business,'' \n     and ``facilitate[] and encourage[] the amicable settlements \n     of disputes between employees and their employers involving \n     conditions of employment.'' See Section 7101. Section \n     220(e)(1) of the CAA instructs the Board to hew as closely as \n     possible to ``the provisions and purposes of chapter 71.'' In \n     doing so, the Board has no choice but to reject the \n     proposition that all employees in a section 220(e)(2) office \n     must be excluded from coverage because of a real or apparent \n     conflict that their organization would create for their \n     Member of Congress. The premise of chapter 71, and thus the \n     CAA, is that employees in unions may loyally serve government \n     employers and that the public will not view government acts \n     in response to union demands as illegitimate responses to \n     union pressure.\n     3. Proposed regulations under section 220(e)(1)(B)\n       For these reasons, the Board does not propose to issue \n     regulations that grant blanket exclusion of all employees in \n     any of the section 220(e)(2) offices. In the Board's \n     judgment, the issuance of blanket exclusions from the \n     application of section 220 for all employees in section \n     220(e)(2) offices would represent a significant departure \n     from the overall purposes and policies of the CAA. The Board \n     would promptly take that step if it were necessary because of \n     a conflict of interest (real or apparent) or Congress' \n     constitutional responsibilities. But no necessity has been \n     shown or yet been found for the exclusion of all employees in \n     section 220(e)(2) offices.\n       The Board further notes that no commenter took the position \n     that there were job duties of employees within section \n     220(e)(2) offices that required application of section \n     220(e)(1)(B)'s exception to coverage; a fortiori, no \n     commenter provided the Board with any facts or legal argument \n     in support of the issuance of regulations providing that \n     employees in section 220(e)(2) offices who perform certain \n     job duties are not covered by section 220. For this reason, \n     the Board does not propose to issue any such regulations at \n     this time. Of course, the Board stands ready to use its \n     rulemaking authority to propose and issue such regulations \n     when and if the Board is presented with facts and legal \n     argument demonstrating that the application of section \n     220(e)(1)(B) to employees performing particular job duties is \n     ``required.'' The Board again urges commenters to provide the \n     Board with such information and authorities.\n       The commenter supporting blanket exclusion of all employees \n     in section 220(e)(2) offices argued that, pursuant to its \n     power under section 220(e)(2)(H), the Board should propose \n     regulations (i) adding the Executive Office of the Secretary \n     of the Senate, the Office of Senate Security, the Senate \n     Disbursing Office, and the Administrative Office of the \n     Sergeant at Arms to the statutory list of section 220(e)(2) \n     offices, and (ii) granting a blanket exclusion of all covered \n     employees in these offices. By its analysis above, the Board \n     has effectively rejected the argument that any offices, \n     including these four, are entitled to blanket exclusion of \n     all of their employees from application of section 220. The \n     Board agrees, however, with the commenter's assertion that \n     employees in these offices perform functions ``comparable'' \n     to those performed by employees in the other section \n     220(e)(2) offices, and thus the Board proposes, pursuant to \n     section 220(e)(2)(H), to treat these offices as section \n     220(e)(2) offices for all purposes, including the \n     determination of the effective date of sections 220(a) and \n     (b). For all other offices--that is, all offices that are not \n     either listed in section 220(e)(2) or defined as section \n     220(e)(2) offices here--the effective date of sections \n     220(a) and (b) is October 1, 1996.\n       No commenter took the position that the Board should adopt \n     a regulation authorizing parties and/or employees in \n     appropriate proceedings to assert, and the Board to decide, \n     where appropriate and relevant, that a covered employee \n     employed in a section 220(e)(2) office is required to be \n     excluded from coverage under section 220(e) because of a \n     conflict of interest (real or apparent) or because of \n     Congress' constitutional responsibilities. The Board, \n     however, proposes to issue such a regulation. By doing so, \n     the Board intends to ensure that an exclusion may be provided \n     where the law and the facts require it. The proposed \n     regulation of the Board allows the issue of exclusions under \n     section 220(e)(1)(B) to be raised and decided on a case-by-\n     case basis.\n\n                         IV. Method of approval\n\n       The Board recommends that (1) the version of the proposed \n     regulations that shall apply to the Senate and employees of \n     the Senate be approved by the Senate by resolution; (2) the \n     version of the proposed regulations that shall apply to the \n     House of Representatives and employees of the House of \n     Representatives be approved by the House of Representatives \n     by resolution; and (3) the version of the proposed \n     regulations that shall apply to\n\n[[Page S5556]]\n\n     other covered employees and employing offices be approved by \n     the Congress by concurrent resolution.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 22nd day of May, 1996.\n                                                    Glen D.

Mr. President, domestic and other acts of violence \nagainst women have reached epidemic proportions. Figures from 1994 show \nthat, on the average in the United States, a woman was murdered every \ntwo days, and a woman was beaten every 15 seconds as a result of \ndomestic violence.\n  The Violence Against Women Act was passed in 1994 to address this \nproblem and ensure the safety and peace of mind of millions of women \nand their families. Congress took an approach that requires a \npartnership between the private sector and the public sector at every \nlevel--Federal, State, and local.\n  The Domestic Violence Project being carried out by the law firm of \nMintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky and Popeo is an excellent example of a \nsuccessful partnership. In testimony before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Kenneth J. Novak, chairman of the firm's Community Service \nProgram, described its Domestic Violence Project and its efforts to \nreduce domestic violence.\n  The Domestic Violence Project that Mr. Novak described can be an \neffective model for many others in helping the Nation meet and master \nthe challenge of domestic violence. I believe that Mr. Novak's \ntestimony will be of interest to all of us in Congress, and I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. Chairman, and members of the Judiciary Committee, my \n     name is Kenneth J. Novack of the law firm Mintz, Levin, Cohn, \n     Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C., with offices in Boston and \n     Washington, D.C. As a member of the Firm's Executive \n     Committee, previous President and CEO, and Chairman of the \n     Mintz Levin Community Service Program, I am pleased to be \n     here today to provide testimony regarding the commitment of \n     one law firm to make a significant and continuing difference \n     in the fight against domestic violence.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       Mintz Levin has strived for over 60 years to create and \n     maintain a workplace of diversity and tolerance, and to serve \n     the community as well as our clients.\n       In 1990, at the initiative of two first-year associates, \n     the Firm created the Mintz Levin Domestic Violence Project to \n     provide free legal representation to victims of domestic \n     violence. In 1994, the Firm decided to expand and focus its \n     community service commitment, and we chose the area of \n     domestic violence as the principal focus of all our future \n     community service. We hired a full-time Director of Community \n     Service and established a Community Service Fund to \n     complement our domestic violence pro bono practice and to \n     encourage Firm-wide participation.\n\n\n                     Domestic Violence Initiatives\n\n       Mintz Levin chose a three-pronged approach for our efforts \n     against domestic violence: public policy issues on a national \n     level; state and local efforts; and an internal focus within \n     the Firm.\n       Internal Focus. As the foundation of our domestic violence \n     initiatives, we began at home by working to give all our \n     employees access to the support needed to free themselves \n     from abusive situations. Mintz Levin provides its employees \n     with free legal assistance including, when necessary, helping \n     them to obtain restraining orders. Each new employee is given \n     an information packet including a resource card entitled \n     Where to Get Help if Domestic Violence is a Problem, which \n     identifies three Mintz Levin attorneys and one attorney from \n     another law firm who will provide free and confidential \n     assistance. In addition, a booklet entitled Domestic \n     Violence: The Facts is provided to each employee and lists \n     local resources. Our Human Resources Department has developed \n     a policy for managing family violence situations, and all \n     management staff have been trained to recognize and respond \n     to such situations. A speaker's bureau provides regularly \n     scheduled seminars to increase employee awareness. We have \n     also offered Model Mugging safety-defense classes in both our \n     Boston and Washington offices. As a result of our efforts, \n     our employees feel free to come forward for assistance and do \n     so on a regular basis.\n       Mintz Levin also creates opportunities for broad-based \n     participation by our employees in community service \n     activities. A Domestic Violence Task Force, consisting of \n     attorneys, senior professionals and other employees, \n     regularly reviews and advises with respect to the \n     Firm's public policy and program development initiatives. \n     A Community Service Advisory Committee, consisting \n     primarily of administrative and support staff, initiates \n     volunteer projects and Firmwide events on behalf of local \n     domestic violence organizations. The Firm encourages \n     interested employees to assist shelters, advocacy groups \n     and other organizations on Firm time.\n\n[[Page S5557]]\n\n       State and Local Efforts. The second component of Mintz \n     Levin's domestic violence initiative consists of continuing \n     efforts at the state and local levels, enabling us to utilize \n     our skills as legal advocates and to identify opportunities \n     for new, innovative projects in the Greater Boston and \n     Washington, D.C. communities. Our attorneys and senior \n     professionals are active in a wide variety of service and \n     planning committees, and our Domestic Violence Project \n     continues to provide pro bono legal representation to victims \n     of domestic violence. The Project is staffed by specially \n     trained Mintz Levin attorneys, paralegals and project \n     analysts, who have been accepting restraining order cases \n     from Greater Boston Legal Services since July 1990. To date, \n     participants in the Project have been successful in obtaining \n     protective orders, vacate orders, and temporary custody and \n     support orders for over 100 clients. Project attorneys also \n     assist clients in the enforcement of such orders. The Project \n     provides clients with social services referrals for their \n     non-legal needs, such as housing and counseling. In \n     Washington, we have also represented battered women in court \n     and sponsored city-wide training sessions to encourage other \n     attorneys to do the same.\n       Through our Domestic Violence Project, Mintz Levin \n     attorneys have also represented battered women in appellate \n     matters before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and \n     have filed briefs amici curiae in both federal and state \n     courts. Such appellate work is essential to the \n     interpretation and enforcement of laws intended to protect \n     victims of domestic violence. Law firms, especially large \n     ones like Mintz Levin, are uniquely situated to muster the \n     legal resources necessary to undertake such appellate cases.\n       In addition to pro bono client services, Project \n     participants work with the Massachusetts Coalition of \n     Battered Women Service Groups toward the enactment of \n     legislation that will afford greater protection to victims of \n     domestic violence. As a result of these efforts, the Project \n     was instrumental in securing the passage in December 1990 of \n     the Act to Further Protect Abused Persons, which \n     substantially strengthened the Massachusetts Abuse Prevention \n     statute. In December 1993, the Project worked with the \n     Massachusetts Coalition of Battered Women Service Groups for \n     the passage of legislation that directs judges to consider \n     evidence of past or present domestic violence in custody and \n     visitation proceedings. More recently, Project members worked \n     to further the enactment of the Massachusetts Weapons Bill, \n     which takes guns, ammunition and other weapons out of the \n     hands of batterers.\n       Our experience has demonstrated that the opportunities to \n     serve are not limited to the fields of litigation or \n     government relations. Mintz Levin's real estate and \n     environmental law professionals have provided pro bono legal \n     services to non-profit corporations which have built shelters \n     for the victims of domestic violence and transitional housing \n     for homeless women and their families. In 1986, the Firm \n     began its representation of the Elizabeth Stone House, an \n     alternative mental health and battered women's shelter, with \n     the acquisition of two buildings and the conversion of them \n     into a battered women's shelter and a transitional housing \n     program.\n       In 1993, the Firm represented the Asian Task Force Against \n     Domestic Violence in its efforts to build a 12-bed emergency \n     shelter for battered women and their children. This shelter \n     was the first shelter for Asian women in New England. In the \n     past year, more than 170 women have used the Asian Shelter, \n     and the shelter has received 1,000 calls for help and another \n     4,000 calls seeking information. It is an especially \n     important facility for Asian women since it provides a hot \n     line and counselling in a number of Asian languages, and \n     language barriers have often prevented Asian women from \n     seeking help at traditional shelters. Attorneys from the Firm \n     have served on the Board of Directors of both the Elizabeth \n     Stone House and the Asian Task Force Against Domestic \n     Violence.\n       The issues of homelessness and substance abuse are \n     intertwined with that of domestic violence. Therefore, the \n     Firm's real estate and environmental law attorneys have given \n     their time to help the Women's Institute for Housing and \n     Economic Development develop two transitional programs for \n     women, one for women recovering from substance abuse and one \n     for homeless women and their families.\n       In Massachusetts, we work closely with the Massachusetts \n     Coalition of Battered Women Service Groups, helping them \n     obtain funds for shelters and to develop programs that \n     provide assistance to battered women and their children. We \n     act as advisors to district attorneys, to the Governor's \n     office and to legislators on the issue of domestic violence. \n     We have worked with the Massachusetts Coalition of Battered \n     Women Service Groups toward the enactment of legislation to \n     help prevent placing children at risk from batterers, by \n     creating a rebuttable presumption that a parent who engages \n     in a ``pattern'' or ``serious incidence'' of abuse against \n     his or her partner should not be awarded sole or joint \n     custody over their children. Our efforts extend to helping \n     the Massachusetts Coalition of Battered Women Service Groups \n     obtain funding for their member shelters, including by \n     bringing together committed advocates and legislators who \n     keep the issue of funding active in the agenda of the \n     Massachusetts legislature.\n       In 1990, the Project received an award from the Young \n     Lawyers Division of the Boston Bar Association; and in 1992, \n     the Project received an award from the Women's Bar \n     Association for its work on behalf of victims of domestic \n     violence. In 1994, the Rose Foundation presented an award to \n     Mintz Levin for its efforts in the area of domestic violence. \n     We are encouraged by these recognitions of our work to hope \n     that other firms will join us in helping battered women and \n     children.\n       Our Community Service Program also includes non-legal \n     direct service work. As part of the Polaroid CEO Challenge, \n     we have partnered with the Elizabeth Stone House, building on \n     our long-standing commitment to that organization. The CEO \n     Challenge encourages business leaders to end domestic \n     violence by partnering with a battered women's shelter, \n     providing support and advocacy. Our partnership with \n     Elizabeth Stone House has to date included a mentoring \n     program for children, and internship program in our \n     production department for women seeking new job skills, a \n     children's holiday party, and a very successful effort to \n     raise money to provide a new roof. Mintz Levin also worked \n     with the Massachusetts Office of Victim Assistance, by \n     helping to craft and implement ``safe plan'', a program that \n     provides women with protection and assistance through each \n     step of their escape from violence. And we have provided \n     support services to Peace At Home, one of the first \n     organizations to define domestic violence as a human rights \n     issue.\n       National Level. On a national level, we are proud to be \n     affiliated with the National Network to End Domestic \n     Violence. As you know, The National Network was instrumental \n     in the drafting of the Violence Against Women Act, and \n     working for its passage and funding. The Violence Against \n     Women Act is historic legislation, and I applaud your \n     championship, Senator Hatch, of the issue of violence against \n     women and children. Our efforts on behalf of the National \n     Network have included our serving as pro bono legal counsel, \n     as well as providing office space and administrative support, \n     and organizational development, as well as writing amicus \n     briefs regarding the confidentiality of records of battered \n     women and rape crisis service providers.\n       Other national efforts include Mintz Levin's participation \n     in the newly organized National Workplace Resource Center, \n     where we serve as Co-chair of the Corporate Social \n     Responsibility Sub-committee, and as liaison to the American \n     Bar Association's Commission on Domestic Violence.\n       Charitable Contributions. Our initiatives include financial \n     contributions, which we make through our Community Service \n     Fund, as well as in-kind contributions. Mintz Levin in-kind  \n     contributions include donations of clothing, furniture, \n     office supplies, graphic design, printing and training \n     events. We have identified a continuing need of grassroots \n     organizations for assistance in strategic planning, \n     business development and computer technology. We consider \n     the funding of an organizational development consultant to \n     be an excellent form of in-kind contribution. For example, \n     when the Same Sex Domestic Violence Coalition applied to \n     our Community Service Fund, we suggested a contribution of \n     a day-long strategic planning session with a consultant of \n     their choice. The group accepted and, six weeks after \n     their planning session, we received an invitation to a \n     community forum which they had identified as the first \n     step in their strategic plan. The community forum inspired \n     an active group of forty organizations and committed \n     individuals who are now working together to develop \n     services for victims of same sex domestic violence.\n\n\n                            Lessons Learned\n\n       The Power of Networking. Mintz Levin draws upon the \n     knowledge and commitment of approximately 600 employees, \n     including over 225 attorneys and senior professionals. As a \n     large law firm, we have experience with the justice system, \n     connections to the corporate community, extensive state and \n     federal government relations capabilities, and a remarkable \n     ability to make a difference. I believe the greatest service \n     that Mintz Levin has offered in its six-year-old domestic \n     violence initiative has been to open doors which have \n     traditionally been shut to battered women and children and \n     their advocates, and to make the introductions necessary for \n     diverse leaders with very different backgrounds to form new \n     partnerships.\n       I would like to mention a few examples. One of our goals \n     has been that resources for battered women and their children \n     be easily accessible, and that domestic violence advocates \n     and service organizations be able to communicate with each \n     other across the country. We encouraged our client America \n     Online (``AOL''), which operates the country's largest \n     consumer online service, to consider a domestic violence area \n     within its new Digital City Boston. AOL responded \n     enthusiastically. At my request, the Mintz Levin Director of \n     Community Service brought together representatives from AOL \n     and local domestic violence activists to design and implement \n     a domestic violence area. The Massachusetts Coalition of \n     Battered Women Service Groups is now partnering with AOL, and \n     involved advocates are receiving the training and software \n     necessary to maintain the area. A representative from the \n     Public Educational Technical Assistance Project of the \n     National Resource Center on Domestic Violence, funded by the \n     Centers for Disease Control, is involved to ensure \n     coordination with other emerging domestic violence online \n     networks. The area is scheduled to open\n\n[[Page S5558]]\n\n     in June, and I hope it will be a precursor to a national \n     online network.\n       We have been pleased, and occasionally surprised, by the \n     interest of others in supporting our efforts. As part of our \n     fund raising efforts to provide a new roof for the Elizabeth \n     Stone House, we received a donation of roofing materials from \n     a Firm client, and donations from several vendors for a \n     silent auction. I have recently agreed to serve as Co-chair \n     for a Men's Advisory Committee for the Massachusetts \n     Coalition of Battered Women Service Groups, which I hope will \n     encourage other businessmen to become personally involved in \n     working to end domestic violence.\n       Mintz Levin was also instrumental in the establishment of \n     the Jane Doe Safety Fund. Through our corporate clients, we \n     were able to bring together corporations, foundations and \n     other funds to provide guidance and financial assistance to \n     members of the domestic violence community who wanted to \n     establish a fund to educate the public about domestic \n     violence and to support battered women's shelters. The Jane \n     Doe Safety Fund is now in its fifth year of existence.\n       Mintz Levin plans to continue its public policy efforts in \n     the area of domestic violence on both a state and national \n     level, including our partnerships with the National Network \n     and the Elizabeth Stone House, as well as our own Firm-based \n     education and prevention programs. The broad-based \n     involvement and enthusiasm of our employees reinforces and \n     deepens our commitment to the issue. We will also continue to \n     use our access and relationships to encourage and foster new \n     public/private partnerships. Building a network of like-\n     minded law firms across the country is one of our goals for \n     the coming year.\n       Economic Security. Economic security is listed as the \n     number one reason battered women go back to their abusers. It \n     would be wrong to separate artificially the problem of \n     domestic violence from the issues of free legal services, \n     social services and child support programs. Battered women \n     need more support, not less, to end abusive relationships.\n       Learning from Others. Our initiatives in domestic violence, \n     and our partnerships with the National Network, the Elizabeth \n     Stone House, and other service organizations, have taught us \n     that in addition to having a lot to offer, we have a lot to \n     learn. From battered women and their advocates we can learn \n     what is needed next to end domestic violence and how and when \n     our resources and skills can best help. The passage and \n     funding of the Violence Against Women Act has already \n     created, and will continue to create, opportunities for \n     unlikely partnerships. Domestic violence advocates, law \n     firms, corporations, government agencies and the judicial \n     system each have their own perspectives on the problem of \n     domestic violence, and we all may be a bit parochial in our \n     approaches. Building new models of collaboration is both \n     challenging and rewarding. Our new partnerships require \n     building new bridges. We must learn to work respectfully with \n     people and organizations with very different histories, \n     different measures of success, and sometimes even histories \n     as adversaries. As we create new models of cooperation, we \n     must also recognize that it will take time, patience, \n     goodwill and even humor to go the distance.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Chairman Hatch and Members of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, I offer my congratulations and thanks for your \n     leadership in the passage of the Violence Against Women Act. \n     I also thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. \n     It is my belief that lawyers and law firms are in a unique \n     position to become innovative partners in the implementation \n     of the Act. My colleagues and I look forward to working with \n     others in the legal profession to make a significant \n     contribution to the fight against domestic violence.\n       Respectfully submitted, Kenneth J. Novack.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5556-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5558-S5562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CHARLES MEISSNER\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the tragic plane crash in Croatia last \nmonth that took the life of Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown also took \nthe lives of other outstanding officials in the Department of Commerce, \nincluding Charles F. Meissner, who was Assistant Secretary for \nInternational Economic Policy and who was also the husband of Doris \nMeissner, the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization \nService. During the 1970's, he had served with great distinction for \nseveral years on the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Our hearts go out to the Meissner family in this time of their great \nloss. In the days following that tragedy, a number of eloquent tributes \nto Charles Meissner described his extraordinary career, his dedication \nto public service, and his contributions to our country and to peoples \nthroughout the world. I believe these tributes will be of interest to \nall of us in Congress and to many others, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the tributes were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Tribute to Charles Meissner\n\n                        (By Stuart E. Eizenstat)\n\n       Doris, Christine, Andrew, family and friends of Chuck \n     Meissner. I feel doubly blessed by my association with the \n     Meissner family. In the Carter Administration it was my good \n     fortune to work closely with Doris on immigration issues--to \n     see directly her intelligence, her calm amidst the pressures \n     of policymaking, her quiet dignity, her dedication to public \n     service. It was then that I first came in contact with Chuck.\n       But it was during the past 2\\1/2\\ years, with me in \n     Brussels and Chuck in Washington, that we formed an intense \n     professional and personal bond which profoundly influenced \n     me. We worked together on every important trade and \n     commercial issue involving the European Union and its member \n     states.\n       During Chuck's frequent travels to Brussels, he stayed with \n     Fran and me, and had many meals with us. Chuck and I attended \n     innumerable meetings together. When my appointment to my \n     current position at Commerce became known, I spent a great \n     deal of time talking and meeting with Chuck, seeking his \n     advice and counsel and telling him of my plans to beef-up the \n     International Economic Policy unit he so ably led. Our last \n     conversation came only a few days before his trip to Bosnia \n     and Croatia.\n       During Chuck's all-too-brief tenure as Assistant Secretary, \n     there was hardly a continent that did not benefit from \n     Chuck's sterling efforts. Chuck used his extensive financial \n     experience at Chemical Bank and the World Bank to encourage \n     private sector investment in the border regions in Mexico, as \n     chair of the U.S.-Mexico Border Economic Development task \n     force. He helped to expand economic contacts between the West \n     and Central Europe and the states of the former Soviet Union \n     by his work to invigorate the Economic Forum of the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and by \n     the drive and leadership he gave to the West-East Economic \n     Conferences.\n       Chuck was inspiring in his work with large and small \n     American companies. He had a flair for dealing with CEOs. \n     They empathized with him and understood his global vision. \n     Nowhere was this better exemplified than in the Transatlantic \n     Business Dialogue. Secretary Brown initiated the idea that \n     U.S. and European business should take the lead in helping \n     government design future transatlantic commercial policy. But \n     it was Chuck that made this idea work. The success of the \n     historic conference in Seville, Spain, last November that \n     brought a 100 leading American and European CEOs together \n     was due in large part to Chuck.\n       Following on his deep conviction that trade was the best \n     force for peace, Chuck used his boundless energy to bring \n     American companies together with companies in emerging \n     democracies and in reforming countries. He was the leading \n     force behind President Clinton's White House Conference on \n     trade and investment in Eastern Europe, held in Cleveland \n     last year. That conference exposed America's top companies to \n     the genuine opportunities to build commercial bridges to \n     Central Europe.\n       He poured his heart into using commercial policy to support \n     the peace process in Northern Ireland. He was particularly \n     proud, and justly so, of bringing scores of companies there \n     to support our efforts and those of the British government to \n     bring peace to that troubled land. When peace finally comes \n     to Northern Ireland, as it surely will, Chuck Meissner will \n     have played a major role in being a midwife. He was just \n     beginning to do the same in Haiti.\n       It was on another such venture to undergird a fragile \n     peace, that took Chuck and Ron Brown to Croatia and Bosnia. \n     He died doing what he loved, using the resources of the \n     American private sector to strengthen the forces of peace and \n     democracy abroad. The terrible conflict in Bosnia has now \n     claimed several friends, earlier Bob Frasure, and now Chuck, \n     Ron and our other colleagues at the Commerce Department.\n       Chuck maintained a punishing travel schedule, as he was \n     driven to extend our commercial diplomacy round the world. He \n     joked to me that he only saw Doris, with her own demanding \n     schedule, as their planes criss-crossed in the sky! And \n     Doris, his love for you and the children was evident in the \n     fond ways in which he talked about you.\n       But all of this was a continuation of a life devoted to \n     public service, with a particular emphasis on expanding \n     America's economic relationships abroad, relationships which \n     are the very essence of our efforts to expand democracy and \n     prosperity around the globe. He served in senior positions in \n     the Treasury Department, on the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee, where he was Staff Director of the Subcommittee on \n     Foreign Relations, and in the State Department where he was \n     Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Finance and \n     Development and Ambassador and U.S. Special Negotiator for \n     Economic Matters. Chuck's service to the United States was \n     not limited to civilian positions. He was a Vietnam veteran, \n     decorated on several occasions for his bravery in combat as a \n     Captain in the United States Army.\n       But will all of these accomplishments, I will most remember \n     Chuck with genuine love and affection for something more \n     personal. Few people have touched me the way Chuck did. He \n     had a wonderful joy of life and sense of humor. He made me \n     laugh--not always easy to do! When I told Doris at her home \n     Friday about this, she said, ``You\n\n[[Page S5559]]\n\n     know, one of the reasons I married Chuck was that he made me \n     laugh too!''\n       When Chuck came into a room his radiance lit it up. That \n     beautiful smile and almost cherubic face--like a grown-up \n     version of one of Raphael's endearing child angels--never \n     failed to touch me deeply and to the core. I was drawn to \n     Chuck, as I know all of you were, by not only his obvious \n     competence but by his basic decency, his goodness, his \n     wonderful humanity. Chuck believed in causes but he never \n     forgot the people who were to benefit from them.\n       Just as we all feel blessed by Chuck's friendship, and by \n     his caring, all of us also feel, in our own way, cheated by \n     his tragic death--for myself, deprived of an opportunity to \n     work even closer together on the causes he so believed in, \n     deprived of more time to nurture our friendship, deprived of \n     the chance to simply feel so good in his presence.\n       But all of this pales in comparison to the loss for Doris \n     and the children of a husband, a father, a companion. There \n     is an old saying, that ``men and women plan, but God laughs \n     at our plans and has his own for us.'' None of us can \n     possibly explain this tragedy. All one can say is that God on \n     High must have been particularly lonely and needed Chuck's \n     companionship and laughter; as those who knew him on this \n     imperfect earth so reveled in it.\n       Chuck, we loved you as you loved us. Our memories are sweet \n     as the fragrances of Spring will surely come. They did not \n     die with you. All of your friends will always be the better \n     for you having come into our lives with your wonderful \n     countenance.\n       Doris, we hope that our prayers and the heartfelt feelings \n     of your colleagues in the Justice Department, the Commerce \n     Department and throughout the Administration will strengthen \n     you in these dark and difficult days, and will sustain you as \n     you continue to service the country so well for which Chuck \n     gave his life.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                    Reflections on Charles Meissner\n\n                            (By Michael Ely)\n\n       Today it is my honor briefly to talk to you about Charles \n     Meissner and the central theme of his working life, service \n     to his government and, more broadly, service to his nation \n     and to the world. Chuck might have been embarrassed by this \n     discussion. His sense of personal responsibility and \n     commitment was so deep and integrated into his life that it \n     became part of his personality. It went right down to his \n     toenails. He felt that devotion to the public good was normal \n     and natural behavior, even if not widely shared in a world \n     full of people in futile pursuit of private gain and \n     satisfaction outside of and divorced from the public good.\n       Indeed, his concept of the good was universal, comparable \n     to what we might think of as the inner vision of a saint, but \n     tempered by years of experience in addressing complex issues \n     of public policy where the path to the good is unmarked and \n     has to be discovered or even created. Here was an area that \n     must have drawn Doris and Chuck together: their willingness, \n     even eagerness, to grapple with policy issues with difficult \n     tradeoffs, no easy solutions and multiple painful outcomes. \n     Chuck sought to reconcile commercial affairs with broader \n     national interests; Doris deals with the terrible tensions \n     between social decency and justice and conflicting economic \n     and social problems.\n       Our paths first came together in the State Department \n     almost two decades ago. From a senior staff position with the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee he had been parachuted in, \n     as it were, as Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of \n     Economic Affairs, then a powerful and aggressive organization \n     with entirely State personnel. Chuck used to joke, with some \n     reason, that I was brought in as his principal deputy to keep \n     an eye on him. We ended up mentoring each other, he with his \n     broad Treasury and Senate background, I a decade older with \n     depth in overseas diplomatic service and State bureaucratic \n     background. Our relations, warmed by Chuck's openness, \n     honesty and obvious ability, deepened into mutual trust and \n     ripened into friendship.\n       It was in retrospect an exciting and creative period. In \n     the wake of the first oil shock and the world economic \n     slowdown many countries in Latin America, Africa and eastern \n     Europe could not repay to the US hundreds of millions in \n     official debts contracted in better times. It was Chuck's \n     labor of Hercules to sort out the economic implications and \n     the sticky foreign and domestic politics to come up with a \n     set of US government responses. A thankless business--he \n     specialized, like Doris, in thankless tasks--with infinite \n     opportunity for offending the Congress, the Treasury, the \n     debtor countries and the other creditors.\n       It was in this thicket of problems that he encountered \n     Michel Camdessus, then a very senior officer of the French \n     Treasury, and like him an official of extraordinary breadth \n     and ability. Their initial adversarial relations were \n     transformed by mutual appreciation into a partnership that \n     defined the rules for handling sovereign debt, and lived on \n     through the years that followed.\n       The dozen years Chuck spent sorting out the debt problems \n     of the Chemical Bank and experiencing the institutional \n     culture of the World Bank were stepping stones to his policy \n     position in Commerce; all of us confidently expected his star \n     to mount in the coming years, the years that have been taken \n     from him.\n       As a negotiator he was matchless. He won, of all things, by \n     being straight! To begin with, Chuck was deeply uninterested \n     in the social luxuries of diplomatic life (I finally got him \n     to recognize the difference between red and white wines) and \n     skipped the cocktail parties unless he had a diplomatic chore \n     to do there. For another, he neither bluffed nor threatened, \n     nor did he respond to such tactics; while he could sense the \n     hidden agenda of his adversary, he had none of his own; and \n     his attention never wavered nor temper flared. His physical \n     vitality and a Churchillian ability to snatch catnaps \n     equipped him to outlast the most tenacious adversary. And his \n     patience had no end.\n       This perhaps gives one insight into the secret of Chuck's \n     consistent success as a public servant: a unmatched \n     combination of selflessness, honesty, self control, and \n     hunger for the public good that set him apart and armored him \n     against any accusations of personal advantage. All this was \n     matched by easy good humor, modesty, natural courtesy and a \n     radiant smile that made this man, in some respects really \n     most formidable, one of the least threatening I have ever \n     known. The biggest occupational hazard of diplomacy is vanity \n     and it increases with rank. Chuck's ambassadorial title, \n     conferred to increase his negotiating prestige, never \n     impressed him; he laughingly liked to suggest he be called \n     Ambassador Chuck.\n       Yet he was a true intellectual--he would not have liked the \n     term--with an original, searching mind that looked so broadly \n     and deeply as to go quite beyond the reach of most of us. \n     Because of this he was, I think, sometimes quite alone--very \n     few could stay with him at the vertiginous level of \n     conceptualization that he felt was--is--urgently needed to \n     think out tough problems. It was to help in this endeavor \n     that he asked me to join him as an advisor.\n       In particular, Chuck was convinced that the age calls for \n     new and creative ways to use the dynamism and power of the \n     American private sector as an instrument for peace, stability \n     and democracy. In his two years at Commerce he wrestled with \n     the challenge of integrating foreign commercial policy with \n     its materially-driven bottom-line goals with broader foreign \n     policy to find how they could be used to energize and \n     reinforce each other. The breakthroughs for reconciliation in \n     Ireland, which Chuck created almost single handedly, were \n     propelled by his vision of economic growth and development \n     based on cooperative measures to induce private investment by \n     American enterprises.\n       Underlying all of his endeavors--his efforts in Ireland, \n     his attempts to strengthen the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe, his approach to the problems of the \n     big emerging markets--was a great long-term vision. He \n     believed that the essential task of the post-Cold War era was \n     to structure incentives and institutions for bringing all the \n     Russias, Chinas and Bosnias--all the reforming and emerging \n     countries--into the world economic order. Chuck dreamed of a \n     world of peace, stability and democracy built upon \n     irreversible global interdependence: all nations would have \n     more to gain by cooperating, by participating in an open \n     world system based on the rule of law, than by resort to \n     traditional unilateral attempts to seek advantage. He saw the \n     vast American commercial structure as a central instrument in \n     this great scheme.\n       He was working on how to articulate this broad concept into \n     a series of strategies when he was taken from us.\n       A week ago Stuart Eizenstat led a gathering of Commerce \n     employees in reflection on the loss of Chuck and his \n     colleagues. In that moving ceremony one of the respondents \n     from the audience declared that the finest memorial for the \n     perished would be to continue to work toward the goals they \n     believed in. So be it with Charles Meissner, visionary, \n     public servant, man of honor--and husband, father and friend. \n     His memory will strengthen and sustain us as we continue his \n     gallant search.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   The Honorable Charles F. Meissner\n\n       Charles Meissner was sworn in as the Assistant Secretary \n     for International Economic Policy at the Department of \n     Commerce on April 4, 1994 following confirmation by the \n     United States Senate. As Assistant Secretary, Mr. Meissner \n     was responsible for international commercial policy \n     development, including country and regional market access \n     strategies, multilateral and bilateral trade issues, and \n     policy support of Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown on \n     international issues.\n       Since 1992, Mr. Meissner had served at the World Bank as \n     manager of the Office of Official Co-financing and Trust Fund \n     Management. Mr. Meissner was responsible for maintaining the \n     Bank's financial relationships with official co-financiers \n     who co-finance approximately $10 billion in projects annually \n     with the World Bank.\n       Previously, Mr. Meissner served as Vice President at \n     Chemical Bank where he coordinated sovereign debt \n     restructuring policy within the bank and represented Chemical \n     in negotiations with debtor countries.\n       In 1980, Mr. Meissner was appointed Ambassador and U.S. \n     Special Negotiator for Economic Matters. Mr. Meissner has \n     also served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for International \n     Finance and Development in the Bureau of Economic and \n     Business Affairs at the U.S. Department of State.\n       In 1973, he accepted a professional staff appointment to \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations of the U.S. Senate where \n     he served as\n\n[[Page S5560]]\n\n     an economist. In his final year with the committee, he also \n     served as staff director to the Subcommittee on Foreign \n     Assistance. He began his career in 1971 at the U.S. \n     Department of Treasury in the Office of International Affairs \n     where he worked as the Japan desk officer and as special \n     assistant to the Assistant Secretary for International \n     Affairs.\n       A native of Wisconsin, Mr. Meissner is a three-time \n     graduate of the University of Wisconsin, including a BS in \n     1964, an MS in Economics in 1967, and a Ph.D. in Agricultural \n     Economics with a minor in Latin American Studies in 1969. He \n     served in the Vietnam War as a Captain in the United States \n     Army during 1969 and 1970 and received for his service the \n     Army Commendation Medal, the Joint Service Commendation Medal \n     and the Bronze Star.\n       Doris and Chuck met during their freshman year at the \n     University of Wisconsin and were married in 1963. They have \n     two children, Christine, 31, and Andrew, 27.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague from \nMassachusetts to mourn the loss of Charles F. Meissner, the Assistant \nSecretary for International Economic Policy at the Commerce Department. \nHe was a man who devoted his life to furthering America's economic \nstrength; our Nation is the better for his service.\n  His close friends--leaders from the public and private sector--have \neulogized Chuck Meissner more ably than I could ever hope to do. I want \nto share their moving statements with my colleagues and with others of \nour Nation, so all Americans may know and understand how deeply America \nmisses his service and his leadership. I ask unanimous consent that \nthese tributes to the life and accomplishments of Chuck Meissner be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the tributes were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Tribute to Charles Meissner\n\n                         (By Michel Camdessus)\n\n       Having had the privilege for 18 years to be one of the \n     innumerable colleagues and friends of Chuck Meissner in the \n     international community, let me try to tell you what sort of \n     man he was for all of us.\n       Let me tell you first how we became friends, something, I \n     must say, which changed my life.\n       When I first met Chuck in 1978, he was the highly respected \n     and seasoned head of the U.S. delegation to the Paris Club--\n     this group of industrialized countries dealing with the \n     payment difficulties of the debtor countries--and I its newly \n     appointed and totally unprepared Chairman. It was there, as \n     Chuck tactfully guided me through the intricacies of \n     developing country debt, that I first came to know the fine \n     qualities that we all admired so much in him.\n       I must say, from the first he impressed me very much. He \n     was one of those people whose mere presence transformed a \n     group's life, focusing its purposes, adding to its \n     creativity, making it congenial and enthusiastic. What was \n     the secret of this? Was it his charm, his persuasiveness, his \n     distinction and natural nobleness, sense of humor, the fun he \n     found in working, his selfishness, his own sense of purpose \n     and dedication? All of these things, and more! The fact that \n     behind the opposite member at the negotiating table he saw a \n     person, and behind the problems, people; men, women, \n     children, whose opinion had to be sought given their \n     responsibility for their own destinies, people whose \n     suffering had to be alleviated, people who had to be given a \n     new chance . . . And more again, but you had to know him well \n     to perceive this and to be prepared to read it in his eyes, \n     his smile, his jokes, or in his silences, the extraordinary \n     way in which love was the unifying factor of his life. He \n     loved his family, he loved his friends, he loved his country, \n     the values of his country and to work for them, knowing \n     pretty well since his experience in Vietnam that this could \n     imply the ultimate sacrifice. Let me mention a few of these \n     values: the sense of responsibility for leading the way \n     toward a better world, confidence that it is always \n     worthwhile to help people stand again on their feet, to work \n     with them to build peace through solidarity. I said \n     solidarity; perhaps the proper word should be brotherhood \n     throughout the world ``from sea to shining seas.'' This was, \n     I think the professional secret of Chuck, the fact that in \n     one way or another, even in the most adverse situations, he \n     was always giving something of himself, putting his mind and \n     heart into achieving a better agreement, in finding a more \n     constructive solution.\n       I witnessed this many, many times, as the debt crises \n     multiplied the clients of the Paris Club, making Chuck a \n     regular customer on the transatlantic flights between \n     Washington and Paris. Let me tell you that I particularly \n     admired him on the occasion of an UNCTAD meeting in Manila \n     where, leading the American delegation, his role was decisive \n     in transforming an occasion which could have been \n     confrontational and rhetorical into an opportunity for \n     solidly laying down the basic principles (the so-called \n     ``features'') which since then have governed public \n     debt rescheduling operations. This could seem somewhat \n     esoteric to you, but if I tell you that since then, on the \n     basis of these principles, more than 250 billion dollars \n     of public debt has been generously rescheduled * * * and \n     65 countries have been given a new chance, you will have \n     some idea of the contribution Chuck made in making the \n     world a better place. No more of this.\n       In the days since that terrible tragedy on the hillside \n     outside Dubrovnik, Chuck's many friends, colleagues and \n     admirers around the world have recounted the many other \n     instances in which Chuck tried to make a difference--and \n     succeeded. In Belfast, where he had traveled many times to \n     assist in building economic bridges across the political \n     divide, and where, as I read in a message from the West \n     Belfast Economic Forum director: The community activists \n     working towards economic and social regeneration in West \n     Belfast came to know Charles Meissner. It was, however, to \n     Chuck Meissner's own credit as an individual, that we came to \n     also regard him as a friend. Over the past two years, Charles \n     Meissner returned to West Belfast on several occasions. \n     Always, he ensured that grassroots activists from the \n     disadvantaged communities were consulted and kept informed. \n     He understood that if there was to be a ``Peace Dividend'' \n     then any economic intervention from the USA must be targeted \n     specifically as those communities which have suffered most \n     from exclusion and marginalisation. Chuck recognised that \n     more than straightforward economic investment is required to \n     bring about economic regeneration. He valued the work of the \n     community organizations and the opinions of those with \n     firsthand experience of dealing with the problems in our \n     community. Chuck gave freely of his own time and expertise \n     and encouraged others, both within his department and among \n     the American business community to support locally based \n     economic initiatives.\n       Chuck's action was similar at the US-Mexican border, where \n     he worked to improve the economic and environmental \n     conditions. And most recently, in Bosnia where Chuck was \n     seeking to secure a fragile peace with the promise of a \n     better future through economic development and trade. Suffice \n     it here for me to quote his last declaration in Bosnia, I \n     quote the wire agencies:\n       `` `We want to build confidence in investing and \n     reestablish the internal confidence' between the Serbs, \n     Croats and Muslims, said Charles Meissner, assistant \n     secretary of commerce for international economic policy.\n       ``Development `gives a common ground that you re-establish \n     economically, developing the basis for interdependency,' he \n     said.''\n       This was Chuck, my friends, this is Chuck: a great man, a \n     great friend, a great American, a great builder of peace, one \n     of those ``God will call his children'' (Mat. 5-9), one of \n     those who can tell the Lord with a joyful assurance ``your \n     house will be my home.'' (Ps. 23).\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                Memorial Service for Charles F. Meissner\n\n                             (By Ted Crabb)\n\n       I came to know Chuck Meissner in the early '60's when I was \n     working, as I still do, at the Wisconsin Union, the student-\n     led community center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \n     Like his brother David, Chuck came to the Union not only to \n     take part in the social, cultural and recreational activities \n     the Union provided, but to help plan, develop and promote \n     those activities.\n       It tells you something about Chuck Meissner that in \n     choosing to become active at the Union as a student, he was \n     not deterred by the fact that his older brother had already \n     made his mark there, first as a committee chair and then as \n     president of the Union's student-faculty-alumni governing \n     board. Another person, less comfortable with himself, might \n     have chosen a different activity, or even a different college \n     in the first place. Not Chuck. If the Union was the place to \n     mix with students of diverse backgrounds, to meet informally \n     with professors, to debate the issues of the day, to \n     encounter new and provocative ideas, to get involved, then \n     that's where Chuck wanted to be.\n       It may have been at the Union that Chuck learned the \n     patience that would enable him to cope with the vagaries and \n     uncertainties of government service. Two years in a row, \n     Chuck was responsible for a lecture to be given by Werner von \n     Braun. Two years in a row, he made posters, distributed \n     notices to university classes, made arrangements for a \n     special dinner for the honored guest, even produced little \n     table tents resplendent with glittering rocket ships. Two \n     years in a row, von Braun canceled his appearance at the last \n     minute.\n       Certainly, Chuck learned at the Union how to deal with \n     dashed hopes. In his senior year, he was a candidate for \n     president of the Union but lost out to his good friend, Carol \n     Skornicka. It tells you something about Chuck that this \n     defeat was no permanent setback to their lifelong friendship.\n       Chuck left the university after he finished his graduate \n     work in Agricultural Economics, but he retained his interest \n     in the university and in the Wisconsin Union. For the last \n     eleven years, he served in an advisory role to the Union, \n     most recently as a member of the board of trustees of the \n     building association. In that role, he was the kind of board \n     member that a president or director both loves and fears.\n       Chuck didn't just attend meetings. He engaged himself in \n     them totally, asking tough questions, goading everyone to \n     more effort. And when he left the annual meeting after an \n     intense day and a half session, I knew that within a few \n     days, I'd get a letter from him. It wouldn't be one of those \n     innocuous,\n\n[[Page S5561]]\n\n     ``Thank you very much, you're doing a great job and enclosed \n     are my expenses'' letter. No. It would be two or three \n     single-spaced, tightly packed pages of ideas for the future \n     and suggestions for implementation. ``What is the Union \n     doing to prepare for a decline in funding when \n     undergraduate enrollment is cut back? What can you learn \n     and put into practice from the recent Carnegie Foundation \n     report on higher education? What is the Union doing to \n     serve the community in continuing education and to broaden \n     the life experiences of students?''\n       In one letter in 1990, Chuck focused on the role and image \n     of Union South, a second Union building, located on the \n     Engineering Campus and long seen by some as a sort of \n     afterthought, or as Chuck called it, ``the second child who \n     has to share his parents' love and always perform up to the \n     older sibling's standards.'' Chuck had a dozen different \n     ideas for upgrading its image, including the possible \n     rededication of the building to honor those who have promoted \n     civil and human rights in Wisconsin as a means of promoting \n     greater campus community feeling in the cause of a shared \n     heritage among blacks, whites, Hispanics, Asians and Native \n     Americans on campus.\n       At the 1991 meeting of the trustees, Chuck proposed the \n     establishment of a permanent endowment for the Union \n     trustees, to provide a stable source of funding for the \n     programming efforts of the Union and the upkeep and \n     renovation of the physical structures. He followed up his \n     suggestion with a three-page draft of a funding statement \n     that the board of trustees adopted at its next meeting, with \n     almost no changes, and which it has since implemented.\n       All directors of organizations should have members like \n     Chuck to prod and nudge.\n       The Wisconsin Union is a tiny entity in the world that \n     Chuck occupied. It tells you a lot about Chuck Meissner that \n     he gave it the same kind of focused attention he gave to the \n     global issues that made up his work day. Just last fall, he \n     was calling to ask me to send him information about the \n     Wisconsin Union that he could take to a person he'd met on a \n     trade mission, who was trying to build a campus community \n     center at his own college in Ireland.\n       The goals and the purpose of the Wisconsin Union as a \n     unifying force in a diverse community were not just words to \n     Chuck. He believed in the worth of student volunteer \n     activities. He never wavered from the view that the Union's \n     primary mission was to provide opportunities for volunteering \n     and to help students develop the skills that would make them \n     effective volunteers and contributors to their communities--\n     to become persons who were concerned not just with getting \n     something out of life but with putting something into life. \n     Chuck had great faith in students. He believed there was \n     little they could not accomplish if given the opportunity. \n     His constant question was, ``What is the student role in this \n     program or this function?''\n       To those of us who worked with Chuck at the Union, it was \n     no surprise that his last effort would be leading a group of \n     volunteer business leaders to Bosnia. Again, he had persuaded \n     others to apply their skills and talents to doing a job that \n     needed to be done. The scope of the job was mammoth: \n     beginning the healing of the unimaginable wounds of a civil \n     war and the rebuilding and revitalizing of an entire society. \n     But Chuck had seen that there was a role to be played by \n     volunteers who were willing to put their unique talents \n     and resources to work to help their larger community. As \n     he had done throughout his life, he was putting into \n     practice the Union ideal that the foundation of democracy \n     is the individual efforts of citizens, working together to \n     solve their common problems.\n       Many people say that heroism has vanished from America. We \n     in this audience know better. We know that Chuck Meissner was \n     a hero. Not only because he gave his life for his country or \n     because he took great risks in the service of his country or \n     flew dozens of hazardous and uncomfortable flights to remote \n     places, all of which he did, but also because he lived the \n     values to which many people give lip service. He honored his \n     commitments. He gave generously of himself, not for self-\n     aggrandizement or private fortune but for the worth of the \n     undertaking. He did what he did because it was the right \n     thing to do. And in the end he left the world a better place \n     for his having been here.\n       We think of Chuck and we remember that broad smile, that \n     gentle spirit, the way he could walk into a room of strangers \n     and put everyone at ease, his enjoyment of the rich and \n     varied experiences his jobs offered him, and that sense of \n     irony that helped him maintain his perspective in the heady \n     and unreal world of Washington politics. We think of the love \n     and pride that were so evident whenever Chuck talked about \n     Chris and Andrew. We think of his marriage to Doris: a \n     marriage in which each partner provided the ballast that \n     allowed the other to soar. And when we think of all these \n     things we can only be grateful that we knew Chuck and that he \n     was our friend.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the National Journal, Apr. 13, 1996]\n\n                       Here Was a Public Servant\n\n                           (By Ben Wildavsky)\n\n       The way a friend of Charles F. Meissner's tells the story, \n     Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown was once leading an \n     American delegation to Bonn when high-profile diplomat \n     Richard C. Holbrooke joined him in the head car of the U.S. \n     motorcade. Not long after the vehicles got under way, the \n     motorcade stopped. Holbrooke walked back to find Meissner in \n     another car and told him that Brown had requested that the \n     two of them trade places. ``I understand you're the guy who \n     tells him what to say before the meeting,'' Holbrooke told \n     Meissner.\n       Meissner, the assistant Commerce secretary for \n     international economic policy, was one of the best of that \n     unsung yet indispensable Washington class: the people who \n     tell other people what to say before the meeting. While he \n     was a distinguished international negotiator in his own \n     right, Meissner was fulfilling a key behind-the-scenes role \n     for Brown when he was killed in the April 3 plane crash that \n     took the lives of the Commerce Secretary and more than 30 \n     other Americans.\n       Those who knew Meissner say the 55-year-old international \n     economics expert showed by example what it means to live a \n     life of public service. ``He was a civil servant in the best \n     tradition of the European civil service, where it carries \n     much more prestige,'' said Jeffrey E. Garten, former Commerce \n     undersecretary for international trade and now dean of the \n     Yale School of Management. ``When I was nominated to go to \n     the Commerce Department, he was about the first person I went \n     to, to see if he would come with me.''\n       With the new Clinton Administration eager to give the \n     Commerce Department an active role in combining commercial \n     and foreign policy, Meissner's extensive background in \n     government and in international banking was tailor-made for \n     the department's mission. ``Chuck had the ideal profile in \n     that he had worked in the State Department but he had all \n     this private-sector experience,'' Garten said. ``Most \n     importantly, he knew how to deal with the bureaucracy--and in \n     the State Department, he was known for being very, very tough \n     in pursuing his goals, It was kind of a joke that when he \n     headed toward Treasury, they all left their offices because \n     they didn't want to spend the next three days arguing with \n     him. He was extremely tenacious.''\n       Charles William Maynes, editor of Foreign Policy magazine, \n     said Meissner deserves a share of the credit for the changed \n     role of the Commerce Department under Brown. In the \n     Administration's first three years, ``there was more foreign \n     policy coming out of the Commerce Department than any other \n     division,'' Maynes said. ``You can quarrel with it, but they \n     had a specific strategy and certain countries they targeted. \n     That is Chuck and Garten and Brown who did that--that's where \n     that came from.''\n       A graduate of the University of Wisconsin, where he earned \n     a doctorate in economics, Meissner received the Bronze Star \n     for his Army service during the Vietnam war. He began his \n     Washington career at the Treasury Department in 1971. \n     Following a five-year stint as a Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee economist, he joined the State Department as a \n     deputy assistant secretary and later gained ambassadorial \n     rank as the lead U.S. negotiator on international debt \n     rescheduling. Meissner spent nine years as a Chemical Bank \n     vice president, then moved to a senior World Bank post in \n     1992 before joining the Administration in April 1994. His \n     wife, Doris, became commissioner of the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service in 1993.\n       Meissner was known among colleagues and friends for an \n     engaging sense of humor and for his basic decency. In the \n     days after Meissner's death, a colleague spoke of the strong \n     interest he took in advancing the careers of the people who \n     worked for him. Another recalled the ``extraordinary''--and \n     successful--efforts Meissner made to help a Vietnamese woman \n     escape her country just before the fall of Saigon. Many \n     remembered his personal warmth.\n       ``He was splendid in every aspect of his personal and \n     professional life,'' said Richard M. Moose, undersecretary of \n     State for management, who first met Meissner around 1970 at \n     the U.S. military headquarters in Vietnam. Moose was then a \n     staff member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Meissner \n     was an Army Intelligence officer. Meissner helped brief the \n     visiting Capitol Hill aides and impressed Moose right away. \n     ``He found a way not to go along with the convention of \n     misleading congressional delegations,'' Moose said. Later, \n     when Meissner went to the Foreign Relations Committee, the \n     two became partners, taking numerous trips together to \n     Vietnam and Cambodia. ``It was like a traveling seminar in \n     macroeconomics,'' Moose said. ``He was terribly good at \n     taking his knowledge of economic theory and applying it to \n     very practical kinds of situations.''\n       Maynes said Meissner had a rare understanding of the real-\n     world intersection of politics and economics. ``He was an \n     out-standing economist and a devoted public servant,'' Maynes \n     said. ``But the most notable thing about him was that he was \n     an excellent negotiator.'' He observed that Meissner's \n     negotiating skills were ``so extraordinary'' he was asked to \n     stay at State in the Reagan Administration even though he was \n     a Democrat.\n       Other testimonials to Meissner's qualities abound. W. \n     Bowman Cutter, former deputy director of the National \n     Economic Council, said Meissner's high-level experience in \n     government and business made his judgment ``something you \n     could really rely on.'' Messiner ``obviously loved his work, \n     and he was good at it,'' said former Senate Majority Leader \n     George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, who\n\n[[Page S5562]]\n\n     worked side by side with Meissner in the U.S. effort to \n     promote economic development in Northern Ireland and called \n     him ``a good friend.''\n       In the end, another friend said, Meissner stood out for his \n     love of substance. ``The higher you go in government, the \n     more you come in touch with sharks or political animals who \n     really aren't interested in policy but who want to do favors \n     for people on the Hill, or do what looks good in tomorrow's \n     press stories,'' said Ellen L. Frost, a former trade official \n     now with the Institute for International Economics in \n     Washington. ``And Chuck was never one of those. He cared \n     about sound policy.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5558-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5562-S5563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HOLDS AGAINST MILITARY NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, before we recess to honor all veterans \nas we observe Memorial Day, I would like to bring a situation, which I \nfind extremely egregious, to the attention of my colleagues.\n  Today there are 25 military nominations pending before the Senate. \nThese general and flag officers have been on the Executive Calendar and \navailable for confirmation by the Senate since Thursday May 2, 1996. \nNow, 3 weeks later, they are still not confirmed because one Senator \nhas placed a hold on these nominations.\n  I do not like anonymous holds for any reason. I can understand a \nSenator holding a political civilian nominee until a meeting can occur \nor an agreement can be reached on an issue related to the civilian \nnominee's duties. In these cases the civilian nominee and the agency \nwould clearly understand who is holding the nomination and the \ncircumstances under which they may reach accommodation. In my view, \nthis type of hold is within the bounds of Senatorial privilege.\n  Traditionally, military nominations have not been the subject of \npolitical holds. In the past, we have seen military nominations held \nfor as long as a year. However, in these cases, the hold was not \nanonymous and the hold was imposed until an investigation of the \nactivities of the nominee could be completed to the Senator's \nsatisfaction. The 25 general and flag officers being held today are \nhostages, I believe, to a political debate which is totally unrelated \nto the qualifications or assignments of the nominees.\n  Let me review for my colleagues a few of the nominations which are \nbeing held. In the Air Force, Lt. Gen. Richard Myers has been nominated \nfor reappointment to lieutenant general and for assignment as the \nassistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Air Force Lt. \nGen. John Jumper has been nominated for reappointment to lieutenant \ngeneral and for assignment as Deputy Chief of Staff for Plans and \nOperations for the Air Force; Lt. Gen. Ralph Eberhart has been \nnominated for reappointment to lieutenant general and for assignment as \nCommander, U.S. Forces, Japan; Lt. Gen. Daniel Christman has been \nnominated for reappointment to lieutenant general and for assignment as \nthe Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy. Mr. President, these \nare not all of the 35 senior military officers currently under an \nanonymous hold, but they represent a sample of the effect of this hold.\n  Why would a Senator deny the Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff his \nkey assistant, the person who travels with the Secretary of State \nrepresenting the Chairman in critical foreign policy discussions? Why \nwould a Senator hold an officer selected for assignment as the plans \nand operations officer for the entire U.S. Air Force. We all understand \nthe global commitments of the Air Force. Why would a Senator deny the \nchief of staff of the Air Force the ability to fill this very critical \nbillet? Why would a Senator deny our U.S. Forces in Japan a commander \nor the cadets of the U.S. Military Academy their Superintendent? Is \nthere any political agenda so worthy as to merit such action? I think \nnot.\n  Mr. President, I abhor this tactic of holding military nominations \nhostage. I assure my colleagues this is not the way to force me or \nSenator Nunn to capitulate on a political issue. I strongly believe \nalso that the Department of Defense should not make concessions while \nmilitary nominees are held. We cannot allow military nominations to \nbecome bargaining chips in political disagreements, for local defense \ncontracts or approval of military construction projects. Military \npersonnel are selected for promotion and nominated by the President \nbased on their performance and potential for greater service. These are \nmerit based actions not political decisions. As chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, I will do everything possible to keep politics out \nof the military promotion process.\n  I urge the Senator who has placed a hold on the military nominations \nto release them and permit the Senate to confirm these key military \nleaders so they can continue to serve their country and perform the \nbusiness of national security.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today to \ndiscuss the current hold that has been placed on military nominations \nthat are pending on the Senate Calendar.\n  There are today 25 military nominations pending before the Senate. \nThese are nominations for promotion or appointment of men and women to \nthe flag and general officer grades in each of the military \ndepartments. These are people who have each performed in the service of \nour country with great distinction for over 20 years. They are \nindividuals who will continue to serve at the highest leadership levels \nin our military.\n  Some examples of the kinds of nominations that are pending include \nthe appointment of the next Commander of U.S. Air Forces in Japan; the \nappointment of the next Commander of U.S. Central Command Air Forces; \nthe appointment of the next Superintendent of the U.S. Military \nAcademy; and the promotion of 19 officers in the Navy to the grade of \nrear admiral.\n  Each appointment and promotion list has been considered by the Armed \nServices Committee and the committee has favorably reported each \nnomination to the Senate recommending confirmation. Some of these \nnominations were reported to the Senate on May 2; others on May 14. \nAlthough some of these nominations have been pending for 3 weeks, the \nSenate is not acting on them because they have been put on hold by one \nSenator.\n  I want to be clear here that I do not object to the long-standing \nSenate practice that permits a Senator to hold a nomination when there \nis a problem with a nomination. Even this should only be done when \nthere is sufficient cause. This is certainly not what is happening \nhere.\n  I strongly object to the tactic of putting a hold on military \nnominations in order to gain leverage on an issue that is totally \nunrelated to either the nominees themselves or the positions for which \nthey have been nominated. This is the announced purpose of the \nSenator's hold.\n  The Senate has had a strong tradition of not involving our military \nnominees in the politics of the Nation or in the politics of the \nSenate. That tradition is being ignored here and I think it is wrong.\n  There may be some that say that the holding up the nominations of men \nand women in uniform is an appropriate way of getting the attention of \nthe Department of Defense. In my judgment, it is inappropriate and I \nwould recommend the Pentagon leadership not react to this type of \nblackmail because, once they do, all military nominations would be at \nrisk.\n  And anyone that thinks it is appropriate to use military \nservicemembers as a bargaining chip for whatever reason does a \ntremendous disservice to those brave men and women who volunteer to \nserve our Nation in uniform and it does a tremendous disservce to this \ninstitution.\n  How do you tell a patriot who has served almost half his or her life \nin uniform, frequently in harms way, that they are not being confirmed \nfor promotion because a United States Senator wants to get the \nattention of someone in the administration?\n\n  We are talking here about people nominated to hold the positions of \nthe highest responsibility in our military services at a time when that \nmilitary is committed in harms way around the globe.\n  Additionally, the unnecessary delay of military nominations has some \nvery real consequences for the individuals and their families that I \nwant to mention.\n  The spring and early summer months are traditionally the periods of \nthe highest turnover for military personnel. Every effort is made to \neffect transfers during the summer months in order to cause as little \ndisruption to families during the school year.\n\n[[Page S5563]]\n\n  The reassignment of a senior military officer upon Senate \nconfirmation is often the lynchpin of a series of reassignments that \nmoves like a ``daiseychain'' down through the ranks.\n  Accompanying one 3-star appointment can be a series of nine or ten \nother moves. So, unnecessarily delaying confirmation has a tremendous \neffect on a number of officers--and their families--far removed from \nthe nominee. These families have to plan their moves, their travel and \nleave time. They can not move until the individual at the top moves. \nAnd the individuals at the top can not move until they are confirmed. \nOne reason for this is that the Senate does not want nominees to take \nany actions that presume the outcome of the confirmation process.\n  Additionally, it is important to note that some of the military \nnominees pending before the Senate could be promoted immediately if \nthey were confirmed. Therefore, holding up their confirmation is \nactually taking money out of the pockets of these officers. Surely, we \ndo not want to require a military officer to pay literally for a \npolitical disagreement in which he or she has no part.\n  If a Senator need to get someone's attention; if one Senate committee \nneeds to work out some difference with another Senate committee; if \nsomeone needs to gain support for a legislative proposal; there are \nways to do this without placing the military service members in the \nmiddle and adversely affecting them and their families.\n  Each day we ask these men and women to make tremendous sacrifices for \nour Nation. Sacrifices that no one in any other walk of life is asked \nto make. These men and women have earned the promotions and \nappointments for which they have been nominated. We do them a \ndisservice when the confirmation process is used as a tactic to gain \nadvantage in the Senate or in other circles.\n  Mr. President. I ask my colleagues to understand the effect that \nholding military nominations has on the men and women caught in the \nmiddle and to refrain using military nominations as hostages. I would \nhope that the Senator will release his hold so these nominees can be \nconfirmed prior to the Memorial Day recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5562-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5563-S5564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CHILDREN'S HEALTH: WHAT WORKS?\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as part of my ongoing commitment to \nchildren, I have come to the floor today to draw attention to my \nefforts to improve the health of American children and young people.\n  It is clear that many people work hard every day for the well-being \nof children in this country. However, we all can do--and need to do--so \nmuch more. Children's health in my home State of Washington is better \noverall, including lower infant mortality and better prenatal care. \nHowever, immunization rates and child nutrition need improvement.\n  Across our Nation, over 10 million children are uninsured. One in \nfour children are covered by Medicaid--more than half in working \nfamilies. And, nearly 200,000 babies were born in 1993 who had no \nprenatal care, or none until the last 3 months of pregnancy, despite \nthe fact that we know that averting one low birth-weight baby can \nprevent as much as $37,000 in initial hospital and doctor fees.\n  Internationally, among industrialized countries, America ranks 16th \nin the living standards of our poorest children, 18th in the gap \nbetween rich and poor children, and 18th in infant mortality.\n  Certainly, we all can do better for our children's well-being. We \nknow it, and the American people know it.\n  When I hear from people in Washington State on the topic of \nchildren's health, I hear common themes. People from Vancouver to \nYakima to Spokane to Tacoma worry about kids not having access to basic \nhealth care. They talk about children going to emergency rooms with \npreventable illnesses and injuries. Parents talk about feeling like \nthey need more and better information to make decisions affecting their \nchild's health.\n  In response to those concerns, you will continue to see me working in \nthree different areas to improve and protect children's health and \nwell-being:\n  First, keep effective national standards for health care in place for \nall children, including those with special needs.\n  Second, make prevention the centerpiece of our national children's \nhealth policy.\n  Third, increase access to information for families to make the best \ndecisions possible for their children.\n  There are several ways to do more for children, and not all of them \nare difficult. One way to help kids is simply to draw attention to the \npeople, programs, and services that are working and doing a good job \nfor children today.\n  In my home State of Washington, for example, we are helping children \nto be more healthy in a variety of ways.\n  In Ellensburg and in Coupeville, through a program now running in \nfour counties that I hope one day goes statewide, parents of young \nchildren get two important services that help them make the best \ndecisions for their children.\n  First, any parent of a child between birth and age 6 gets special \nmailings and health information sent to their home, including \ninformation on well-baby checkups, immunizations, safety, and normal \npatterns of growth and development. All at no cost to the parents, and \nall for a total cost of about $10 per child.\n  Second, parents get reminders and assistance to get the many \nimmunizations their child will need. We know children should be \nprotected from a host of childhood illnesses, from diphtheria and \ntetanus, and from polio to measles, mumps, and rubella. We also know \npeople are busy, and need reminders, access to affordable vaccines, and \nlots of information. This program is a good start.\n  There is also a dental health promotion effort underway in my State. \nIn the past, many dentists' advice to parents has been to bring \nchildren in for their first visit about the time they start school, at \nage 4 or 5. The problem is that many children show up to their first \ndental visit with decay, gum problems--in many cases so serious that \nthey require dental surgery--because of preventable causes.\n  The Access to Baby and Child Dentistry [ABDC] program in Spokane, WA, \nreaches out to families with young children and encourages early dental \nvisits. ABDC dentists remind them to do things like remove baby bottles \nat the proper age, and not give babies soft drinks or candy bars. In \naddition, dentists, apply fluoride varnishes and other treatments to \nbaby teeth, and do other clinical procedures to decrease a baby's \nchances of developing dental problems.\n  These measum save all of us money in the long run.\n  Sometimes bringing awareness to a problem is not enough. I mentioned \nthat we need to preserve national standards for children's health. This \nmust happen at the national level.\n  This Friday, tomorrow, the National Highway Traffic Safety Commission \nand Prevention magazine will release Prevention's 1996 report on auto \nsafety in America. I hope we all pay attention to their findings. Last \nyear, the report included information on child safety helmets. This \nyear, their report will focus on the things we can do to make \nautomobile travel safer.\n  Effective national standards for children's health do not have to be \nsome scientific formula. Sometimes it's as easy as retaining a Federal \nspeed limit, or Federal safety regulations. We know that the 55-mile-\nper-hour speed limit has saved countless children's lives. We know that \nthe automobile industry has made great strides to improve automobile \nsafety. We know air bags improve safety, and that cellular telephone \nuse probably decreases it.\n  When it comes to the basic safety of our children, it should not \ndepend on which line on a map they just crossed on their family \nvacation.\n  As a final note, I want to remind you all that on June 1, the \nChildren's Defense Fund will host Stand for Children, an event in \nWashington, DC, that will bring Americans together, to show their \nshared commitment to children. We spend so much time talking about our \ndifferences of opinion. We need to respect our opposing view, but get \nbeyond them to common ground and common sense action for children.\n  I encourage all Americans who can attend this event to do so. It will \nbe a\n\n[[Page S5564]]\n\nday to rally around our children, and show them how important they are \nto us all. This will be a day of fun family activies, and togetherness, \nand of the power of individual action.\n  I have heard from many people around the country who cannot attend \nthe event. I encourage you to support those at the Lincoln Memorial in \nyour thoughts and prayers, I encourage every American to do at least \none thing to make a difference in the life of a child, and June 1 would \nbe a great place to start. If anyone wants more information on the \nStand for Children event they can call 1-800-233-1200.\n  Anyone who is listening can make it easier for one child to get \nappropriate health care. Offer to provide child care or a ride to the \nclinic, so someone's child can go to a medical check-up or get \nimmunized.\n  We all can help prevent health problems to avoid bigger costs later \non. Anyone listing can volunteer to distribute information on health \nscreenings, immunizations, or blood drives. Lead a safety committees or \nfitness day at the local park, school, or community center. Help to \nfind or build affordable housing in your area.\n  You can stay educated and prepared about children's health. Read \nabout childhood illnesses. Make a personal medical history for each \nmember of your family, so you can be ready in the case of illness or \ntrauma.\n  Nothing is more vital to a child than her basic health. A child must \nbe healthy to learn well. She must be educated to participate and \ncontribute to our society. But we must start with making sure we do \neverything we can for her basic well-being.\n  You will see me doing my best for the health of our children. Please \njoin me in this critical effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5563-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n FOREIGN OIL CONSUMED BY THE UNITED STATES? HERE'S THE WEEKLY BOX SCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending May 17, the United States imported 7,782,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, 256,000 barrels less than the 8,038,000 \nbarrels imported during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 54.9 percent of their needs last \nweek, and there are no signs that this upward spiral will abate.

WILLIAMS, JR.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, the long-time dean of Cumberland Law \nSchool of Samford University, Dr. Parham H. Williams, Jr., will retire \non June 1, 1996. When he leaves his position at the Birmingham, AL, law \nschool, he will have served a total of 25 years as a law school dean, \n14 at the University of Mississippi and 11 at Cumberland. His tenure as \na dean is such that his title has virtually become a part of his name. \nEven his grandchildren call him ``Dean.''\n  Dean Williams is widely known for his involvement in the legal \ncommunity and his outstanding performance as an academician. He has \nstrengthened Cumberland's program by recruiting a superb faculty which \nhas added a diversity of talents and ideas. He oversaw the \nrevitalization of the faculty through the development and \nimplementation of sabbatical, promotion, tenure, and governance \npolicies and procedures.\n  The size of its entering class was decreased by 15 percent at a time \nwhen the number of applications increased over 200 percent. As a \nresult, the average admissions criteria have been raised to new \nheights. The academic excellence of the law school has also been \nenhanced through initiatives such as increased alumni involvement; the \nimplementation of a broad continuing legal education program; the \nimprovement of the advocacy program; the expansion of foreign study \nopportunities; the development of joint degree programs; the \ninauguration of the master of comparative law degree; and the \ninternationalization of the law school by visiting faculty and foreign \nstudents.\n  Since taking over as dean on July 1, 1985, Dean Williams has helped \nsecure a bright future for the law school by overseeing the largest \nfunds development effort in its history. The endowment has increased \nfrom less than $1 million to over $4.2 million, resulting in 2 endowed \nchairs, 25 endowed scholarships, 8 annually-funded scholarships, and 6 \nspecial funds endowing lectures and other programs. The stature, \nbeauty, and utility of the law school have been enriched by the \nconstruction of the Lucille Stewart Beeson Law Library.\n  Dean Williams earned both his bachelor of arts and law degrees at the \nUniversity of Mississippi, in 1953 and 1954, respectively. In 1965, he \nreceived his LL.M. degree from Yale University. Before coming to \nCumberland, the alma mater of both his parents--class of 1925--he \nserved as a district attorney in his native Mississippi and as an \nassociate professor, professor, associate dean, and dean at the \nUniversity of Mississippi School of Law. His academic specialties are \nevidence, criminal procedure, criminal law, and professional \nresponsibility.\n  The author of 9 law review articles and co-author of ``Mississippi \nEvidence,'' he has served as a commissioner of the law enforcement \nassistance commission and the national conference of commissioners of \nuniform State laws. He was chairman of the Governor's blue ribbon \ncommittee on corrections; the Governor's task force on tort reform; and \nthe Mississippi Supreme Court advisory committee on rules.\n  As Dean Parham H. Williams, Jr., retires, he will be remembered for \nbringing the Cumberland Law School into the life of Birmingham and in \nAlabama more than ever before. His polished, Southern, and unfailingly \npleasant manner have guided his actions and helped create an image of \ncivility and learning. I am proud to congratulate him for the \nimpeccable job he has done and for the outstanding legacy he leaves \nbehind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5564-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5564-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5564-S5565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION ENTITLED ``THE RETIREMENT SAVINGS AND \n           SECURITY ACT''--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 150\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit today for the consideration of the Congress \nthe ``Retirement Savings and Security Act.'' This legislation is \ndesigned to empower all Americans to save for their retirement by \nexpanding pension coverage, increasing portability, and enhancing \nsecurity. By using both employer and individual tax-advantaged \nretirement savings programs, Americans can benefit from the \nopportunities of our changing economy while assuring themselves and \ntheir families greater security for the future. A general explanation \nof the Act accompanies this transmittal.\n  Today, over 58 million American public and private sector workers are \ncovered by employer-sponsored pension or retirement savings plans. \nMillions more have been able to save through Individual Retirement \nAccounts (IRAs). The Retirement Savings and Security Act would help \nexpand pensions to the over 51 million American\n\n[[Page S5565]]\n\nprivate-sector workers--including over three-quarters of the workers in \nsmall businesses--who are not covered by an employer-sponsored pension \nor retirement savings program and need both the opportunity and \nencouragement to start saving. Women particularly need this expanded \ncoverage: fewer than one-third of all women retirees who are 55 or \nolder receive pension benefits, compared with 55 percent of male \nretirees.\n  The Act would also help the many workers who participate in pension \nplans to continue to save when they change jobs. It would reassure all \nworkers who save through employer-sponsored plans that the money they \nhave saved, as well as that put aside by employers on their behalf, \nwill be there when they need it.\n  The Retirement Savings and Security Act would:\n  --Establish a simple new small business 401(k)-type plan--the \n    National Employee Savings Trust (NEST)--and simplify complex \n    pension laws. The NEST is specifically designed to ensure \n    participation by low- and moderate-wage workers, who will be able \n    to save up to $5,000 per year tax-deferred, plus receive employer \n    contributions toward retirement. The Act would encourage employers \n    of all sizes to cover employees under retirement plans, and it \n    would enable employers to put more money into benefits and less \n    into paying lawyers, accountants, consultants, and actuaries.\n  --Increase the ability of workers to save for retirement from their \n    first day on the job by removing barriers to pension portability. \n    In particular, employers would be encouraged no longer to require a \n    1-year wait before employees can contribute to their pension plans. \n    The Federal Government would set the example for other employers by \n    allowing its new employees to begin saving through the Thrift \n    Savings Plan when they are hired, rather than having to wait up to \n    a year. In addition, the Act would reduce from 10 to 5 years the \n    time those participating in multiemployer plans--union plans where \n    workers move from job to job--must work to receive vested benefits. \n    It would also help ensure that returning veterans retain pension \n    benefits and that workers receive their retirement savings even \n    when a previous employer is no longer in existence.\n  --Expand eligibility for tax-deductible IRAs to 20 million more \n    families. In addition, the Act would encourage savings by making \n    the use of IRAs more flexible by allowing penalty-free withdrawals \n    for education and training, purchase of a first home, catastrophic \n    medical expenses, and long-term unemployment. It would also provide \n    an additional IRA option that provides tax-free distributions \n    instead of tax-deductible contributions.\n  --Enhance pension security by protecting the savings of millions of \n    State and local workers from their employer's bankruptcy, as \n    happened in Orange County, California. The Act would (1) require \n    prompt reporting by plan administrators and accountants of any \n    serious and egregious misuse of funds; (2) double the guaranteed \n    benefit for participants in multiemployer plans in the unlikely \n    event such a plan becomes insolvent; and (3) enhance benefits of a \n    surviving spouse and dependents under the Civil Service Retirement \n    System and the Railroad Retirement System.\n  --Ensure that pension raiding, such as that which drained $20 billion \n    out of retirement funds in the 1980s, never happens again--by \n    retaining the strong current laws preventing such abuses and by \n    requiring periodic reports on reversions by the Secretary of Labor.\n  Many of the provisions of the Retirement Savings and Security Act are \nnew. In particular, provisions facilitating saving from the first day \non the job, in both the private sector and the Federal Government; the \ndoubling of the multi-employer guarantee; and improving benefits for \nsurviving spouses and dependents of participants in the Civil Service \nRetirement System and the Railroad Retirement System deserve special \nconsideration by the Congress. In addition, many of the provisions and \nconcepts in this Act have been previously proposed by this \nAdministration and have broad bipartisan support.\n  American workers deserve pension security--as well as a decent wage, \nlifelong access to high quality education and training, and health \nsecurity--to take advantage of the opportunities of our growing \neconomy.\n  I urge the prompt and favorable consideration of this legislative \nproposal by the Congress.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to revise the requirements for procurement of \nproducts of Federal Prison Industries to meet needs of Federal \nagencies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n      The Federal Prison Industries Competition in Contracting Act\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, with \nSenator Abraham, the Federal Prison Industries Competition in \nContracting Act. This bill, if enacted, would eliminate the requirement \nfor Federal agencies to purchase products made by Federal Prison \nIndustries and require that FPI to compete commercially for Federal \ncontracts. It would implement a key recommendation of the Vice \nPresident's National Performance Review, which concluded that we should \n``Take away the Federal Prison Industries' status as a mandatory source \nof Federal supplies and require it to compete commercially for Federal \nagencies' business.'' Most importantly, it would ensure that the \ntaxpayers get the best possible value for their Federal procurement \ndollars.\n  Mr. President, the Director of Federal Prison Industries, Mr. Steve \nSchwalb, told me earlier this year that his agency is fully capable of \ncompeting with private industry for Federal contracts. Indeed, FPI \nwould have a significant advantage in any such head-to-head \ncompetition: FPI pays inmates only $1.35 an hour, less than a third of \nthe minimum wage and a small fraction of the wage paid to most private \nsector workers in competing industries.\n  The taxpayers already provide a direct subsidy Federal Prison \nIndustries products by picking up the cost of feeding, clothing, and \nhousing the inmates\n\n[[Page S5568]]\n\nwho provide the labor. There is no reason why we should provide an \nindirect subsidy as well, by requiring Federal agencies to purchase \nproducts from FPI even when they are more expensive and of a lower \nquality than competing commercial items.\n  Despite Mr. Schwalb's statement that Federal Prison Industries is \ncapable of competing with the private sector, FPI remains unwilling to \ndo so. The reason is obvious: it is much easier to gain market share by \nfiat than it is to compete for business. Under current law, FPI need \nnot offer the best product at the best price; it is sufficient for it \nto offer an adequate product at an adequate price, and insist upon its \nright to make the sale. Indeed, FPI currently advertises that it offers \nFederal agencies ``ease in purchasing'' through ``a procurement with no \nbidding necessary.'' The result of the FPI's status as a mandatory \nsource is not unlike the result of other sole-source contracting: the \ntaxpayers frequently pay too much and receive an inferior product for \ntheir money.\n  Mr. President, I do not consider myself to be an enemy of Federal \nPrison Industries. I am a strong supporter of the idea of putting \nFederal inmates to work. I understand that a strong prison work program \nnot only reduces inmate idleness and prison disruption, but can also \nhelp build a work ethic, provide job skills, and enable prisoners to \nreturn to product society upon their release.\n  However, I believe that prison work must be conducted in a manner \nthat is sensitive to the need not to unfairly eliminate the jobs of \nhard-working citizens who have not committed crimes. FPI will be able \nto achieve this result only if it diversifies its product lines and \navoids the temptation to build its work force by continuing to displace \nprivate sector jobs in its traditional lines of work. For this reason, \nI have been working since 1990 to try to help Federal Prison Industries \nto identify new markets that it can expand into without displacing \nprivate sector jobs. I had hoped.\n  In 1990, the House Appropriations Committee requested a study to \nidentify new opportunities for FPI to meet its growth requirements, \nassess FPI's impact on private sector businesses and labor, and \nevaluate the need for changes to FPI's laws and mandates. That study, \nconducted by Deloitte & Touche, concluded that FPI should meet its \ngrowth needs by using new approaches and new markets, not by expanding \nits production in traditional industries. The Deloitte & Touch study \nconcluded:\n\n       FPI needs to maintain sales in industries that produce \n     products such as traditional furniture and furnishings, \n     apparel and textile products, and electronic assemblies to \n     maintain inmate employment during the transition.\n       These industries should not be expanded, and FPI should \n     limit its market shares to current levels.\n\n  I followed up on that report by meeting with Federal Prison \nIndustries officials and participating in a summit process, sponsored \nby the Brookings Institute, designed to develop alternative growth \nstrategies for FPI. The summit process resulted in two suggested areas \nfor growth: First, entering partnerships with private sector companies \nto replace offshore labor; and second, entering the recycling business \nin areas such as mattresses and electrical motors.\n  In January 1994, I urged FPI to move quickly to implement these \nrecommendations and develop new markets. At that time, I wrote to \nKathleen M. Hawk, the Director of the Bureau of Federal Prisons, as \nfollows:\n\n       As you know, I am supportive of FPI's role in keeping \n     inmates occupied and teaching them a work ethic and job \n     skills. However, FPI's continued market share growth in the \n     government furniture market has had an unfair and \n     disproportionate impact on that particular sector. In order \n     to take pressure off of such traditional industries where FPI \n     has focused, FPI should cap its market share and diversify \n     its activities away from these traditional industries and \n     into alternative growth strategies.\n       I am alarmed that FPI continues to increase its share of \n     government purchases of furniture. The 1991 Deloitte and \n     Touche study recommended that FPI limit its industry market \n     share to current levels in traditional industries. It would \n     be a welcome sign of goodwill in this ``summit'' process if \n     FPI were to cap its market share in the furniture industry \n     while aggressively pursuing acceptable alternative growth \n     strategies.\n\n  Unfortunately, Federal Prison Industries has chosen to take the exact \nopposite course of action. Earlier this year, FPI acted unilaterally to \nvirtually double its furniture sales from $70 million to $130 million \nand from 15 percent of the Federal market to 25 percent of the Federal \nmarket, over the next 5 years. In direct contravention of the Deloitte \n& Touche recommendations, FPI has announced its intention to undertake \nsimilar market share increases in other traditional product lines, such \nas work clothing and protective clothing.\n  In defense of this action FPI contends that it will not place an \nundue burden on the private sector because most firms within the \nindustry are not heavily involved in the Federal market.\n  Mr. President, Federal Prison Industries cannot have it both ways. If \nthey are providing a substantial number of jobs to inmates, then they \nmust be displacing a substantial number of jobs in the private sector. \nA substantial increase in FPI's business means a similar decrease in \nU.S. private sector business--unless it is displacing imports, which is \nwhat FPI should be doing. Instead of diversifying as recommended by the \nDeloitte & Touche study and the Brookings summit, FPI is going back to \nthe same well yet again, and taking it out of the hide of the same \ntraditional industries.\n  Mr. President, this is the easy way out, but it isn't the right way \nfor FPI, it isn't the right way for the private sector workers whose \njobs FPI is taking, and it isn't the right way for the taxpayer, who \nwill continue to pay more and get less as a result of the mandatory \npreference for FPI goods. We need to have jobs for prisoners, but can \nno longer afford to allow FPI to designate whose jobs it will take, and \nwhen it will take them. Competition will be better for FPI, better for \nthe taxpayer, and better for working men and women around the \ncountry.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with my \ndistinguished colleague from Michigan in sponsoring this legislation. I \nthink that Federal Prison Industries plays an extremely valuable role \nin giving prisoners something useful to do with their time and helping \nthem to develop the self-discipline and other virtues that enable \npeople outside of prison to lead productive lives. I am convinced, \nhowever, that these same goals can be accomplished within the \nparameters set by this legislation. I also see no reason why the law \nabiding owners of small businesses and the workers they employ should \nbe deprived of any opportunity to bid for a class of government \ncontracts in favor of FPI. Finally, I appreciate Senator Levin's \nacceptance of my suggestion to include section 2, which I believe \nprovides useful encouragement to FPI to try to concentrate its \nexpansion efforts in the direction of goods that the Government \npresently acquires by importing them.\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 1798. A bill to amend the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 to \nclarify the acreage limitations and incorporate a means test for \ncertain farm operations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n              The Irrigation Subsidy Reduction Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am introducing today a new measure to \ncurb the receipt of Federal irrigation subsidies by large agribusiness \ninterests. I am introducing legislation in this area as a deficit \nreduction measure because I believe that the Federal Government needs \nto scrutinize carefully all forms of assistance it provides in these \ntimes of fiscal constraint. I am also prompted to act in this area, Mr. \nPresident, because the Federal Government has been unable to correct \nfundamental abuses of reclamation law that cost the taxpayer millions \nof dollars every year.\n  In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt proposed legislation, which \ncame to be known as the Reclamation Act, to encourage development of \nfamily farms throughout the western United States. The idea was to \nprovide needed water for areas that were otherwise dry and give small \nfarms--those no larger than 160 acres--a chance, with a helping hand \nfrom the Federal Government, to establish themselves.\n  Under the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982, Congress acted to expand \nthe size of the farms that could receive subsidized water to 960 acres. \nThe RRA of 1982 expressly prohibits farms that\n\n[[Page S5569]]\n\nexceed 960 acres in size from receiving Federally-subsidized water. \nThese restrictions were added to the Reclamation law to close loopholes \nthrough which Federal subsidies were flowing to large agribusinesses \nrather than the small family farmers that Reclamation projects were \ndesigned to serve. Agribusinesses were expected to pay full cost for \nall water received on land in excess of their 960-acre entitlement. \nDespite the express mandate of Congress, regulations promulgated under \nthe Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 have failed to keep big agricultural \nwater users from receiving Federal subsidies. The General Accounting \nOffice and the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior \ncontinue to find that the acreage limits established in law are \ncircumvented through the creation of arrangements such as farming \ntrusts. These trusts, which in total acreage well exceed the 960 acre \nlimit, are comprised of smaller units that are not subject to the \nreclamation acreage cap. These smaller units are farmed under a single \nmanagement agreement often through a combination of leasing and \nownership.\n  Three years ago, as part of a settlement of a suit with the Natural \nResources Defense Council, the Bureau of Reclamation agreed to propose \nnew regulations under the reclamation program. At the beginning of \nFebruary 1996, the Administration issued its final environmental impact \nstatement [EIS] on its proposed regulations. On March 8, 1996 I joined \nwith the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley], the Senator from New \nHampshire (Mr. Gregg) and others in writing to the President to express \nour concern and disappointment that these new regulations would \ncontinue to allow the 960-acre loophole to be exploited. Indeed, \nneither the Bureau's ``preferred option'' for the regulation, nor any \nof the alternatives they describe in the EIS, would act to curb \nirrigation water abuses by these agribusiness trusts.\n  Last week, I received a response to the letter I joined in sending to \nthe Department of the Interior. The letter states, ``Last spring's \nrelease of a proposed rule making and draft EIS prompted nearly 400 \nletters and 8 public hearings on these complex issues during the \ncomment period. The FEIS alternative responds to many of the comments \nwe received.'' Mr. President, this letter specifically does not respond \nto the concerns that I, the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] and \nothers raised. Now is the time, in light of the Department's inability \nto correct this problem, to look back to the statute and attempt to \ncorrect the costly loopholes that it facilitates.\n  Presently, according to the Bureau of Reclamation, there are 80 such \ntrusts receiving subsidized water on more than 738,000 acres of land, \nor about 10 percent of the land for which the Bureau of Reclamation \nprovides water. In a 1989 GAO report, the activities of six of these \ntrusts were fully explored. According to GAO, one 12,345 acre cotton \nfarm--roughly 20 square miles--operating under a single partnership, \nwas reorganized to avoid the 960-acre limitation into 15 separate land \nholdings through 18 partnerships, 24 corporations, and 11 trusts which \nwere all operated as one large unit. A seventh very large trust was the \nsole topic of a 1990 GAO report. The Westhaven trust is a 23,238-acre \nfarming operation in California's Central Valley. It was formed for the \nbenefit of 326 salaried employees of the J.G. Boswell Company. Boswell, \nGAO found, had taken advantage of section 214 of the RRA, which exempts \nfrom its 960-acre limit land held for beneficiaries by a trustee in a \nfiduciary capacity, as long as no single beneficiary's interest exceeds \nthe law's ownership limits. The RRA, as I have mentioned, does not \npreclude multiple land holdings from being operated collectively under \na trust as one farm while qualifying individually for federally \nsubsidized water. Accordingly, the J.G. Boswell Company reorganized \n23,238 acres it held as the Boston Ranch by selling them to the \nWesthaven Trust, with the land holdings attributed to each beneficiary \nbeing eligible to receive federally subsidized water.\n\n  Before the land was sold to Westhaven Trust, the J.G. Boswell Company \noperated the acreage as one large farm and paid full cost for the \nFederal irrigation water delivered for the 18-month period ending in \nMay 1989. When the trust bought the land, due to the loopholes in the \nlaw, the entire acreage became eligible to receive federally subsidized \nwater because the land holdings attributed to the 326 trust \nbeneficiaries range from 21 acres to 547 acres--all well under the 960-\nacre limit.\n  In the six cases the GAO reviewed in 1989, owners or lessees paid a \ntotal of about $1.3 million less in 1987 for Federal water then they \nwould have paid if their collective land holdings were considered as \nlarge farms subject to the Reclamation Act acreage limits. Had \nWesthaven trust been required to pay full cost, GAO estimated in 1990, \nit would have paid $2 million more for its water. The GAO also found, \nin all seven of these cases, that reduced revenues are likely to \ncontinue unless Congress amends the Reclamation Act to close the \nloopholes allowing benefits for trusts.\n  The legislation that I am introducing combines various elements of \nproposals introduced during previous attempts by other members of \nCongress to close loopholes in the 1982 legislation and to impose a \n$500,000 means test. This new approach limits the amount of subsidized \nirrigation water delivered to any operation in excess of the 960-acre \nlimit which claimed $500,000 or more in gross income, as reported on \ntheir most recent IRS tax form. If the $500,000 threshold were \nexceeded, an income ratio would be used to determine how much of the \nwater should be delivered to the user at the full-cost rate, and how \nmuch at the below-cost rate. For example, if a 961-acre operation \nearned $1 million dollars, a ratio of $500,000 (the means test value) \ndivided by their gross income would determine the full cost rate, thus \nthe water user would pay the full cost rate on half of their acreage \nand the below cost rate on the remaining half.\n  This means testing proposal was profiled in this year's ``Green \nScissors'' report, written by Friends of the Earth and Taxpayers for \nCommon Sense and supported by 21 other environmental and consumer \ngroups, including groups like the Concord Coalition, the Progressive \nPolicy Institute. The premise of the report is that there are a number \nof subsidies and projects, totaling $39 billion dollars in all, that \ncould be cut to both reduce the deficit and benefit the environment. \nThis report coalesces what I and many others in the Senate have long \nknown, we must be diligent in eliminating practices that can no longer \nbe justified in light of our enormous annual deficit and national debt. \nThe ``Green Scissors'' recommendation on means testing water subsidies \nindicates that if a test is successful in reducing subsidy payments to \nthe highest grossing 10 percent of farms, then the Federal Government \nwould recover at least $440 million per year, or at least $2.2 billion \nover 5 years.\n  The measure I introduce today is my third legislative effort in the \narea of irrigation subsidies, all of which have been profiled in the \n``Green Scissors'' report. In February of 1995, I introduced two \nrelated pieces of legislation aimed at reducing double dipping for \nirrigation water subsidies that cost the Federal taxpayers millions of \ndollars each year. I hope that other Members will join me in sponsoring \nthese efforts, as elimination of western water subsidies, and a wide \nrange of reclamation subsidies, should be pursued as legitimate deficit \nreduction opportunities.\n  When countless Federal program are subjected to various types of \nmeans tests to limit benefits to those who truly need assistance, it \nmakes little sense to continue to allow large business interests to dip \ninto a program intended to help small entities struggling to survive. \nTaxpayers have legitimate concerns when they learn that their hard-\nearned tax dollars are being expended to assist large corporate \ninterests in select regions of the country who benefit from these \nloopholes. The Federal Water Program was simply never intended to \nbenefit these large interests.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, it is clear that the conflicting \npolicies of the Federal Government in this area are in need of reform, \nand if Federal agencies cannot be diligent in curbing this corporate \nwelfare administratively, Congress should act. Large agribusinesses \nshould not be able to continue to soak the taxpayers. We should act to \nclose these loopholes as soon as possible. I ask unanimous consent that\n\n[[Page S5570]]\n\nthe text of the measure be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1798\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Irrigation Subsidy Reduction \n     Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Federal reclamation program has been in existence \n     for over 90 years, with an estimated taxpayer investment of \n     over $70,000,000,000;\n       (2) the program has had and continues to have an enormous \n     effect on the water resources and aquatic environments of the \n     western States;\n       (3) irrigation water made available from Federal water \n     projects in the West is a very valuable resource for which \n     there are increasing and competing demands;\n       (4) the justification for providing water at less than full \n     cost was to benefit and promote the development of small \n     family farms and exclude large corporate farms, but this \n     purpose has been frustrated over the years due to inadequate \n     implementation of subsidy and acreage limits;\n       (5) below-cost water prices tend to encourage excessive use \n     of scarce water supplies in the arid regions of the West, and \n     reasonable price increases to the wealthiest western farmers \n     would provide an economic incentive for greater water \n     conservation;\n       (6) the Federal Government has increasingly applied \n     eligibility tests based on income for Federal entitlement and \n     subsidy programs, measures that are consistent with the \n     historic approach of the reclamation program's acreage \n     limitations that seek to limit water subsidies to smaller \n     farms; and\n       (7) including a means test based on gross income in the \n     reclamation program will increase the effectiveness of \n     carrying out the family farm goals of the Federal reclamation \n     laws.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to promote greater equity in the delivery of health \ncare services to American women through expanded research on women's \nhealth issues and through improved access to health care services, \nincluding preventive health services; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n                   Women's Health Equity Act of 1996\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to join with Senator \nMikulski in introducing the Women's Health Equity Act of 1996. I \nbelieve that this event is historic, not only because of the impressive \nbreadth and depth of this legislation, but because five women Senators, \nincluding Senators Feinstein, Murray, and Moseley-Braun, have joined \ntogether to set an agenda for congressional action to improve women's \nhealth.\n  For too many years, women's health care needs were ignored or poorly \nunderstood, and women were systematically excluded from important \nhealth research. One famous medical study on breast cancer examined \nhundreds of men. And another federally funded study examined the \nability of aspirin to prevent heart attacks in 20,000 medical doctors, \nall of whom were men, despite the fact that heart disease is the \nleading cause of death among women.\n  Today, Members and the American public understand the importance of \nensuring that both genders benefit equally from the fruits of medical \nresearch and the delivery of health care services. Unfortunately, \nequity does not yet exist in health care, and we have a long way to go. \nKnowledge about appropriate course of treatment for women lags far \nbehind that for men for many diseases. Research into diseases affecting \npredominately women, such as breast cancer, for years went grossly \nunderfunded. And many women do not have access to critical reproductive \nand other health services.\n  Throughout my tenure in the House and Senate, I have worked hard to \nexpose and eliminate this health care gender gap and improve women's \naccess to affordable, quality health services. And under my leadership \nas the co-chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, women \nlegislators in the House called for a GAO investigation into the \ninclusion of women and minorities in medical research at the National \nInstitute of Health. This study documented the widespread exclusion of \nwomen from medical research, and spurred the caucus to introduce the \nfirst Women's Health Equity Act [WHEA] in 1990. This comprehensive \nlegislation provided Congress with its first broad, forward looking \nhealth agenda intended to redress the historical inequities that face \nwomen in medical research, prevention and services.\n  Since the initial introduction of WHEA in the 101st Congress, women \nlegislators have made important strides on behalf of women's health. \nLegislation from that first package was signed into law as part of the \nNIH Revitalization Act in June 1993, mandating the inclusion of women \nand minorities in clinical trials at NIH. We established the Office of \nResearch on Women's Health at NIH, and secured dramatic funding \nincreases for research into breast cancer, osteoporosis, and cervical \ncancer.\n  Today, I have joined forces with many of my women colleagues on a \nbipartisan basis to take the next crucial step on the road to achieving \nequity in health care. The Women's Health Equity Act of 1996 is \ncomprised of 39 bills devoted to research and services in areas of \ncritical importance to women's health. I have already introduced \nseveral of the bills contained in WHEA in the Senate: the Consumer \nInvolvement in Breast Cancer Research Act; the Women's Health Office \nAct; the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act \nof 1996; the Patient Access to Clinical Studies Act; the Medicare Bone \nMass Measurement Coverage Act; and the Accurate Mammography Guidelines \nAct. Together, these 39 bills represent the high-water mark for \nlegislation on women's health.\n  The research bills contained in title I of WHEA continue to push for \nincreased biomedical research in women's health at NIH and other \nFederal agencies, and address the need for social policy to keep pace \nwith scientific technology. The impact of the environment of women's \nhealth, women and AIDS, osteoporosis, and lupus are all addressed in \nthis title.\n  The service-oriented bills contained in title II of WHEA target new \nareas such as the prevention of insurance discrimination based on \ngenetic information or participation in clinical research as well as \ninsurance protection for victims of domestic violence. Several bills \naddress the need for education and training of health professionals and \nthe importance of providing information about health risks and \nprevention to women. Adolescent health, eating disorders, \npostreproductive health, and breast and cervical prevention are also \naddressed, as well as the need to designate obstetrician-gynecologists \nas primary care providers for insurance purposes and to provide for \nminimum hospital stays for mothers and their newborns.\n  Improving the health of American women requires a far greater \nunderstanding of women's health needs and conditions, and ongoing \nevaluation in the areas of research, education, prevention, treatment, \nand the delivery of services. I believe that the 39 bills comprising \nthe Women's Health Equity Act will take a giant step in this direction, \nand the passage of this legislation will help ensure that women's \nhealth will never again be a missing page in America's medical \ntextbook.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5567-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5571-S5600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am honored to join my good friends \nSenators Snowe, Boxer, Feinstein, Murray, and Mosely-Braun in \nintroducing the Women's Health Equity Act. This years' bill, composed \nof 37 separate bills, will improve the status of women's health in the \nareas of research, services and prevention. The package builds on past \nsuccesses. It brings resources and expertise to bear on the unmet \nhealth needs of America's women. This bill sets an agenda. It's where \nwomen's health care needs to go as we enter the 21st century.\n  There has been a pattern of neglect and a history of indifference to \nwomen's health needs. It's astonishing that between 1979 and 1986 the \ndeath rate from breast cancer was up 24 percent. No one knew why. Yet \nthere was no research being done--the research community was ignoring \nthis very significant problem. I worked with colleagues to change that \nby making sure that breast cancer research got its fair share of \nresearch dollars.\n  I was frustrated when I found out that America's flagship medical \nresearch center, the National Institutes of Health [NIH], was \nsupporting research that systematically excluded women. Less than a \ndecade ago, only 14 percent of every research dollar was going to study \nthe health problems of 51 percent of the American population. I wanted \nto change that. And I did. With the help of my colleagues, I was \nsuccessful in setting up the Office of Women's Health Research at NIH. \nThis office is turning these statistics around. Women are now routinely \nincluded in clinical trials.\n\n[[Page S5572]]\n\n  Despite all our progress, we have a long way to go. We have to change \noutdated attitudes. It's not easy to reverse gender biases. We take a \nfew steps forward and then a few steps back.\n  I want to make sure that women's health care needs are met \ncomprehensively and equitably. The NIH must allocate sufficient \nresources to women's diseases. It should continue to include women in \nclinical trials. It must continue to expand access to health services \nfor women. We must aggressively pursue prevention in women's diseases. \nI pledge to fight for new attitudes and find new ways to end the \nneedless pain and death that too many American women face.\n  I am proud to introduce this bill with a great group of Senators that \ncare equally about women's health. This bill confirms our intent to \nmove forward in women's health equity. It is an outline, a framework, \nan agenda. No doubt, it will take time, but I'm sure we will succeed.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Women's \nHealth Equity Act. I am proud to join my colleagues, Senators Snowe, \nMikulski, Feinstein, and Moseley-Braun, in offering this package of 39 \nlegislative initiatives of critical importance to the health of women \nand their children. Today we are sending a powerful and united message. \nWe are more committed than ever to keeping the spotlight on the \nimportant issues surrounding women's health research, treatment and \neducation.\n  There are so many worthy pieces to this bill that I won't go into \neach and every one separately. This bill underscores the lack of \nattention that has been paid to women's health issues and the many \nobstacles we face in getting accurate, vital information about our \nhealth, the health of our children and the health care system as it \neffects us.\n  Women face an array of unique and serious health risks. We must do \nmore to ensure that adequate research and education programs are \nmaintained, supported and enriched. We have much more to learn about \ndiseases like osteoporosis, lupus, and breast cancer that devastate the \nlives of women across this country. And we need to continue to broaden \nthe scope of current efforts in research into AIDS, cardiovascular \ndisease and alcoholism to better understand how women are impacted. We \nmust enable women to protect themselves and their daughters.\n  Mr. President, our bill recognizes the need for supporting this kind \nof research and specifically addresses all of these conditions which \njeopardize the health of women. We must encourage a coordinated and \ncommitted effort from the top level of our government to make sure that \nwomen's health issues receive the attention they deserve. For too long, \nour concerns were ignored or given second-class status. If we continue \nto allow this to happen--women will die, our children will get sick, \nand future generations will be shortchanged of valuable information \nabout ways to prevent health-related tragedies.\n  And our bill acknowledges another critical health issue which \ndisproportionately affects women--domestic violence. The Women's Health \nEquity Act includes a number of provisions which seek to protect women \nwho are victims of violence from being discriminated against when \nseeking health insurance. Family violence is a public health crisis \nwhich tears families apart and often prevents women, especially low-\nincome women, from providing their children with a safe, nurturing \nenvironment in which to learn and grow.\n  As you know Mr. President, one of my biggest concerns as a Senator is \nthe well being of our Nation's young people. I am proud that this bill \nincludes provisions which encourage: adolescent health demonstration \nprojects; eating disorders research and education initiatives; fetal \nalcohol syndrome research and prevention programs; and demonstration \nprojects to prevent smoking in WIC clinics. These efforts are critical \nand send our young people an important message that we care about them, \ntheir health, and their futures.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Newborns' and Mothers' Health \nProtection Act was included in this act. By allowing longer hospital \nstays after child-birth, we will see improved health for both mother \nand baby. Women will receive essential information about care for their \nnewborn and if there are any health complications, mother and baby will \nreceive the attention they need.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Snowe for her leadership in \ncoordinating this effort and for all she has done for women's health \nand health care. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill \nand I urge all of my colleagues to join and help move these initiatives \nforward. Together, we can improve the lives and health of women and \nchildren in our Nation, continue the important work we have started and \ncelebrate the great strides we have made. I look forward to this \nchallenge.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Bryan, \n        Ms. Moseley-Braun, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1800. A bill to amend the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to limit \nfees charged by financial institutions for the use of automatic teller \nmachines, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n              the fair atm fees for consumers act of 1996\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Kerry and \nMurray as my primary cosponsor to introduce legislation to protect \nconsumers from excessive and redundant fees imposed by automated teller \nmachine (ATM) operators. I am also pleased that Senators Boxer, Bryan, \nand Moseley-Braun have joined in cosponsoring this important \ninitiative.\n  Traditionally, a bank or financial institution, let's call it \nIntegrity Bank, agrees to provide a consumer with a package of services \nin exchange for the use of the consumer's money. These services \ntypically include access to an ATM network, such as MOST, CIRRUS, or \nPLUS, which consists of any Integrity Bank ATM's as well as ATM's \noperated by other banks or financial institutions. Integrity Bank and \nthe consumer have an agreement about whether Integrity Bank will charge \nthe consumer for using ATM's not owned by Integrity Bank. Integrity \nBank, in turn, is responsible for paying the network a fee for \ntransactions completed by its consumers on ATM's not owned by Integrity \nBank.\n  Changes which took effect in April of this year may force the \nconsumer to pay new fees. Until April 1, the major electronic banking \nnetworks prohibited the assessment of ATM user fees by the bank which \nowned the ATM. The networks have revoked this policy, opening the door \nto a new and outrageous practice beyond the control of Integrity Bank \nand its customer. Now, despite the fact that Integrity Bank pays fees \nto the ATM network, ATM owners and operators can now charge non-\ncustomers who use their ATM's--a service that consumers thought was \nincluded in any charges imposed by Integrity Bank--their bank.\n  Now many ATM users may be caught in the middle. Their own banks can \ncontinue to impose fees while the operators of the ATM's they use are \nentitled to ransack consumers' accounts. What is next, explicit and \nredundant fees for deposit envelopes? A nighttime ATM surcharge? I will \nrefrain from offering banks any further suggestions on how to pick the \npockets of American consumers.\n  Mr. President, this double-dipping is unfair and unconscionable. \nConsumers should not be charged twice for a single ATM transaction and \nshould certainly not be charged a fee which has nothing to do with the \nrelationship between the consumer and his or her financial institution.\n  Banks and other financial service providers argue that these \nsurcharges are necessary to cover the costs of ATM operation. In-branch \nATM's present minimal expense to financial institutions. How can banks \nargue with straight faces that surcharges are necessary to cover costs \nof operation?\n  Mr. President, the rules change which permits this extra fee was \nenacted only recently. While some banks have already imposed the \nsurcharge, many others are testing the waters before they take \nadvantage of the rule change. Congress should act before this unfair \npractice spreads like a wildfire.\n  It is hard to believe that banks are so strapped when industry \nprofits have never been higher. For the fourth straight year in 1995, \ncommercial banks reported record earnings. Last year, commercial banks \nreported profits of $48.8 billion, exceeding the previous year's record \nof $44.6 billion by\n\n[[Page S5573]]\n\n9.4 percent. These skyrocketing earnings are primarily the result of \nincreased interest and fee income. On top of this, commercial banks now \npay nearly nothing to receive deposit insurance.\n  Are banks really losing money on ATM operations or is this new fee \njust an easy way to gouge the consumer? The U.S. Public Interest \nResearch Group and the Center for the Responsive Law recently reported \nthat ATM's generated $3.1 billion in transaction fees for banks in \n1995. Though ATM transactions cost banks $3.2 billion, the report said, \nprofits increased by $2.2 billion as a result of the labor savings. \nThis new ATM surcharge is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to \nartificially inflate profits at the consumer's expense.\n  Banks have spent the past 20 years enticing consumers to use ATMs to \nreduce the need for branch offices. Banks have told regulators and the \nCongress that branch closings save money without decreasing service \nbecause ATM's fill the role once served by branch offices. Now it \nappears providing that service comes only with an added cost to the \nconsumer and more profit for the provider.\n  Let me just say a few words about the impact of this fee on community \nbanks. These banks have already agreed to pay fees to ATM networks in \norder to ensure that their customers have access to funds at convenient \nlocations. Now community banks face the threat of losing customers to \nlarge banks with large ATM networks. Since community bank customers \ndepend on other institutions' ATM's, large banks can use ATM user fees \nto steal community bank customers.\n  This moves comes at a time when some banks are charging their \ncustomers a premium for teller service. These banks justify this teller \nfee with claims that teller service is more expensive to provide than \nATM service. Now, some banks are squeezing consumers even harder with \nnew ATM user fees. Consumers are getting nickel-and-dimed to death and \nit has got to stop.\n  Mr. President, the bill I introduce today would prohibit user fees \nimposed by ATM operators. Under this bill, for example, banks would \nremain free to charge their own customers for using the ATM's of other \nbanks. Other ATM owners and operators, however, would be prohibited \nfrom taking a second bite out of the consumer.\n  There is congressional precedent for this type of legislation. \nCongress originally passed legislation banning surcharges in the credit \ncard industry in 1976 and renewed the ban twice in 1978 and 1981. In \nthat instance, Congress prohibited retail institutions from charging \nconsumers surcharges on their credit card purchases. To allow \nadditional charges and fees for card use after the consumer had paid \nfor the use of the credit card would have forced customers to pay twice \nand permitted some unscrupulous merchant to engage in deceptive \nadvertising and other harmful practices. This is analogous to our \ncurrent ATM situation.\n  I understand that some businesses that rely on retail sales through \ncredit and ATM cards may be concerned about this bill. They need not \nworry. The sole purpose of this legislation is to prohibit excessive \nfees to ATM users. I recognize that there may be some off-site ATM's \nthat are costly to maintain and have historically charged fees. I am \nwilling to consider necessary accommodations to this bill. However, I \nwill draw the line in cases where it is clear the consumer is being \nfleeced.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from New \nYork, the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator D'Amato, in \nintroducing this important piece of legislation.\n  It is not often that Senator D'Amato and I agree on issues on this \nfloor or in the Banking Committee, and when we do, there is \njustification for strong bi-partisan support. That is indeed the case \non this legislation, and I am pleased to join with my colleague, and I \ncongratulate him on his leadership in moving to protect consumers \nagainst the potential of double-bank-fees that amount to a banking-\npenalty tax on consumers.\n  Why do we need this legislation now? Because, on April 1 of this \nyear, American depositors had a cruel April Fool's joke played on them. \nThat's the day Visa and MasterCard--owners of two of the largest \nautomated teller network--began letting their member banks charge a fee \nto other banks' customers who use their automated tellers. Some banking \nanalysts tell me that across the country this surcharge can range from \n50 cents to $2.50. Consumers can be charged an increased fee by both \ntheir bank and the bank whose machine they are using which could cost \nas much as $5 to make a deposit, a withdrawal, or to check your \nbalance.\n  Our legislation has a simple purpose: it prohibits a transaction fee \nassessed by the owner or operator of an ATM machine. This bill will \nstop double fees.\n  It gives consumers negotiating power with a financial services \nindustry which is consolidating and downsizing--laying off tellers, \nshutting branches and reducing bank-lobby hours; it helps the small \nbanker from being run out of business by the big banks; and it bolsters \ncongressional oversight of antitrust violations.\n  Mr. President, Massachusetts is in a unique situation. Because of \npending bank mergers and consolidations the 2 largest banks will soon \nown 2,200 of the 3,500 ATM machines in the State--about 65 percent.\n  In no other State does one bank control more than 15 percent of the \nATM's. I applaud the banking industry which has grown and is healthy \nand strong, and there is room in financial services for large \ninstitutions and for small credit unions and neighborhood savings and \nloans. This bill not only protects consumers, but it protects small \nbanks that don't own more than a few ATM's from being run out of \nbusiness by the larger banks who can offer free transactions at \nthousands of machines.\n  Let me put this in perspective. In a survey of just 228 of the 3,500 \nmachines in my State--less than 10 percent of all the machines--it was \nreported that 400,742 transactions per month would be subject to the \nnew surcharge--almost 5 million transactions per year at just 10 \npercent of the ATM's in my State.\n  If the larger financial institutions could offer no fee if a consumer \ntook their money out of a smaller institution, the fate of the smaller \ninstitutions in an increasingly automated environment is obviously in \nquestion, and we have to address this problem now. And to save the \ncommunity banks and avoid the 1990's version of the 1980's S crisis.\n  Mr. President, in a recent USA Today interview with an executive of \none of the Nation's largest banks, when asked ``are you instituting \nsurcharges on non-customers who use your automated teller machines?'' \nthe answer was somewhat disturbing.\n  It was:\n\n       We're going to do it . . . The reason is frankly pretty \n     self-evident. You've got a community bank that likes to tell \n     you they're going to give you this wonderful service and you \n     can shake the President's hand and get a doughnut and a cup \n     of coffee in the lobby and so on. When you go in to open an \n     account they say we don't have any ATM's but don't worry \n     about it, here's our card and you can use anybody's ATM in \n     the country. So we're subsidizing the community banks. We're \n     not going to do that anymore.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, I ask, what's wrong with community banks. I like \nthe idea of neighborhood credit unions and having a cup of coffee and a \ndoughnut in the lobby. What this response tells me is that there is \nmore to the surcharge than meets the eye. And we should be aware of the \nwhat lies around the corner as we head down the road.\n  You will hear from representatives of the industry, Mr. President. \nSome of the biggest banks will lobby heavily saying that this fee is an \nissue of convenience. But I suspect that other forces are at play. \nCommercial banks posted record profits last year. This new fee is not \ndesigned to raise profits.\n  Yet, community and cooperative bankers will tell you a different \nstory--a constituent of mine in Dorchester, MA, owns a profitable bank \nwith one ATM machine. He runs the bank well and serves the community. \nBut he is no match against far bigger competitors. He knows that once \nthese surcharges become pervasive and the big banks start charging his \ncustomers to use their ATM's, they will just move their accounts to the \nbig banks to avoid the charge.\n  So, this is not an issue of establishing prices and fees; this is an \nantitrust issue. I want to set the marker down clearly--the Congress \nneeds to do a\n\n[[Page S5574]]\n\nbetter job in monitoring and preventing the trend of consolidation from \nrunning the smaller banks out of business.\n  I want to be clear about what else this bill does, and what it does \nnot do. This legislation does not regulate fees and prices, and does \nnot curtail the widespread use of ATM's especially in lower income \nareas.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that it is the business of the U.S. \nSenate to set prices and fees at banks and other financial \ninstitutions. I am a great believer in the free market--not the Federal \nGovernment--dictating fee structures. But there is a general sense of \nfairness that is being violated in this new surcharge.\n  When a depositor opens an account, he or she knows the fees \nassociated with transactions. It is current Federal law--found in \nstatutes like the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Truth-in-Savings \nAct and the Truth-in-Lending Act--that mandates fees to be disclosed to \nthe consumer. So, when we open a bank account, we will know how much \neach transaction will cost.\n  But now, with this new surcharge, we are left in the dark. We don't \nfind out how much it will cost to use an ATM machine, not associated \nwith our particular bank, until our statement appears in the mail, long \nafter the ATM transaction is completed.\n  That is bad for consumers and it is bad precedent. And the trend is \nnot favorable. Historic mergers, consolidations and acquisitions have \ntaken place in financial service industry. Consumers have less choice, \nnot more. Bank lobby hours have been curtailed so drastically, tellers \nreplaced by machines, that we are forced to use ATM's. This is the \ndirection of the industry and at some point the Congress must step in \nand let the banks know enough is enough.\n  Thank you and I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1801. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to authorize \nappropriations for the Federal Aviation Administration for fiscal year \n1997, to reform the Federal Aviation Administration, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                    THE OMNIBUS AVIATION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Omnibus \nAviation Act of 1996. This legislation reauthorizes for one year \nseveral key programs of the Federal Aviation Administration, including \nthe vital Airport Improvement Program. It also provides needed, \ncomprehensive FAA reform, including the development of a stable, long-\nterm funding system for the FAA, and addresses other critical safety \nand airport concerns. Specifically, this legislation would:\n  Reauthorize AIP at $1.8 billion for one year;\n  Expand the prohibition on airport revenue diversion;\n  Provide for thorough reform of the FAA;\n  Encourage Congress to meet the FAA's short-term funding needs;\n  Enhance airline safety by requiring airlines to share employment and \nperformance records before hiring new pilots; and\n  Abolish the MWAA Board of Review.\n  Significantly, this bill expresses the sense of the Senate that \nCongress must act immediately to address the short-term funding needs \nof the FAA. Mr. President, we have all heard by now that certain \naviation excise taxes that make up most of the Airport and Airway Trust \nFund, which provides nearly all of the FAA's funding, expired at the \nend of last year. Since then, no money has been going into the aviation \ntrust fund. Yet, the FAA has determined that since the beginning of \nthis year, approximately half a billion dollars has been spent each \nmonth from the existing trust fund balance. The FAA advises that at \nthis rate, all of the money in the trust fund will be spent by \nDecember. Without immediate action by Congress to provide interim, \nshort-term funding for the FAA, confidence in the FAA and our nation's \nair traffic control system could erode.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today not only encourages quick \nresolution of the FAA's immediate funding problem, but also sets out a \nplan for complete FAA reform. In specific, this bill incorporates the \nAir Traffic Management System Performance Improvement Act, which I have \ncosponsored with Senator Ford and Senator Hollings, to create a more \nautonomous and accountable FAA that can continue to ensure the safety \nof the traveling public while, at the same time, meet the needs of the \ngrowing aviation industry.\n  This FAA reform measure is particularly important because while the \ninterim, short-term funding is in place and during the one-year \nreauthorization of FAA programs, the FAA will be able to set up a \nperformance-based fee system to satisfy the FAA's long-term funding \nneeds. This FAA reform proposal would ensure that the new FAA funding \nsystem must consider the FAA's costs of providing air traffic control \nservices and must increase the efficiency with which air traffic \ncontrol services are produced or used, without jeopardizing safety.\n  The existing aviation excise tax system does not enable the FAA to \ndetermine whether the air traffic control system is becoming more or \nless costly per flight, or whether air traffic control system \nproductivity is increasing or decreasing. By contrast, establishing a \nuser fee funding system under this bill would compel the FAA to \nestablish a cost accounting system, which would enable it to determine \nthe efficiency and costs of the FAA and the air traffic control system, \nand develop investment and modernization programs that are viable.\n\n  This legislation also addresses other critical aviation issues. \nFirst, it contains provisions intended to reverse the disturbing trend \nof illegal diversion of airport revenues. To ensure that airport \nrevenues are used only for airport purposes, this legislation would \nexpand the prohibition on revenue diversion to cover more instances of \ndiversion. It also would establish clear penalties and stronger \nmechanisms to enforce Federal laws prohibiting revenue diversion. In \naddition, the bill would impose additional reporting requirements so \nthat illegal revenue diversion is easily identified and verified. It \nalso would provide important protections for whistleblowers.\n  To enhance the safety of the Nation's air transportation system, this \nlegislation also contains provisions that would require air carriers to \nrequest and receive, after obtaining written consent from a pilot \napplication, relevant employment and performance records before hiring \nsomeone as a pilot. These provisions focus on encouraging and \nfacilitating the flow of information between employers so that safety \nis not compromised in any way.\n  To ensure that the burden of these pilot recordsharing provisions \ndoes not fall on employers and the legal system, when a transfer is \nrequested and complied with, both the employer who turns over the \nrequested records and the prospective employer who receives them will \nbe immune from lawsuits related to the transferred information, unless \nthe employer who provides the information knows it is false. Complete \nimmunity is critical--without it, the airlines simply will not share \nrecords. The legislation therefore could not achieve its objective of \nmaking it a common practice of prospective employers to research to the \ngreatest extent the experience of pilots, and to learn significant \ninformation that could affect air carrier hiring decisions and, \nultimately, airline safety.\n  Finally, this legislation makes certain changes to the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority required following recent Federal court \nrulings. In specific, the bill would abolish the MWAA Board of Review, \nand increase the number of presidentially appointed members of the MWAA \nBoard of Directors. It also conveys the sense of the Senate that the \nMWAA should not provide free, reserved parking areas at either \nWashington National Airport or Washington Dulles International Airport \nfor Members of Congress and other government officials or diplomats.\n  Mr. President, certain unfortunate, recent events have raised \nquestions about the safety of our nation's air transportation system. \nWe must do our part to reassure the traveling public that we have the \nworld's safest system. This comprehensive legislation will go a long \nway in reassuring the public that the system is safe, and will provide \nthe FAA with a stable, predictable, and sufficient funding stream for \nthe long term.\n\n[[Page S5575]]\n\n                                 ______\n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself and Mr. SIMPSON):\n  S. 1802. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain property containing a fish and wildlife facility to the State \nof Wyoming, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n               Ranch a Crook County, Wyoming Legislation\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague from \nWyoming, Senator Simpson, to introduce legislation to protect public \nland in our State. This bill would transfer 680 acres of land currently \nadministered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to the \nState of Wyoming. This property commonly known as Ranch A is located in \nCrook County, WY, and is scheduled to be disposed of by the General \nServices Administration in the coming months. Since the area is unique \nand possesses many historic and distinctive characteristics, the State \nof Wyoming would like to have the property transferred to it so that \nthe property and facilities on the land can be preserved for the public \nfor many years to come.\n  The Ranch A lodge, which sits on 680 acres of property, was \nconstructed by a private developer in the 1930's and acquired by the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1963. Since the area has an abundant \nsupply of spring-fed water, it is ideal for trout research and the \nstudy of trout genetics. The Fish and Wildlife Service continued its \nresearch operations at Ranch A until 1980 when all of the agency's \ntrout research work was transferred to Bozeman, MT. Since that time, \nthe Service has maintained the facility but has leased the area to a \nvariety of groups including the Wyoming Game and Fish Department and \nthe South Dakota School of Mines.\n  Although the area has significant historical and cultural values, in \n1995 the Department of Interior took action to divest itself of \nownership of Ranch A. Recently, the Fish and Wildlife Service declared \nthe property as ``surplus'' and is planning to dispose of Ranch A \nthrough the General Services Administration. No formal action has been \ntaken on the disposal request and the property is still owned and \nmaintained by the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  The State of Wyoming is interested in protecting Ranch A and working \nto ensure the area is protected for future generations. Earlier this \nyear, the Wyoming congressional delegation was approached by Gov. Jim \nGeringer and asked if we could introduce legislation to have the \nproperty transferred to the State of Wyoming. The State is willing to \nassume ownership of the area and maintain the facility and the adjacent \nland for educational, historical and wildlife management purposes.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would achieve that goal. The \nbill would transfer all right and title of the 680 acres and all \nbuildings on the Ranch A property to the State of Wyoming. The State \nwould assume control of the property and would be required to manage \nthe area for public purposes including fish and wildlife management, \neducation and historical uses. In order to ensure the area remains \npublic, the legislation contains a reverter clause that requires the \nState of Wyoming to manage the property for public uses or it would be \ntransferred back to Federal ownership.\n  The bill is the product of long negotiations between the State of \nWyoming and the Fish and Wildlife Service. Initially, the State would \nonly accept the land if Federal funds were authorized to refurbish the \narea. However, by working with the State, the Federal Government and \nlocal officials, we have been able to craft a compromise that does not \nrequire any Federal expenditures and keeps the land public.\n  Mr. President, the Ranch A property is a truly unique facility that \nshould be kept in public ownership. The area has significant historic \nand cultural value in addition to its wildlife and research \nopportunities. Keeping the area clean and pure is a goal of the \nresidents in the region who hope to preserve the beauty of the facility \nand surrounding land for future generations to enjoy. The State of \nWyoming is willing to take on the responsibility of protecting this \nwonderful property and I strongly support their efforts to ensure that \nRanch A is protected for many years to come.\n  Instead of allowing the Federal Government to dispose of this unique \nproperty that has such a variety of uses, I urge Congress to take \naction and allow the State of Wyoming to protect Ranch A. The choice is \nclear--either we pass this bill and keep the area open to the public, \nor we allow the Federal Government to move forward and dispose of the \nland into private ownership. I hope we can move quickly to support this \noutstanding area and pass this legislation in the near future.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Johnston and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1804. A bill to make technical and other changes to the laws \ndealing with the territories and freely associated States of the United \nStates; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          Territories and Freely Associated States Legislation\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill address several concerns that were brought to my attention by the \nleadership in some of the United States territories and in the nations \nin free association with the United States. I am pleased that this \nlegislation is cosponsored by the Ranking Member and former Chairman of \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Senator Johnston, as \nwell as by Senator Akaka, who has also had a long and abiding interest \nin the welfare of the territories and freely associated States.\n  During the February recess, I had the opportunity to meet with the \nchief executives of the United States territories of American Samoa, \nGuam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands as well as \nthe Presidents of the Republic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall \nIslands, and the Federated States of Micronesia. I want to express my \nappreciation to all of them for their courtesies and their willingness \nto meet with Senator Akaka and myself and for their assistance in \narranging full and frank discussions.\n  I was impressed by the diversity within the Pacific and the magnitude \nof the problems facing these island governments. I have some \nappreciation for their problems in dealing with Washington because I \ncan recall the days of territorial administration for Alaska. I was \nalso able to point out that Statehood is not a complete remedy for \nthose who still think Alaska is their private reserve. Alaska, like the \nislands, is noncontiguous and must deal with standards developed for \nthe lower 48 States. We have the problem of servicing small remote \npopulations, much like the Republic of the Marshalls and the Federated \nStates of Micronesia have.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would address the \nfollowing issues:\n  Section 1 extends the supplemental food assistance program for \nEnewetak and Bikini for an additional 5 years. Enewetak and Bikini were \nthe sites for the United States atmospheric nuclear testing program in \nthe Marshall Islands and the food assistance program is necessary to \nsupplement local food supplies while the populations resettle their \natolls. The difficulty that Enewetak has experienced in establishing a \nlocal food supply should be ample warning to the population of Bikini \nof the environmental consequences of a scrape, and I sincerely hope \nthat we can avoid that environmental degradation. While Enewetak is \nmaking significant strides in reestablishing a local food supply, it is \nclear that a continuation of the agriculture assistance is needed. The \nlanguage would also require the United States to ensure that the \nprogram is designed to meet the actual needs of the populations. I \nunderstand that the program is running at the same level as it did 10 \nyears ago without taking into account the change in population.\n\n  A concern was also raised over the medical care and monitoring \nprogram that the Department of Energy runs in the Northern Marshalls. \nAt the same time that I am introducing this legislation, I am also \nintroducing an amendment that would extend the program to Bikini and \nEnewetak. While I do not want to jeopardize the effectiveness of the \nprogram for the affected populations of Rongelap and Utirik, I also \nwant to ensure that the objectives of the four atoll program are being \nmet. This language will also provide the Committee with an opportunity \nto review the administration of the program\n\n[[Page S5576]]\n\nsince it was shifted out of defense programs and into environmental \nhealth within DOE. I appreciate that the four atoll health program was \nto be administered by the Tribunal established under the Compact of \nFree Association, but I am also mindful of the special responsibility \nthat the United States has for the populations of the four affected \natolls. Under the terms of the Compact, we authorized further ex gratia \nassistance if justified, and I think it is time for the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources to examine how the programs--those being \nprovided by the Republic of the Marshall Islands and those provided by \nthe United States--are being implemented. I was very impressed by my \nvisit to Bikini and am grateful for the courtesies and hospitality \nextended by the Mayor, the Council, and Senator Balos. During the \nhearings on this legislation, I also want to examine what role the \nPublic Health Service can play in improving health care not only to the \nfour atolls, but throughout the Republic of the Marshall Islands and \nalso to the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Palau. I \nagain want to emphasize that in no way do I want to jeopardize the \noverriding objective of the health care being provided by Brookhaven to \nthe 133 exposed Marshallese, but I do not want to pass over the \nopportunity to see if the populations of Bikini and Enewetak could \nbootstrap onto the program using their trust funds.\n  Section 2 of the legislation would repeal a provision of law that \nauthorizes the government of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \nIslands to take over the American Memorial Park in Saipan. Senator \nAkaka and I participated in a wreath laying at the park, and I was \nimpressed with the development of the area, especially in light of \nstaff descriptions of the site only a few short years ago. Ambassador \nHaydn Williams deserves a great deal of credit for his persistence and \ncommitment to seeing the park established. While I am not opposed to \nproposals for other arrangements, it seems to me that the area is now a \npart of the National Park System and should remain so until the lease \nexpires unless some concrete proposal is brought forward that will \nmaintain the objectives and purposes for the memorial. I fully expect \nthat we will need to modify this provision to permit the commonwealth \nthe ability to develop the marina area, but at least for the time \nbeing, I think the National Park Service should continue to operate and \nmaintain the memorial.\n\n  Section 3 is a technical amendment to the legislation dealing with \nthe land grant status of the College of Micronesia and was brought to \nmy attention by Susan Moses, the president of the college. The \namendment would provide separate land grant status to the three \nsuccessor institutions to the former College of Micronesia--the College \nof Micronesia--FSM, the College of the Marshall Islands, and the Palau \nCommunity College. This amendment will hopefully eliminate some \nadministrative headaches for the college.\n  Section 4 amends the Guam Organic Act to guarantee that any lands \nacquired by the United States for Federal purposes will be made \navailable to the Government of Guam when those purposes have expired. \nThe Federal Government, principally the Department of Defense, controls \nabout one-third of the available land area in Guam. Those lands were \nacquired for defense needs, and when those needs no longer exist, the \nlands should be returned to Guam. I was particularly troubled by the \nsituation at Ritidian Point where the Fish and Wildlife Service, \nseemingly in the dead of night, effectively stole land that the \nDepartment of Defense and the Government of Guam had negotiated for \ntransfer. Whatever the justification for Fish and Wildlife's interest, \nthere is no excuse for the insensitivity shown by the Department of the \nInterior in that acquisition. Rather than spending their time enlarging \ntheir empire, the Fish and Wildlife Service could make better use of \ntheir resources by going after the brown tree snake. At the rate they \nare going, they will have the only wildlife refuge dedicated to extinct \nspecies. I especially want to thank Congressman Underwood for his \nassistance in developing this approach to guarantee a role for the \nGovernment of Guam in any further Federal land disposal in Guam. The \nGovernor of Guam made an excellent presentation of the problems created \nby the actions of the Fish and Wildlife Service and I think this is a \nsituation that needs to be addressed and I am grateful for the \ncomprehensive briefing he provided us during our brief visit to Guam.\n\n  Section 5 would repeal a provision of law that limits the use of \nlands transferred to Guam. Again, I want to thank Congressman Underwood \nfor suggesting this amendment. I cannot think of any restriction more \nonerous than transferring property for which the Federal Government has \nno further need and then denying the Government of Guam the ability to \nderive the economic benefits of its use and development.\n  Section 6 was suggested by the Resident Representative of the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and would provide State-\nlike treatment for the commonwealth, the Virgin Islands, and American \nSamoa for certain drug enforcement programs. Guam and Puerto Rico \npresently have State-like treatment, and this amendment simply provides \nuniform treatment for all the territories.\n  Section 7 of the legislation would amend the Revised Organic Act of \nthe Virgin Islands at the request of the Governor of the Virgin \nIslands. The first amendment would provide that the Governor would \nretain his powers as Governor when he is temporarily absent from the \nterritory on official business. This amendment recognizes that with \nmodern communications and transportation, the current limitations are \narchaic and impede continuity in the operations of the executive branch \nin the Virgin Islands.\n  The second amendment would reform the authority granted to the Virgin \nIslands in 1976 to issue bonds secured by the matching fund. The debt \nis now priority debt, not parity debt. Priority debt places a premium \nvalue on the earliest debt, while parity debt places all bond holders \non a level playing field. Although most communities now issue parity \ndebt, the current limitation handicaps the Virgin Islands by requiring \na higher fee and interest rate on subsequent issues as well as over \ncollateralization. The amendment would permit the Virgin Islands to \nissue parity debt and allows for a transition to permit the Virgin \nIslands to refinance their current priority debt. This would reduce the \ndebt service and free up needed revenues for school improvements and \nemergency repairs made necessary by Hurricane Marilyn. I want to \nemphasize that current bond holders will be fully protected.\n  Section 8 was suggested by Senator Johnston to begin to look at what \nthe economic future of the Virgin Islands will be in light of the \nchanges that are happening both politically and economically in the \nCaribbean and what the Federal Government can do to provide a stable \nand self-sustaining local economic base. I fully agree with Senator \nJohnston that the time to do that analysis is now.\n\n  Mr. President, upon my return from my visit to the Pacific, I wrote \nthe President on what I thought was a fairly significant concern raised \nby the Presidents of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the \nFederated States of Micronesia. While the political relationship under \nthe Compacts of Free Association is of indefinite duration, certain \nprovisions are subject to renegotiation and expire at the end of 15 \nyears. The compacts require renegotiation in the 13th year and the \nPresidents quite correctly pointed out that was not sufficient time to \nconclude negotiations and obtain the necessary ratifications by the \nUnited States and their governments. Like the Governor of the Virgin \nIslands and Senator Johnston, they are looking to the future and trying \nto plan for it. They asked if I would request the administration to \nbegin the process of formulating the U.S. position and begin discussion \nwhile there was a degree of time. Given the number of years it took for \nthe original ratification, that seemed like a reasonable request. I \nwill not comment on the President's response, other than to ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of my letter and his response be included \nin the Record.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate that we are late in this session of the \nCongress, but these are important matters that require the attention of \nthe Congress. I\n\n[[Page S5577]]\n\nwant to announce that the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \nwill hold a hearing on this legislation on June 25, 1996 and at the \nsame time we will review the report on the law enforcement initiative \nin the commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. I will not go into \ngreat detail on the situation in the Commonwealth other than to say \nthat reforms need to be implemented. We had extensive and detailed \nbriefings and discussions with the Governor's staff, the Federal \nofficials on the island, the Chamber of Commerce, the legislature, the \nU.S. attorney and Federal judiciary. It is my intention to move \nexpeditiously on this legislation immediately after the hearing is \nconcluded.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 1804\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AMERICAN MEMORIAL PARK.\n\n       Section 5 of Public Law 95-348 is amended by striking \n     subsection (f), and renumbering subsections (g) and (h) as \n     subsections (f) and (g), respectively.\n\n     SEC. 3. TERRITORIAL LAND GRANT COLLEGES--TECHNICAL AMENDMENT.\n\n       Subsection (b) of section 1361 of Public Law 96-374 is \n     amended by striking the words ``August 30, 1980 (7 U.S.C. \n     327), commonly referred to as the Second'' and inserting in \n     lieu thereof the words ``July 2, 1862 (7 U.S.C. 305), \n     commonly referred to as the First''.\n\n     SEC. 4. AMENDMENT TO THE GUAM ORGANIC ACT.\n\n       The Organic Act of Guam (48 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.), as \n     amended, is further amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following new section:\n       ``Sec. 36. (a) At least 180 days before transferring to any \n     Federal agency excess real property located in Guam, the \n     Administrator of General Services shall notify the government \n     of Guam that the property is available under this section.\n       ``(b) The Administrator shall transfer to the government of \n     Guam all right, title, and interest of the United States in \n     and to excess real property located in Guam, by quit claim \n     deed and without reimbursement, if the government of Guam, \n     within 180 days after receiving notification under subsection \n     (a) regarding the property, notifies the Administrator that \n     the government of Guam intends to acquire the property under \n     this section.\n       ``(c) For purposes of this section, the term 'excess real \n     property' means excess property (as that term is defined in \n     section 3 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services \n     Act of 1949, as in effect on the date of enactment of the \n     Guam Land Return Act) that is real property.''.\n\n     SEC. 5.

William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Recently Senator Akaka and I had the \n     opportunity to meet with President Amata Kabua of the \n     Republic of the Marshall Islands and his Cabinet and later \n     with President Bailey Olter of the Federated States of \n     Micronesia and the Speaker of their legislature. While we had \n     frank and informative meetings, one issue arose in both \n     meetings that we wanted to bring to your attention and \n     request your support.\n       As you know, in 1986, the Republic of the Marshall Islands \n     and the Federated States of Micronesia emerged from the \n     former United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands \n     as sovereign nations in free association with the United \n     States. That status had been requested by the Micronesian \n     governments in the late 1960's and negotiated with the United \n     States over more than a decade. Congress approved the \n     Compacts of Free Association for these two areas in Public \n     Law 99-239, signed by the President on January 14, 1986. That \n     approval came after several years of Congressional \n     consideration.\n       Under the terms of the Compacts, the political relationship \n     is open ended, but the federal assistance provisions \n     terminate after fifteen years, in 2001, with a possible two \n     year extension if negotiations on such assistance have not \n     concluded. Under section 231 of the Compacts, negotiations on \n     those provisions that expire at the end of fifteen years \n     shall commence no later than in year thirteen, in 1999. The \n     leadership in both countries strongly urged that discussions \n     begin prior to that time. I support that request.\n       In addition to the critical strategic and policy interests \n     of the United States in each of these areas, we have \n     developed a close and, I hope, an enduring relationship based \n     on mutually shared values. the political development of the \n     freely associated states and their emergence from the United \n     Nations trusteeship system was done peacefully. The option of \n     free association was a decision made by the Micronesians at a \n     time when full independence was the mark of decolonization \n     elsewhere in the world. While there have been significant \n     developments in the ten years of the Compacts, the process of \n     nation-building is not simple nor without setbacks and \n     problems. The relationship is unique, and while I understand \n     that there are some who find it troubling, I think an honest \n     review would demonstrate that it has exceeded the \n     expectations of all parties.\n       I do have some concerns with how the present relationship \n     has been implemented, not the least of which is the failure \n     of the Department of the Interior to assign an individual to \n     each of the freely associated states to provide assistance \n     and monitor the various federal programs and grants that have \n     been provided despite the clear intent of the Congress in \n     approving section 108 of P.L. 101-219 and explicit \n     appropriations. That is a situation that should be rectified \n     immediately. Some of the present economic problems might have \n     been avoided with a continuing presence from the Department. \n     While I support the Administration's economic policy reforms \n     being carried out in cooperation with the Asian Development \n     Bank, those reforms do not obviate the need for a full time \n     presence from the Department of the Interior in responding to \n     the problems.\n       I think it is clear, however, that the United States has \n     much to offer the micronesian governments consistent with \n     their sovereignty and our fiscal limitations. Technical and \n     other assistance in marine resources and tourism will be \n     important as these countries attempt to develop their \n     economic potential while preserving their culture and \n     traditions. Continued assistance in fiscal management will \n     also be vital.\n       I strongly suggest that you begin consideration of the \n     Administration's policy with respect to future assistance to \n     the freely associated states now and that you do so in close \n     consultation with the Congress. The history of the original \n     approval of the Compacts indicates that the two years \n     provided in section 231 is wholly inadequate for negotiations \n     and Congressional consideration. It would be even worse if \n     the Administration waited any longer to begin to formulate \n     its position.\n       I do want to emphasize the need for close Congressional \n     consultations. This Committee, as well as the relevant House \n     Committees, were involved in the discussions and negotiations \n     that led to the passage of the Covenant for the Northern \n     Mariana Islands and the Compacts for the three freely \n     associated states, and many of our concerns are reflected in \n     the final documents.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                                       Washington, April 10, 1996.\n      Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regrading U.S. \n     policy toward the Federated States of Micronesia and the \n     Republic of the Marshall Islands. These former parts of the \n     Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands make an important \n     contribution to our security presence in the Asia-Pacific \n     region.\n       We are working closely with Micronesia and the Marshall \n     Islands to ensure the nearly $2 billion in scheduled U.S. \n     assistance from over forty agencies is effectively and \n     efficiently used. The Interior Department has dedicated \n     substantial personnel resources for this purpose.\n       I look forward to working with you and other members of \n     your committee to support the exciting process of nation-\n     building that is taking place in these former parts of the \n     Trust Territories.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Bill Clinton.\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON, Mr. President, I am pleased to join in the \nintroduction of this legislation that will address several important \nareas of concern in the territories and freely associated states. Many \nof the provisions result from a recent trip that the chairman of the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, Senator Murkowski, and \nSenator Akaka recently took to most of the Pacific insular areas.\n  It is almost 24 years since I first came to the Senate and assumed \nthe chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Territories of the then \nCommittee on Interior and Insular Affairs. I thought it was important \nto visit the areas under the committee's jurisdiction and meet with the \nleadership. There is nothing that can replace that first-hand \nknowledge. Given the enormous workload of the committee and the \ncritical nature of the legislation before us, it is often easy to \noverlook the needs of the territories and freely associated states. I \nsincerely hope that other members of the committee will also visit \nthese areas and come to appreciate the unique needs and problems that \nconfront the residents. The responsibility for these areas is one of \nthose unique constitutional authorities entrusted to Congress by \narticle IV.\n  In the time that I have been involved with the insular areas, \nCongress has enacted legislation providing full local self-government \nto the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa--including the election \nof non-voting delegates to the House of Representatives. We have also \nterminated the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, leader to the \nemergence of three sovereign nations in free association with the \nUnited States and a fully locally self-governing territory--the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. I also had the privilege \nof serving on the Ad Hoc Advisory Group of Puerto Rico with our former \ncolleague Marlow Cook and former Governor Luis Munoz Marin.\n\n  I want to focus on one provision of this legislation, and that is the \nstudy of the future economic needs of the Virgin Islands. Since 1960, \nthe Virgin Islands has experienced enormous growth and development. In \nlarge part, that growth resulted from increased tourism after the \nclosure of Cuba and also from improved transportation links to the \nIslands. Another component was the favorable trade status of the Virgin \nIslands, which is outside the customs territory of the United States. \nThose underpinnings are about to disappear. NAFTA and other trade \nagreements are eroding the trade advantages that the Virgin Islands has \nenjoyed. Within the foreseeable future, we will have a post-Castro Cuba \nthat will likely challenge the Virgin Islands tourist industry. Rather \nthan waiting for those events to happen, it is essential that we--the \nVirgin Islands and the federal government--begin to plan for the \nfuture. This legislation calls for the creation of a Commission on the \nEconomic Future of the Virgin Islands. The Commission would carry out \nan in-depth study of what will need to be done to provide a transition \nfor the Virgin Islands to a fully self-sustaining local economy and \nwhat the federal government needs to do to facilitate that transition.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation and I look forward to the \nhearings that the Committee will conduct\n\n[[Page S5579]]\n\nin the next several weeks. At that time we will also review the report \nfrom the Administration on the law enforcement initiative in the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. I was the floor manager \nfor the Covenant, and I take particular pride in the accomplishments \nthat have occurred in the past twenty years. The Northern Marianas \nentered territorial status heavily dependent on federal support for \nbasic government operations. In twenty years, the territory has \nprogressed to the point that it no longer requires direct assistance in \noperations and is capable of matching federal grants for capital \ninfrastructure. That progress has had a price, however, and I intend to \nvery carefully examine the labor situation and the continued reports of \nabuse, especially in the garment industry. While I fully support the \nauthority for local self-government conferred under the Covenant, that \ngrant also included the responsibility for exercising that authority \nproperly.\n  In that context, on July 20, 1995, the Senate passed S. 638, a bill \ncontaining, among other things, significant provisions addressing labor \nissues in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The House \nhas not yet responded to this important legislative initiative. My hope \nis that we can obtain House action on S. 638 soon--in time for the \n104th Congress to act to address these problems.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRAMS:\n  S. 1805. A bill to provide for the management of Voyageurs National \nPark, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n       voyageurs national park accessibility and partnership act\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, there is a march toward democracy afoot in \nAmerica today.\n  That statement may seem surprising; after all, why would such a \nmovement be needed? We Americans take pride in the fact that our \nGovernment is based on the pursuit of democracy--in the words of \nAbraham Lincoln, ``a government of the people, by the people and for \nthe people.'' And that principle should have as much relevance today as \nit did when President Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address 130 \nyears ago--but does it?\n  In theory perhaps, but as a practical matter, it seems that the words \nof Lincoln have been steadily eroded by the recent surge in the size \nand power of the Federal Government. And with that growth in Washington \nhas come the slow but unmistakable shift in power from the people to \nthe government.\n  Under a democracy, government is needed to establish and enforce the \nfundamental rules by which our society operates--with the express \nsupport of the people. It is there to protect the rights of individuals \nand to step in when those rights come into conflict--to resolve \ndisputes between people, not to create them.\n  But in recent years, the American people have been forced to watch \nGovernment expand its role in our daily lives through the use of laws, \nrules, and regulations--to the point of interference. Instead of \nreceiving its power from the people, it has usurped that authority and \nas a result, abandoned any sense of public accountability.\n  As a result, many people believe that they have lost control of their \nGovernment--indeed a growing number of us feel that the Government now \ncontrols us.\n  There is no better example of this shift in power than in the Federal \nGovernment's management of our natural resources and public lands, \nparticularly as it has affected the people of my home state in the \ncontroversy surrounding Voyageurs National Park.\n  The Park, now comprising 218,000 acres in northern Minnesota, was \ncreated in 1971 and established as part of the National Park System in \n1975 following years of contentious debate and public hearings. While a \nnumber of local residents supported the creation of the park, they did \nso after promises by the Federal Government of increased economic \ngrowth in the region; maintenance of the Park as a multiple \nrecreational use facility, for recreational activities like \nsnowmobiling; and the continued use of input from the public into the \nmanagement of the park.\n  But as the years passed, those promises fell by the wayside, leaving \nlocal residents out in the cold and understandably distrustful of \ngovernment bureaucrats who have been unaccountable to the people they \nare supposed to serve and unresponsive to their needs. Instead of \nworking for the people, the Federal Government has consistently ignored \ntheir concerns and in some cases, actually worked against them.\n  For example, the people of northern Minnesota were promised that in \nexchange for giving up their rights to the land that would comprise the \nPark, they would receive opportunities to boost their local economy. In \nfact, upon creation of the Park, Federal officials estimated that it \nwould host over 1.3 million visitors each year, thereby providing much-\nneeded economic growth for the surrounding communities.\n  But the road toward economic prosperity never found its way through \nVoyageurs National Park. Park officials currently estimate the annual \nnumber of visitors at 200,000--less than one-sixth their initial \nprojection. Even worse, the Park Service has tried to cover its tracks \nby suggesting that the park--despite its low visitor rate--is not \nunderutilized.\n  While the facts and figures certainly counter the Park Service's \nassertion, nothing beats a first-hand assessment of park use. So, on a \nbeautiful Saturday last July, I visited Voyageurs National Park. While \nadmiring the beauty and historical significance of the lands and waters \nenclosed within the park, I was struck by the fact that hardly anyone--\nwith the exception of park officials and a few scattered visitors--was \nthere. It was only when I drove through the neighboring city of \nInternational Falls, MN, that I did see a number of tourists and \nvisitors--in line--waiting to pass through customs--on their way to \nCanada.\n  In 1983, Congress called for the Park Service to create a \ncomprehensive visitor use and facilities plan which would lay out a \nstrategy to increase park use. In spite of Congress' directive, no \nattempt to carry out the study ever occurred--perhaps due to the Park \nService's belief that the park was not being underutilized, \nbureaucratic stonewalling, or maybe just out of simple \nnegligence. Whatever the reason, Voyageurs National Park today remains \nunderutilized--an isolated enclave--with the people of northern \nMinnesota forced to pay the price of the National Park Service's \nmismanagement.\n\n  The Park Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have also \nworked together to curtail legitimate visitor access to and use in the \nPark. Under the guise of the Endangered Species Act, certain bays were \nshut off to snowmobiling in order to protect the nesting habitat of \nbald eagles. While everyone agreed that the eagles should be protected, \nmany believed that both agencies failed to give valid, scientific \nreasons for closing off the bays. Recently, a Federal district judge \nruled that Federal bureaucrats had abused the Endangered Species Act to \nunfairly restrict snowmobile access in the bays. It is sadly ironic \nthat it took a Federal judge to recognize a legitimate use in the \nPark--something the Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service have \nfailed to comprehend.\n  But perhaps the greatest example of arrogance on the part of the \nFederal Government concerns the question of wilderness designation \nwithin the Park. Despite the clearly expressed intent of Congress that \nVoyageurs National Park was to be a multiple recreational use facility, \nthe Park Service has continued to manage certain portions of the Park \nfor wilderness study characteristics. One need go no further than to \nask my colleague from Minnesota, Representative Jim Oberstar, who \nhelped create the Park when he served as a Congressional staffer, about \nthe intent of Congress that it was to be open for multiple use. Yet, \nmajor segments of the Park continue to be shut off to legitimate and \nrecognized multiple uses--such as snowmobiling, boating and dog \nsledding--further breaking the long-standing commitments made to \nnorthern Minnesotans.\n  Mr. President, as much as we would like to, we cannot rewrite the \nhistory of Voyageurs National Park or simply wave a magic wand to right \nthe wrongs to which the people of northern Minnesota have been \nsubjected over the last 25 years. But we can and must take action to \nensure that history does not repeat itself--that future management\n\n[[Page S5580]]\n\nof the Park be conducted in accordance with the views of the people.\n  For that reason, today, I am introducing legislation which would help \nresolve this controversy by bringing democracy and government \naccountability back to Voyageurs National Park.\n  Under my legislation, a new Planning and Management Council will be \ncharged with developing and monitoring a comprehensive management plan. \nIt will consist of 11 members appointed by the Secretary of the \nInterior and will include representatives from Federal, State, local \nand tribal governments.\n  The management council will be authorized to create Advisory Councils \nmade up of individuals representing diverse interests. All council \nmeetings will be open to the public, who will be given opportunities to \nprovide comment on agenda items.\n  Mr. President, under my bill, public input will no longer be \nignored--in fact, it will be encouraged as part of the management \nprocess.\n  Finally, my legislation will prohibit the Park Service from issuing \nany additional regulations regarding the Park between enactment of this \nbill and the Secretary's final approval of the management plan, except \nin cases of routine administration, law enforcement need and \nemergencies.\n  To better understand how this new management council will improve the \nsituation in northern Minnesota, one need look no further than the \nrecent ban that was proposed by the National Park Service on the use of \nlive bait within the interior lakes of Voyageurs National Park--one \nimposed without the solicitation of public input or notification to \narea fisherman and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.\n  This unilateral action taken by the Park Service naturally created \nenormous controversy and outrage in northern Minnesota. As one State \nofficial said at the time, ``It was a big surprise to us * * *. There \nwas no prior discussion with us on the ban. There's a longstanding \ntradition in the park of being able to use live bait.''\n  After many of us raised our objections and outrage over the ban, the \nPark Service backpedaled, then lifted the ban, stating that it had \nmisread the law. In doing so, the Superintendent of the Park was quoted \nin the papers saying, ``I had no idea this was going to be a problem. \nIf I had known, trust me, I would have dealt with it differently.''\n  Mr. President, think about those words for a second. According to the \nPark Service, if they had just known, they never would have tried to \nimpose their will on the people. If they had just known, just listened, \njust sought input, none of this would have happened. That is exactly \nwhat we are seeking today.\n  My legislation would avoid such embarrassments in the future by \nbringing everyone together to ensure that management of the Park is \nconducted by agreement, not edict. It will ensure that everyone has a \nseat at the table when the decisions are made. Above all, this new \nmanagement council will return democracy to the preservation of \nVoyageurs National Park. It will return to the people of northern \nMinnesota a voice in how the park is operated and its impact on their \ncommunities, economy and livelihood.\n\n  Mr. President, I spoke earlier today of a growing movement toward \ndemocracy in America--born in the heartland of our Nation, led by the \nAmerican people, and headed toward Washington. Since holding two public \nfield hearings in Minnesota on this issue last year, I have heard from \nnumerous citizen organizations, community leaders, and average \nMinnesotans about the management of the park and how their daily lives \nare affected by it.\n  Their message is simple: Let us have a say in how our natural \nresources are maintained--return some of the power to the people--give \nus back our government and our country. The silent majority, which has \nbeen suppressed for so many years, is now finding its voice again--and \nit is our responsibility to listen to it and act upon it. By conducting \nour field hearings, which attracted well over 2,000 Minnesotans, we \ntook the first step by listening. Now, we must move ahead and take \naction.\n  During those hearings, I heard a number of people give profound and \noften moving testimony. Many presented facts and figures--invaluable \ndata about the history and management about the park. But what struck \nme the most during the hearings were the personal stories--the real-\nlife accounts about how the Federal Government and its mismanagement of \nVoyageurs National Park has truly changed the lives of the people it \nwas created to serve.\n  One of these stories belonged to Carol Selsaas of Cohasset, MN. In \nher testimony, Carol described the work of her late father, George \nEsslinger, who was one of the strongest supporters in northern \nMinnesota for the creation of Voyageurs National Park.\n  Carol said:\n\n       For over 9 years, my father worked with other men and women \n     to fight for the creation of the park. He assisted the \n     Department of the Interior in physically identifying the \n     boundaries of the park. He traveled and spoke in favor of the \n     park. He gave his heart and soul to the park. He believed the \n     area he supported for a national park should be maintained \n     for the enjoyment of all people: snowmobilers, cross country \n     skiers, boaters, hikers, fishermen, hunters, yes and even dog \n     sledders. He felt that this would be a park for everyone who \n     had respect for this land, not one locked up except for a \n     chosen few.\n\n  Carol went on to describe how her father supported the park with the \nunderstanding that the trails and roads already established--over 200 \nmiles on the Kabetogama Peninsula alone-- would be maintained. To date, \nall but 12 miles are now closed off to public access. On one of those \nclosed off trails, Carol said, rests a memorial to her father placed by \nthe Park Service. With tears in her eyes, she said that because of the \ninaccessibility of the trail, she has never been able to visit her \nfather's memorial.\n  ``My father died knowing that he had been lied to,'' said Carol. ``He \ndied apologizing to me, his grandson, his community. On his death bed, \nI promised that I would fulfill his wish and tell the story of how he \nwas misled in his support for Voyageurs National Park.''\n  Indeed, she did--as did many other of my fellow Minnesotans. We \ncannot forget their words or discard their testimonies. In the sterile \nhalls of the Federal buildings here in Washington, the words of Carol \nSelsaas and others may not mean much, but to me, they describe the \nheartfelt emotions and passions about the culture of northern \nMinnesota--a culture that Washington may not understand, but cannot \ntake for granted.\n  Nor can we hide in the halls of Congress from the march of democracy \nthat is spreading throughout the heartland of our country. If we are \ntruly committed to operating as the open democracy described by \nPresident Lincoln, we must turn the tide and return power back to its \nlegitimate source in America: the people.\n  The legislation I introduce today is a necessary step in bringing the \nprinciples of democracy back to one small, but important region of our \nNation. Let us no longer obstruct the march of democracy but help pave \nthe way for it across America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the test of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1805\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nclarify that any dietary supplement that claims to produce euphoria, \nheightened awareness or similar mental or psychological effects shall \nbe treated as a drug under the Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n               Legislation to Control Herbal Street Drugs\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation--along with my colleagues Senators Dodd and Frist--to \ncontrol the growing problem of dangerous herbal stimulants that are \nmarketed and sold as alternatives to powerful and illegal street drugs. \nThis carefully-drafted bill will make these herbal street drugs subject \nto pre-market safety reviews and allow the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the FDA, to take prompt and decisive action against \nthis narrow class of products.\n  I strongly support the right of the American people to have access to \nlegitimate dietary supplements, and I want to clearly state that this \nbill will not limit that access. However, herbal street drugs are not \nlegitimate dietary supplements. They are quite simply dangerous \nproducts masquerading as dietary supplements to evade Government review \nand sanctions.\n  Mr. President, on March 7, 1996, one of these products, called \nUltimate Xphoria, killed 20-year-old Peter Schlendorf of Northport, NY. \nPeter, a junior at the State University of New York at Albany, died \nfrom a lethal combination of herbal stimulants found in this product. A \nstatement issued by the medical examiner's office in Panama City, FL, \nwhere Peter died, specifically states that Peter's death ``was a result \nof the use of Ultimate Xphoria, an herbal product containing Ma \nHuang.'' Ma Huang--also known as Ephedra--is a botanical source of the \npowerful stimulant ephedrine. The medical examiner's statement lists \nPeter's cause of death as the ``synergistic effect of ephedrine'' and \nseveral other herbal stimulants contained in this product. The \nstatement further explains that these stimulants ``can have an adverse \neffect on the heart and central nervous system.''\n  Mr. President, I am committed to doing everything that I can to \nensure that no more young people die from these dangerous herbal street \ndrugs. And let me be perfectly clear: if Congress fails to act, it will \njust be a matter of time before these products kill more young people.\n  This is a battle to protect our children. The slick peddlers of these \nherbal street drugs have specifically targeted young people. They sell \ntheir products in novelty shops, using flashy signs and posters that \nappeal to and attract adolescents. They give their products names like \nCloud 9, Herbal Ecstacy, Ultimate Xphoria, Magic Mushrooms and E-Ludes.\n  Using the Internet and showy brochures, they hawk their dangerous \nwares with promises of ``euphoric stimulation, highly increased energy \nlevels, tingly skin sensations, increased sexual sensations, enhanced \nsensory processing and mood elevations.'' One product, called Herbal \nEcstacy, even claims that it is ``a carefully formulated and thoroughly \ntested organic alternative to actual MDMA or Ecstacy''--a dangerous, \nillegal street drug. The marketing brochure for this product further \nstates that it ``acts on the same basis as MDMA, triggering similar, \nbut not identical, physical reactions in the body.'' This is just \noutrageous.\n  In addition, many of these products falsely claim to be safe and \ntested. Some are even advertised as ``100 percent and FDA approved'' \nand as ``100 percent natural . . . with no side effects''. As Peter's \ndeath clearly demonstrates, however, these products can be deadly, and \nnone are FDA-approved. How can the producers of these herbal street \ndrugs claim that they are safe and tested when they can produce such \ntragic results? This is wrong and must be stopped.\n  The manner in which these products are marketed invites misuse by \nunsuspecting young people. These products are advertised as \nalternatives to street drugs. They are intended to get young people \nhigh. And what happens when the recommended dosage doesn't achieve the \ndesired high? Then, the claims that these products are safe, natural \nand thoroughly tested lure young people into taking larger dosages. \nIndeed, some sellers are telling people to take two, three and four \ntimes the recommended dosage to achieve the desired high.\n  Mr. President, the legislation that I am introducing today will help \nto ensure that no more young people die from these dangerous products. \nThe bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to clarify \nthat a dietary supplement shall be considered a drug if its label or \nlabeling claims or implies that the dietary supplement produces \neuphoria, heightened awareness or similar mental or psychological \neffects. As a result, this narrow class of dangerous products will be \nsubject to the same premarket safety reviews as other drugs, and the \nFDA will have enhanced authority to take prompt and decisive action \nagainst them. Now, the FDA will be able to quickly pull these herbal \nstreet drugs, like the one that killed Peter Schlendorf, from stores \nbefore they kill again. This legislation is necessary to protect the \nhealth of the American public, particularly its youth, who are \nobviously the target of these dangerous herbal street drugs.\n\n  Again, let me clearly state that this bill has been carefully drafted \nto maintain the public's continued access to legitimate dietary \nsupplements. For example, it will not limit access to either over-the-\ncounter drugs, such as Sudafed, or legitimate dietary supplements, such \nas herbal teas, that contain ephedra or its related products.\n  I am certain that no Member of Congress envisioned that the Dietary \nSupplement Health and Education Act of 1994--the Dietary Supplement \nAct--would protect dangerous products like these herbal street drugs, \nbut these products are currently covered by the literal language of \nthat act. Since these products are considered dietary\n\n[[Page S5583]]\n\nsupplements under current law, the FDA's authority to regulate them is \nsignificantly limited. For example, these products are not currently \nsubject to premarket safety reviews. In addition, the FDA cannot \nregulate herbal street drugs as a class, but instead must take action \nagainst each product individually. Indeed, the FDA must prove that a \nparticular formulation of an herbal street drug ``presents a \nsignificant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury'' before it can \ntake any action against the product. This is a lengthy process that can \ntake years.\n  Moreover, under current law, an herbal street drug manufacturer can \neasily evade an FDA enforcement action simply by changing the \ncomposition of its product, while continuing to make the same labeling \nclaims for drug-like mental and psychological effects. Each time the \nproduct formula changes, the FDA must evaluate the new formula and \nbuild its case from the beginning. The product formula thus becomes a \nmoving target that the FDA must chase. The FDA should not have to chase \nherbal street drugs.\n  Some will argue that this legislation is unnecessary and that the FDA \nalready has the authority to take action against herbal street drugs, \nbut the clever producers and marketers of these herbal street drugs \nhave been careful to take advantage of the protections afforded \nlegitimate dietary supplements under the Dietary Supplement Act. For \nexample, under that act, a dietary supplement is not subject to \nregulation as a drug simply because its label or labeling bears a \ntruthful, nonmisleading claim regarding its effect on the body. This \nprovision significantly limits the FDA's ability to take action against \nthe peddlers of herbal street drugs who use carefully worded labels to \nevade FDA review and control.\n  Other options available to the FDA would also be ineffective against \nherbal street drugs. For example, the Dietary Supplement Act gives the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services the authority to declare that a \ndietary supplement poses an imminent hazard to public health or safety. \nOnce such a declaration is made, the dietary supplement can be banned. \nA formal imminent hazard declaration requires lengthy formal rulemaking \nprocedures, however, including a trial-type hearing before an \nadministrative law judge. In addition, because what sells an herbal \nstreet drug is its claims rather than its ingredients, the imminent \nhazard declaration can easily be defeated by a formulation change \nwithout any label change. One can easily imagine the slick peddlers of \nthese products switching a single ingredient--for example, from ephedra \nto kava-kava, another powerful herbal stimulant--just as the FDA is \nknocking on their door.\n  Mr. President, the marketing of herbal street drugs as dietary \nsupplements, rather than as drugs, does not promote any of the goals \nidentified by Congress in the Dietary Supplement Act. That act was \nintended to promote the public health. Congressional findings in \nsection 2 of the act cite the role of a healthy diet, including safe \ndietary supplements in disease prevention, long-term good health, and \nreducing health care costs. Far from promoting the public health, \nherbal street drugs endanger the health and safety of consumers and \ngive rise to unnecessary medical costs.\n  These dangerous products are not taken for nutritional purposes or to \notherwise improve health and thus are not within the intended coverage \nof the Dietary Supplement Act. The manufacturers of herbal street drugs \nshould not be permitted to abuse the Dietary Supplement Act by using it \nto legitimize the marketing of dangerous products. A narrowly drafted \nstatutory amendment to correct the inclusion of herbal street drugs in \nthe language of the act would achieve the intent of Congress by closing \na loophole that Congress never intended to create.\n  Herbal street drugs killed young Peter Schlendorf. We have to make \nsure that this does not happen again. We have carefully drafted this \nlegislation to target the narrow class of products that killed Peter--\nproducts that are being marketed and sold to young people as safe and \nlegal alternatives to dangerous, illegal street drugs. We must take \naction quickly. I urge my fellow Senators to support this effort and \nquickly pass this legislation. If we wait, herbal street drugs will end \nmore promising, young lives.\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor this very \nimportant legislation with my colleagues, Senators D'amato and Frist. \nIn my view, the legislation is necessary to protect the American \npublic, and particularly our Nation's youth, from what amount to common \nstreet drugs.\n  The makers of these products make no attempt to sell them as products \nto improve health or nutrition. The products carry names like ``Herbal \nEcstacy,'' ``Ultimate X-Phoria,'' and ``Cloud 9.'' One product claims \n``It is a carefully formulated and thoroughly tested organic \nalternative to actual MDMA or Ecstacy.'' I hardly think any of us \nbelieve that our Nation's children should be able to go into any \nnovelty store and buy the equivalent of a powerful, dangerous, and I \nmight add, illegal street drug.\n  Let me share with you the claims and promotional language of these \nproducts, lest there be any doubt what there purpose is for:\n\n       The effects of Herbal Ecstacy beyond smart drug capacity \n     include: Euphoric stimulation; highly increased energy \n     levels; tingly skin sensations; enhanced sensory processing; \n     mood elevations.\n       Herbal Ecstacy acts on the same basis as MDMA, triggering \n     similar but not identical physical reactions in the body.\n       Our herbs are 100% natural and are uniquely formulated to \n     give you a floaty, energetic, mind expanding, euphoric \n     experience.\n\n  And listen to what is presented on a brochure as endorsements by \nusers:\n\n       They don't call it ``ultimate'' for nothing!\n       This puts everything else I've tried to shame!!\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I guess we might feel differently if we knew \nthese products were without risk. But the fact is, they have proven \ndeadly. Peter Schlendorf, a 20-year-old from York, FL, died because he \ntook one of these products. The cause of death was identified by the \nmedical examiner's office in the Florida town where Peter died.\n  The makers of these products claim they are nutritional supplements, \nlegitimately sold and promoted. They point to a law passed a couple of \nyears ago that was meant to govern legitimate dietary supplements, that \nimprove health and nutrition. But make no mistake. These products do \nnothing to improve health and nutrition.\n  So, the legislation we are proposing today is very simple. It says \nthat products claiming to produce euphoria, heightened awareness or \nsimilar mental or psychological effects shall be treated as a drug. It \nwould make the products subject to the same review, by the U.S. Food \nand Drug Administration, as other drugs. The products are not banned. \nAnd the bill will have no effect on legitimate dietary supplements. It \nonly will affect products that are marketed and sold as alternatives to \npowerful street drugs.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that we can act quickly on this \nlegislation and prevent the kind of tragedy experienced by the \nSchlendorfs.\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to join my \ndistinguished colleague from New York in introducing legislation to \naddress an alarming problem facing our children today.\n  A new class of street drugs is endangering our Nation's young people. \nThese products are being portrayed as safe, natural alternatives to \nillegal street drugs, but they are far from safe.\n  As a medical doctor who specialized in heart ailments, I am familiar \nwith the powerful and even life-threatening effect some of these \nproducts can have on the human heart and central nervous system. And as \nthe father of three young boys of the ages 8, 10 and 12, I am outraged \nat the way these products are being blatantly marketed toward children \nand young adults.\n  Therefore, I have joined Senators D'Amato and Dodd in introducing a \nbill that will control the growing problem of herbal street drugs. This \nbill will classify as drugs products marketed and sold, particularly to \nyoung people, as alternatives to illegal street drugs. As a result \nthese products will be subject to the same Federal review and sanctions \nas other pharmaceuticals.\n  This bill will not limit public access to legitimate dietary \nsupplements and over-the-counter medications. It is not drafted to \nlimit public access to products that contain particular ingredients. \nThe producers of legitimate products that make truthful claims about \ntheir product have nothing to fear from\n\n[[Page S5584]]\n\nthis bill. To the contrary, they should support the intent of this bill \nbecause it addresses the problem of unscrupulous manufacturers who are \ngiving the dietary supplement industry a bad name and abusing the very \nlaws which permit dietary supplement manufacturers to place truthful \nand nonmisleading claims on their products.\n  These herbal street drugs pose significant health risks to consumers. \nThese products are marketed under a variety of brand names, including \nCloud 9, Herbal Ecstasy and Ultimate Xphoria, with labels that claim or \nimply that they produce such effects as euphoria, heightened awareness \nand other effects. These labels often portray the products as legal \nalternatives to illegal street drugs such as ``ecstasy.'' ``Ecstasy'' \nis the street name for MDMA (4-methyl-2, dimethoxyamphetamine), which \nproduces euphoria.\n  These products often contain botanical sources of ephedrine. \nEphedrine is an amphetamine-like stimulant that can have potentially \ndangerous effects on the heart and central nervous system. Possible \nadverse effects range from clinically significant effects such as heart \nattack, stroke, seizures, psychosis and death, to clinically less \nsignificant effects that may indicate the potential for more serious \neffects. These effects can include dizziness, headache, \ngastrointestinal distress, irregular heartbeat, and heart palpitations. \nThe labels on these herbal street drugs may list one or more ephedrine-\ncontaining ingredients, including ma huang, Chinese ephedra, ma huang \nextract, ephedra, Ephedra sinica, ephedra extract, ephedra herb powder, \nepitonin or ephedrine.\n  Ephedrine and its related products are also available in many \nlegitimate forms that will not be affected by this bill. For example, \nephedrine can be useful for treating mild forms of seasonal or chronic \nasthma and is also FDA-approved for treating enursesis hypotension, \nnasal congestion and sisustitis.\n  According to a statement by the Panama City, Florida medical \nexaminer, 20-year-old Peter Schlendorf died ``as a result of the use of \nUltimate Xphoria, an herbal product containing Ma Huang''. Peter's \ncause of death was listed as the ``synergistic effect of ephedrine, \npseudo-ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine and caffeine''. There is no \nquestion that this combination of stimulants can have an adverse effect \non the heart and central nervous system.\n  As lawmakers, we have a responsibility to make sure that no more \nyoung people die from these herbal street drugs. This bill provokes \ndebate on this important issue. I have already been contacted by a \nmajor trade association, the Council for Responsible Nutrition [CRN], \nand the Nutritional Health Alliance, an industry and consumer \ncoalition, expressing a desire to work with us to reach an effective \nsolution to this issue. I urge all interested parties to come to the \ntable and address the serious consequences of allowing these herbal \nstreet drugs to fall into the hands of our children.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 1807. A bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, \nregarding the Kake Tribal Corporation public interest land exchange; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                     kake land exchange legislation\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce the Kake \nTribal Land Exchange Act on behalf of myself and Senator Stevens. This \nlegislation would amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act which \nauthorized the transfer of 23,040 acres of land from the U.S. \nGovernment to Kake Tribal Corporation.\n  The land was transferred to Kake to recognize ``an immediate need for \na fair and just settlement''\n  Unfortunately, Kake has not received the full beneficial use of its \n23,040 acres because the city's watershed--over 2,400 acres--rest \nwithin Kake Tribal's lands. In order to protect the city's watershed \nand still receive beneficial use of their 23,040 acres we are proposing \nan acre-for-acre land exchange. This will assist the people of Kake, \nAK, as they move toward a safer, cleaner, and healthier future.\n  Under this proposal, Kake Tribal would exchange the watershed for \n2,427 acres in southeast Alaska, thereby allowing Kake to receive its \nfull entitlement under ANCSA. This legislation is of great importance \nto the residents of the community of Kake, AK.\n  This legislation will ensure protection of the Gunnuk Creek watershed \nwhich is the main water supply for the city of Kake as well as protect \ncritical habitat for the Gunnuk Creek hatchery.\n  The legislation has received wide support in Alaska from diverse \ngroups such as: The Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, the city of \nKake, AK, the Organized Village of Kake, the Kake non-profit fishery, \nthe Alaska Federation of Natives, and Sealaska Corporation.\n  Additionally, the Governor of Alaska has written to me in support of \nthis exchange. Attached are copies of some of the letters of support I \nhave received for the record at this time.\n  Because this is an acre-for-acre exchange there will be no cost to \nthe Federal Government. I introduced this legislation with the \nconfidence that it is in the best interest of not only the citizens of \nKake but with the knowledge that it is in the best interest of all \nAmericans to protect drinking water for our communities. Lastly, this \nlegislation will help fulfill our commitment to the Natives of Alaska \nthat they will be treated fairly and justly under the Alaska Native \nClaims Settlement Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1807\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Act of October 15, 1966 (80 stat. 915), \nas amended, establishing a program for the preservation of additional \nhistoric property throughout the Nation, and for other purpose; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n  the national historic preservation act of 1966 amendment act of 1996\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Johnston \nand myself, I introduce a bill to amend the National Historic \nPreservation Act of 1966, that, when enacted, will continue the \nappropriations authorization for the Advisory Council on Historic \nPreservation.\n  Established in 1966, the Council is an independent Federal agency \nresponsible for advising the President and the Congress on historic \npreservation matters and commenting to Federal agencies on the effects \nof their activities upon historic properties.\n  Mr. President, over the past three decades, the Congress has made a \nsubstantial commitment to the preservation and encouragement of our \nnational heritage. Established by the National Historic Preservation \nAct, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has served to \nimprove the effectiveness and coordination of public and private \nefforts in historic preservation.\n  Historic preservation safeguards physical links to the past. It is \nthrough these links that our important cultural resources are preserved \nand passed on to succeeding generations. Destruction of our significant \ncultural and historic resources serves no purpose. Our memory of \nimportant history only becomes more difficult without the various \nfabrics to view, touch and or experience.\n  Congress recognized this principle in the National Historic \nPreservation Act of 1966: ``The historical and cultural foundations of \nthe nation should be preserved as a living part of our community life \nand development in order to give a sense of orientation to the American \npeople.''\n  Mr. President, in addition to many educational programs, one of the \nmost important functions of the Advisory Council is mediating between \nany Federal agency issuing a permit and the individual who is planning \nto develop his property. Under the terms of Section 106 of the National \nHistoric Preservation Act, the Council seeks to negotiate a memorandum \nof agreement in such cases, setting forth what will be done to reduce \nor avoid and adverse effects the undertaking will have.\n  While the section 106 process has often been described as contentious \nby private property rights advocates and others, I believe the Advisory \nCouncil can and should serve as a solution to resolving conflicts \nbetween a sometimes over-reaching bureaucracy and the individual \nproperty owner.\n  It is my hope that the committee hearing process will shed light on \nthe problems, address the issues, as well as the successes of the \nCouncil; and that we can move forward on this important program in a \npositive and constructive manner.\n  The Council's appropriations authorization expires with the current \nfiscal year. This legislation will authorize the continuing work of the \nCouncil by providing appropriations authority from fiscal year 1997 \nthrough fiscal year 2002.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1808\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled, That the Act of October 15, 1966 (80 Stat. 915), \n     as amended (16 U.S.C. Section 470 et seq.) is further amended \n     as follows:\n       (a) Section 212(a) is amended by deleting the last sentence \n     and inserting in lieu thereof the sentence ``There are \n     authorized to be appropriated not to exceed $5,000,000 in \n     each fiscal year 1997 through 2002.''\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1809. A bill entitled the ``Aleutian World War II National \nHistoric Areas Act of 1996''; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n     THE ALEUTIAN WORLD WAR II NATIONAL HISTORIC AREAS ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I introduce a bill entitled the \n``Aleutian World War II National Historic Areas Act of 1996.''\n  Mr. President, the Ounalashka Corporation is the Alaska Native \nvillage corporation for the Unalaska region of the Western Aleutian \nIslands. The Corporation is the major land owner of Amaknak Island, \nwhere the City of Unalaska is located. The Corporation has been working \nclosely with municipal officials of the City of Unalaska to identify \nCorporation land which would be Federally recognized and designated as \na unique ``historic area''.\n  Many have forgotten that during World War II, Unalaska came under \nattack. Unalaska was raided and bombed by Japanese aircraft in one of \nthe few sieges on U.S. territory. This area of Amaknak Island was \nheavily fortified, and much of the original bunkers, tunnels, and \nbuildings remain. The Corporation owns the majority of land and \nfacilities occupied by U.S. military forces on Amaknak Island during \nthe war.\n  The area is rich in history and memories. In recent years World War \nII veterans who were stationed in Unalaska, and in some cases family \nmembers, have made pilgrimages back to honor fallen friends and relive \nthe past.\n  In addition to the historic significance of Unalaska during the War, \nthere is also a compelling story of the Aleutian Islands indigenous \npeople which is not well known. Alaska Native people from 23 villages \nwere evacuated from the region during the War, and many were interned \nin relocation camps. As a result of the devastating bombing by the \nJapanese, the city of Unalaska was the only village that was re-\ninhabited following the World War II effort.\n  The Aleut people made substantial contributions to the war effort and \nyet suffered hardships similar to those of the Japanese-Americans \nthroughout the war.\n  The Corporation, the City of Unalaska, and many historians believe \nthat the history of the Aleut people and the war effort in the region \nare\n\n[[Page S5586]]\n\nintertwined. In response to the increased interest of the World War II \nveterans and their survivors who have visited Unalaska, the Corporation \nis considering constructing a World War II Historic Center on the \nIsland of Amaknak to tell this unique, but little known history of the \nwar in the Aleutians and the Aleut people to the rest of the world.\n  Mr. President, this legislation, when enacted, will establish the \n``Aleutian World War II National Historic Area''. I am very cognizant \nof the adverse effects that new units of the National Park System can \ncreate on existing units of the System. This legislation provides us \nwith a unique opportunity to work with and for the private sector in \nthe development and operation of this important historic resources.\n  There will be no land acquisition or day-to-day operational expenses \nnormally associated with other units of the National Park System. The \nOunakashka Corporation has exclusive ownership and control of the \nlands, buildings and historic structures which would comprise the \nhistoric area.\n  The Corporation is not seeking land exchanges with the Department of \nthe Interior and does not desire to convey or encumber title to, or \ncontrol of, its lands to the Federal Government. The Corporation only \nwants to work with the Federal Government to save this significant \npiece of the history of the United States. The expense to the National \nPark Service would be minimal, and would consist of technical \nassistance and training. The contribution to the public will be a \nhistoric site that is preserved for the enjoyment and education of all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1809\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Aleutian World War II \n     National Historic Areas Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to designate and preserve the \n     Aleutian World War II National Historic Area within lands \n     owned by the Ounalaska Corporation on the island of Amaknak, \n     Alaska and to provide for the interpretation, for the \n     educational and inspirational benefit of present and future \n     generations, of the unique and significant circumstances \n     involving the history of the Aleut people, and the role of \n     the Aleut people and the Aleutian Islands in the defense of \n     the United States in World War II.\n\n     SEC. 3. BOUNDARIES.\n\n       The Aleutian World War II National Historic Area shall be \n     comprised of areas on Amaknak island depicted on the map \n     entitled ``Aleutian World War II National Historic Area''.\n\n     SEC. 4. TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall--\n       (a) authorize the conveyance of lands between the Ounalaska \n     Corporation and the U.S. Department of the Interior, nor \n     remove land or structures appurtenant to the land from the \n     exclusive control of the Ounalaska Corporation; or\n       (b) provide authority for the Department of the Interior to \n     assume the duties associated with the daily operation of the \n     Historic Area or any of its facilities or structures.\n\n     SEC. 5. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior may award grants and provide \n     technical assistance to the Ounalaska Corporation and the \n     City of Unalaska to assist with the planning, development, \n     and historic preservation from any program funds authorized \n     by law for technical assistance, land use planning or \n     historic preservation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1810. A bill to expand the boundary of the Snoqualmie National \nForest and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n     the snoqualmie national forest boundary adjustment act of 1996\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I am joined by junior Senator \nfrom Washington State, Mrs. Murray, in introducing the ``Snoqualmie \nNational Forest Boundary Adjustment Act of 1996.'' Earlier this week \nRepresentative Jennifer Dunn, of Washington State, introduced identical \nlegislation in the House.\n  This legislation will facilitate the exchange of land between the \nWeyerhaeuser Company and the Forest Service by adjusting a National \nForest Boundary. As Chairman of the Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee, which funds our National Forest and Parks, land exchanges \nresult in less expense to the Federal taxpayer than do land \nacquisitions.\n  I will be working over the course of the next few months to get this \nlegislation passed by both the House and Senate, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I fully support this landmark \nagreement negotiated by the Sierra Club's Cascade Checkerboard Project, \nthe Weyerhaeuser Company, and the Forest Service. I particularly \napplaud the Weyerhaeuser Company's donation of approximately 1,900 \nacres of land, 900 acres of which will become part of the Alpine Lakes \nWilderness Area.\n  This exchange will give Weyerhaeuser 7,200 acres of 80- to 100-year-\nold trees within the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest in Pierce \nCounty, WA, in exchange for 33,000 acres of company's land. \nEssentially, the company gets timber to cut now, and the public gets \nmuch more land upon which future forests will be grown. Both \nWeyerhaeuser and the Forest Service will also be better able to manage \ntheir lands as ecosystems and reduce costs and administrative burdens \nof checkerboard management.\n  I strongly support such negotiated trades. I believe it is in all of \nour interests to reduce the checkerboard pattern of ownership--which \nCongress created through a massive land grant to the Northern Pacific \nRailroad in 1864. I will continue to encourage cooperation between \npublic and private landowner, and environmental and timber interests. \nSuch agreements provide models for resolution of natural resources \ndisputes and other environmental issues.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to take expeditious action on this \nbill, which simply alters the boundary of Mount Baker-Snoqualmie \nNational Forest. The boundary change is needed before the exchange can \noccur. I thank my colleagues for any support they can give to their \nbipartisan, non-controversial bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MACK (for himself, Mr. Bradley, Mr. Roth, Mr. Lautenberg \n        and Mr. Biden):\n\n  S. 1811. A bill to amend the Act entitled ``An Act authorizing \nFederal participation in the cost of protecting the shores of publicly \nowned property'' to confirm and clarify the authority and \nresponsibility of the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief \nof Engineers, to promote and carry out shore protection projects, \nincluding beach nourishment projects, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                    The Shore Protection Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to announce legislation I am \nintroducing--along with Senator Bradley and others--to reaffirm the \nFederal role in beach preservation and renourishment. I want to thank \nthe Senator from New Jersey for his steadfast efforts on this issue and \nfor all he did to make this bill possible.\n  Mr. President, in my State of Florida, healthy beaches mean a healthy \neconomy. Each year, millions of people travel from around the world to \nenjoy the recreational benefits of my State's coastlines. This tourist \nactivity sustains our economy and provides hundreds of thousands of \njobs for Floridians. As a consequence, people in Florida care deeply \nabout the future of our beaches and look to us to ensure that they are \nproperly maintained.\n  For 60 years, Mr. President, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers worked \nin partnership with the Congress, the States, and coastal communities \nto devise a workable policy on sandy beach renourishment. The Corps \nbrought to this partnership a wealth of accumulated technical expertise \nand institutional knowledge about beach preservation. Further, they \nbrought funding which was leveraged with State and local participation \ninto projects which directly benefited the Nation's coastlines.\n  This all ended last year when the Clinton administration turned its \nback on coastal communities by ending the traditional Federal role in \nbeach renourishment. In its 1996 budget request, the administration \nindicated that beach preservation and maintenance was no longer of \nnational significance.\n  I strongly disagree. Almost half our population lives in or near \ncoastal communities. The coastal economy is responsible for one-third \nof our gross domestic product and more than 28 million jobs. Much of \nthis economic activity derives from the vacationtime\n\n[[Page S5587]]\n\nlure of healthy beaches. These projects truly are of national \nsignificance, Mr. President, and the Corps of Engineers ought to remain \na full partner in this effort.\n  Last year, I joined Senator Bradley and several of my colleagues in \ntwice writing the administration in protest. Further, we restored the \nCorps' authority through the appropriations process. This victory was \nonly short term, however, and coastal communities throughout the Nation \nasked Congress for assurance of a permanent Federal presence in this \nsector.\n  When the administration released this year's budget and again \nproposed to end the Corps' involvement in restoring beaches, we began \nto explore a permanent legislative solution to this problem. The \nculmination of our efforts is the bill we are introducing today.\n  Our legislation is very simple, Mr. President. We amend the mission \nof the Corps to include shore protection projects, and we mandate that \nthe Corps make recommendations to Congress on specific projects that \nare worthy of Federal participation. Further, we require the Corps to \nconsider benefits to the local and regional economy and ecology when \nconsidering preparing cost/benefit analyses on beach projects. And we \nencourage the Corps to work with the States and local communities on \nregional plans for the long-term preservation of our coastal resources.\n  Mr. President, this bill will ensure that the Federal Government \nremains a full partner with the States and communities on the \npreservation of our beach resources. This is critical to Florida and to \nour Nation's economy. I encourage my colleagues to join the Senator \nfrom New Jersey and me as we continue to move ahead on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1811\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Shore Protection Act of \n     1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the beach, shore, and coastal resources of the United \n     States--\n       (A) are critical assets that must be protected, conserved, \n     and restored; and\n       (B) provide economic and environmental benefits that are of \n     national significance;\n       (2) a network of healthy and nourished beaches is essential \n     to the economy, competitiveness in world tourism, and safety \n     of coastal communities of the United States;\n       (3)(A) the coasts of the United States are an economic \n     asset, supporting 34 percent of national employment, or \n     28,000,000 jobs; and\n       (B) the 413 coastal communities of the United States \n     generate $1,300,000,000,000, or \\1/3\\, of the gross domestic \n     product;\n       (4)(A) travel and tourism--\n       (i) is the second largest sector of the economy of the \n     United States; and\n       (ii) contributed over $746,000,000,000 to the gross \n     domestic product in 1995;\n       (B) the health of the beaches and shoreline of the United \n     States contributes to this economic benefit, since the \n     leading tourist destinations in the United States are \n     beaches; and\n       (C) 85 percent of all tourism-generated revenue in the \n     United States derives from coastal communities;\n       (5)(A) the value of the coastline of the United States lies \n     not only in the jobs and revenue that the coastline \n     generates, but also in the families, homes, and businesses \n     that the coastline protects from hurricanes, typhoons, and \n     tropical and extratropical storms;\n       (B) almost 50 percent of the total United States population \n     lives in coastal communities; and\n       (C) beaches provide protection to prevent the destruction \n     of life and hundreds of billions of dollars worth of \n     property;\n       (6) shoreline protection projects can provide ecological \n     and environmental benefits by providing for, or by restoring, \n     marine and littoral habitat;\n       (7)(A) the coastline of the United States is a national \n     treasure, visited by millions of Americans and foreign \n     tourists every year;\n       (B) over 90,000,000 Americans spend time boating or fishing \n     along the coast each year; and\n       (C) the average American spends 10 recreational days per \n     year on the coast; and\n       (8) since shoreline protection projects generate positive \n     economic, recreational, and environmental outcomes that \n     benefit the United States as a whole, Federal responsibility \n     for preserving this valuable resource should be maintained.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for a \n     Federal role in shore protection projects, including projects \n     involving the replacement of sand, for which the economic and \n     ecological benefits to the locality, region, or Nation exceed \n     the costs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Mack in \nintroducing a measure designed to provide for a continuing Federal role \nin protecting a valuable national resource--our Nation's coastline. The \nShore Protection Act of 1996 states clearly that the Federal Government \nhas an obligation to provide necessary support--both financial and \ntechnical--for projects that promote the protection, restoration and \nenhancement of sandy beaches and shorelines in cooperation with States \nand localities.\n  Beach, shore and coastal resources are critical to our economy and \nquality of life, but they are fragile and must be protected, conserved \nand restored. As a coastal State Senator, who walks the beaches of the \nJersey shore every year, I know first-hand the economic and \nrecreational benefits that are derived from healthy beaches. Every \nsummer, thousands of New Jerseyans and visitors from all over the U.S. \nand the world, visit the beaches of the Jersey shore, generating \nroughly $11 billion in travel and tourism revenues.\n  However, beaches are important not only to New Jersey's economy or to \nthose of other coastal communities, they are important to the Nation's \neconomy. Beaches support 28 million jobs, and coastal communities \ngenerate $1.3 trillion, or one-third, of the Gross National Product. \nTravel and tourism is the second largest sector of our economy, \ncontributing over $746 billion in 1995 and amounting to a $26 billion \ntrade surplus. Beaches are responsible for this economic boom. As the \nleading tourist destination in the U.S., coastlines generate 85 percent \nof tourism-related revenue. If we allow this valuable resource to \nsimply wash away, billions of dollars in beach related revenues will \ndisappear as well.\n  The value of our coastline lies not only in the jobs and revenue that \nthey generate, but also in the families, homes and business they \nprotect from hurricanes, nor'easters and tropical storms. With almost \n50% of all Americans living in our coastal communities, we simply must \nhave healthy beaches as our first line of defense. Nourished beaches \ncan also provide ecological and environmental benefits for certain \nspecies of wildlife by providing, or restoring, marine and littoral \nhabitat.\n  In 1995, the Administration proposed an end to the Federal role in \nshore protection projects. Citing budgetary concerns, the \nAdministration proposal called for Federal involvement in projects that \nwere of ``national significance'' only. This bill makes the case that \nthe preservation of an invaluable economic and environmental resource--\nour shoreline--is of national significance. Our bill would permit all \nthe local, regional and national economic and ecological benefits of a \nshoreline protection project to be considered when judging a project's \nmerit. I am confident this comprehensive evaluation will demonstrate \nthat shore protection projects are indeed of national significance.\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to outline the major provisions \nof the bill. Specifically, the bill would mandate a continuing Federal \nrole in shore protection projects. The bill changes the mission of the \nCorps from one of general authority to do beach projects to a specific \nmandate to undertake the protection, restoration and enhancement of \nbeaches in cooperation with states and local communities.\n  Additionally, the bill would require that new criteria be used in \nconducting the cost/benefit analysis of a proposed project. Currently, \nwhen undertaking cost/benefit analysis to determine the suitability of \nproposed projects, the Corps is only required to consider the property \nvalues of property directly adjacent to the beach. The Corps can take \ninto account revenues generated through recreation, but is not required \nto do so, nor can the recreational values be weighed as anything other \nthan an ``incidental'' benefit. This bill requires that the benefits to \nthe local, regional and national economy and the local, regional and \nnational ecology be considered. This comprehensive evaluation will \ndemonstrate that shore protection projects are of national \nsignificance.\n  The bill also requires that the Corps report annually to Congress on \nbeach project priorities.

A bill to provide for the liquidation or replication of \ncertain frozen concentrated orange juice entries to correct an error \nthat was made in connection with the original liquidation; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n     legislation to correct inequity suffered by juice farms, inc.\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today \nthat will order Customs to take the necessary steps to correct an \ninequity suffered by a Florida company, Juice Farms, Inc., resulting \nfrom a Customs administrative error arising from a dumping case.\n  From 1987 to 1990, several anti-dumping orders were issued covering \nBrazilian frozen concentrated orange juice. Juice Farms imported juice \nfrom Brazil and deposited duties with Customs. As required by law, \nliquidation of the import entries by Customs was suspended by Commerce \npending the outcome of administrative dumping reviews to be conducted \nby Commerce.\n  In 1991, after three successive reviews, the Department of Commerce \nfound no sales at less than fair value. Commerce instructed Customs to \nreturn Juice Farms' anti-dumping duty deposits plus interest. Juice \nFarms learned, however, that Customs had mistakenly liquidated a number \nof entries. Such liquidations were in clear violation of the suspension \norder.\n  Juice Farms pursued court challenges but received an unfavorable \ndecision because the court found that the company filed its protest of \nthe premature liquidations too late. Accordingly, even though the \nduties were required by law to be returned to Juice Farms, to date the \ndeposits have not been received. The legislation I propose today simply \nwill correct that error and require Customs to refund the funds \nproperly owed Juice Farms.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HELMS (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1813 A bill to reform the coastwise, intercoastal, and \nnoncontiguous trade shipping laws, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n              The Coastal shipping competition act of 1996\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, since 1920 there has been a Federal statute \nin force in America that, however well intentioned, has nonetheless \nprevented a vast segment of the farming community in North Carolina and \nother States from obtaining reasonably much-needed and priced grain \nfrom the Midwest.\n  In doing so, of course, it has long prevented Midwestern grain \nproducers from delivering grain to grain deficit States which \nrepeatedly experience difficulty in sustaining their livestock. North \nCarolina is one of the those States.\n  That is why I am today introducing S. 1813, the Coastal Shipping \nCompetition Act, which will eliminate a harmful anachronism that \nenables a few waterborne carriers to cling to a monopoly on shipping. \nThe victims of this system, in North Carolina and elsewhere, assert \naccurately that those shippers have no certified Jones Act ships to \nmeet the demands of producers who need the gain.\n  In fact, Mr. President, poultry and pork farmers in North Carolina \nsay they can't get enough grain for their farms to feed their animals. \nNorth Carolina cannot now, nor ever be able, to produce enough grain to \nsatisfy the urgent needs of the poultry and pork producers in North \nCarolina. As a result, they must rely upon grain shipped in from the \nMidwest. The railroads can't guarantee enough railcars to move this \ngrain from the Midwest, and the costs of such shipments as can be \narranged are enormous.\n  The increase in transportation costs, coupled with the price of \ngrain, inevitably leads to excessively high overhead costs for North \nCarolina farmers. To put it succinctly, the shortage of grains and \nshortage of trains means sharply elevated costs and prices that \nthreaten the livelihoods of many farmers.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters from two highly \nrespected North Carolina farmers, both of whom urge introduction and \npassage of this legislation, be printed in the Record at the conclusion \nof my remarks.\n   Mr. President, according to the most recent North Carolina \nDepartment of Agriculture statistics, North Carolina was, in 1995, No. \n1 in the Nation in turkey production with 61.2 million birds; in hog \nproduction, North Carolina was No. 2, with 8.3 million heads--Iowa was \nNo. 1--and in commercial broilers North Carolina was No. 4 with 644 \nmillion birds--Arkansas, Georgia, and Alabama ranked first, second, and \nthird.\n   Mr. President, this past Saturday an article in the May 18 edition \nof the Raleigh News and Observer, reported that 800 poultry jobs in \nChatham County, N.C., were threatened by, among other things, high-feed \ngrain prices. I ask unanimous consent that this article ``800 Perdue \nJobs in Danger'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n   Mr. President, additionally, in times of severe weather--such as \nthis past winter--railroads often are unable to get through mountain \npasses because of snow or flooding.\n   Mr. President, the Jones Act unfairly and unreasonably restricts \nshipping between ports in the United States because it requires that \nmerchandise and produce shipped by water between U.S. points be shipped \nonly on U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, U.S.-manned, and U.S.-citizen owned \nvessels specifically documented and authorized by the Coast Guard for \nsuch shipments.\n  But, Mr. President, the problem with that is that not nearly enough \ncertified vessels exist to transport grain to farmers in North Carolina \nand other States. As a matter of fact, my farmers are now being forced \nto go to foreign sources for feed grain.\n  Last year, according to a report in the September 12, 1995, Journal \nof Commerce, Murphy family farms brought in a cargo shipment of 1 \nmillion bushels of Canadian wheat to the port of Wilmington, NC, aboard \nCanada steamship lines.\n   Mr. President, the Jones Act is simply not fair. It's not fair to \nfarmers in the Midwest and it is unfair to countless producers in my \nown State and in other States.\n\n  Those who may protest this legislation are likely to claim that it \nwill somehow destroy American shipping. That simply is not so. \nMoreover, if the status quo is maintained, my farmers will have no \nchoice but to purchase their foreign grain from Canada, Argentina, and \nother countries--and all of it will be shipped on foreign flagged \nvessels.\n  According to a December 1995 report by the U.S. International Trade \nCommission,\n\n       The economy wide effect of removing the Jones Act is a U.S. \n     economic welfare gain of approximately $2.8 billion. This \n     figure can also be interpreted as the annual reduction in \n     real national income imposed by the Jones Act. A primary \n     reason for the large gain in welfare is a decline of \n     approximately 26 percent in the price of shipping services \n     formerly restricted by the Jones Act.\n\n  Mr. President, isn't it ironic that the United States--the \nbreadbasket of the world--has such an unwise and unfair lid on that \nbread basket? That lid, Mr. President, is the Jones Act.\n  That is my reason for offering this legislative remedy, Mr. \nPresident. If Senators truly believe in the free enterprise system, \nthey will support this proposal to allow American grain to be shipped \nunhindered to grain deficit States that are in need of it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1813\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Coastal Shipping Competition \n     Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Jesse Helms,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: I am writing to urge you to introduce \n     and sponsor the Coastal Shipping Competition Act--Legislation \n     that I believe would bring much needed, yet fair reform to \n     our nation's antiquated maritime transportation laws.\n       North Carolina consumes in its animal and poultry \n     production businesses far more grain and oilseed meals than \n     our North Carolina farmers are able to produce. Thus far, we \n     have relied upon rail transportation originating in the \n     ``Eastern Grain Belt'' states to augment local supplies. As \n     our demand increases, we will likely continue to use rail \n     transportation as our primary source of grains and oilseed \n     meals from production areas outside North Carolina. However, \n     we are beginning to experience the symptoms of over taxing \n     the capacity of the rail corridors that serve us. \n     Additionally, realization of the risks inherent in relying \n     too heavily on a single source of dry bulk transport to feed \n     live animals and poultry is becoming far too real when we \n     have had major service interruptions on at least three \n     occasions since early December 1995.\n       We believe that the only other viable transportation source \n     to supply our needs is via water. Yet, after some five years \n     of diligent effort, the only reasonably competitive cargo \n     that we have been able to procure via water has been foreign \n     cargoes delivered to the port of Wilmington on foreign \n     vessels. This seems illogical to us because we know that the \n     United States is the most efficient and largest producer of \n     grains and oilseed meals in the world and that our country \n     serves as the world's repository of supply of these \n     invaluable resources.\n       Why can't we access these domestic supplies via water? We \n     believe that a major impediment lies within the constraints \n     imposed upon us and others by the Merchant Marine Act of \n     1920, more commonly known as the Jones Act. Legislation to \n     reform the Jones Act is desperately needed to help rebuild a \n     viable, competitive United States domestic shipping industry \n     and to enhance the competitive position of ours and other \n     American agricultural producers and businesses. I believe \n     that without this legislation we will experience the not so \n     gradual erosion of the economic viability of our existing \n     capital asset base and likewise the economic demise of many \n     of our good citizens and business persons who depend upon the \n     animal and poultry production industry of North Carolina for \n     their livelihoods.\n       As a member of the business community and a farmer from \n     your district, I assure you that this is an issue of utmost \n     importance and one that merits your attention and support.\n       Thank you for your time and effort and please let me know \n     if I may be of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Wendell H. Murphy,\n     Chairman and CEO.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    Goldsboro Milling Company,\n\n                                      Goldsboro, NC, May 21, 1996.\n       Dear Senator Helms: Let me start by thanking you for all \n     you have done in the past in support of agri-business in this \n     country. Your support has meant a great deal to all of us.\n       I'm also writing you today to ask you to introduce and \n     support the Coastal Shipping Competition Act--legislation \n     that would bring much needed reform to our nation's \n     antiquated maritime transportation laws.\n       These laws negatively affect thousands of businesses across \n     America every day because the laws have eliminated \n     competitive deepwater domestic waterbourne transportation for \n     essential manufacturing inputs and finished products.\n       The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (known as the Jones Act) \n     has had an ironically anti-American impact. While it may have \n     been originally written to protect the U.S. shipping \n     industry, the resulting noncompetitive domestic industry is \n     sparsely available, if at all in many U.S. locations. Not a \n     single coastal freighter over 1,000 tons is operating on the \n     entire 2,000 mile East Coast of the United States.\n       Those of us in the poultry and hog business on the East \n     Coast really need an alternative transportation option for \n     our inputs (such as grain) because the infrastructure of the \n     railroads is getting critically overloaded. However, being \n     restricted to using a U.S. owned, operated and manned ship \n     effectively eliminates the possibility of getting inputs \n     delivered by water to east coast ports.\n       Legislation to reform the Jones Act is desperately needed \n     to help build the competitive position of American businesses \n     and agricultural producers.\n       As a member of the business community in North Carolina, I \n     can assure you this is an issue that merits your attention \n     and support. Thanks for all that you have already done and \n     for your consideration on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  J.L Maxwell, Jr.\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the News & Observer, May 18, 1996]\n\n                       800 Perdue Jobs in Danger\n\n                             (By Jay Price)\n\n       Siler City.--Perdue Farms announced Friday that it will \n     padlock its Chatham County chicken processing plant unless \n     the plant can be sold within 60 days, placing the future of \n     800 workers in doubt and sending shock waves through the \n     local economy.\n       The company, which has headquarters in Salisbury, Md., \n     blamed the move on high feed costs and a glutted chicken \n     market. ``Hopefully, we'll find a buyer, and if we don't \n     we'll make the workers aware of job opportunities at other \n     Perdue facilities,'' said company spokesman Richard Auletta \n     in New York.\n       The news from one of Chatham County's largest employers \n     cast a pall over the annual Siler City Chicken Festival, \n     which begins today.\n\n[[Page S5593]]\n\n       ``I've worked here a long time,'' said Frank Torres, a \n     Perdue employee since 1985. ``I don't know what happened. I \n     can't do nothing new. Now all everybody's got is one piece of \n     paper and a check. I don't know what will happen.''\n       Torres said that Friday morning, employees were given a \n     letter in Spanish and English outlining the company's plans.\n       Perdue said employment at a 28-worker feed mill in Staley \n     also will be scaled back, and the operation may later be \n     closed.\n       Also affected are 118 growers who raise chickens for Perdue \n     under contract, mostly in Chatham and Randolph counties. Only \n     30 of those will continue to raise birds for the company, \n     which will process them at other plants.\n       The company said it will try to arrange for the remaining \n     growers to work with other poultry companies in the area.\n       Perdue said the plant workers, most of whom earn $7 to \n     $7.10 an hour, can apply for jobs at other plants, but the \n     closest ones are in Robbins and Concord, a considerable \n     distance away by car.\n       About noon Friday, workers dressed in jeans, work boots and \n     hard hats trickled solemnly out of the yellow brick plant and \n     into a gravel parking lot. Many, like Torres, are migrant \n     workers from Mexico who made their way to Chatham County in \n     search of stability.\n       Domingo Gonzales, 28 years old and the father of two, has \n     been at the plant for only three months.\n       ``I don't know what I'll do,'' he said, noting that he has \n     been working at odd jobs in the United States for nearly nine \n     years and was hoping to finally settle down. ``Maybe I'll go \n     back to Mexico.''\n       The fate of many workers like Torres and Gonzales may \n     depend on complex business forces over which they have no \n     control.\n       Besides record-high feed prices Perdue cited a recent jump \n     in fuel costs and an abundance of poultry, beef and pork as \n     major reasons for the decision.\n       Producers are paying an estimated 40 percent more for feed \n     than they did a year ago, and are getting lower prices for \n     their products, said Dr. Tom Carter, a poultry specialist \n     with the N.C. Cooperative Extensive Service.\n       ``It's an unusual situation with the grain prices so \n     high,'' Carter said. ``The cost of production is higher than \n     the market, and that's because of high corn prices.''\n       Carter, however, was optimistic that another company would \n     buy the 61,000-square-foot plant, which can process 625,000 \n     birds a week.\n       ``Very seldom does a facility like that go without a \n     buyer,'' Carter said. ``On the surface, it looks like the \n     situation is such that people wouldn't want to buy it, but if \n     you look beneath the surface, you usually get the best buy \n     when the price is down.''\n       Growers also may be able to sell birds elsewhere, Carter \n     said. Townsend, Golden Poultry and Mount Aire have poultry \n     processing plants in Siler City, Sanford and Bonlee, \n     respectively, Carter said.\n       ``Eventually, growers will adjust and move in with other \n     companies,'' Carter said, ``but it may take longer than some \n     can adjust their finances for.''\n       Growers work under contract to processors like Perdue. The \n     processor owns the chickens, so in this case the farmers \n     won't get stuck with the birds. But they could get stuck with \n     big investments in chicken houses, which cost about $120,000. \n     The average farmer in the area has three houses, said Dr. \n     Glenn Carpenter, a Pittsboro extension agent specializing in \n     poultry. Some older houses may have cost just a few thousand \n     dollars, he said.\n       Many growers raise chickens part-time. Typically, it's a \n     family affair employing between one and three people, but \n     some operations are larger and full-time.\n       The plant was one of a group of processing facilities that \n     Perdue bought from Showell Farms in January 1995. Its \n     products are sold mostly to institutional users such as \n     schools, hospitals and restaurants.\n\n\n                             mixed signals\n\n       In recent months, signs were that it was prospering. \n     Olivier Devaud, director of Chatham's Economic Development \n     Commission, said the plant had been hiring workers since \n     announcing in December that it needed 150 more. In the past \n     year Perdue spent $4 million for new equipment at the plant \n     and $1 million on an expansion, which was still under way \n     when Friday's announcement came.\n       Other signals were more ominous. In March, Perdue--the \n     nation's No. 2 poultry producer--said it would cut production \n     by 7 percent, but that it didn't plan layoffs. Other large \n     poultry firms, including Tyson, Hudson Foods Inc. and \n     Pilgrims Pride Corp., had already announced similar cuts.\n       Poultry and eggs make up the most lucrative agricultural \n     industry in the state, said Kim Decker of the state \n     Agriculture Department. In 1994, the most recent year for \n     which statistics were available, poultry and eggs earned \n     farmers $1.9 billion, he said.\n       In contrast, revenue from hogs was $980 million and from \n     tobacco, $943 million. Statewide, the industry employs more \n     than 27,000 people.\n\n\n                            major job source\n\n       The plant is Chatham's third largest employer. Devaud said \n     its closing would be a blow to the local economy. But new \n     companies and expansions are expected to bring 120 new jobs \n     to Siler City in the next month alone, and the county's \n     unemployment rate is just 2.7 percent.\n       Devaud said he hopes that Townsend, the county's biggest \n     employer, can eventually hire some of the workers at its \n     chicken processing plant.\n       One who might be looking is Steven Garner, who landed a job \n     loading trucks at the Perdue plant three weeks ago. He was \n     angry Friday.\n       ``That's 800 people,'' he said between puffs of a \n     cigarette.\n       ``I've got a family. I'm the one who buys the groceries and \n     pays the bills. It's going to be really hard.''\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRAMM (for himself, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Bryan, and Ms. \n        Moseley-Braun):\n  S. 1815. A bill to provide for improved regulation of the securities \nmarkets, eliminate excess securities fees, reduce the costs of \ninvesting, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n            THE SECURITIES INVESTMENT PROMOTION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators D'Amato, \nDodd, Bryan, and Moseley-Braun in introducing the Securities Investment \nPromotion Act of 1996. This is important legislation incorporating \nreforms supported by business and by State and Federal Securities \nregulators.\n  This legislation moves forward in a significant way to define a \ndivision of labor between the State and Federal governments for the \nsupervision of the securities industry. In the process two very \nimportant goals are achieved. We improve administration of our nation's \nsecurities laws while at the same time greatly reducing the cost of \nthat regulation.\n  We must always remember that the cost of securities regulation, \nhowever desirable or effective that regulation may be, is ultimately \nborn by the people who invest. Today, that includes almost everyone. \nNot everyone may have a stock portfolio, although an increasing number \nof American families do. But most Americans have investments in a \nmutual fund or have a stake in a pension fund that invests in our \nnation's securities markets. More and more small businesses are funding \ntheir growth, expansion, and job creation with financing from the \nsecurities markets.\n  When I became Chairman of the Securities Subcommittee, I was struck \nby the number of State and Federal regulators, and people in the \nsecurities business, as well as investors, who commented on the need to \nreform out-of-date and unnecessary securities regulation. The most \nimmediate need in that regard the Congress addressed last year, with \nour bill to reform securities litigation. That was a measured, \nbipartisan effort.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today is a continuation of \nthat bipartisan spirit. I am proud to be joined by the Chairman of the \nBanking Committee, Senator D'Amato, as well as by the Ranking Member of \nthe Securities Subcommittee, Senator Dodd, together with Senators Bryan \nand Moseley-Braun of the Banking Committee. We have all worked closely \nin drafting the bill that we are introducing, and have in addition \nbenefited from comments and suggestions from the SEC, State securities \nregulators, trade associations, the stock exchanges, and self-\nregulatory organizations, among others. I invite further comments as we \nconsider this bill in the Committee and then on the floor of the \nSenate. I have intentionally sought to cast the net wide in seeking \ncomment from the public on this legislation, since, ultimately, what we \ndo in this bill affects the people of this country in very important \nways.\n  Mr. President, I would like to comment briefly on some of the key \nprovisions of the bill.\n  Title I of the bill is called the Investment Advisers Integrity Act. \nIt is an updated version of a bill that I introduced on the first day \nof the 104th Congress, S. 148. There are approximately 25,000 \nregistered investment advisers in the nation today, and the number \nkeeps growing. The SEC has testified that they do not have the \nresources to supervise effectively such a large number of advisers. In \nthe past, proposals were put forward to increase SEC funding for \nenforcement of the Investment Adviser Act of 1940 by assessing a $16 \nmillion tax on the industry. Even with such a tax, however, an \ninvestment adviser could have gone several years without an inspection.\n\n[[Page S5594]]\n\n  Title I of the bill tries a different approach, first suggested to me \nby former SEC Commissioner Rick Roberts. This approach addresses the \nproblem through a partnership between the Federal and State securities \nregulators, dividing up the responsibility. The States would have \nexclusive jurisdiction to register investment advisers who manage less \nthan $25 million in client assets. These are the investment advisers \nwhose activities are most likely to be within their home State. In \nfact, about half of all investment advisers do not personally manage \nany client assets at all.\n  The SEC would have exclusive responsibility for registration of \ninvestment advisers who manage $25 million or more of client assets, as \nwell as for all investment advisors to mutual funds. These are the \ninvestment advisers most likely to be engaged in interstate commerce, \nappropriately a Federal concern.\n  I would add, Mr. President, that this provision does not impose a \nFederal mandate on the States, for under the provisions of the bill, \nany State that did not want to assume the responsibility for \nregistration of investment advisers is not required to do so. The \nadvisers in such a State would then be required to register with the \nSEC, regardless of the size of their business.\n  The effect of this division of responsibility will be that between \ntwo-thirds and three-quarters of investment advisers will be supervised \nby the States where they do their business. On the other hand, perhaps \nas much as two-thirds or more of the assets under management will be \nmanaged by investment advisers supervised by the SEC, demonstrating the \nconcentration of managed assets in the hands of the larger investment \nadvisers, having multi-state operations.\n  I would like to express my appreciation to the representatives of the \ninvestment adviser industry, the SEC, and the Texas State Securities \nCommissioner, Denise Crawford, for their assistance in revising and \ncrafting this title of the bill, and the support that they have \nexpressed for this approach. Whereas today investment adviser \nsupervision is limited at best, and more often than not effectively \nnon-existent, this division of labor will mean that adequate resources \nand attention can not be brought to bear to encourage the integrity of \nthe industry and further increase the investment opportunities for \nAmerican families.\n  Mr. President, perhaps the most significant impact of this bill will \ncome from the provisions assigning responsibility for mutual fund \nprospectuses review to the SEC. Mutual funds spend tens of millions of \ndollars each year complying with a patchwork of varied and \noften conflicting State requirements governing the prospectuses by \nwhich funds are offered to investors. These requirements are merely \ndifferent, usually duplicative, and to not provide investors with any \nadded useful information than what is already required by the SEC. \nMoreover, complying with these requirements is time consuming. In just \none example, while a particular mutual fund was awaiting delays in \nclearing its prospectus with a certain State regulator, its value \nincreased by 16%. That was a 16% growth denied to the investors of that \nState who could not place funds with the mutual fund until its \nprospectus had cleared the State regulators. No investor was helped by \nthat delay. The mutual fund industry has dramatically increased the \ninvestment opportunities for American families of all levels of income, \nand I am please to further the efforts of my colleagues, Congressmen \nFields and Bliley, to move forward this important relief from \nunnecessary regulatory burden.\n\n  Similarly, stocks that are traded on the national stock exchange and \ntrading systems would be exempted from State regulation under the \nprovisions of this bill. Again, as with mutual funds, this is a \nnational business, the very kind of activity contemplated by the \nFounding Fathers with the interstate commerce clause of the Commission.\n  One of the provisions of the bill, which I consider of high \nimportance, is a requirement that the Chief Economist of the SEC \nconduct and publish an economic analysis of each new regulation before \nthe regulation can enter into effect. Mr. President, the SEC is a \nlawyer-heavy agency. The Officer of General Counsel, for example, has a \nbudget of over $10 million and 120 staff members. By comparison, the \nOffice of Economic Analysis, even with the increase required by my \namendment to the appropriation bill, has a budget of $3 million and \nabout two dozen employees.\n  The actions of the SEC in regulating the nation's capital markets \nhave a profound impact on the economy of the nation and of the world. \nIt is therefore of paramount importance that a high priority be given \nwithin the SEC to careful examination and analysis of the economic and \nmarket consequences of its regulations. Otherwise, we are in danger of \nregulating blindly, which the economic livelihood and health of the \nnation cannot risk.\n  While there are many other important provisions of the bill, I will \nconclude, Mr. President, by emphasizing the last section of the bill. \nThis provision addresses the need for improving the access to U.S. \nstock exchanges for the listing of world-class foreign companies. \nToday, U.S. accounting standards are in many points different from the \naccounting standards of other countries. They are not necessarily \nbetter, just different. Under current regulations, a foreign company \nwishing to list on a U.S. stock exchange would first have to meet U.S. \naccounting standards, which in effect may mean that the company would \nhave to keep two sets of books.\n  The SEC has sought to address this problem through a greater \nharmonization of international accounting standards. The bill \nencourages the SEC to redouble its efforts to achieve a level of \ngenerally accepted accounting standards and to report to the Congress \non its progress.\n  Our nation's stock exchanges are the preeminent exchanges in the \nworld. It is hard to see how we can continue that position long into \nthe next century while maintaining formidable obstacle to the listing \non our exchanges of the major corporations of the world. I do not see \nhow any American investor is protected by being forced to resort to the \nLondon or Frankfurt stock exchanges in order to invest in foreign \ncorporations.\n  Mr. President, this is important legislation. Congressman Jack Fields \nand the members of the House Commerce Committee have done the country a \ngreat service by setting in motion a process by which the Congress will \nbegin to delineate clearly the roles of the State and Federal \ngovernments in securities regulation. I hope that this bill can be \nadopted in short order and meet in conference with similar legislation \nrecently adopted unanimously by the House Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Securities Investment Promotion Act of 1996\n\n     SECTION 1.

Promoting Preeminence of American Securities \n                   Markets\n\n       Expresses the sense of the Congress that the SEC should \n     reinforce its efforts in developing generally accepted \n     international accounting standards in order to enhance the \n     ability of foreign corporations to list their stocks on U.S. \n     exchanges, and requires the SEC to report to Congress in one \n     year on its progress.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, it is with great enthusiasm that I rise \ntoday with my colleagues, the chairman and ranking member of the \nSecurities Subcommittee, Senator Gramm and Senator Dodd, and Senators \nBryan and Moseley-Braun to introduce the Securities Investment \nPromotion Act of 1996.\n  The U.S. securities market is the preeminent market in the world. It \nis a fair, efficient and orderly market. In 1995, the U.S. equity \nmarket capitalization of $7.98 trillion represented nearly half of the \n$16.48 worldwide equity market. The market is at an all time high, \nhaving increased in trading volume 168 percent in the last decade from \n77.3 billion to 207.4 billion. Clearly our securities market is a \nnational treasure.\n  This bill my colleagues and I introduce today represents a bi-\npartisan effort to improve regulation of the securities market. The \nlegislation seeks to maintain our preeminent securities market by \nmaking it even more efficient and more accessible to those individuals \nand entities who seek entry in order to raise capital.\n  The legislation streamlines securities regulation by peeling back \nlayers of duplicative, unnecessary and burdensome regulation--opening \nup the capital markets and promoting capital formation. It makes more \nefficient use of precious State and Federal resources by dividing \nrather duplicating regulatory responsibility. These changes will also \nstrengthen consumer and investor protection.\n\n\n                          investment advisers\n\n  The Securities Investment Promotion Act fills a significant \nregulatory gap in the area of investment advisers. As low interest \nrates have caused individuals to flock to the securities markets with \ntheir savings and retirement money--often seeking advice from an \ninvestment adviser--it becomes increasingly critical for Congress to \nensure that investment advisers are adequately regulated. The increase \nin mutual fund investments, which are usually managed by investment \nadvisers, has also contributed to the growing number of investment \nadvisers.\n  Right now, 22,000 investment advisers manage approximately $10.6 \ntrillion in assets. The SEC does not have sufficient resources to \nmaintain an adequate inspection program for investment advisers. \nAccording to some SEC estimates, they are only able to inspect some of \nthe smaller investment advisers once every 30 years.\n  The bill creates a rational system of regulation for investment \nadvisers by dividing between the SEC and the States responsibility for \nregulating investment advisers. States will regulate the smaller \ninvestment advisers who operate in their State and manage $25 million \nor less in assets. The SEC will regulate the larger advisers. This \nsystem will enable the States and the SEC to share regulatory \nresponsibility--better protecting investors.\n\n\n                              mutual funds\n\n  The Securities Investment Promotion Act of 1996 facilitates the \nregistration, operation and certain disclosures made by mutual funds. \nOver 30 million U.S. households, or about 31 percent now own mutual \nfunds. In part because of low interest rates, by the end of last year \nmutual fund assets hit the $2.7 trillion mark--exceeding bank deposits \nfor the first time.\n  This bill allows the mutual fund market to operate as a national \nmarket, comprehensively regulated by the SEC. Right now, when a mutual \nfund registers its shares it must register with the SEC and the States. \nAs a result, mutual funds must comply with a\n\n[[Page S5596]]\n\ncrazy quilt of regulation imposed by the laws of each of the 50 States. \nThis bill facilitates mutual fund registration by eliminating the \nrequirement that mutual funds register with the States.\n  The bill makes it easier for mutual funds to provide current \ninformation in advertisements; calculate their registration fees and \ninvest in other mutual funds in their family of funds. It also provides \nadditional consumer and investor protection by giving the SEC authority \nto prohibit mutual funds from naming their funds in a manner that could \nmislead or confuse investors.\n\n\n                           capital formation\n\n  The bill promotes capital formation by eliminating overlapping State \nand Federal requirements for registering certain types of securities, \nsuch as securities sold to ``qualified purchasers'' or securities that \nare listed on a national securities exchange or market system. It also \ngives the SEC flexibility to identify other exchanges or systems that \nshould qualify for the exemption from registration.\n  The bill promotes investment in small projects and business by making \nit easier for economic, business, and industrial development companies \nto raise money without having to register with the SEC. These companies \nwill not have to register their securities if 80 percent or more of the \nsecurities are sold to accredited investors within the State the \ncompany operates. This bill provides further relied for companies \noperating within one State. The SEC may now exempt from the securities \nlaws a company with $100,000 in assets that is operating within a \nState. The Securities Investment Promotion Act of 1996 raises this \nlevel to $10 million.\n  The bill provides liquidity and investment opportunities to business \ndevelopment companies--enabling these companies to invest more capital \nin small businesses. It also helps venture capitalists tap the capital \nmarkets to fund business endeavors by allowing individuals and entities \nto pool a certain amount of investment funds without having to register \nwith the SEC.\n\n\n                        regulatory modernization\n\n  The legislation updates the securities laws to reflect the reality of \ntoday's marketplace. It simplifies certain procedures for paying fees \nand making disclosures. It gives the SEC flexibility to adapt to the \nchanging financial market by giving the SEC authority to exempt \ntransactions, individuals or entities from the Federal securities laws.\n  The bill fosters awareness of the cost of regulation by requiring the \nSEC to publish an economic analysis of a proposed regulation before it \nbecomes effective. It also reduces the costs associated with revolving \ndoor compliance examinations, where one regulator completes its \nexamination only to be replaced by the next. The legislation requires \nthe regulators to coordinate examinations.\n  The Securities Investment Promotion Act of 1996 is a significant \npiece of legislation that will ensure that the U.S. securities market \nremains number one in the world. It is not a controversial bill, it \nenjoys support on both sides of the aisle. This bill thoughtfully and \ncarefully tightens the laws governing the securities market. I commend \nmy colleagues and their staff for their excellent work in drafting this \nlegislation and plan to move it quickly through the Banking Committee.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Gramm, \nD'Amato, Bryan, and Moseley-Braun in introducing the Securities \nInvestment Promotion Act of 1996.\n  The U.S. capital markets are vitally important for the good economic \nhealth not only of virtually every American company but for millions \nand millions of individual investors who have placed some of their \nassets either directly in securities or, as has become more and more \ncommon, into mutual funds.\n  We must recognize that sustained economic growth is heavily dependent \nupon the continuing ability of our capital markets and financial \nservices industry to function efficiently and with integrity. If \ncompanies find impediments to obtaining capital, they will not grow. If \nindividuals find impediments to their access to securities and other \ninvestments, they will not save. Taking steps to enhance the access of \nboth corporations and individuals to the securities markets is a \nprudent means by which Congress can help sustain or even increase the \nNation's rate of economic growth.\n  Furthermore, the American capital markets are the envy of the world. \nNo other nation enjoys the international reputation of our capital \nmarkets and it is necessary for Congress periodically to review and \nmodernize, where necessary, the laws that make our markets and our \nfinancial services industry the world's leader.\n  The legislation that is being introduced today is the culmination of \na lengthy bipartisan effort to reform those aspects of the securities \nlaws that are an outdated impediment to the efficient functioning of \nthe securities industry. The bill will also provide clearer statutory \ndirectives to both state and Federal regulators so that the integrity \nof--and confidence in--our capital markets and financial services \nindustry is enhanced.\n  Mr. President, let me provide a brief summary of the major elements \nof this legislation. The three main areas that the bill addresses are: \nimproving the regulation of investment advisors under the Investment \nAdvisors Act of 1940; modernizing and streamlining the regulation of \nmutual funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940; and, making \nmodest adjustments in the securities laws to account for changes in the \nfinancial world over the past 60 years.\n  Title I, the Investment Advisors Integrity Act, would provide much \nneeded clarity to regulators for the regulation of investment advisors \nunder the Investment Advisors Act of 1940. The most important feature \nof this title is to draw a clear, bright line between those registered \ninvestment advisors who should be regulated at the Federal level by the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, and those advisors who are more \nproperly regulated by the state that is the advisor's principal place \nof business.\n  The bill would require investment advisors with more than $25 million \nunder management to be regulated by the Securities and Exchange \ncommission, while those with assets under the $25 million threshold \nwould be regulated by the state.\n  This bifurcation is necessary because it is not realistic to expect \nthe SEC to be able to thoroughly supervise the more than 25,000 \nadvisors who are registered under the IAA nor is it reasonable to have \nthe advisor industry burdened by duplicative state and Federal \nregulation. This change will allow the state and Federal regulators to \nfocus on those parts of the industry that is within their regulatory \nexpertise, while freeing the industry from the burden of duplicative \nlayers of regulation.\n  The second title of the bill is entitled Facilitating Investment in \nMutual Funds. While most of my colleagues are aware of the rapid growth \nin the mutual fund industry, I wonder how many are aware that nearly \none out of every three American families has money invested, in some \nform or another, in mutual funds. Mutual funds, as of 1995, have \nslightly more than $2 trillion dollars under management, with $800 \nbillion coming from individual investors and $1.2 trillion coming from \ninstitutional investors.\n  The significantly increasing importance of the mutual fund industry \nled to a lengthy review by the Securities and Exchange Commission in \n1992, entitled ``Protecting Investors: A Half-Century of Investment \nCompany Regulation,'' which made recommendations for modernizing of the \nInvestment Company Act of 1940. The last time Congress revised the ICA \nwas in 1970, and many believe that it is approriate--a quarter century \nlater--for Congress to take a fresh look at the issue of modernization.\n  Several of the mutual fund provisions of the legislation being \nintroduced today were originally proposed by the SEC in their 1992 \nreport. Other suggestions have been forthcoming since that report and \nrepresent a careful balance between the need to make the Investment \nCompany Act fit the mutual fund industry as it exists today, without \nsacrificing any investor protection.\n  This section of the bill contains two major components: the first is \nto eliminate unnecessary state regulation of mutual funds, while \npreserving the state's authority to investigate for fraud and other \ntypes of wrongdoing. Mutual funds are highly regulated by the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission through the Investment Company\n\n[[Page S5597]]\n\nAct of 1940; in fact, this is one of the most successfully regulated \nindustries in America, borne out by the explosive growth in mutual \nfunds since the Act was passed. In 1940, there were 105 registered \ncompanies with $2 billion in assets (according to the SEC); today, as I \nmentioned above, there are more than 5,300 funds holding over $2 \ntrillion in assets.\n  The very success of SEC regulation has rendered most individual state \nregulations obsolete, not to mention that complying with these \nduplicative statutes is both expensive and burdensome on the industry. \nThe costs of this regulatory burden are passed onto consumers. The \nlegislation we are introducing today will preempt most state regulation \nof mutual funds, while preserving the state's necessary ability to \nprotect consumers through anti-fraud and other statutes.\n  Another area that will be modernized through adoption of this \nlegislation will be in the area of smaller funds whose investors are \neither wealthy individuals--defined in the bill as those with more than \n$5 million in investments--and institutional investors. These funds, \nwhich are exempt from many of the provisions of the Investment Company \nAct of 1940 because of their smaller size and unique nature, often \nprovide critically needed capital directly to new corporations and \ngenerally to America's emerging industries. By modestly expanding the \npool of people and institutions eligible to participate in such funds, \nthe legislation seeks to expand the amount of capital available for \ninvestment, particularly newer, small and moderate sized companies.\n  There are also enhanced mutual fund disclosure requirements \nbenefiting investors that we are continuing to develop, and I would \nanticipate that if and when this bill goes to mark-up, they will be \nadded to the legislation.\n  The last title of the bill contains a number of provisions that \nattempt to remove anomalies that have developed within the securities \nlaws as the financial world has changed over the last sixty years. \nThese changes, while modest in and of themselves, will nevertheless \nprovide significant and needed relief to both investors and industry.\n  In all, Mr. President, this is an extremely balanced and thoughtful \nbill that has been drafted in close consultation with the Securities \nand Exchange Commission and the North American Securities \nAdministrators Association, the umbrella group for the fifty state \nsecurities administrators. It has been written in bipartisan manner \nthat is increasingly rare in this body, and as a result, the bill \nprovides statutory reform that is needed by investors, corporations and \nthe financial services industry without sacrificing any consumer \nprotections. I hope that the Senate will move expeditiously to pass \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to sign on as a co-sponsor of \nthe Securities Investment Promotion Act of 1996. This comprehensive \neffort to modernize our regulation of the capital markets will help us \nachieve the most efficient possible regulatory scheme, while preserving \ninvestor confidence in our markets by maintaining needed investor \nprotection safeguards.\n  I come to this issue believing that our capital formation process is \nfundamentally sound. America's capital markets are the fairest, most \nsuccessful, and the most liquid the world has ever known. By virtually \nevery statistical measure, our capital markets are vibrant and healthy. \nThe stock market has been setting new records for some time now and is \nin the midst of the longest run in this century. This has been an \nunprecedented boom for companies, investors and Wall Street firms.\n  The manner in which we reform our regulation of securities is \nimportant because tens of millions of Americans increasingly rely on \nour nation's financial markets to save for retirement, fund their \nchildren's college education, and to receive a rate of return on \nsavings that exceeds the rate of inflation. Today, more than ever, the \npeople of America are investing in America. For the first time in \nhistory, mutual fund assets exceed the deposits of the commercial \nbanking system.\n  The growth in the mutual fund industry has been nothing short of \nphenomenal. Today, there are 2,222 stock funds, 2,576 bond and fixed-\nincome funds, plus another 1,000 money-market funds, according to the \nInvestment Company Institute. In fact, there are now twice as many \nmutual funds--with a value of around $2.8 trillion--as stocks listed on \nthe New York Stock Exchange. The reason for this huge expansion of \nfunds may be summed up in one word: demand. Funds continue to roll off \nthe assembly line because investors want more avenues in which to put \ntheir money.\n  Investors are attracted to mutual funds because the market has \nremained generally trouble-free and because of its relative safety. \nWhile much of the credit for this environment should go to go to the \nindustry itself, so too should credit go to an effective system of \nregulation. In our enthusiasm for updating and modernizing the \noversight of this marketplace, care must be taken to maintain vital \ninvestor protections that have helped this industry grow and prosper.\n  Our securities laws and regulations are designed first and foremost \nto protect investors and to maintain the integrity of the marketplace, \nthereby promoting trust and confidence in our system of capital \nformation. We should strive for a securities regulatory system that is \ntough--but one that also is fair and reasonable.\n  On balance, I believe that this legislation does a good job of \neliminating or modernizing laws and regulations that either are \nduplicative or outdated--without sacrificing investor protection. \nHowever, I also recognize that the introduction of this bill is just \nthe first step in a longer process and that further fine tuning and \nrevisions will be in order as we learn more about the practical effect \nof several of its specific provisions. I have decided to sign on as a \nco-sponsor despite the reservations I have about specific provisions \ncontained in the bill. I will seek out the comments and views of \nfederal and state regulators, industry representatives, and investor \nadvocates on these matters.\n  I would like to take just a few minutes to briefly highlight a few \nkey provisions of this legislation:\n  More rational investment adviser oversight. This bill seeks to \nrationalize the regulatory scheme for investment advisers. Over the \nlast decade, both the House of Representatives and the Senate have held \nnumerous hearings in which we have been told that our system of \ninvestment adviser regulation is woefully inadequate, both in terms of \nthe resources we devote to the effort and the laws that govern the \nindustry. Today, we take a modest first step in the effort to establish \na credible program of investment adviser oversight. While I applaud the \nsensible approach contained in this bill, it is my hope that Congress \ndoes not end its consideration of this issue here.\n\n  This bill will direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to focus \non the biggest investment advisers--those who manage more than $25 \nmillion of client assets. Investment advisers who fall below this \nthreshold will be overseen by the State securities regulators, who \nappropriately are given the task of overseeing the smaller, local \ninvestment advisers. Now, it may be that the $25 million is not an \nappropriate dividing line. I would look for guidance here to the \nregulators and the industry who will be questioned on this issue. If we \nlearn that the threshold is too high, too low, or too inflexible, I \nexpect we will make the necessary revisions.\n  The oversight of investment advisers is an extremely important issue, \nas more and more Americans turn to these financial professionals to \nhelp guide them through the increasing complexity of our financial \nmarkets. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives have \naddressed the issue of improving investment adviser oversight for \nseveral years now, but each time we have failed to reach an agreement \non how best to accomplish such a goal. Establishing a more rational \nsystem for determining jurisdiction is a helpful step. But, it is only \na first step. If we can all agree on this, I hope that we can also \nagree to come back next year and begin the process of evaluating \nwhether our investment adviser laws are adequate for the protection of \ninvestors. For example, as I understand it, there is little more to the \nfederal system of regulation than filling out some paperwork and paying \na one-time fee. There are no minimum standards of competency, training, \nor education to become an investment adviser. We\n\n[[Page S5598]]\n\nmust take a closer look at this law to determine where it may be \ndeficient and to make the necessary improvements.\n  Improved State-Federal Coordination. Today, both the Securities and \nExchange Commission and the 50 State securities regulators share the \nresponsibility for overseeing our capital markets. By and large, this \nsystem of shared regulatory responsibility has worked well, with the \nSEC taking responsibility for market-wide issues, while the States \nfocus their attention on the issues most affecting individual investors \nand small businesses.\n  I also believe that there is room for improved coordination and a \nmore clearly defined allocation of responsibility between the States \nand the SEC. I support the goal of eliminating duplicative and \noverlapping regulations that do not provide any additional protections \nto investors or to the markets but which do serve to increase the costs \nof raising capital. I believe this bill draws brighter lines of \nresponsibility between the States and the SEC, and streamlines the \nsecurities offering process for American businesses. However, I will \nwithdraw my support if any changes are made to the bill that will have \nthe effect of weakening the State role in policing sales practices, or \nthat will in any way undermine the enforcement authority of State \nsecurities regulators or the ability of defrauded investors to recover \ntheir losses in court under State laws.\n  Modernization of mutual fund oversight. This bill recognizes the \nfundamentally national character of the mutual fund industry by \nassigning exclusive responsibility for the routine review of mutual \nfund offering documents and related materials to the SEC and NASD. The \nlegislation also encourages further innovation in the mutual fund \nindustry by means of advertising prospectuses and fund of funds.\n  While I understand that this section of the bill generally \ncorresponds to a similar section contained in H.R. 3005 recently \napproved by the House Commerce Committee, I am troubled that the Senate \nversion fails to incorporate two key provisions of the House bill that \ndeal with Commission authority with respect to reporting and record \nkeeping requirements.\n  In closing, I want to say that it is my intention to carefully \nconsider the feedback and comments we receive on this legislation--from \nFederal and State securities regulators--from representatives of the \nsecurities industry--and from investor advocates. I will work to revise \nany provisions that are identified as having the potential to upset the \ndelicate balance between promoting capital formation and protecting \ninvestors that this bill now seeks to accomplish.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Kassebaum, and Mr. \n        Bond):\n  S. 1817. A bill to limit the authority of Federal courts to fashion \nremedies that require local jurisdictions to assess, levy, or collect \ntaxes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    the wisconsin works act of 1996\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure that \nwill assist the President of the United States in carrying out a \npromise he made to the people of Wisconsin that he would approve the \nWisconsin Works program. There have been some problems getting welfare \nactually acted on. I had a very nice letter from the President last \nyear for the work that we did on the welfare reform bill. But that \nmeasure got vetoed and so did a subsequent measure.\n\n  Now, the President has said that he supports the welfare reform \ndemonstration project in Wisconsin, known as Wisconsin Works. Well, \ntoday, on behalf of myself, Senators Coats, Abraham, Gramm of Texas, \nAshcroft, Craig, Coverdell, Grassley, Gregg, Santorum, Faircloth, and \nNickles, I am submitting a very brief bill, which, in substance, says \nthat when waivers are submitted by the Wisconsin Department of Health \nand Services to conduct a demonstration project known as Wisconsin \nWorks, those waivers shall be deemed approved.\n  We have heard many stories about the need to reform welfare, Mr. \nPresident, and one of those stories that has been repeated recently is \nthat of an experiment in Sedalia, MO, where applicants for food stamps \nwere sent to an employer. Many of them took jobs, which is good. It \nmoved them off public assistance. Those who were turned down because \nthey were not capable could stay on public assistance. Those who \nrefused to show up were taken off of the food stamp rolls. So there was \nan incentive for those who did not want to work. Two people went for \nthe job, but they were turned down because they tested positive for \ndrugs.\n  Under existing Federal law, the State of Missouri could not sanction \nthose people, even though they were turned down for a job because they \ntested positive for drugs. The simple point of that is that that \ncreates the most perverse of incentives--the incentive for people who \nare on public assistance and who do not want to have to take a job to \nget on drugs and they can stay on the public assistance rolls.\n  That is the kind of thing that needs to be changed. That is why we \nneed welfare reform. Today, Mr. President, I am simply acting to \nexpedite one of the many waivers now pending from the States, which has \nbeen delayed, I understand from the Governors, an average of 210 days. \nThis measure, if and when adopted, will deem the waivers submitted by \nthe State of Wisconsin to be approved.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Kassebaum, and Mr. \n        Bond):\n  S. 1817. A bill to limit the authority of Federal courts to fashion \nremedies that require local jurisdictions to assess, levy, or collect \ntaxes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             the fairness in judicial taxation act of 1996\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I introduce the Fairness in \nJudicial Taxation Act of 1996. I would like to thank Senator Hatch, \nSenator Kassebaum, and Congressman Manzullo for their leadership on \nthis issue. I hope that both the House and Senate will move quickly to \npass this bill.\n  This important piece of legislation will curb the awesome power that \nthe Federal courts gave themselves in the Supreme Court Case of \nMissouri versus Jenkins. As this body well knows, in that case the U.S. \nSupreme Court ruled that Federal courts could force towns and cities \nacross America to raise taxes--even if State law forbids a tax \nincrease. Amazingly, the Supreme Court failed to place any effective \nlimitation on this power.\n  This is outrageous and violates one of the basic principles our great \nNation was founded on--no taxation without representation. I really \ncan't think of a more un-American creature than a tax imposed by an \nunelected, unaccountable Federal judge. I urge my fellow Senators to \nremember--the power to tax is the power to destroy.\n  This Congress is working hard to reduce the tax burdens on American \nfamilies and small businesses. It would be a dereliction of duty not to \ndo what we can to protect the American taxpayer from the destructive \npower of judge-imposed taxes.\n  Today, I expect to be appointed to a national commission which is \ncharged with looking into ways to change the way the IRS operates so \nthat it will be fairer to the American taxpayer. The bill I introduce \ntoday is intended to deal with the same sort of problem--helping to \nprotect the American people from the abusive use of Federal power in \nthe collection of taxes.\n  In my view, and I believe in the view of the vast majority of \nAmerican taxpayers, it doesn't matter where the abuse comes from--the \nIRS or some Federal judge. The bottom line is that the scale has tipped \ntoo far in the direction of the Federal Government and away from \nprotecting the rights of the American people.\n  Now, we cannot by statute overturn Missouri versus Jenkins. And we \ndon't have the votes to pass a constitutional amendment. Since the \nSupreme Court has spoken, and we are stuck with judge-imposed taxes, \nthe Fairness in Judicial Taxation Act goes as far as we can. The bill \nsets up a six-part test which must be met before a judge can compel the \nraising of taxes. In brief, before a court could impose a tax, the \njudge would have to prove:\n\n  That there is no way--other than a tax--to achieve justice; right \nnow, courts can compel the raising of taxes\n\n[[Page S5599]]\n\nwithout even looking to see what else can be done;\n  The tax won't in reality make the problems the tax is supposed to fix \neven worse;\n  That the tax will not force property owners to leave the area, \nthereby actually reducing the amount of tax revenue for the town or \ncity;\n  The proposed tax will not cause property values to plummet; when \nproperty owners leave to avoid judge-imposed taxes, this can cause the \nvalue of land and property to go through the floor;\n  The tax will not override tax caps set by local law; in Missouri \nversus Jenkins, the Supreme Court actually ruled that Federal Judge can \nstrike down local tax caps;\n  The proposed tax will effectively redress only the narrow issue \nbefore the court; in some cases, Federal judges have used judge-imposed \ntaxation plans to pay for vast social engineering schemes.\n  As you can see, Mr. President, these six factors will make it \ndifficult--but not impossible--for courts to raise taxes. I wish we \ncould just overturn Missouri versus Jenkins, but we can't. So, this is \nthe next best thing.\n  Importantly, the Fairness in Judicial Taxation Act gives everyday, \naverage Americans the right to go before the court and be heard on the \nissue of tax increases. Congress might not be able to force courts not \nto raise taxes, but we can at least make the courts listen to people \nwho will be harmed by the tax increase. And anyone who wants to, and \nwho has appeared before the judge to oppose the tax, can file their own \nindependent appeal--immediately, and not at the end of the court case, \nwhich can drag on for many years.\n  Mr. President, this bill is good and fair and reasonable. It returns \npower back to the American people in a real and effective way.\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today \nSenator Grassley in introducing the Fairness in Judicial Taxation Act \nof 1996. I want to commend Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, and \nCongressman Manzullo for their leadership on this important issue.\n  In recent years, a number of judges have ordered local governments to \nimpose taxes on citizens as a means to remedy a constitutional \nviolation. In many of these cases, I have believed that Federal courts \nexceeded their limited jurisdiction under article III of the \nConstitution. While I fully understand the role of the judiciary in \nprotecting constitutional rights, I do not believe that judges should \nbe in the business of needlessly imposing taxes.\n  Our legislation addresses this issue by requiring Federal courts to \nmeet certain criteria before imposing a tax. The Federal court must \nfind that: There is no other means available to remedy the deprivation \nof rights, the tax will not contribute to the deprivation intended to \nbe remedied, the tax will not result in a loss of revenue, the tax will \nnot disproportionately affect any racial, ethnic, or national group, \nand plans submitted by a locality will not effectively redress the \ndeprivation.\n  These five criteria are similar to the analysis any effective \nlegislature would undertake before imposing a tax on its people. It is \na reasonable, moderate approach to a difficult issue.\n  Mr. President, in 1990, I joined Senator Danforth in supporting a \nconstitutional amendment which would prohibit judicial taxation. \nSenator Thurmond has advocated a legislative solution to this same \nissue. While these various approaches have not yet been successful, I \nbelieve they represent the emerging consensus that courts should stay \nout of the business of imposing taxes.\n  I would hope that the legislation we are introducing today will \ncontribute to the important debate about this issue.\n  Mr. President, my interest in the issue of judicial taxation grew out \nof the experience of the Kansas City, MO, school system. In that case, \nthe Federal judge has essentially taken over the school system by \nimposing a tax on the local population in order to finance \nimplementation of a magnet school plan. His intervention, I would \nargue, has created an undercurrent of ill will, exacerbated racial \ntension, and done little to solve, over the long term, the problems \nwith the Kansas City of school system.\n  School desegregation is not an easy issue. It is fraught with \nemotion, and there are no magic answers. But imposing a comprehensive \nsolution from the bench--without the support of the community--has not \nproven effective. We simply must find a better approach to this \nproblem--an approach which brings a community together.\n  I, for one, have strongly supported neighborhood schools. One of the \nreal strengths of our education system has been in its local base. The \nsense of connection among students, parents, school officials, and \ncommunities is a vitally important source of support for children. When \neducation loses its roots in the neighborhood, we lose the commitment \nand emphasis which are critical to academic success.\n  Moreover, at a time when the stresses and outright breakdown of many \nfamilies have denied to children the strong and positive messages they \nshould be receiving from the parents, the sense of connection and \nbelonging that a school can provide becomes even more vital.\n  I fear that complex, Rube Goldberg solutions involving busing, magnet \nschools, and the such--financied by judicially imposed taxes--undermine \ncommunity support for effective schooling. The business at hand is to \nguarantee that all our students have an opportunity for a quality \neducation in their neighborhoods. That is where we should devote our \nenergies and our financial resources.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Grassley in \nproposing legislation which deals with a key aspect of this problem--\nthe imposition of taxes by Federal courts. It is my hope that the \nSenate will act expeditiously on this important legislation, and \ncommunities will again work together to improve education for all their \nchildren.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Mr. Leahy, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Moseley-Braun Mr. Rockefeller, and \n        Mr. Simon) (by request):\n  S. 1818.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor retirement savings and security; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     retirement savings legislation\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, lack of retirement security is America's \nquiet crisis.\n  Americans who work hard all their lives--either in the workplace or \nat home--deserve peace of mind that a secure retirement awaits them. \nBut too many Americans live in fear that they cannot afford to retire \nbecause they do not have adequate pension coverage.\n  Right now, 51 million working Americans--more than half of private \nsector workers--have no private pension plan. Women are especially hard \nhit by this quiet crisis. Nearly two-thirds of working women do not \nhave pension plans. And if you work in a small business, you only have \na 1-in-4 chance of getting pension coverage.\n  Even those workers fortunate enough to have a pension plan cannot be \nsure their pensions will actually be there when they are ready to \nretire. Add to that the fact that more Americans are spending every \ndollar they earn just to pay the bills, leaving less and less for \nretirement, and it is no wonder people are worried about the future.\n  Working Americans should be able to count on a pyramid of income \nsources that, along with Medicare, provides them with a secure \nretirement. Social Security is the base of that pyramid, the foundation \nof retirement security. At the top of the pyramid are employer-provided \npensions and private savings.\n  From day one, Democrats in this Congress have had to fight to protect \nSocial Security and Medicare from attacks by the far right. And we will \ncontinue to defend those programs as the critical bedrock of retirement \nsecurity.\n  But Social Security and Medicare--alone--were never intended to \nprovide\n\n[[Page S5600]]\n\nfull retirement security. If people are going to retire with dignity \nand security, they need personal savings, and they need adequate \npension coverage. But too many obstacles exist in our current system \nfor millions of Americans to get and keep pension coverage.\n  That is why pension reform is one of the top 3 priorities for \nDemocrats between now and November. We are committed to getting some, \nif not all, of this package back to the President for his signature \nbefore this Congress ends.\n  Democrats plan to ease the fears of working Americans by making it \neasier for businesses to offer pension plans, and easier for workers \nwho do not have access to employer-sponsored pensions plans to set up \ntheir own, tax-free pension plans.\n  We will also establish a new kind of 401(k) plan to help people save \nup to $5,000 a year, tax-free, for retirement.\n  Workers will be able to take their pensions and retirement savings \naccounts with them when they change jobs. They will not lose what they \nhave already saved every time they take a new job. That is essential in \nan economy where the average worker will change jobs up to 8 times in \nhis or her career.\n  In addition to more pensions, this plan will make all pensions more \nsecure by requiring pension funds to be invested in a more timely \nmanner, and by increasing civil and criminal penalties for pension \nraiding.\n  Finally, Democrats in the Senate will push to dramatically increase \nwomen's retirement security by enabling them to earn pensions \nthemselves, and by making sure women are aware of the spousal pension \nfunds to which they may be entitled.\n  My colleague from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, predicted in a recent \nspeech that pension reform would be the big issue for the next \nCongress. I respectfully disagree with my colleague. Senate Democrats \nbelieve that pension reform is a big issue for this Congress. There is \nno reason the American people should have to wait that long.\n  People who work hard all their lives deserve to be able to retire \nwith dignity and security. We intend to ensure that they can, and we \nintend to do so this year.\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this \nopportunity to join my colleagues in introducing President Clinton's \npension legislation, the Retirement Savings and Security Act. This \nlegislation addresses some of the most serious concerns of the Nation's \nwork force, and it will have a positive and lasting impact on the \nworking people of this country. The Retirement Savings and Security Act \nwill help America's working people prepare for their retirement, and \nhelp ensure their future economic security.\n  This plan tackles the significant problems of pension coverage and \nportability by making it easier for people to enroll in pension plans, \nby making it easier for small businesses to offer benefits to their \nemployees, and by making it easier for people to save for their \nretirement.\n  A baby boomer will turn 50 every 7 seconds this year. The average \nAmerican will hold between four and eight jobs in his or her lifetime. \nThese trends require that we concern ourselves with increasing access \nto our Nation's pension system and ensuring that pensions are portable.\n  As the sponsor of S. 1756, the Women's Pension Equity Act, I want to \ntake special note of the attention the President's plan gives to some \nof the pension issues which have a disproportionate impact on women.\n  Our pension system was not designed for working women, either those \nin the work force or in the home. The statistics vividly make the case. \nWomen make up 60 percent of seniors over 65 years old, but 75 percent \nof the elderly poor. An elderly woman is twice as likely as a man to \nlive below the poverty line. One reason for the high incidence of \npoverty among older women is clear--less than one-third of female \nretirees receive any pension benefits at all and for those that do, the \naverage benefit is only half that of male retirees. Over half of all \nmale retirees receive pension benefits.\n  There are a number of reasons for the disparity in men's and women's \npension coverage and benefits. Women are more likely to move in and out \nof the work force to care for family, women are more likely to work at \nhome, or to work in industries without generous salary or pension \nbenefits, and women earn less compared to men--all of which contributes \nto little or no pension income.\n  This legislation encourages increased portability and lower vesting \nrequirements. Allowing workers to earn pension benefits quickly and to \ntake those benefits with them when they change jobs will directly \nbenefit women, who are more likely than men to take time out of the \nwork force to care for their children or their parents.\n  This legislation encourages small business to offer 401(k) plans. \nExpanding pension coverage into small businesses will directly benefit \nwomen, who disproportionately work in small businesses.\n  This legislation encourages employers to accept a lump sum rollover \nof a new employee's pension funds from the previous employer. Making it \neasier to transfer retirement funds directly into a new account, \nthereby decreasing the likelihood of pension savings being spent before \nretirement, will directly benefit women, who are almost a third more \nlikely to receive a lump sum payment as their sole pension income, will \nbenefit directly.\n  In addition, this plan contains several targeted initiatives that \nwere drawn, in part, from S. 1756, and that will help to further ensure \nretirement security for older women. These are initiatives to protect \nworking women and homemakers alike who face widowhood or divorce. The \ncurrent pension laws often leave widows and divorced women without any \nof the pension benefits earned by their husbands during many years of \nmarriage.\n\n  I am very pleased that the President acted to ensure that these \nprovisions were included in the administration's pension bill. The \nPresident understands that our pension laws have to reflect the reality \nfaced by women today in the work force, in the home, and in retirement.\n  I want to take particular note of the President's interest in dealing \nwith two problems affecting widows and divorced widows whose deceased \nhusbands participated in the Federal civil service retirement system.\n  The first provision in this legislation allows a widow or divorced \nwidow to collect their husband's civil service pension if he dies after \nleaving his civil service job and before collecting his pension \nbenefits. The second provision allows a court that awards a woman part \nof her husband's civil service pension upon divorce, to extend that \naward to any lump sum payment made if the husband dies before \ncollecting benefits.\n  These provisions ensure that women will not be left without pension \nincome in their retirement years because of absurd, yet potentially \ndevastating, pension loopholes in the civil service retirement system. \nSimilar language is included in S. 1756.\n  Mr. President, the President's pension initiative will result in \nsignificant improvements in pension coverage for older women. This bill \nis just another example of the President's commitment to increase the \neconomic security of all Americans.\n  All Americans need improved pension coverage. We need to know that we \ncan retire without falling into poverty or becoming a huge financial \nburden for our families. We need to know that the golden years are not \ngoing to turn into disposable years.\n  I commend the President on his efforts to expand pension coverage, \nportability, and security for all Americans and I commend the President \nfor making a special effort when it comes to older women living alone--\nthose most likely to live in poverty.\n  I am proud to be able to cosponsor this important initiative. All \nAmericans, women included, deserve to retire with dignity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5571-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5571-S5600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am honored to join my good friends \nSenators Snowe, Boxer, Feinstein, Murray, and Mosely-Braun in \nintroducing the Women's Health Equity Act. This years' bill, composed \nof 37 separate bills, will improve the status of women's health in the \nareas of research, services and prevention. The package builds on past \nsuccesses. It brings resources and expertise to bear on the unmet \nhealth needs of America's women. This bill sets an agenda. It's where \nwomen's health care needs to go as we enter the 21st century.\n  There has been a pattern of neglect and a history of indifference to \nwomen's health needs. It's astonishing that between 1979 and 1986 the \ndeath rate from breast cancer was up 24 percent. No one knew why. Yet \nthere was no research being done--the research community was ignoring \nthis very significant problem. I worked with colleagues to change that \nby making sure that breast cancer research got its fair share of \nresearch dollars.\n  I was frustrated when I found out that America's flagship medical \nresearch center, the National Institutes of Health [NIH], was \nsupporting research that systematically excluded women. Less than a \ndecade ago, only 14 percent of every research dollar was going to study \nthe health problems of 51 percent of the American population. I wanted \nto change that. And I did. With the help of my colleagues, I was \nsuccessful in setting up the Office of Women's Health Research at NIH. \nThis office is turning these statistics around. Women are now routinely \nincluded in clinical trials.\n\n[[Page S5572]]\n\n  Despite all our progress, we have a long way to go. We have to change \noutdated attitudes. It's not easy to reverse gender biases. We take a \nfew steps forward and then a few steps back.\n  I want to make sure that women's health care needs are met \ncomprehensively and equitably. The NIH must allocate sufficient \nresources to women's diseases. It should continue to include women in \nclinical trials. It must continue to expand access to health services \nfor women. We must aggressively pursue prevention in women's diseases. \nI pledge to fight for new attitudes and find new ways to end the \nneedless pain and death that too many American women face.\n  I am proud to introduce this bill with a great group of Senators that \ncare equally about women's health. This bill confirms our intent to \nmove forward in women's health equity. It is an outline, a framework, \nan agenda. No doubt, it will take time, but I'm sure we will succeed.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Women's \nHealth Equity Act. I am proud to join my colleagues, Senators Snowe, \nMikulski, Feinstein, and Moseley-Braun, in offering this package of 39 \nlegislative initiatives of critical importance to the health of women \nand their children. Today we are sending a powerful and united message. \nWe are more committed than ever to keeping the spotlight on the \nimportant issues surrounding women's health research, treatment and \neducation.\n  There are so many worthy pieces to this bill that I won't go into \neach and every one separately. This bill underscores the lack of \nattention that has been paid to women's health issues and the many \nobstacles we face in getting accurate, vital information about our \nhealth, the health of our children and the health care system as it \neffects us.\n  Women face an array of unique and serious health risks. We must do \nmore to ensure that adequate research and education programs are \nmaintained, supported and enriched. We have much more to learn about \ndiseases like osteoporosis, lupus, and breast cancer that devastate the \nlives of women across this country. And we need to continue to broaden \nthe scope of current efforts in research into AIDS, cardiovascular \ndisease and alcoholism to better understand how women are impacted. We \nmust enable women to protect themselves and their daughters.\n  Mr. President, our bill recognizes the need for supporting this kind \nof research and specifically addresses all of these conditions which \njeopardize the health of women. We must encourage a coordinated and \ncommitted effort from the top level of our government to make sure that \nwomen's health issues receive the attention they deserve. For too long, \nour concerns were ignored or given second-class status. If we continue \nto allow this to happen--women will die, our children will get sick, \nand future generations will be shortchanged of valuable information \nabout ways to prevent health-related tragedies.\n  And our bill acknowledges another critical health issue which \ndisproportionately affects women--domestic violence. The Women's Health \nEquity Act includes a number of provisions which seek to protect women \nwho are victims of violence from being discriminated against when \nseeking health insurance. Family violence is a public health crisis \nwhich tears families apart and often prevents women, especially low-\nincome women, from providing their children with a safe, nurturing \nenvironment in which to learn and grow.\n  As you know Mr. President, one of my biggest concerns as a Senator is \nthe well being of our Nation's young people. I am proud that this bill \nincludes provisions which encourage: adolescent health demonstration \nprojects; eating disorders research and education initiatives; fetal \nalcohol syndrome research and prevention programs; and demonstration \nprojects to prevent smoking in WIC clinics. These efforts are critical \nand send our young people an important message that we care about them, \ntheir health, and their futures.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Newborns' and Mothers' Health \nProtection Act was included in this act. By allowing longer hospital \nstays after child-birth, we will see improved health for both mother \nand baby. Women will receive essential information about care for their \nnewborn and if there are any health complications, mother and baby will \nreceive the attention they need.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Snowe for her leadership in \ncoordinating this effort and for all she has done for women's health \nand health care. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill \nand I urge all of my colleagues to join and help move these initiatives \nforward. Together, we can improve the lives and health of women and \nchildren in our Nation, continue the important work we have started and \ncelebrate the great strides we have made. I look forward to this \nchallenge.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Bryan, \n        Ms. Moseley-Braun, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1800. A bill to amend the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to limit \nfees charged by financial institutions for the use of automatic teller \nmachines, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n              the fair atm fees for consumers act of 1996\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Kerry and \nMurray as my primary cosponsor to introduce legislation to protect \nconsumers from excessive and redundant fees imposed by automated teller \nmachine (ATM) operators. I am also pleased that Senators Boxer, Bryan, \nand Moseley-Braun have joined in cosponsoring this important \ninitiative.\n  Traditionally, a bank or financial institution, let's call it \nIntegrity Bank, agrees to provide a consumer with a package of services \nin exchange for the use of the consumer's money. These services \ntypically include access to an ATM network, such as MOST, CIRRUS, or \nPLUS, which consists of any Integrity Bank ATM's as well as ATM's \noperated by other banks or financial institutions. Integrity Bank and \nthe consumer have an agreement about whether Integrity Bank will charge \nthe consumer for using ATM's not owned by Integrity Bank. Integrity \nBank, in turn, is responsible for paying the network a fee for \ntransactions completed by its consumers on ATM's not owned by Integrity \nBank.\n  Changes which took effect in April of this year may force the \nconsumer to pay new fees. Until April 1, the major electronic banking \nnetworks prohibited the assessment of ATM user fees by the bank which \nowned the ATM. The networks have revoked this policy, opening the door \nto a new and outrageous practice beyond the control of Integrity Bank \nand its customer. Now, despite the fact that Integrity Bank pays fees \nto the ATM network, ATM owners and operators can now charge non-\ncustomers who use their ATM's--a service that consumers thought was \nincluded in any charges imposed by Integrity Bank--their bank.\n  Now many ATM users may be caught in the middle. Their own banks can \ncontinue to impose fees while the operators of the ATM's they use are \nentitled to ransack consumers' accounts. What is next, explicit and \nredundant fees for deposit envelopes? A nighttime ATM surcharge? I will \nrefrain from offering banks any further suggestions on how to pick the \npockets of American consumers.\n  Mr. President, this double-dipping is unfair and unconscionable. \nConsumers should not be charged twice for a single ATM transaction and \nshould certainly not be charged a fee which has nothing to do with the \nrelationship between the consumer and his or her financial institution.\n  Banks and other financial service providers argue that these \nsurcharges are necessary to cover the costs of ATM operation. In-branch \nATM's present minimal expense to financial institutions. How can banks \nargue with straight faces that surcharges are necessary to cover costs \nof operation?\n  Mr. President, the rules change which permits this extra fee was \nenacted only recently. While some banks have already imposed the \nsurcharge, many others are testing the waters before they take \nadvantage of the rule change. Congress should act before this unfair \npractice spreads like a wildfire.\n  It is hard to believe that banks are so strapped when industry \nprofits have never been higher. For the fourth straight year in 1995, \ncommercial banks reported record earnings. Last year, commercial banks \nreported profits of $48.8 billion, exceeding the previous year's record \nof $44.6 billion by\n\n[[Page S5573]]\n\n9.4 percent. These skyrocketing earnings are primarily the result of \nincreased interest and fee income. On top of this, commercial banks now \npay nearly nothing to receive deposit insurance.\n  Are banks really losing money on ATM operations or is this new fee \njust an easy way to gouge the consumer? The U.S. Public Interest \nResearch Group and the Center for the Responsive Law recently reported \nthat ATM's generated $3.1 billion in transaction fees for banks in \n1995. Though ATM transactions cost banks $3.2 billion, the report said, \nprofits increased by $2.2 billion as a result of the labor savings. \nThis new ATM surcharge is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to \nartificially inflate profits at the consumer's expense.\n  Banks have spent the past 20 years enticing consumers to use ATMs to \nreduce the need for branch offices. Banks have told regulators and the \nCongress that branch closings save money without decreasing service \nbecause ATM's fill the role once served by branch offices. Now it \nappears providing that service comes only with an added cost to the \nconsumer and more profit for the provider.\n  Let me just say a few words about the impact of this fee on community \nbanks. These banks have already agreed to pay fees to ATM networks in \norder to ensure that their customers have access to funds at convenient \nlocations. Now community banks face the threat of losing customers to \nlarge banks with large ATM networks. Since community bank customers \ndepend on other institutions' ATM's, large banks can use ATM user fees \nto steal community bank customers.\n  This moves comes at a time when some banks are charging their \ncustomers a premium for teller service. These banks justify this teller \nfee with claims that teller service is more expensive to provide than \nATM service. Now, some banks are squeezing consumers even harder with \nnew ATM user fees. Consumers are getting nickel-and-dimed to death and \nit has got to stop.\n  Mr. President, the bill I introduce today would prohibit user fees \nimposed by ATM operators. Under this bill, for example, banks would \nremain free to charge their own customers for using the ATM's of other \nbanks. Other ATM owners and operators, however, would be prohibited \nfrom taking a second bite out of the consumer.\n  There is congressional precedent for this type of legislation. \nCongress originally passed legislation banning surcharges in the credit \ncard industry in 1976 and renewed the ban twice in 1978 and 1981. In \nthat instance, Congress prohibited retail institutions from charging \nconsumers surcharges on their credit card purchases. To allow \nadditional charges and fees for card use after the consumer had paid \nfor the use of the credit card would have forced customers to pay twice \nand permitted some unscrupulous merchant to engage in deceptive \nadvertising and other harmful practices. This is analogous to our \ncurrent ATM situation.\n  I understand that some businesses that rely on retail sales through \ncredit and ATM cards may be concerned about this bill. They need not \nworry. The sole purpose of this legislation is to prohibit excessive \nfees to ATM users. I recognize that there may be some off-site ATM's \nthat are costly to maintain and have historically charged fees. I am \nwilling to consider necessary accommodations to this bill. However, I \nwill draw the line in cases where it is clear the consumer is being \nfleeced.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from New \nYork, the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator D'Amato, in \nintroducing this important piece of legislation.\n  It is not often that Senator D'Amato and I agree on issues on this \nfloor or in the Banking Committee, and when we do, there is \njustification for strong bi-partisan support. That is indeed the case \non this legislation, and I am pleased to join with my colleague, and I \ncongratulate him on his leadership in moving to protect consumers \nagainst the potential of double-bank-fees that amount to a banking-\npenalty tax on consumers.\n  Why do we need this legislation now? Because, on April 1 of this \nyear, American depositors had a cruel April Fool's joke played on them. \nThat's the day Visa and MasterCard--owners of two of the largest \nautomated teller network--began letting their member banks charge a fee \nto other banks' customers who use their automated tellers. Some banking \nanalysts tell me that across the country this surcharge can range from \n50 cents to $2.50. Consumers can be charged an increased fee by both \ntheir bank and the bank whose machine they are using which could cost \nas much as $5 to make a deposit, a withdrawal, or to check your \nbalance.\n  Our legislation has a simple purpose: it prohibits a transaction fee \nassessed by the owner or operator of an ATM machine. This bill will \nstop double fees.\n  It gives consumers negotiating power with a financial services \nindustry which is consolidating and downsizing--laying off tellers, \nshutting branches and reducing bank-lobby hours; it helps the small \nbanker from being run out of business by the big banks; and it bolsters \ncongressional oversight of antitrust violations.\n  Mr. President, Massachusetts is in a unique situation. Because of \npending bank mergers and consolidations the 2 largest banks will soon \nown 2,200 of the 3,500 ATM machines in the State--about 65 percent.\n  In no other State does one bank control more than 15 percent of the \nATM's. I applaud the banking industry which has grown and is healthy \nand strong, and there is room in financial services for large \ninstitutions and for small credit unions and neighborhood savings and \nloans. This bill not only protects consumers, but it protects small \nbanks that don't own more than a few ATM's from being run out of \nbusiness by the larger banks who can offer free transactions at \nthousands of machines.\n  Let me put this in perspective. In a survey of just 228 of the 3,500 \nmachines in my State--less than 10 percent of all the machines--it was \nreported that 400,742 transactions per month would be subject to the \nnew surcharge--almost 5 million transactions per year at just 10 \npercent of the ATM's in my State.\n  If the larger financial institutions could offer no fee if a consumer \ntook their money out of a smaller institution, the fate of the smaller \ninstitutions in an increasingly automated environment is obviously in \nquestion, and we have to address this problem now. And to save the \ncommunity banks and avoid the 1990's version of the 1980's S crisis.\n  Mr. President, in a recent USA Today interview with an executive of \none of the Nation's largest banks, when asked ``are you instituting \nsurcharges on non-customers who use your automated teller machines?'' \nthe answer was somewhat disturbing.\n  It was:\n\n       We're going to do it . . . The reason is frankly pretty \n     self-evident. You've got a community bank that likes to tell \n     you they're going to give you this wonderful service and you \n     can shake the President's hand and get a doughnut and a cup \n     of coffee in the lobby and so on. When you go in to open an \n     account they say we don't have any ATM's but don't worry \n     about it, here's our card and you can use anybody's ATM in \n     the country. So we're subsidizing the community banks. We're \n     not going to do that anymore.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, I ask, what's wrong with community banks. I like \nthe idea of neighborhood credit unions and having a cup of coffee and a \ndoughnut in the lobby. What this response tells me is that there is \nmore to the surcharge than meets the eye. And we should be aware of the \nwhat lies around the corner as we head down the road.\n  You will hear from representatives of the industry, Mr. President. \nSome of the biggest banks will lobby heavily saying that this fee is an \nissue of convenience. But I suspect that other forces are at play. \nCommercial banks posted record profits last year. This new fee is not \ndesigned to raise profits.\n  Yet, community and cooperative bankers will tell you a different \nstory--a constituent of mine in Dorchester, MA, owns a profitable bank \nwith one ATM machine. He runs the bank well and serves the community. \nBut he is no match against far bigger competitors. He knows that once \nthese surcharges become pervasive and the big banks start charging his \ncustomers to use their ATM's, they will just move their accounts to the \nbig banks to avoid the charge.\n  So, this is not an issue of establishing prices and fees; this is an \nantitrust issue. I want to set the marker down clearly--the Congress \nneeds to do a\n\n[[Page S5574]]\n\nbetter job in monitoring and preventing the trend of consolidation from \nrunning the smaller banks out of business.\n  I want to be clear about what else this bill does, and what it does \nnot do. This legislation does not regulate fees and prices, and does \nnot curtail the widespread use of ATM's especially in lower income \nareas.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that it is the business of the U.S. \nSenate to set prices and fees at banks and other financial \ninstitutions. I am a great believer in the free market--not the Federal \nGovernment--dictating fee structures. But there is a general sense of \nfairness that is being violated in this new surcharge.\n  When a depositor opens an account, he or she knows the fees \nassociated with transactions. It is current Federal law--found in \nstatutes like the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Truth-in-Savings \nAct and the Truth-in-Lending Act--that mandates fees to be disclosed to \nthe consumer. So, when we open a bank account, we will know how much \neach transaction will cost.\n  But now, with this new surcharge, we are left in the dark. We don't \nfind out how much it will cost to use an ATM machine, not associated \nwith our particular bank, until our statement appears in the mail, long \nafter the ATM transaction is completed.\n  That is bad for consumers and it is bad precedent. And the trend is \nnot favorable. Historic mergers, consolidations and acquisitions have \ntaken place in financial service industry. Consumers have less choice, \nnot more. Bank lobby hours have been curtailed so drastically, tellers \nreplaced by machines, that we are forced to use ATM's. This is the \ndirection of the industry and at some point the Congress must step in \nand let the banks know enough is enough.\n  Thank you and I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1801. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to authorize \nappropriations for the Federal Aviation Administration for fiscal year \n1997, to reform the Federal Aviation Administration, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                    THE OMNIBUS AVIATION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Omnibus \nAviation Act of 1996. This legislation reauthorizes for one year \nseveral key programs of the Federal Aviation Administration, including \nthe vital Airport Improvement Program. It also provides needed, \ncomprehensive FAA reform, including the development of a stable, long-\nterm funding system for the FAA, and addresses other critical safety \nand airport concerns. Specifically, this legislation would:\n  Reauthorize AIP at $1.8 billion for one year;\n  Expand the prohibition on airport revenue diversion;\n  Provide for thorough reform of the FAA;\n  Encourage Congress to meet the FAA's short-term funding needs;\n  Enhance airline safety by requiring airlines to share employment and \nperformance records before hiring new pilots; and\n  Abolish the MWAA Board of Review.\n  Significantly, this bill expresses the sense of the Senate that \nCongress must act immediately to address the short-term funding needs \nof the FAA. Mr. President, we have all heard by now that certain \naviation excise taxes that make up most of the Airport and Airway Trust \nFund, which provides nearly all of the FAA's funding, expired at the \nend of last year. Since then, no money has been going into the aviation \ntrust fund. Yet, the FAA has determined that since the beginning of \nthis year, approximately half a billion dollars has been spent each \nmonth from the existing trust fund balance. The FAA advises that at \nthis rate, all of the money in the trust fund will be spent by \nDecember. Without immediate action by Congress to provide interim, \nshort-term funding for the FAA, confidence in the FAA and our nation's \nair traffic control system could erode.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today not only encourages quick \nresolution of the FAA's immediate funding problem, but also sets out a \nplan for complete FAA reform. In specific, this bill incorporates the \nAir Traffic Management System Performance Improvement Act, which I have \ncosponsored with Senator Ford and Senator Hollings, to create a more \nautonomous and accountable FAA that can continue to ensure the safety \nof the traveling public while, at the same time, meet the needs of the \ngrowing aviation industry.\n  This FAA reform measure is particularly important because while the \ninterim, short-term funding is in place and during the one-year \nreauthorization of FAA programs, the FAA will be able to set up a \nperformance-based fee system to satisfy the FAA's long-term funding \nneeds. This FAA reform proposal would ensure that the new FAA funding \nsystem must consider the FAA's costs of providing air traffic control \nservices and must increase the efficiency with which air traffic \ncontrol services are produced or used, without jeopardizing safety.\n  The existing aviation excise tax system does not enable the FAA to \ndetermine whether the air traffic control system is becoming more or \nless costly per flight, or whether air traffic control system \nproductivity is increasing or decreasing. By contrast, establishing a \nuser fee funding system under this bill would compel the FAA to \nestablish a cost accounting system, which would enable it to determine \nthe efficiency and costs of the FAA and the air traffic control system, \nand develop investment and modernization programs that are viable.\n\n  This legislation also addresses other critical aviation issues. \nFirst, it contains provisions intended to reverse the disturbing trend \nof illegal diversion of airport revenues. To ensure that airport \nrevenues are used only for airport purposes, this legislation would \nexpand the prohibition on revenue diversion to cover more instances of \ndiversion. It also would establish clear penalties and stronger \nmechanisms to enforce Federal laws prohibiting revenue diversion. In \naddition, the bill would impose additional reporting requirements so \nthat illegal revenue diversion is easily identified and verified. It \nalso would provide important protections for whistleblowers.\n  To enhance the safety of the Nation's air transportation system, this \nlegislation also contains provisions that would require air carriers to \nrequest and receive, after obtaining written consent from a pilot \napplication, relevant employment and performance records before hiring \nsomeone as a pilot. These provisions focus on encouraging and \nfacilitating the flow of information between employers so that safety \nis not compromised in any way.\n  To ensure that the burden of these pilot recordsharing provisions \ndoes not fall on employers and the legal system, when a transfer is \nrequested and complied with, both the employer who turns over the \nrequested records and the prospective employer who receives them will \nbe immune from lawsuits related to the transferred information, unless \nthe employer who provides the information knows it is false. Complete \nimmunity is critical--without it, the airlines simply will not share \nrecords. The legislation therefore could not achieve its objective of \nmaking it a common practice of prospective employers to research to the \ngreatest extent the experience of pilots, and to learn significant \ninformation that could affect air carrier hiring decisions and, \nultimately, airline safety.\n  Finally, this legislation makes certain changes to the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority required following recent Federal court \nrulings. In specific, the bill would abolish the MWAA Board of Review, \nand increase the number of presidentially appointed members of the MWAA \nBoard of Directors. It also conveys the sense of the Senate that the \nMWAA should not provide free, reserved parking areas at either \nWashington National Airport or Washington Dulles International Airport \nfor Members of Congress and other government officials or diplomats.\n  Mr. President, certain unfortunate, recent events have raised \nquestions about the safety of our nation's air transportation system. \nWe must do our part to reassure the traveling public that we have the \nworld's safest system. This comprehensive legislation will go a long \nway in reassuring the public that the system is safe, and will provide \nthe FAA with a stable, predictable, and sufficient funding stream for \nthe long term.\n\n[[Page S5575]]\n\n                                 ______\n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself and Mr. SIMPSON):\n  S. 1802. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain property containing a fish and wildlife facility to the State \nof Wyoming, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n               Ranch a Crook County, Wyoming Legislation\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague from \nWyoming, Senator Simpson, to introduce legislation to protect public \nland in our State. This bill would transfer 680 acres of land currently \nadministered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to the \nState of Wyoming. This property commonly known as Ranch A is located in \nCrook County, WY, and is scheduled to be disposed of by the General \nServices Administration in the coming months. Since the area is unique \nand possesses many historic and distinctive characteristics, the State \nof Wyoming would like to have the property transferred to it so that \nthe property and facilities on the land can be preserved for the public \nfor many years to come.\n  The Ranch A lodge, which sits on 680 acres of property, was \nconstructed by a private developer in the 1930's and acquired by the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1963. Since the area has an abundant \nsupply of spring-fed water, it is ideal for trout research and the \nstudy of trout genetics. The Fish and Wildlife Service continued its \nresearch operations at Ranch A until 1980 when all of the agency's \ntrout research work was transferred to Bozeman, MT. Since that time, \nthe Service has maintained the facility but has leased the area to a \nvariety of groups including the Wyoming Game and Fish Department and \nthe South Dakota School of Mines.\n  Although the area has significant historical and cultural values, in \n1995 the Department of Interior took action to divest itself of \nownership of Ranch A. Recently, the Fish and Wildlife Service declared \nthe property as ``surplus'' and is planning to dispose of Ranch A \nthrough the General Services Administration. No formal action has been \ntaken on the disposal request and the property is still owned and \nmaintained by the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  The State of Wyoming is interested in protecting Ranch A and working \nto ensure the area is protected for future generations. Earlier this \nyear, the Wyoming congressional delegation was approached by Gov. Jim \nGeringer and asked if we could introduce legislation to have the \nproperty transferred to the State of Wyoming. The State is willing to \nassume ownership of the area and maintain the facility and the adjacent \nland for educational, historical and wildlife management purposes.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would achieve that goal. The \nbill would transfer all right and title of the 680 acres and all \nbuildings on the Ranch A property to the State of Wyoming. The State \nwould assume control of the property and would be required to manage \nthe area for public purposes including fish and wildlife management, \neducation and historical uses. In order to ensure the area remains \npublic, the legislation contains a reverter clause that requires the \nState of Wyoming to manage the property for public uses or it would be \ntransferred back to Federal ownership.\n  The bill is the product of long negotiations between the State of \nWyoming and the Fish and Wildlife Service. Initially, the State would \nonly accept the land if Federal funds were authorized to refurbish the \narea. However, by working with the State, the Federal Government and \nlocal officials, we have been able to craft a compromise that does not \nrequire any Federal expenditures and keeps the land public.\n  Mr. President, the Ranch A property is a truly unique facility that \nshould be kept in public ownership. The area has significant historic \nand cultural value in addition to its wildlife and research \nopportunities. Keeping the area clean and pure is a goal of the \nresidents in the region who hope to preserve the beauty of the facility \nand surrounding land for future generations to enjoy. The State of \nWyoming is willing to take on the responsibility of protecting this \nwonderful property and I strongly support their efforts to ensure that \nRanch A is protected for many years to come.\n  Instead of allowing the Federal Government to dispose of this unique \nproperty that has such a variety of uses, I urge Congress to take \naction and allow the State of Wyoming to protect Ranch A. The choice is \nclear--either we pass this bill and keep the area open to the public, \nor we allow the Federal Government to move forward and dispose of the \nland into private ownership. I hope we can move quickly to support this \noutstanding area and pass this legislation in the near future.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Johnston and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1804. A bill to make technical and other changes to the laws \ndealing with the territories and freely associated States of the United \nStates; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          Territories and Freely Associated States Legislation\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill address several concerns that were brought to my attention by the \nleadership in some of the United States territories and in the nations \nin free association with the United States. I am pleased that this \nlegislation is cosponsored by the Ranking Member and former Chairman of \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Senator Johnston, as \nwell as by Senator Akaka, who has also had a long and abiding interest \nin the welfare of the territories and freely associated States.\n  During the February recess, I had the opportunity to meet with the \nchief executives of the United States territories of American Samoa, \nGuam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands as well as \nthe Presidents of the Republic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall \nIslands, and the Federated States of Micronesia. I want to express my \nappreciation to all of them for their courtesies and their willingness \nto meet with Senator Akaka and myself and for their assistance in \narranging full and frank discussions.\n  I was impressed by the diversity within the Pacific and the magnitude \nof the problems facing these island governments. I have some \nappreciation for their problems in dealing with Washington because I \ncan recall the days of territorial administration for Alaska. I was \nalso able to point out that Statehood is not a complete remedy for \nthose who still think Alaska is their private reserve. Alaska, like the \nislands, is noncontiguous and must deal with standards developed for \nthe lower 48 States. We have the problem of servicing small remote \npopulations, much like the Republic of the Marshalls and the Federated \nStates of Micronesia have.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would address the \nfollowing issues:\n  Section 1 extends the supplemental food assistance program for \nEnewetak and Bikini for an additional 5 years. Enewetak and Bikini were \nthe sites for the United States atmospheric nuclear testing program in \nthe Marshall Islands and the food assistance program is necessary to \nsupplement local food supplies while the populations resettle their \natolls. The difficulty that Enewetak has experienced in establishing a \nlocal food supply should be ample warning to the population of Bikini \nof the environmental consequences of a scrape, and I sincerely hope \nthat we can avoid that environmental degradation. While Enewetak is \nmaking significant strides in reestablishing a local food supply, it is \nclear that a continuation of the agriculture assistance is needed. The \nlanguage would also require the United States to ensure that the \nprogram is designed to meet the actual needs of the populations. I \nunderstand that the program is running at the same level as it did 10 \nyears ago without taking into account the change in population.\n\n  A concern was also raised over the medical care and monitoring \nprogram that the Department of Energy runs in the Northern Marshalls. \nAt the same time that I am introducing this legislation, I am also \nintroducing an amendment that would extend the program to Bikini and \nEnewetak. While I do not want to jeopardize the effectiveness of the \nprogram for the affected populations of Rongelap and Utirik, I also \nwant to ensure that the objectives of the four atoll program are being \nmet. This language will also provide the Committee with an opportunity \nto review the administration of the program\n\n[[Page S5576]]\n\nsince it was shifted out of defense programs and into environmental \nhealth within DOE. I appreciate that the four atoll health program was \nto be administered by the Tribunal established under the Compact of \nFree Association, but I am also mindful of the special responsibility \nthat the United States has for the populations of the four affected \natolls. Under the terms of the Compact, we authorized further ex gratia \nassistance if justified, and I think it is time for the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources to examine how the programs--those being \nprovided by the Republic of the Marshall Islands and those provided by \nthe United States--are being implemented. I was very impressed by my \nvisit to Bikini and am grateful for the courtesies and hospitality \nextended by the Mayor, the Council, and Senator Balos. During the \nhearings on this legislation, I also want to examine what role the \nPublic Health Service can play in improving health care not only to the \nfour atolls, but throughout the Republic of the Marshall Islands and \nalso to the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Palau. I \nagain want to emphasize that in no way do I want to jeopardize the \noverriding objective of the health care being provided by Brookhaven to \nthe 133 exposed Marshallese, but I do not want to pass over the \nopportunity to see if the populations of Bikini and Enewetak could \nbootstrap onto the program using their trust funds.\n  Section 2 of the legislation would repeal a provision of law that \nauthorizes the government of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \nIslands to take over the American Memorial Park in Saipan. Senator \nAkaka and I participated in a wreath laying at the park, and I was \nimpressed with the development of the area, especially in light of \nstaff descriptions of the site only a few short years ago. Ambassador \nHaydn Williams deserves a great deal of credit for his persistence and \ncommitment to seeing the park established. While I am not opposed to \nproposals for other arrangements, it seems to me that the area is now a \npart of the National Park System and should remain so until the lease \nexpires unless some concrete proposal is brought forward that will \nmaintain the objectives and purposes for the memorial. I fully expect \nthat we will need to modify this provision to permit the commonwealth \nthe ability to develop the marina area, but at least for the time \nbeing, I think the National Park Service should continue to operate and \nmaintain the memorial.\n\n  Section 3 is a technical amendment to the legislation dealing with \nthe land grant status of the College of Micronesia and was brought to \nmy attention by Susan Moses, the president of the college. The \namendment would provide separate land grant status to the three \nsuccessor institutions to the former College of Micronesia--the College \nof Micronesia--FSM, the College of the Marshall Islands, and the Palau \nCommunity College. This amendment will hopefully eliminate some \nadministrative headaches for the college.\n  Section 4 amends the Guam Organic Act to guarantee that any lands \nacquired by the United States for Federal purposes will be made \navailable to the Government of Guam when those purposes have expired. \nThe Federal Government, principally the Department of Defense, controls \nabout one-third of the available land area in Guam. Those lands were \nacquired for defense needs, and when those needs no longer exist, the \nlands should be returned to Guam. I was particularly troubled by the \nsituation at Ritidian Point where the Fish and Wildlife Service, \nseemingly in the dead of night, effectively stole land that the \nDepartment of Defense and the Government of Guam had negotiated for \ntransfer. Whatever the justification for Fish and Wildlife's interest, \nthere is no excuse for the insensitivity shown by the Department of the \nInterior in that acquisition. Rather than spending their time enlarging \ntheir empire, the Fish and Wildlife Service could make better use of \ntheir resources by going after the brown tree snake. At the rate they \nare going, they will have the only wildlife refuge dedicated to extinct \nspecies. I especially want to thank Congressman Underwood for his \nassistance in developing this approach to guarantee a role for the \nGovernment of Guam in any further Federal land disposal in Guam. The \nGovernor of Guam made an excellent presentation of the problems created \nby the actions of the Fish and Wildlife Service and I think this is a \nsituation that needs to be addressed and I am grateful for the \ncomprehensive briefing he provided us during our brief visit to Guam.\n\n  Section 5 would repeal a provision of law that limits the use of \nlands transferred to Guam. Again, I want to thank Congressman Underwood \nfor suggesting this amendment. I cannot think of any restriction more \nonerous than transferring property for which the Federal Government has \nno further need and then denying the Government of Guam the ability to \nderive the economic benefits of its use and development.\n  Section 6 was suggested by the Resident Representative of the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and would provide State-\nlike treatment for the commonwealth, the Virgin Islands, and American \nSamoa for certain drug enforcement programs. Guam and Puerto Rico \npresently have State-like treatment, and this amendment simply provides \nuniform treatment for all the territories.\n  Section 7 of the legislation would amend the Revised Organic Act of \nthe Virgin Islands at the request of the Governor of the Virgin \nIslands. The first amendment would provide that the Governor would \nretain his powers as Governor when he is temporarily absent from the \nterritory on official business. This amendment recognizes that with \nmodern communications and transportation, the current limitations are \narchaic and impede continuity in the operations of the executive branch \nin the Virgin Islands.\n  The second amendment would reform the authority granted to the Virgin \nIslands in 1976 to issue bonds secured by the matching fund. The debt \nis now priority debt, not parity debt. Priority debt places a premium \nvalue on the earliest debt, while parity debt places all bond holders \non a level playing field. Although most communities now issue parity \ndebt, the current limitation handicaps the Virgin Islands by requiring \na higher fee and interest rate on subsequent issues as well as over \ncollateralization. The amendment would permit the Virgin Islands to \nissue parity debt and allows for a transition to permit the Virgin \nIslands to refinance their current priority debt. This would reduce the \ndebt service and free up needed revenues for school improvements and \nemergency repairs made necessary by Hurricane Marilyn. I want to \nemphasize that current bond holders will be fully protected.\n  Section 8 was suggested by Senator Johnston to begin to look at what \nthe economic future of the Virgin Islands will be in light of the \nchanges that are happening both politically and economically in the \nCaribbean and what the Federal Government can do to provide a stable \nand self-sustaining local economic base. I fully agree with Senator \nJohnston that the time to do that analysis is now.\n\n  Mr. President, upon my return from my visit to the Pacific, I wrote \nthe President on what I thought was a fairly significant concern raised \nby the Presidents of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the \nFederated States of Micronesia. While the political relationship under \nthe Compacts of Free Association is of indefinite duration, certain \nprovisions are subject to renegotiation and expire at the end of 15 \nyears. The compacts require renegotiation in the 13th year and the \nPresidents quite correctly pointed out that was not sufficient time to \nconclude negotiations and obtain the necessary ratifications by the \nUnited States and their governments. Like the Governor of the Virgin \nIslands and Senator Johnston, they are looking to the future and trying \nto plan for it. They asked if I would request the administration to \nbegin the process of formulating the U.S. position and begin discussion \nwhile there was a degree of time. Given the number of years it took for \nthe original ratification, that seemed like a reasonable request. I \nwill not comment on the President's response, other than to ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of my letter and his response be included \nin the Record.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate that we are late in this session of the \nCongress, but these are important matters that require the attention of \nthe Congress. I\n\n[[Page S5577]]\n\nwant to announce that the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \nwill hold a hearing on this legislation on June 25, 1996 and at the \nsame time we will review the report on the law enforcement initiative \nin the commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. I will not go into \ngreat detail on the situation in the Commonwealth other than to say \nthat reforms need to be implemented. We had extensive and detailed \nbriefings and discussions with the Governor's staff, the Federal \nofficials on the island, the Chamber of Commerce, the legislature, the \nU.S. attorney and Federal judiciary. It is my intention to move \nexpeditiously on this legislation immediately after the hearing is \nconcluded.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 1804\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MARSHALL ISLANDS AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD PROGRAMS.\n\n       Paragraph (2) of subsection (h) of section 103 of Public \n     Law 99-239, as amended, is further amended by striking the \n     word ``ten'' and inserting in lieu thereof the word \n     ``fifteen'' and by adding at the end of subparagraph (B) \n     ``Such technical assistance, programs and services shall \n     ensure, on an ongoing basis, that the commodities provided \n     reflect the changes in the population that have occurred \n     since the effective date of the Compact.''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMERICAN MEMORIAL PARK.\n\n       Section 5 of Public Law 95-348 is amended by striking \n     subsection (f), and renumbering subsections (g) and (h) as \n     subsections (f) and (g), respectively.\n\n     SEC. 3. TERRITORIAL LAND GRANT COLLEGES--TECHNICAL AMENDMENT.\n\n       Subsection (b) of section 1361 of Public Law 96-374 is \n     amended by striking the words ``August 30, 1980 (7 U.S.C. \n     327), commonly referred to as the Second'' and inserting in \n     lieu thereof the words ``July 2, 1862 (7 U.S.C. 305), \n     commonly referred to as the First''.\n\n     SEC. 4. AMENDMENT TO THE GUAM ORGANIC ACT.\n\n       The Organic Act of Guam (48 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.), as \n     amended, is further amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following new section:\n       ``Sec. 36. (a) At least 180 days before transferring to any \n     Federal agency excess real property located in Guam, the \n     Administrator of General Services shall notify the government \n     of Guam that the property is available under this section.\n       ``(b) The Administrator shall transfer to the government of \n     Guam all right, title, and interest of the United States in \n     and to excess real property located in Guam, by quit claim \n     deed and without reimbursement, if the government of Guam, \n     within 180 days after receiving notification under subsection \n     (a) regarding the property, notifies the Administrator that \n     the government of Guam intends to acquire the property under \n     this section.\n       ``(c) For purposes of this section, the term 'excess real \n     property' means excess property (as that term is defined in \n     section 3 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services \n     Act of 1949, as in effect on the date of enactment of the \n     Guam Land Return Act) that is real property.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. REPEAL OF LIMITATION ON USE OF LANDS BY THE \n                   GOVERNMENT OF GUAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 818(b)(2) of Public Law 96-418 (94 \n     Stat. 1782), is repealed.\n       (b) Execution of Instruments.--The Secretary of the Navy \n     and the Administrator General Services shall execute all \n     instruments necessary to implement this section.\n\n     SEC. 6. CLARIFICATION OF ALLOTMENT FOR TERRITORIES.\n\n       Section 901(a), Part 1, title I of the Act of June 19, 1968 \n     (42 U.S.C. 3791(a)), as amended, is further amended in \n     paragraph (2) by changing the proviso to read as follows: \n     ``(2) ``State'' means any State of the United States, the \n     District of Columbia, The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the \n     Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of \n     the Northern Mariana Islands.''\n\n     SEC. 7. AMENDMENTS TO THE REVISED ORGANIC ACT OF THE VIRGIN \n                   ISLANDS.\n\n       (a) Section 7(a) of P.L. 90-496 (82 Stat. 839), as amended, \n     is futher amended by adding at the end thereof ``As used in \n     this section, the term 'temporary absence' shall not be \n     construed as being physically absent from the territory while \n     on official Government business.''\n       (b) Section 3 of P.L. 94-392 (90 Stat. 1195), as amended, \n     is further amended to read as follows:\n       (1) by inserting ``hereinafter'' between ``obligations'' \n     and ``issued'';\n       (2) by deleting ``priority for payment'' and inserting in \n     lieu thereof ``a parity lien with every other issue of bonds \n     or other obligations hereinafter issued for payment''; and\n       (3) by deleting ``in the order of the date of issue''.\n       (c) The provisions of section 149(d)(3)(A)(i)(I) and \n     149(d)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, \n     shall not apply to bonds issued:\n       (1) by an authority created by statute of the Virgin \n     Islands legislature, the proceeds of which will be used to \n     advance refund certain bonds issued by such authority on July \n     8, 1992; or\n       (2) by an authority created by statute of the Virgin \n     Islands Legislature, the proceeds of which will be used to \n     advance refund certain bonds issued by such authority on \n     November 3, 1994.\n       (d) The amendments made by subsections (b) and (c) shall \n     apply to obligations issued on or after the date of enactment \n     of this section.\n\n     SEC. 8. COMMISSION ON THE ECONOMIC FUTURE OF THE VIRGIN \n                   ISLANDS.\n\n       (a) Establishment and Membership.--\n       (1) There is hereby established a Commission on the \n     Economic Future of the Virgin Islands (the ``Commission''). \n     The Commission shall consist of six members appointed by the \n     President, two of whom shall be selected from nominations \n     made by the Governor of the Virgin Islands. The President \n     shall designate one of the members of the Commission to be \n     Chairman.\n       (2) In addition to the six members appointed under \n     paragraph (1), the Secretary of the Interior shall be an ex-\n     officio member of the Commission.\n       (3) Members of the Commission appointed by the President \n     shall be persons who by virtue of their background and \n     experience are particularly suited to contribute to \n     achievement of the purposes of the Commission.\n       (4) Members of the Commission shall serve without \n     compensation, but shall be reimbursed for travel, subsistence \n     and other necessary expenses incurred by them in the \n     performance of their duties.\n       (5) Any vacancy in the Commission shall be filled in the \n     same manner as the original appointment was made.\n       (b) Purpose and Report.--\n       (1) The purpose of the Commission is to make \n     recommendations to the President and Congress on the policies \n     and programs necessary to provide for a secure and self-\n     sustaining future for the local economy of the Virgin Islands \n     through 2020 and on the role of the federal government in \n     providing for that future. In developing recommendations, the \n     Commission shall--\n       (A) solicit information and advice from persons and \n     entities that the Commission determines have expertise to \n     assist the Commission in its work;\n       (B) examine and analyze historical data since 1970 on \n     expenditures for infrastructure and services;\n       (C) analyze the sources of funds for such expenditures;\n       (D) assemble relevant demographic and economic data, \n     including trends and projections for the future; and\n       (E) estimate future needs of the Virgin Islands, including \n     needs for capital improvements, educational needs and social, \n     health and environmental requirements.\n       (2) The recommendations of the Commission shall be \n     transmitted to the President, the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the \n     Committee on Resources of the United States House of \n     Representatives no later than December 1, 1997. The \n     recommendations shall be accompanied by a report that sets \n     forth the basis for the recommendations and includes an \n     analysis of the capability of the Virgin Islands to meet \n     projected needs based on reasonable alternative economic, \n     political and social conditions in the Caribbean, including \n     the opening in the near future of Cuba to trade, tourism and \n     development.\n       (c) Powers.--\n       (1) The Commission may--\n       (A) hold such hearings, sit and act at such times and \n     places, take such testimony and receive such evidence as it \n     may deem advisable;\n       (B) use the United States mail in the same manner and upon \n     the same conditions as other departments and agencies of the \n     United States;\n       (C) enter into contracts or agreements for studies and \n     surveys with public and private organizations and transfer \n     funds to federal agencies to carry out such aspects of the \n     Commission's functions as the Commission determines can best \n     be carried out in such manner; and\n       (D) incur such necessary expenses and exercise such other \n     powers as are consistent with and reasonably required to \n     perform its functions.\n       (2) The Secretary of the Interior shall provide such office \n     space, furnishings and equipment as may be required to enable \n     the Commission to perform its functions.

The \n     Chairman may make such provisions as he may deem appropriate \n     authorizing the performance of his executive and \n     administrative functions by the staff of the Commission.\n       (e) Appropriations.--There is authorized to be appropriated \n     such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of \n     this section.\n       (f) Termination.--The Commission shall terminate three \n     months after the transmission of the report and \n     recommendations under subsection (b)(2).\n                                                                    ____\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,\n                                    Washington DC, March 11, 1996.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Recently Senator Akaka and I had the \n     opportunity to meet with President Amata Kabua of the \n     Republic of the Marshall Islands and his Cabinet and later \n     with President Bailey Olter of the Federated States of \n     Micronesia and the Speaker of their legislature. While we had \n     frank and informative meetings, one issue arose in both \n     meetings that we wanted to bring to your attention and \n     request your support.\n       As you know, in 1986, the Republic of the Marshall Islands \n     and the Federated States of Micronesia emerged from the \n     former United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands \n     as sovereign nations in free association with the United \n     States. That status had been requested by the Micronesian \n     governments in the late 1960's and negotiated with the United \n     States over more than a decade. Congress approved the \n     Compacts of Free Association for these two areas in Public \n     Law 99-239, signed by the President on January 14, 1986. That \n     approval came after several years of Congressional \n     consideration.\n       Under the terms of the Compacts, the political relationship \n     is open ended, but the federal assistance provisions \n     terminate after fifteen years, in 2001, with a possible two \n     year extension if negotiations on such assistance have not \n     concluded. Under section 231 of the Compacts, negotiations on \n     those provisions that expire at the end of fifteen years \n     shall commence no later than in year thirteen, in 1999. The \n     leadership in both countries strongly urged that discussions \n     begin prior to that time. I support that request.\n       In addition to the critical strategic and policy interests \n     of the United States in each of these areas, we have \n     developed a close and, I hope, an enduring relationship based \n     on mutually shared values. the political development of the \n     freely associated states and their emergence from the United \n     Nations trusteeship system was done peacefully. The option of \n     free association was a decision made by the Micronesians at a \n     time when full independence was the mark of decolonization \n     elsewhere in the world. While there have been significant \n     developments in the ten years of the Compacts, the process of \n     nation-building is not simple nor without setbacks and \n     problems. The relationship is unique, and while I understand \n     that there are some who find it troubling, I think an honest \n     review would demonstrate that it has exceeded the \n     expectations of all parties.\n       I do have some concerns with how the present relationship \n     has been implemented, not the least of which is the failure \n     of the Department of the Interior to assign an individual to \n     each of the freely associated states to provide assistance \n     and monitor the various federal programs and grants that have \n     been provided despite the clear intent of the Congress in \n     approving section 108 of P.L. 101-219 and explicit \n     appropriations. That is a situation that should be rectified \n     immediately. Some of the present economic problems might have \n     been avoided with a continuing presence from the Department. \n     While I support the Administration's economic policy reforms \n     being carried out in cooperation with the Asian Development \n     Bank, those reforms do not obviate the need for a full time \n     presence from the Department of the Interior in responding to \n     the problems.\n       I think it is clear, however, that the United States has \n     much to offer the micronesian governments consistent with \n     their sovereignty and our fiscal limitations. Technical and \n     other assistance in marine resources and tourism will be \n     important as these countries attempt to develop their \n     economic potential while preserving their culture and \n     traditions. Continued assistance in fiscal management will \n     also be vital.\n       I strongly suggest that you begin consideration of the \n     Administration's policy with respect to future assistance to \n     the freely associated states now and that you do so in close \n     consultation with the Congress. The history of the original \n     approval of the Compacts indicates that the two years \n     provided in section 231 is wholly inadequate for negotiations \n     and Congressional consideration. It would be even worse if \n     the Administration waited any longer to begin to formulate \n     its position.\n       I do want to emphasize the need for close Congressional \n     consultations. This Committee, as well as the relevant House \n     Committees, were involved in the discussions and negotiations \n     that led to the passage of the Covenant for the Northern \n     Mariana Islands and the Compacts for the three freely \n     associated states, and many of our concerns are reflected in \n     the final documents.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              THE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n                                       Washington, April 10, 1996.\n      Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regrading U.S. \n     policy toward the Federated States of Micronesia and the \n     Republic of the Marshall Islands. These former parts of the \n     Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands make an important \n     contribution to our security presence in the Asia-Pacific \n     region.\n       We are working closely with Micronesia and the Marshall \n     Islands to ensure the nearly $2 billion in scheduled U.S. \n     assistance from over forty agencies is effectively and \n     efficiently used. The Interior Department has dedicated \n     substantial personnel resources for this purpose.\n       I look forward to working with you and other members of \n     your committee to support the exciting process of nation-\n     building that is taking place in these former parts of the \n     Trust Territories.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Bill Clinton.\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON, Mr. President, I am pleased to join in the \nintroduction of this legislation that will address several important \nareas of concern in the territories and freely associated states. Many \nof the provisions result from a recent trip that the chairman of the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, Senator Murkowski, and \nSenator Akaka recently took to most of the Pacific insular areas.\n  It is almost 24 years since I first came to the Senate and assumed \nthe chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Territories of the then \nCommittee on Interior and Insular Affairs. I thought it was important \nto visit the areas under the committee's jurisdiction and meet with the \nleadership. There is nothing that can replace that first-hand \nknowledge. Given the enormous workload of the committee and the \ncritical nature of the legislation before us, it is often easy to \noverlook the needs of the territories and freely associated states. I \nsincerely hope that other members of the committee will also visit \nthese areas and come to appreciate the unique needs and problems that \nconfront the residents. The responsibility for these areas is one of \nthose unique constitutional authorities entrusted to Congress by \narticle IV.\n  In the time that I have been involved with the insular areas, \nCongress has enacted legislation providing full local self-government \nto the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa--including the election \nof non-voting delegates to the House of Representatives. We have also \nterminated the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, leader to the \nemergence of three sovereign nations in free association with the \nUnited States and a fully locally self-governing territory--the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. I also had the privilege \nof serving on the Ad Hoc Advisory Group of Puerto Rico with our former \ncolleague Marlow Cook and former Governor Luis Munoz Marin.\n\n  I want to focus on one provision of this legislation, and that is the \nstudy of the future economic needs of the Virgin Islands. Since 1960, \nthe Virgin Islands has experienced enormous growth and development. In \nlarge part, that growth resulted from increased tourism after the \nclosure of Cuba and also from improved transportation links to the \nIslands. Another component was the favorable trade status of the Virgin \nIslands, which is outside the customs territory of the United States. \nThose underpinnings are about to disappear. NAFTA and other trade \nagreements are eroding the trade advantages that the Virgin Islands has \nenjoyed. Within the foreseeable future, we will have a post-Castro Cuba \nthat will likely challenge the Virgin Islands tourist industry. Rather \nthan waiting for those events to happen, it is essential that we--the \nVirgin Islands and the federal government--begin to plan for the \nfuture. This legislation calls for the creation of a Commission on the \nEconomic Future of the Virgin Islands. The Commission would carry out \nan in-depth study of what will need to be done to provide a transition \nfor the Virgin Islands to a fully self-sustaining local economy and \nwhat the federal government needs to do to facilitate that transition.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation and I look forward to the \nhearings that the Committee will conduct\n\n[[Page S5579]]\n\nin the next several weeks. At that time we will also review the report \nfrom the Administration on the law enforcement initiative in the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. I was the floor manager \nfor the Covenant, and I take particular pride in the accomplishments \nthat have occurred in the past twenty years. The Northern Marianas \nentered territorial status heavily dependent on federal support for \nbasic government operations. In twenty years, the territory has \nprogressed to the point that it no longer requires direct assistance in \noperations and is capable of matching federal grants for capital \ninfrastructure. That progress has had a price, however, and I intend to \nvery carefully examine the labor situation and the continued reports of \nabuse, especially in the garment industry. While I fully support the \nauthority for local self-government conferred under the Covenant, that \ngrant also included the responsibility for exercising that authority \nproperly.\n  In that context, on July 20, 1995, the Senate passed S. 638, a bill \ncontaining, among other things, significant provisions addressing labor \nissues in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The House \nhas not yet responded to this important legislative initiative. My hope \nis that we can obtain House action on S. 638 soon--in time for the \n104th Congress to act to address these problems.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRAMS:\n  S. 1805. A bill to provide for the management of Voyageurs National \nPark, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n       voyageurs national park accessibility and partnership act\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, there is a march toward democracy afoot in \nAmerica today.\n  That statement may seem surprising; after all, why would such a \nmovement be needed? We Americans take pride in the fact that our \nGovernment is based on the pursuit of democracy--in the words of \nAbraham Lincoln, ``a government of the people, by the people and for \nthe people.'' And that principle should have as much relevance today as \nit did when President Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address 130 \nyears ago--but does it?\n  In theory perhaps, but as a practical matter, it seems that the words \nof Lincoln have been steadily eroded by the recent surge in the size \nand power of the Federal Government. And with that growth in Washington \nhas come the slow but unmistakable shift in power from the people to \nthe government.\n  Under a democracy, government is needed to establish and enforce the \nfundamental rules by which our society operates--with the express \nsupport of the people. It is there to protect the rights of individuals \nand to step in when those rights come into conflict--to resolve \ndisputes between people, not to create them.\n  But in recent years, the American people have been forced to watch \nGovernment expand its role in our daily lives through the use of laws, \nrules, and regulations--to the point of interference. Instead of \nreceiving its power from the people, it has usurped that authority and \nas a result, abandoned any sense of public accountability.\n  As a result, many people believe that they have lost control of their \nGovernment--indeed a growing number of us feel that the Government now \ncontrols us.\n  There is no better example of this shift in power than in the Federal \nGovernment's management of our natural resources and public lands, \nparticularly as it has affected the people of my home state in the \ncontroversy surrounding Voyageurs National Park.\n  The Park, now comprising 218,000 acres in northern Minnesota, was \ncreated in 1971 and established as part of the National Park System in \n1975 following years of contentious debate and public hearings. While a \nnumber of local residents supported the creation of the park, they did \nso after promises by the Federal Government of increased economic \ngrowth in the region; maintenance of the Park as a multiple \nrecreational use facility, for recreational activities like \nsnowmobiling; and the continued use of input from the public into the \nmanagement of the park.\n  But as the years passed, those promises fell by the wayside, leaving \nlocal residents out in the cold and understandably distrustful of \ngovernment bureaucrats who have been unaccountable to the people they \nare supposed to serve and unresponsive to their needs. Instead of \nworking for the people, the Federal Government has consistently ignored \ntheir concerns and in some cases, actually worked against them.\n  For example, the people of northern Minnesota were promised that in \nexchange for giving up their rights to the land that would comprise the \nPark, they would receive opportunities to boost their local economy. In \nfact, upon creation of the Park, Federal officials estimated that it \nwould host over 1.3 million visitors each year, thereby providing much-\nneeded economic growth for the surrounding communities.\n  But the road toward economic prosperity never found its way through \nVoyageurs National Park. Park officials currently estimate the annual \nnumber of visitors at 200,000--less than one-sixth their initial \nprojection. Even worse, the Park Service has tried to cover its tracks \nby suggesting that the park--despite its low visitor rate--is not \nunderutilized.\n  While the facts and figures certainly counter the Park Service's \nassertion, nothing beats a first-hand assessment of park use. So, on a \nbeautiful Saturday last July, I visited Voyageurs National Park. While \nadmiring the beauty and historical significance of the lands and waters \nenclosed within the park, I was struck by the fact that hardly anyone--\nwith the exception of park officials and a few scattered visitors--was \nthere. It was only when I drove through the neighboring city of \nInternational Falls, MN, that I did see a number of tourists and \nvisitors--in line--waiting to pass through customs--on their way to \nCanada.\n  In 1983, Congress called for the Park Service to create a \ncomprehensive visitor use and facilities plan which would lay out a \nstrategy to increase park use. In spite of Congress' directive, no \nattempt to carry out the study ever occurred--perhaps due to the Park \nService's belief that the park was not being underutilized, \nbureaucratic stonewalling, or maybe just out of simple \nnegligence. Whatever the reason, Voyageurs National Park today remains \nunderutilized--an isolated enclave--with the people of northern \nMinnesota forced to pay the price of the National Park Service's \nmismanagement.\n\n  The Park Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have also \nworked together to curtail legitimate visitor access to and use in the \nPark. Under the guise of the Endangered Species Act, certain bays were \nshut off to snowmobiling in order to protect the nesting habitat of \nbald eagles. While everyone agreed that the eagles should be protected, \nmany believed that both agencies failed to give valid, scientific \nreasons for closing off the bays. Recently, a Federal district judge \nruled that Federal bureaucrats had abused the Endangered Species Act to \nunfairly restrict snowmobile access in the bays. It is sadly ironic \nthat it took a Federal judge to recognize a legitimate use in the \nPark--something the Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service have \nfailed to comprehend.\n  But perhaps the greatest example of arrogance on the part of the \nFederal Government concerns the question of wilderness designation \nwithin the Park. Despite the clearly expressed intent of Congress that \nVoyageurs National Park was to be a multiple recreational use facility, \nthe Park Service has continued to manage certain portions of the Park \nfor wilderness study characteristics. One need go no further than to \nask my colleague from Minnesota, Representative Jim Oberstar, who \nhelped create the Park when he served as a Congressional staffer, about \nthe intent of Congress that it was to be open for multiple use. Yet, \nmajor segments of the Park continue to be shut off to legitimate and \nrecognized multiple uses--such as snowmobiling, boating and dog \nsledding--further breaking the long-standing commitments made to \nnorthern Minnesotans.\n  Mr. President, as much as we would like to, we cannot rewrite the \nhistory of Voyageurs National Park or simply wave a magic wand to right \nthe wrongs to which the people of northern Minnesota have been \nsubjected over the last 25 years. But we can and must take action to \nensure that history does not repeat itself--that future management\n\n[[Page S5580]]\n\nof the Park be conducted in accordance with the views of the people.\n  For that reason, today, I am introducing legislation which would help \nresolve this controversy by bringing democracy and government \naccountability back to Voyageurs National Park.\n  Under my legislation, a new Planning and Management Council will be \ncharged with developing and monitoring a comprehensive management plan. \nIt will consist of 11 members appointed by the Secretary of the \nInterior and will include representatives from Federal, State, local \nand tribal governments.\n  The management council will be authorized to create Advisory Councils \nmade up of individuals representing diverse interests. All council \nmeetings will be open to the public, who will be given opportunities to \nprovide comment on agenda items.\n  Mr. President, under my bill, public input will no longer be \nignored--in fact, it will be encouraged as part of the management \nprocess.\n  Finally, my legislation will prohibit the Park Service from issuing \nany additional regulations regarding the Park between enactment of this \nbill and the Secretary's final approval of the management plan, except \nin cases of routine administration, law enforcement need and \nemergencies.\n  To better understand how this new management council will improve the \nsituation in northern Minnesota, one need look no further than the \nrecent ban that was proposed by the National Park Service on the use of \nlive bait within the interior lakes of Voyageurs National Park--one \nimposed without the solicitation of public input or notification to \narea fisherman and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.\n  This unilateral action taken by the Park Service naturally created \nenormous controversy and outrage in northern Minnesota. As one State \nofficial said at the time, ``It was a big surprise to us * * *. There \nwas no prior discussion with us on the ban. There's a longstanding \ntradition in the park of being able to use live bait.''\n  After many of us raised our objections and outrage over the ban, the \nPark Service backpedaled, then lifted the ban, stating that it had \nmisread the law. In doing so, the Superintendent of the Park was quoted \nin the papers saying, ``I had no idea this was going to be a problem. \nIf I had known, trust me, I would have dealt with it differently.''\n  Mr. President, think about those words for a second. According to the \nPark Service, if they had just known, they never would have tried to \nimpose their will on the people. If they had just known, just listened, \njust sought input, none of this would have happened. That is exactly \nwhat we are seeking today.\n  My legislation would avoid such embarrassments in the future by \nbringing everyone together to ensure that management of the Park is \nconducted by agreement, not edict. It will ensure that everyone has a \nseat at the table when the decisions are made. Above all, this new \nmanagement council will return democracy to the preservation of \nVoyageurs National Park. It will return to the people of northern \nMinnesota a voice in how the park is operated and its impact on their \ncommunities, economy and livelihood.\n\n  Mr. President, I spoke earlier today of a growing movement toward \ndemocracy in America--born in the heartland of our Nation, led by the \nAmerican people, and headed toward Washington. Since holding two public \nfield hearings in Minnesota on this issue last year, I have heard from \nnumerous citizen organizations, community leaders, and average \nMinnesotans about the management of the park and how their daily lives \nare affected by it.\n  Their message is simple: Let us have a say in how our natural \nresources are maintained--return some of the power to the people--give \nus back our government and our country. The silent majority, which has \nbeen suppressed for so many years, is now finding its voice again--and \nit is our responsibility to listen to it and act upon it. By conducting \nour field hearings, which attracted well over 2,000 Minnesotans, we \ntook the first step by listening. Now, we must move ahead and take \naction.\n  During those hearings, I heard a number of people give profound and \noften moving testimony. Many presented facts and figures--invaluable \ndata about the history and management about the park. But what struck \nme the most during the hearings were the personal stories--the real-\nlife accounts about how the Federal Government and its mismanagement of \nVoyageurs National Park has truly changed the lives of the people it \nwas created to serve.\n  One of these stories belonged to Carol Selsaas of Cohasset, MN. In \nher testimony, Carol described the work of her late father, George \nEsslinger, who was one of the strongest supporters in northern \nMinnesota for the creation of Voyageurs National Park.\n  Carol said:\n\n       For over 9 years, my father worked with other men and women \n     to fight for the creation of the park. He assisted the \n     Department of the Interior in physically identifying the \n     boundaries of the park. He traveled and spoke in favor of the \n     park. He gave his heart and soul to the park. He believed the \n     area he supported for a national park should be maintained \n     for the enjoyment of all people: snowmobilers, cross country \n     skiers, boaters, hikers, fishermen, hunters, yes and even dog \n     sledders. He felt that this would be a park for everyone who \n     had respect for this land, not one locked up except for a \n     chosen few.\n\n  Carol went on to describe how her father supported the park with the \nunderstanding that the trails and roads already established--over 200 \nmiles on the Kabetogama Peninsula alone-- would be maintained. To date, \nall but 12 miles are now closed off to public access. On one of those \nclosed off trails, Carol said, rests a memorial to her father placed by \nthe Park Service. With tears in her eyes, she said that because of the \ninaccessibility of the trail, she has never been able to visit her \nfather's memorial.\n  ``My father died knowing that he had been lied to,'' said Carol. ``He \ndied apologizing to me, his grandson, his community. On his death bed, \nI promised that I would fulfill his wish and tell the story of how he \nwas misled in his support for Voyageurs National Park.''\n  Indeed, she did--as did many other of my fellow Minnesotans. We \ncannot forget their words or discard their testimonies. In the sterile \nhalls of the Federal buildings here in Washington, the words of Carol \nSelsaas and others may not mean much, but to me, they describe the \nheartfelt emotions and passions about the culture of northern \nMinnesota--a culture that Washington may not understand, but cannot \ntake for granted.\n  Nor can we hide in the halls of Congress from the march of democracy \nthat is spreading throughout the heartland of our country. If we are \ntruly committed to operating as the open democracy described by \nPresident Lincoln, we must turn the tide and return power back to its \nlegitimate source in America: the people.\n  The legislation I introduce today is a necessary step in bringing the \nprinciples of democracy back to one small, but important region of our \nNation. Let us no longer obstruct the march of democracy but help pave \nthe way for it across America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the test of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1805\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nclarify that any dietary supplement that claims to produce euphoria, \nheightened awareness or similar mental or psychological effects shall \nbe treated as a drug under the Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n               Legislation to Control Herbal Street Drugs\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation--along with my colleagues Senators Dodd and Frist--to \ncontrol the growing problem of dangerous herbal stimulants that are \nmarketed and sold as alternatives to powerful and illegal street drugs. \nThis carefully-drafted bill will make these herbal street drugs subject \nto pre-market safety reviews and allow the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the FDA, to take prompt and decisive action against \nthis narrow class of products.\n  I strongly support the right of the American people to have access to \nlegitimate dietary supplements, and I want to clearly state that this \nbill will not limit that access. However, herbal street drugs are not \nlegitimate dietary supplements. They are quite simply dangerous \nproducts masquerading as dietary supplements to evade Government review \nand sanctions.\n  Mr. President, on March 7, 1996, one of these products, called \nUltimate Xphoria, killed 20-year-old Peter Schlendorf of Northport, NY. \nPeter, a junior at the State University of New York at Albany, died \nfrom a lethal combination of herbal stimulants found in this product. A \nstatement issued by the medical examiner's office in Panama City, FL, \nwhere Peter died, specifically states that Peter's death ``was a result \nof the use of Ultimate Xphoria, an herbal product containing Ma \nHuang.'' Ma Huang--also known as Ephedra--is a botanical source of the \npowerful stimulant ephedrine. The medical examiner's statement lists \nPeter's cause of death as the ``synergistic effect of ephedrine'' and \nseveral other herbal stimulants contained in this product. The \nstatement further explains that these stimulants ``can have an adverse \neffect on the heart and central nervous system.''\n  Mr. President, I am committed to doing everything that I can to \nensure that no more young people die from these dangerous herbal street \ndrugs. And let me be perfectly clear: if Congress fails to act, it will \njust be a matter of time before these products kill more young people.\n  This is a battle to protect our children. The slick peddlers of these \nherbal street drugs have specifically targeted young people. They sell \ntheir products in novelty shops, using flashy signs and posters that \nappeal to and attract adolescents. They give their products names like \nCloud 9, Herbal Ecstacy, Ultimate Xphoria, Magic Mushrooms and E-Ludes.\n  Using the Internet and showy brochures, they hawk their dangerous \nwares with promises of ``euphoric stimulation, highly increased energy \nlevels, tingly skin sensations, increased sexual sensations, enhanced \nsensory processing and mood elevations.'' One product, called Herbal \nEcstacy, even claims that it is ``a carefully formulated and thoroughly \ntested organic alternative to actual MDMA or Ecstacy''--a dangerous, \nillegal street drug. The marketing brochure for this product further \nstates that it ``acts on the same basis as MDMA, triggering similar, \nbut not identical, physical reactions in the body.'' This is just \noutrageous.\n  In addition, many of these products falsely claim to be safe and \ntested. Some are even advertised as ``100 percent and FDA approved'' \nand as ``100 percent natural . . . with no side effects''. As Peter's \ndeath clearly demonstrates, however, these products can be deadly, and \nnone are FDA-approved. How can the producers of these herbal street \ndrugs claim that they are safe and tested when they can produce such \ntragic results? This is wrong and must be stopped.\n  The manner in which these products are marketed invites misuse by \nunsuspecting young people. These products are advertised as \nalternatives to street drugs. They are intended to get young people \nhigh. And what happens when the recommended dosage doesn't achieve the \ndesired high? Then, the claims that these products are safe, natural \nand thoroughly tested lure young people into taking larger dosages. \nIndeed, some sellers are telling people to take two, three and four \ntimes the recommended dosage to achieve the desired high.\n  Mr. President, the legislation that I am introducing today will help \nto ensure that no more young people die from these dangerous products. \nThe bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to clarify \nthat a dietary supplement shall be considered a drug if its label or \nlabeling claims or implies that the dietary supplement produces \neuphoria, heightened awareness or similar mental or psychological \neffects. As a result, this narrow class of dangerous products will be \nsubject to the same premarket safety reviews as other drugs, and the \nFDA will have enhanced authority to take prompt and decisive action \nagainst them. Now, the FDA will be able to quickly pull these herbal \nstreet drugs, like the one that killed Peter Schlendorf, from stores \nbefore they kill again. This legislation is necessary to protect the \nhealth of the American public, particularly its youth, who are \nobviously the target of these dangerous herbal street drugs.\n\n  Again, let me clearly state that this bill has been carefully drafted \nto maintain the public's continued access to legitimate dietary \nsupplements. For example, it will not limit access to either over-the-\ncounter drugs, such as Sudafed, or legitimate dietary supplements, such \nas herbal teas, that contain ephedra or its related products.\n  I am certain that no Member of Congress envisioned that the Dietary \nSupplement Health and Education Act of 1994--the Dietary Supplement \nAct--would protect dangerous products like these herbal street drugs, \nbut these products are currently covered by the literal language of \nthat act. Since these products are considered dietary\n\n[[Page S5583]]\n\nsupplements under current law, the FDA's authority to regulate them is \nsignificantly limited. For example, these products are not currently \nsubject to premarket safety reviews. In addition, the FDA cannot \nregulate herbal street drugs as a class, but instead must take action \nagainst each product individually. Indeed, the FDA must prove that a \nparticular formulation of an herbal street drug ``presents a \nsignificant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury'' before it can \ntake any action against the product. This is a lengthy process that can \ntake years.\n  Moreover, under current law, an herbal street drug manufacturer can \neasily evade an FDA enforcement action simply by changing the \ncomposition of its product, while continuing to make the same labeling \nclaims for drug-like mental and psychological effects. Each time the \nproduct formula changes, the FDA must evaluate the new formula and \nbuild its case from the beginning. The product formula thus becomes a \nmoving target that the FDA must chase. The FDA should not have to chase \nherbal street drugs.\n  Some will argue that this legislation is unnecessary and that the FDA \nalready has the authority to take action against herbal street drugs, \nbut the clever producers and marketers of these herbal street drugs \nhave been careful to take advantage of the protections afforded \nlegitimate dietary supplements under the Dietary Supplement Act. For \nexample, under that act, a dietary supplement is not subject to \nregulation as a drug simply because its label or labeling bears a \ntruthful, nonmisleading claim regarding its effect on the body. This \nprovision significantly limits the FDA's ability to take action against \nthe peddlers of herbal street drugs who use carefully worded labels to \nevade FDA review and control.\n  Other options available to the FDA would also be ineffective against \nherbal street drugs. For example, the Dietary Supplement Act gives the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services the authority to declare that a \ndietary supplement poses an imminent hazard to public health or safety. \nOnce such a declaration is made, the dietary supplement can be banned. \nA formal imminent hazard declaration requires lengthy formal rulemaking \nprocedures, however, including a trial-type hearing before an \nadministrative law judge. In addition, because what sells an herbal \nstreet drug is its claims rather than its ingredients, the imminent \nhazard declaration can easily be defeated by a formulation change \nwithout any label change. One can easily imagine the slick peddlers of \nthese products switching a single ingredient--for example, from ephedra \nto kava-kava, another powerful herbal stimulant--just as the FDA is \nknocking on their door.\n  Mr. President, the marketing of herbal street drugs as dietary \nsupplements, rather than as drugs, does not promote any of the goals \nidentified by Congress in the Dietary Supplement Act. That act was \nintended to promote the public health. Congressional findings in \nsection 2 of the act cite the role of a healthy diet, including safe \ndietary supplements in disease prevention, long-term good health, and \nreducing health care costs. Far from promoting the public health, \nherbal street drugs endanger the health and safety of consumers and \ngive rise to unnecessary medical costs.\n  These dangerous products are not taken for nutritional purposes or to \notherwise improve health and thus are not within the intended coverage \nof the Dietary Supplement Act. The manufacturers of herbal street drugs \nshould not be permitted to abuse the Dietary Supplement Act by using it \nto legitimize the marketing of dangerous products. A narrowly drafted \nstatutory amendment to correct the inclusion of herbal street drugs in \nthe language of the act would achieve the intent of Congress by closing \na loophole that Congress never intended to create.\n  Herbal street drugs killed young Peter Schlendorf. We have to make \nsure that this does not happen again. We have carefully drafted this \nlegislation to target the narrow class of products that killed Peter--\nproducts that are being marketed and sold to young people as safe and \nlegal alternatives to dangerous, illegal street drugs. We must take \naction quickly. I urge my fellow Senators to support this effort and \nquickly pass this legislation. If we wait, herbal street drugs will end \nmore promising, young lives.\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor this very \nimportant legislation with my colleagues, Senators D'amato and Frist. \nIn my view, the legislation is necessary to protect the American \npublic, and particularly our Nation's youth, from what amount to common \nstreet drugs.\n  The makers of these products make no attempt to sell them as products \nto improve health or nutrition. The products carry names like ``Herbal \nEcstacy,'' ``Ultimate X-Phoria,'' and ``Cloud 9.'' One product claims \n``It is a carefully formulated and thoroughly tested organic \nalternative to actual MDMA or Ecstacy.'' I hardly think any of us \nbelieve that our Nation's children should be able to go into any \nnovelty store and buy the equivalent of a powerful, dangerous, and I \nmight add, illegal street drug.\n  Let me share with you the claims and promotional language of these \nproducts, lest there be any doubt what there purpose is for:\n\n       The effects of Herbal Ecstacy beyond smart drug capacity \n     include: Euphoric stimulation; highly increased energy \n     levels; tingly skin sensations; enhanced sensory processing; \n     mood elevations.\n       Herbal Ecstacy acts on the same basis as MDMA, triggering \n     similar but not identical physical reactions in the body.\n       Our herbs are 100% natural and are uniquely formulated to \n     give you a floaty, energetic, mind expanding, euphoric \n     experience.\n\n  And listen to what is presented on a brochure as endorsements by \nusers:\n\n       They don't call it ``ultimate'' for nothing!\n       This puts everything else I've tried to shame!!\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I guess we might feel differently if we knew \nthese products were without risk. But the fact is, they have proven \ndeadly. Peter Schlendorf, a 20-year-old from York, FL, died because he \ntook one of these products. The cause of death was identified by the \nmedical examiner's office in the Florida town where Peter died.\n  The makers of these products claim they are nutritional supplements, \nlegitimately sold and promoted. They point to a law passed a couple of \nyears ago that was meant to govern legitimate dietary supplements, that \nimprove health and nutrition. But make no mistake. These products do \nnothing to improve health and nutrition.\n  So, the legislation we are proposing today is very simple. It says \nthat products claiming to produce euphoria, heightened awareness or \nsimilar mental or psychological effects shall be treated as a drug. It \nwould make the products subject to the same review, by the U.S. Food \nand Drug Administration, as other drugs. The products are not banned. \nAnd the bill will have no effect on legitimate dietary supplements. It \nonly will affect products that are marketed and sold as alternatives to \npowerful street drugs.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that we can act quickly on this \nlegislation and prevent the kind of tragedy experienced by the \nSchlendorfs.\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to join my \ndistinguished colleague from New York in introducing legislation to \naddress an alarming problem facing our children today.\n  A new class of street drugs is endangering our Nation's young people. \nThese products are being portrayed as safe, natural alternatives to \nillegal street drugs, but they are far from safe.\n  As a medical doctor who specialized in heart ailments, I am familiar \nwith the powerful and even life-threatening effect some of these \nproducts can have on the human heart and central nervous system. And as \nthe father of three young boys of the ages 8, 10 and 12, I am outraged \nat the way these products are being blatantly marketed toward children \nand young adults.\n  Therefore, I have joined Senators D'Amato and Dodd in introducing a \nbill that will control the growing problem of herbal street drugs. This \nbill will classify as drugs products marketed and sold, particularly to \nyoung people, as alternatives to illegal street drugs. As a result \nthese products will be subject to the same Federal review and sanctions \nas other pharmaceuticals.\n  This bill will not limit public access to legitimate dietary \nsupplements and over-the-counter medications. It is not drafted to \nlimit public access to products that contain particular ingredients. \nThe producers of legitimate products that make truthful claims about \ntheir product have nothing to fear from\n\n[[Page S5584]]\n\nthis bill. To the contrary, they should support the intent of this bill \nbecause it addresses the problem of unscrupulous manufacturers who are \ngiving the dietary supplement industry a bad name and abusing the very \nlaws which permit dietary supplement manufacturers to place truthful \nand nonmisleading claims on their products.\n  These herbal street drugs pose significant health risks to consumers. \nThese products are marketed under a variety of brand names, including \nCloud 9, Herbal Ecstasy and Ultimate Xphoria, with labels that claim or \nimply that they produce such effects as euphoria, heightened awareness \nand other effects. These labels often portray the products as legal \nalternatives to illegal street drugs such as ``ecstasy.'' ``Ecstasy'' \nis the street name for MDMA (4-methyl-2, dimethoxyamphetamine), which \nproduces euphoria.\n  These products often contain botanical sources of ephedrine. \nEphedrine is an amphetamine-like stimulant that can have potentially \ndangerous effects on the heart and central nervous system. Possible \nadverse effects range from clinically significant effects such as heart \nattack, stroke, seizures, psychosis and death, to clinically less \nsignificant effects that may indicate the potential for more serious \neffects. These effects can include dizziness, headache, \ngastrointestinal distress, irregular heartbeat, and heart palpitations. \nThe labels on these herbal street drugs may list one or more ephedrine-\ncontaining ingredients, including ma huang, Chinese ephedra, ma huang \nextract, ephedra, Ephedra sinica, ephedra extract, ephedra herb powder, \nepitonin or ephedrine.\n  Ephedrine and its related products are also available in many \nlegitimate forms that will not be affected by this bill. For example, \nephedrine can be useful for treating mild forms of seasonal or chronic \nasthma and is also FDA-approved for treating enursesis hypotension, \nnasal congestion and sisustitis.\n  According to a statement by the Panama City, Florida medical \nexaminer, 20-year-old Peter Schlendorf died ``as a result of the use of \nUltimate Xphoria, an herbal product containing Ma Huang''. Peter's \ncause of death was listed as the ``synergistic effect of ephedrine, \npseudo-ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine and caffeine''. There is no \nquestion that this combination of stimulants can have an adverse effect \non the heart and central nervous system.\n  As lawmakers, we have a responsibility to make sure that no more \nyoung people die from these herbal street drugs. This bill provokes \ndebate on this important issue. I have already been contacted by a \nmajor trade association, the Council for Responsible Nutrition [CRN], \nand the Nutritional Health Alliance, an industry and consumer \ncoalition, expressing a desire to work with us to reach an effective \nsolution to this issue. I urge all interested parties to come to the \ntable and address the serious consequences of allowing these herbal \nstreet drugs to fall into the hands of our children.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 1807. A bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, \nregarding the Kake Tribal Corporation public interest land exchange; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                     kake land exchange legislation\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce the Kake \nTribal Land Exchange Act on behalf of myself and Senator Stevens. This \nlegislation would amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act which \nauthorized the transfer of 23,040 acres of land from the U.S. \nGovernment to Kake Tribal Corporation.\n  The land was transferred to Kake to recognize ``an immediate need for \na fair and just settlement''\n  Unfortunately, Kake has not received the full beneficial use of its \n23,040 acres because the city's watershed--over 2,400 acres--rest \nwithin Kake Tribal's lands. In order to protect the city's watershed \nand still receive beneficial use of their 23,040 acres we are proposing \nan acre-for-acre land exchange. This will assist the people of Kake, \nAK, as they move toward a safer, cleaner, and healthier future.\n  Under this proposal, Kake Tribal would exchange the watershed for \n2,427 acres in southeast Alaska, thereby allowing Kake to receive its \nfull entitlement under ANCSA. This legislation is of great importance \nto the residents of the community of Kake, AK.\n  This legislation will ensure protection of the Gunnuk Creek watershed \nwhich is the main water supply for the city of Kake as well as protect \ncritical habitat for the Gunnuk Creek hatchery.\n  The legislation has received wide support in Alaska from diverse \ngroups such as: The Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, the city of \nKake, AK, the Organized Village of Kake, the Kake non-profit fishery, \nthe Alaska Federation of Natives, and Sealaska Corporation.\n  Additionally, the Governor of Alaska has written to me in support of \nthis exchange. Attached are copies of some of the letters of support I \nhave received for the record at this time.\n  Because this is an acre-for-acre exchange there will be no cost to \nthe Federal Government. I introduced this legislation with the \nconfidence that it is in the best interest of not only the citizens of \nKake but with the knowledge that it is in the best interest of all \nAmericans to protect drinking water for our communities. Lastly, this \nlegislation will help fulfill our commitment to the Natives of Alaska \nthat they will be treated fairly and justly under the Alaska Native \nClaims Settlement Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1807\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Kake Tribal Corporation Land \n     Exchange Act.''\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Act of October 15, 1966 (80 stat. 915), \nas amended, establishing a program for the preservation of additional \nhistoric property throughout the Nation, and for other purpose; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n  the national historic preservation act of 1966 amendment act of 1996\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Johnston \nand myself, I introduce a bill to amend the National Historic \nPreservation Act of 1966, that, when enacted, will continue the \nappropriations authorization for the Advisory Council on Historic \nPreservation.\n  Established in 1966, the Council is an independent Federal agency \nresponsible for advising the President and the Congress on historic \npreservation matters and commenting to Federal agencies on the effects \nof their activities upon historic properties.\n  Mr. President, over the past three decades, the Congress has made a \nsubstantial commitment to the preservation and encouragement of our \nnational heritage. Established by the National Historic Preservation \nAct, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has served to \nimprove the effectiveness and coordination of public and private \nefforts in historic preservation.\n  Historic preservation safeguards physical links to the past. It is \nthrough these links that our important cultural resources are preserved \nand passed on to succeeding generations. Destruction of our significant \ncultural and historic resources serves no purpose. Our memory of \nimportant history only becomes more difficult without the various \nfabrics to view, touch and or experience.\n  Congress recognized this principle in the National Historic \nPreservation Act of 1966: ``The historical and cultural foundations of \nthe nation should be preserved as a living part of our community life \nand development in order to give a sense of orientation to the American \npeople.''\n  Mr. President, in addition to many educational programs, one of the \nmost important functions of the Advisory Council is mediating between \nany Federal agency issuing a permit and the individual who is planning \nto develop his property. Under the terms of Section 106 of the National \nHistoric Preservation Act, the Council seeks to negotiate a memorandum \nof agreement in such cases, setting forth what will be done to reduce \nor avoid and adverse effects the undertaking will have.\n  While the section 106 process has often been described as contentious \nby private property rights advocates and others, I believe the Advisory \nCouncil can and should serve as a solution to resolving conflicts \nbetween a sometimes over-reaching bureaucracy and the individual \nproperty owner.\n  It is my hope that the committee hearing process will shed light on \nthe problems, address the issues, as well as the successes of the \nCouncil; and that we can move forward on this important program in a \npositive and constructive manner.\n  The Council's appropriations authorization expires with the current \nfiscal year. This legislation will authorize the continuing work of the \nCouncil by providing appropriations authority from fiscal year 1997 \nthrough fiscal year 2002.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1808\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled, That the Act of October 15, 1966 (80 Stat. 915), \n     as amended (16 U.S.C. Section 470 et seq.) is further amended \n     as follows:\n       (a) Section 212(a) is amended by deleting the last sentence \n     and inserting in lieu thereof the sentence ``There are \n     authorized to be appropriated not to exceed $5,000,000 in \n     each fiscal year 1997 through 2002.''\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1809. A bill entitled the ``Aleutian World War II National \nHistoric Areas Act of 1996''; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n     THE ALEUTIAN WORLD WAR II NATIONAL HISTORIC AREAS ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I introduce a bill entitled the \n``Aleutian World War II National Historic Areas Act of 1996.''\n  Mr. President, the Ounalashka Corporation is the Alaska Native \nvillage corporation for the Unalaska region of the Western Aleutian \nIslands. The Corporation is the major land owner of Amaknak Island, \nwhere the City of Unalaska is located. The Corporation has been working \nclosely with municipal officials of the City of Unalaska to identify \nCorporation land which would be Federally recognized and designated as \na unique ``historic area''.\n  Many have forgotten that during World War II, Unalaska came under \nattack. Unalaska was raided and bombed by Japanese aircraft in one of \nthe few sieges on U.S. territory. This area of Amaknak Island was \nheavily fortified, and much of the original bunkers, tunnels, and \nbuildings remain. The Corporation owns the majority of land and \nfacilities occupied by U.S. military forces on Amaknak Island during \nthe war.\n  The area is rich in history and memories. In recent years World War \nII veterans who were stationed in Unalaska, and in some cases family \nmembers, have made pilgrimages back to honor fallen friends and relive \nthe past.\n  In addition to the historic significance of Unalaska during the War, \nthere is also a compelling story of the Aleutian Islands indigenous \npeople which is not well known. Alaska Native people from 23 villages \nwere evacuated from the region during the War, and many were interned \nin relocation camps. As a result of the devastating bombing by the \nJapanese, the city of Unalaska was the only village that was re-\ninhabited following the World War II effort.\n  The Aleut people made substantial contributions to the war effort and \nyet suffered hardships similar to those of the Japanese-Americans \nthroughout the war.\n  The Corporation, the City of Unalaska, and many historians believe \nthat the history of the Aleut people and the war effort in the region \nare\n\n[[Page S5586]]\n\nintertwined. In response to the increased interest of the World War II \nveterans and their survivors who have visited Unalaska, the Corporation \nis considering constructing a World War II Historic Center on the \nIsland of Amaknak to tell this unique, but little known history of the \nwar in the Aleutians and the Aleut people to the rest of the world.\n  Mr. President, this legislation, when enacted, will establish the \n``Aleutian World War II National Historic Area''. I am very cognizant \nof the adverse effects that new units of the National Park System can \ncreate on existing units of the System. This legislation provides us \nwith a unique opportunity to work with and for the private sector in \nthe development and operation of this important historic resources.\n  There will be no land acquisition or day-to-day operational expenses \nnormally associated with other units of the National Park System. The \nOunakashka Corporation has exclusive ownership and control of the \nlands, buildings and historic structures which would comprise the \nhistoric area.\n  The Corporation is not seeking land exchanges with the Department of \nthe Interior and does not desire to convey or encumber title to, or \ncontrol of, its lands to the Federal Government. The Corporation only \nwants to work with the Federal Government to save this significant \npiece of the history of the United States. The expense to the National \nPark Service would be minimal, and would consist of technical \nassistance and training. The contribution to the public will be a \nhistoric site that is preserved for the enjoyment and education of all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1809\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Aleutian World War II \n     National Historic Areas Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to designate and preserve the \n     Aleutian World War II National Historic Area within lands \n     owned by the Ounalaska Corporation on the island of Amaknak, \n     Alaska and to provide for the interpretation, for the \n     educational and inspirational benefit of present and future \n     generations, of the unique and significant circumstances \n     involving the history of the Aleut people, and the role of \n     the Aleut people and the Aleutian Islands in the defense of \n     the United States in World War II.\n\n     SEC. 3. BOUNDARIES.\n\n       The Aleutian World War II National Historic Area shall be \n     comprised of areas on Amaknak island depicted on the map \n     entitled ``Aleutian World War II National Historic Area''.\n\n     SEC. 4. TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall--\n       (a) authorize the conveyance of lands between the Ounalaska \n     Corporation and the U.S. Department of the Interior, nor \n     remove land or structures appurtenant to the land from the \n     exclusive control of the Ounalaska Corporation; or\n       (b) provide authority for the Department of the Interior to \n     assume the duties associated with the daily operation of the \n     Historic Area or any of its facilities or structures.\n\n     SEC. 5. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior may award grants and provide \n     technical assistance to the Ounalaska Corporation and the \n     City of Unalaska to assist with the planning, development, \n     and historic preservation from any program funds authorized \n     by law for technical assistance, land use planning or \n     historic preservation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1810. A bill to expand the boundary of the Snoqualmie National \nForest and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n     the snoqualmie national forest boundary adjustment act of 1996\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I am joined by junior Senator \nfrom Washington State, Mrs. Murray, in introducing the ``Snoqualmie \nNational Forest Boundary Adjustment Act of 1996.'' Earlier this week \nRepresentative Jennifer Dunn, of Washington State, introduced identical \nlegislation in the House.\n  This legislation will facilitate the exchange of land between the \nWeyerhaeuser Company and the Forest Service by adjusting a National \nForest Boundary. As Chairman of the Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee, which funds our National Forest and Parks, land exchanges \nresult in less expense to the Federal taxpayer than do land \nacquisitions.\n  I will be working over the course of the next few months to get this \nlegislation passed by both the House and Senate, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I fully support this landmark \nagreement negotiated by the Sierra Club's Cascade Checkerboard Project, \nthe Weyerhaeuser Company, and the Forest Service. I particularly \napplaud the Weyerhaeuser Company's donation of approximately 1,900 \nacres of land, 900 acres of which will become part of the Alpine Lakes \nWilderness Area.\n  This exchange will give Weyerhaeuser 7,200 acres of 80- to 100-year-\nold trees within the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest in Pierce \nCounty, WA, in exchange for 33,000 acres of company's land. \nEssentially, the company gets timber to cut now, and the public gets \nmuch more land upon which future forests will be grown. Both \nWeyerhaeuser and the Forest Service will also be better able to manage \ntheir lands as ecosystems and reduce costs and administrative burdens \nof checkerboard management.\n  I strongly support such negotiated trades. I believe it is in all of \nour interests to reduce the checkerboard pattern of ownership--which \nCongress created through a massive land grant to the Northern Pacific \nRailroad in 1864. I will continue to encourage cooperation between \npublic and private landowner, and environmental and timber interests. \nSuch agreements provide models for resolution of natural resources \ndisputes and other environmental issues.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to take expeditious action on this \nbill, which simply alters the boundary of Mount Baker-Snoqualmie \nNational Forest. The boundary change is needed before the exchange can \noccur. I thank my colleagues for any support they can give to their \nbipartisan, non-controversial bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MACK (for himself, Mr. Bradley, Mr. Roth, Mr. Lautenberg \n        and Mr. Biden):\n\n  S. 1811. A bill to amend the Act entitled ``An Act authorizing \nFederal participation in the cost of protecting the shores of publicly \nowned property'' to confirm and clarify the authority and \nresponsibility of the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief \nof Engineers, to promote and carry out shore protection projects, \nincluding beach nourishment projects, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                    The Shore Protection Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to announce legislation I am \nintroducing--along with Senator Bradley and others--to reaffirm the \nFederal role in beach preservation and renourishment. I want to thank \nthe Senator from New Jersey for his steadfast efforts on this issue and \nfor all he did to make this bill possible.\n  Mr. President, in my State of Florida, healthy beaches mean a healthy \neconomy. Each year, millions of people travel from around the world to \nenjoy the recreational benefits of my State's coastlines. This tourist \nactivity sustains our economy and provides hundreds of thousands of \njobs for Floridians. As a consequence, people in Florida care deeply \nabout the future of our beaches and look to us to ensure that they are \nproperly maintained.\n  For 60 years, Mr. President, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers worked \nin partnership with the Congress, the States, and coastal communities \nto devise a workable policy on sandy beach renourishment. The Corps \nbrought to this partnership a wealth of accumulated technical expertise \nand institutional knowledge about beach preservation. Further, they \nbrought funding which was leveraged with State and local participation \ninto projects which directly benefited the Nation's coastlines.\n  This all ended last year when the Clinton administration turned its \nback on coastal communities by ending the traditional Federal role in \nbeach renourishment. In its 1996 budget request, the administration \nindicated that beach preservation and maintenance was no longer of \nnational significance.\n  I strongly disagree. Almost half our population lives in or near \ncoastal communities. The coastal economy is responsible for one-third \nof our gross domestic product and more than 28 million jobs. Much of \nthis economic activity derives from the vacationtime\n\n[[Page S5587]]\n\nlure of healthy beaches. These projects truly are of national \nsignificance, Mr. President, and the Corps of Engineers ought to remain \na full partner in this effort.\n  Last year, I joined Senator Bradley and several of my colleagues in \ntwice writing the administration in protest. Further, we restored the \nCorps' authority through the appropriations process. This victory was \nonly short term, however, and coastal communities throughout the Nation \nasked Congress for assurance of a permanent Federal presence in this \nsector.\n  When the administration released this year's budget and again \nproposed to end the Corps' involvement in restoring beaches, we began \nto explore a permanent legislative solution to this problem. The \nculmination of our efforts is the bill we are introducing today.\n  Our legislation is very simple, Mr. President. We amend the mission \nof the Corps to include shore protection projects, and we mandate that \nthe Corps make recommendations to Congress on specific projects that \nare worthy of Federal participation. Further, we require the Corps to \nconsider benefits to the local and regional economy and ecology when \nconsidering preparing cost/benefit analyses on beach projects. And we \nencourage the Corps to work with the States and local communities on \nregional plans for the long-term preservation of our coastal resources.\n  Mr. President, this bill will ensure that the Federal Government \nremains a full partner with the States and communities on the \npreservation of our beach resources. This is critical to Florida and to \nour Nation's economy. I encourage my colleagues to join the Senator \nfrom New Jersey and me as we continue to move ahead on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1811\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Shore Protection Act of \n     1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the beach, shore, and coastal resources of the United \n     States--\n       (A) are critical assets that must be protected, conserved, \n     and restored; and\n       (B) provide economic and environmental benefits that are of \n     national significance;\n       (2) a network of healthy and nourished beaches is essential \n     to the economy, competitiveness in world tourism, and safety \n     of coastal communities of the United States;\n       (3)(A) the coasts of the United States are an economic \n     asset, supporting 34 percent of national employment, or \n     28,000,000 jobs; and\n       (B) the 413 coastal communities of the United States \n     generate $1,300,000,000,000, or \\1/3\\, of the gross domestic \n     product;\n       (4)(A) travel and tourism--\n       (i) is the second largest sector of the economy of the \n     United States; and\n       (ii) contributed over $746,000,000,000 to the gross \n     domestic product in 1995;\n       (B) the health of the beaches and shoreline of the United \n     States contributes to this economic benefit, since the \n     leading tourist destinations in the United States are \n     beaches; and\n       (C) 85 percent of all tourism-generated revenue in the \n     United States derives from coastal communities;\n       (5)(A) the value of the coastline of the United States lies \n     not only in the jobs and revenue that the coastline \n     generates, but also in the families, homes, and businesses \n     that the coastline protects from hurricanes, typhoons, and \n     tropical and extratropical storms;\n       (B) almost 50 percent of the total United States population \n     lives in coastal communities; and\n       (C) beaches provide protection to prevent the destruction \n     of life and hundreds of billions of dollars worth of \n     property;\n       (6) shoreline protection projects can provide ecological \n     and environmental benefits by providing for, or by restoring, \n     marine and littoral habitat;\n       (7)(A) the coastline of the United States is a national \n     treasure, visited by millions of Americans and foreign \n     tourists every year;\n       (B) over 90,000,000 Americans spend time boating or fishing \n     along the coast each year; and\n       (C) the average American spends 10 recreational days per \n     year on the coast; and\n       (8) since shoreline protection projects generate positive \n     economic, recreational, and environmental outcomes that \n     benefit the United States as a whole, Federal responsibility \n     for preserving this valuable resource should be maintained.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for a \n     Federal role in shore protection projects, including projects \n     involving the replacement of sand, for which the economic and \n     ecological benefits to the locality, region, or Nation exceed \n     the costs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Mack in \nintroducing a measure designed to provide for a continuing Federal role \nin protecting a valuable national resource--our Nation's coastline. The \nShore Protection Act of 1996 states clearly that the Federal Government \nhas an obligation to provide necessary support--both financial and \ntechnical--for projects that promote the protection, restoration and \nenhancement of sandy beaches and shorelines in cooperation with States \nand localities.\n  Beach, shore and coastal resources are critical to our economy and \nquality of life, but they are fragile and must be protected, conserved \nand restored. As a coastal State Senator, who walks the beaches of the \nJersey shore every year, I know first-hand the economic and \nrecreational benefits that are derived from healthy beaches. Every \nsummer, thousands of New Jerseyans and visitors from all over the U.S. \nand the world, visit the beaches of the Jersey shore, generating \nroughly $11 billion in travel and tourism revenues.\n  However, beaches are important not only to New Jersey's economy or to \nthose of other coastal communities, they are important to the Nation's \neconomy. Beaches support 28 million jobs, and coastal communities \ngenerate $1.3 trillion, or one-third, of the Gross National Product. \nTravel and tourism is the second largest sector of our economy, \ncontributing over $746 billion in 1995 and amounting to a $26 billion \ntrade surplus. Beaches are responsible for this economic boom. As the \nleading tourist destination in the U.S., coastlines generate 85 percent \nof tourism-related revenue. If we allow this valuable resource to \nsimply wash away, billions of dollars in beach related revenues will \ndisappear as well.\n  The value of our coastline lies not only in the jobs and revenue that \nthey generate, but also in the families, homes and business they \nprotect from hurricanes, nor'easters and tropical storms. With almost \n50% of all Americans living in our coastal communities, we simply must \nhave healthy beaches as our first line of defense. Nourished beaches \ncan also provide ecological and environmental benefits for certain \nspecies of wildlife by providing, or restoring, marine and littoral \nhabitat.\n  In 1995, the Administration proposed an end to the Federal role in \nshore protection projects. Citing budgetary concerns, the \nAdministration proposal called for Federal involvement in projects that \nwere of ``national significance'' only. This bill makes the case that \nthe preservation of an invaluable economic and environmental resource--\nour shoreline--is of national significance. Our bill would permit all \nthe local, regional and national economic and ecological benefits of a \nshoreline protection project to be considered when judging a project's \nmerit. I am confident this comprehensive evaluation will demonstrate \nthat shore protection projects are indeed of national significance.\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to outline the major provisions \nof the bill. Specifically, the bill would mandate a continuing Federal \nrole in shore protection projects. The bill changes the mission of the \nCorps from one of general authority to do beach projects to a specific \nmandate to undertake the protection, restoration and enhancement of \nbeaches in cooperation with states and local communities.\n  Additionally, the bill would require that new criteria be used in \nconducting the cost/benefit analysis of a proposed project. Currently, \nwhen undertaking cost/benefit analysis to determine the suitability of \nproposed projects, the Corps is only required to consider the property \nvalues of property directly adjacent to the beach. The Corps can take \ninto account revenues generated through recreation, but is not required \nto do so, nor can the recreational values be weighed as anything other \nthan an ``incidental'' benefit. This bill requires that the benefits to \nthe local, regional and national economy and the local, regional and \nnational ecology be considered. This comprehensive evaluation will \ndemonstrate that shore protection projects are of national \nsignificance.\n  The bill also requires that the Corps report annually to Congress on \nbeach project priorities. The Corps will be required to submit \ninformation (reports) to Congress on projects that, when evaluated with \nthe bill's new cost/benefit criteria, are found to merit Federal \ninvolvement. In current law, this authority is discretionary and has \nbeen suspended by the Administration.\n  The bill also encourages the Corps to work with state and local \nauthorities to develop regional plans for preservation, restoration and \nenhancement of shorelines and coastal resources. Further the Corps is \nencouraged to work with other agencies to coordinate with other \nprojects that may have a complimentary effect on shoreline protection \nprojects.\n  A network of healthy and nourished beaches is essential to our \neconomy, competitiveness in world tourism and the safety of our coastal \ncommunities.\n\n[[Page S5589]]\n\n Protection of the Nation's shoreline must be a continued Federal \npriority.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRAHAM:\n  S. 1812. A bill to provide for the liquidation or replication of \ncertain frozen concentrated orange juice entries to correct an error \nthat was made in connection with the original liquidation; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n     legislation to correct inequity suffered by juice farms, inc.\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today \nthat will order Customs to take the necessary steps to correct an \ninequity suffered by a Florida company, Juice Farms, Inc., resulting \nfrom a Customs administrative error arising from a dumping case.\n  From 1987 to 1990, several anti-dumping orders were issued covering \nBrazilian frozen concentrated orange juice. Juice Farms imported juice \nfrom Brazil and deposited duties with Customs. As required by law, \nliquidation of the import entries by Customs was suspended by Commerce \npending the outcome of administrative dumping reviews to be conducted \nby Commerce.\n  In 1991, after three successive reviews, the Department of Commerce \nfound no sales at less than fair value. Commerce instructed Customs to \nreturn Juice Farms' anti-dumping duty deposits plus interest. Juice \nFarms learned, however, that Customs had mistakenly liquidated a number \nof entries. Such liquidations were in clear violation of the suspension \norder.\n  Juice Farms pursued court challenges but received an unfavorable \ndecision because the court found that the company filed its protest of \nthe premature liquidations too late. Accordingly, even though the \nduties were required by law to be returned to Juice Farms, to date the \ndeposits have not been received. The legislation I propose today simply \nwill correct that error and require Customs to refund the funds \nproperly owed Juice Farms.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HELMS (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1813 A bill to reform the coastwise, intercoastal, and \nnoncontiguous trade shipping laws, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n              The Coastal shipping competition act of 1996\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, since 1920 there has been a Federal statute \nin force in America that, however well intentioned, has nonetheless \nprevented a vast segment of the farming community in North Carolina and \nother States from obtaining reasonably much-needed and priced grain \nfrom the Midwest.\n  In doing so, of course, it has long prevented Midwestern grain \nproducers from delivering grain to grain deficit States which \nrepeatedly experience difficulty in sustaining their livestock. North \nCarolina is one of the those States.\n  That is why I am today introducing S. 1813, the Coastal Shipping \nCompetition Act, which will eliminate a harmful anachronism that \nenables a few waterborne carriers to cling to a monopoly on shipping. \nThe victims of this system, in North Carolina and elsewhere, assert \naccurately that those shippers have no certified Jones Act ships to \nmeet the demands of producers who need the gain.\n  In fact, Mr. President, poultry and pork farmers in North Carolina \nsay they can't get enough grain for their farms to feed their animals. \nNorth Carolina cannot now, nor ever be able, to produce enough grain to \nsatisfy the urgent needs of the poultry and pork producers in North \nCarolina. As a result, they must rely upon grain shipped in from the \nMidwest. The railroads can't guarantee enough railcars to move this \ngrain from the Midwest, and the costs of such shipments as can be \narranged are enormous.\n  The increase in transportation costs, coupled with the price of \ngrain, inevitably leads to excessively high overhead costs for North \nCarolina farmers. To put it succinctly, the shortage of grains and \nshortage of trains means sharply elevated costs and prices that \nthreaten the livelihoods of many farmers.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters from two highly \nrespected North Carolina farmers, both of whom urge introduction and \npassage of this legislation, be printed in the Record at the conclusion \nof my remarks.\n   Mr. President, according to the most recent North Carolina \nDepartment of Agriculture statistics, North Carolina was, in 1995, No. \n1 in the Nation in turkey production with 61.2 million birds; in hog \nproduction, North Carolina was No. 2, with 8.3 million heads--Iowa was \nNo. 1--and in commercial broilers North Carolina was No. 4 with 644 \nmillion birds--Arkansas, Georgia, and Alabama ranked first, second, and \nthird.\n   Mr. President, this past Saturday an article in the May 18 edition \nof the Raleigh News and Observer, reported that 800 poultry jobs in \nChatham County, N.C., were threatened by, among other things, high-feed \ngrain prices. I ask unanimous consent that this article ``800 Perdue \nJobs in Danger'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n   Mr. President, additionally, in times of severe weather--such as \nthis past winter--railroads often are unable to get through mountain \npasses because of snow or flooding.\n   Mr. President, the Jones Act unfairly and unreasonably restricts \nshipping between ports in the United States because it requires that \nmerchandise and produce shipped by water between U.S. points be shipped \nonly on U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, U.S.-manned, and U.S.-citizen owned \nvessels specifically documented and authorized by the Coast Guard for \nsuch shipments.\n  But, Mr. President, the problem with that is that not nearly enough \ncertified vessels exist to transport grain to farmers in North Carolina \nand other States. As a matter of fact, my farmers are now being forced \nto go to foreign sources for feed grain.\n  Last year, according to a report in the September 12, 1995, Journal \nof Commerce, Murphy family farms brought in a cargo shipment of 1 \nmillion bushels of Canadian wheat to the port of Wilmington, NC, aboard \nCanada steamship lines.\n   Mr. President, the Jones Act is simply not fair. It's not fair to \nfarmers in the Midwest and it is unfair to countless producers in my \nown State and in other States.\n\n  Those who may protest this legislation are likely to claim that it \nwill somehow destroy American shipping. That simply is not so. \nMoreover, if the status quo is maintained, my farmers will have no \nchoice but to purchase their foreign grain from Canada, Argentina, and \nother countries--and all of it will be shipped on foreign flagged \nvessels.\n  According to a December 1995 report by the U.S. International Trade \nCommission,\n\n       The economy wide effect of removing the Jones Act is a U.S. \n     economic welfare gain of approximately $2.8 billion. This \n     figure can also be interpreted as the annual reduction in \n     real national income imposed by the Jones Act. A primary \n     reason for the large gain in welfare is a decline of \n     approximately 26 percent in the price of shipping services \n     formerly restricted by the Jones Act.\n\n  Mr. President, isn't it ironic that the United States--the \nbreadbasket of the world--has such an unwise and unfair lid on that \nbread basket? That lid, Mr. President, is the Jones Act.\n  That is my reason for offering this legislative remedy, Mr. \nPresident. If Senators truly believe in the free enterprise system, \nthey will support this proposal to allow American grain to be shipped \nunhindered to grain deficit States that are in need of it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1813\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Jesse Helms,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: I am writing to urge you to introduce \n     and sponsor the Coastal Shipping Competition Act--Legislation \n     that I believe would bring much needed, yet fair reform to \n     our nation's antiquated maritime transportation laws.\n       North Carolina consumes in its animal and poultry \n     production businesses far more grain and oilseed meals than \n     our North Carolina farmers are able to produce. Thus far, we \n     have relied upon rail transportation originating in the \n     ``Eastern Grain Belt'' states to augment local supplies. As \n     our demand increases, we will likely continue to use rail \n     transportation as our primary source of grains and oilseed \n     meals from production areas outside North Carolina. However, \n     we are beginning to experience the symptoms of over taxing \n     the capacity of the rail corridors that serve us. \n     Additionally, realization of the risks inherent in relying \n     too heavily on a single source of dry bulk transport to feed \n     live animals and poultry is becoming far too real when we \n     have had major service interruptions on at least three \n     occasions since early December 1995.\n       We believe that the only other viable transportation source \n     to supply our needs is via water. Yet, after some five years \n     of diligent effort, the only reasonably competitive cargo \n     that we have been able to procure via water has been foreign \n     cargoes delivered to the port of Wilmington on foreign \n     vessels. This seems illogical to us because we know that the \n     United States is the most efficient and largest producer of \n     grains and oilseed meals in the world and that our country \n     serves as the world's repository of supply of these \n     invaluable resources.\n       Why can't we access these domestic supplies via water? We \n     believe that a major impediment lies within the constraints \n     imposed upon us and others by the Merchant Marine Act of \n     1920, more commonly known as the Jones Act. Legislation to \n     reform the Jones Act is desperately needed to help rebuild a \n     viable, competitive United States domestic shipping industry \n     and to enhance the competitive position of ours and other \n     American agricultural producers and businesses. I believe \n     that without this legislation we will experience the not so \n     gradual erosion of the economic viability of our existing \n     capital asset base and likewise the economic demise of many \n     of our good citizens and business persons who depend upon the \n     animal and poultry production industry of North Carolina for \n     their livelihoods.\n       As a member of the business community and a farmer from \n     your district, I assure you that this is an issue of utmost \n     importance and one that merits your attention and support.\n       Thank you for your time and effort and please let me know \n     if I may be of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Wendell H. Murphy,\n     Chairman and CEO.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    Goldsboro Milling Company,\n\n                                      Goldsboro, NC, May 21, 1996.\n       Dear Senator Helms: Let me start by thanking you for all \n     you have done in the past in support of agri-business in this \n     country. Your support has meant a great deal to all of us.\n       I'm also writing you today to ask you to introduce and \n     support the Coastal Shipping Competition Act--legislation \n     that would bring much needed reform to our nation's \n     antiquated maritime transportation laws.\n       These laws negatively affect thousands of businesses across \n     America every day because the laws have eliminated \n     competitive deepwater domestic waterbourne transportation for \n     essential manufacturing inputs and finished products.\n       The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (known as the Jones Act) \n     has had an ironically anti-American impact. While it may have \n     been originally written to protect the U.S. shipping \n     industry, the resulting noncompetitive domestic industry is \n     sparsely available, if at all in many U.S. locations. Not a \n     single coastal freighter over 1,000 tons is operating on the \n     entire 2,000 mile East Coast of the United States.\n       Those of us in the poultry and hog business on the East \n     Coast really need an alternative transportation option for \n     our inputs (such as grain) because the infrastructure of the \n     railroads is getting critically overloaded. However, being \n     restricted to using a U.S. owned, operated and manned ship \n     effectively eliminates the possibility of getting inputs \n     delivered by water to east coast ports.\n       Legislation to reform the Jones Act is desperately needed \n     to help build the competitive position of American businesses \n     and agricultural producers.\n       As a member of the business community in North Carolina, I \n     can assure you this is an issue that merits your attention \n     and support. Thanks for all that you have already done and \n     for your consideration on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  J.L Maxwell, Jr.\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the News & Observer, May 18, 1996]\n\n                       800 Perdue Jobs in Danger\n\n                             (By Jay Price)\n\n       Siler City.--Perdue Farms announced Friday that it will \n     padlock its Chatham County chicken processing plant unless \n     the plant can be sold within 60 days, placing the future of \n     800 workers in doubt and sending shock waves through the \n     local economy.\n       The company, which has headquarters in Salisbury, Md., \n     blamed the move on high feed costs and a glutted chicken \n     market. ``Hopefully, we'll find a buyer, and if we don't \n     we'll make the workers aware of job opportunities at other \n     Perdue facilities,'' said company spokesman Richard Auletta \n     in New York.\n       The news from one of Chatham County's largest employers \n     cast a pall over the annual Siler City Chicken Festival, \n     which begins today.\n\n[[Page S5593]]\n\n       ``I've worked here a long time,'' said Frank Torres, a \n     Perdue employee since 1985. ``I don't know what happened. I \n     can't do nothing new. Now all everybody's got is one piece of \n     paper and a check. I don't know what will happen.''\n       Torres said that Friday morning, employees were given a \n     letter in Spanish and English outlining the company's plans.\n       Perdue said employment at a 28-worker feed mill in Staley \n     also will be scaled back, and the operation may later be \n     closed.\n       Also affected are 118 growers who raise chickens for Perdue \n     under contract, mostly in Chatham and Randolph counties. Only \n     30 of those will continue to raise birds for the company, \n     which will process them at other plants.\n       The company said it will try to arrange for the remaining \n     growers to work with other poultry companies in the area.\n       Perdue said the plant workers, most of whom earn $7 to \n     $7.10 an hour, can apply for jobs at other plants, but the \n     closest ones are in Robbins and Concord, a considerable \n     distance away by car.\n       About noon Friday, workers dressed in jeans, work boots and \n     hard hats trickled solemnly out of the yellow brick plant and \n     into a gravel parking lot. Many, like Torres, are migrant \n     workers from Mexico who made their way to Chatham County in \n     search of stability.\n       Domingo Gonzales, 28 years old and the father of two, has \n     been at the plant for only three months.\n       ``I don't know what I'll do,'' he said, noting that he has \n     been working at odd jobs in the United States for nearly nine \n     years and was hoping to finally settle down. ``Maybe I'll go \n     back to Mexico.''\n       The fate of many workers like Torres and Gonzales may \n     depend on complex business forces over which they have no \n     control.\n       Besides record-high feed prices Perdue cited a recent jump \n     in fuel costs and an abundance of poultry, beef and pork as \n     major reasons for the decision.\n       Producers are paying an estimated 40 percent more for feed \n     than they did a year ago, and are getting lower prices for \n     their products, said Dr. Tom Carter, a poultry specialist \n     with the N.C. Cooperative Extensive Service.\n       ``It's an unusual situation with the grain prices so \n     high,'' Carter said. ``The cost of production is higher than \n     the market, and that's because of high corn prices.''\n       Carter, however, was optimistic that another company would \n     buy the 61,000-square-foot plant, which can process 625,000 \n     birds a week.\n       ``Very seldom does a facility like that go without a \n     buyer,'' Carter said. ``On the surface, it looks like the \n     situation is such that people wouldn't want to buy it, but if \n     you look beneath the surface, you usually get the best buy \n     when the price is down.''\n       Growers also may be able to sell birds elsewhere, Carter \n     said. Townsend, Golden Poultry and Mount Aire have poultry \n     processing plants in Siler City, Sanford and Bonlee, \n     respectively, Carter said.\n       ``Eventually, growers will adjust and move in with other \n     companies,'' Carter said, ``but it may take longer than some \n     can adjust their finances for.''\n       Growers work under contract to processors like Perdue. The \n     processor owns the chickens, so in this case the farmers \n     won't get stuck with the birds. But they could get stuck with \n     big investments in chicken houses, which cost about $120,000. \n     The average farmer in the area has three houses, said Dr. \n     Glenn Carpenter, a Pittsboro extension agent specializing in \n     poultry. Some older houses may have cost just a few thousand \n     dollars, he said.\n       Many growers raise chickens part-time. Typically, it's a \n     family affair employing between one and three people, but \n     some operations are larger and full-time.\n       The plant was one of a group of processing facilities that \n     Perdue bought from Showell Farms in January 1995. Its \n     products are sold mostly to institutional users such as \n     schools, hospitals and restaurants.\n\n\n                             mixed signals\n\n       In recent months, signs were that it was prospering. \n     Olivier Devaud, director of Chatham's Economic Development \n     Commission, said the plant had been hiring workers since \n     announcing in December that it needed 150 more. In the past \n     year Perdue spent $4 million for new equipment at the plant \n     and $1 million on an expansion, which was still under way \n     when Friday's announcement came.\n       Other signals were more ominous. In March, Perdue--the \n     nation's No. 2 poultry producer--said it would cut production \n     by 7 percent, but that it didn't plan layoffs. Other large \n     poultry firms, including Tyson, Hudson Foods Inc. and \n     Pilgrims Pride Corp., had already announced similar cuts.\n       Poultry and eggs make up the most lucrative agricultural \n     industry in the state, said Kim Decker of the state \n     Agriculture Department. In 1994, the most recent year for \n     which statistics were available, poultry and eggs earned \n     farmers $1.9 billion, he said.\n       In contrast, revenue from hogs was $980 million and from \n     tobacco, $943 million. Statewide, the industry employs more \n     than 27,000 people.\n\n\n                            major job source\n\n       The plant is Chatham's third largest employer. Devaud said \n     its closing would be a blow to the local economy. But new \n     companies and expansions are expected to bring 120 new jobs \n     to Siler City in the next month alone, and the county's \n     unemployment rate is just 2.7 percent.\n       Devaud said he hopes that Townsend, the county's biggest \n     employer, can eventually hire some of the workers at its \n     chicken processing plant.\n       One who might be looking is Steven Garner, who landed a job \n     loading trucks at the Perdue plant three weeks ago. He was \n     angry Friday.\n       ``That's 800 people,'' he said between puffs of a \n     cigarette.\n       ``I've got a family. I'm the one who buys the groceries and \n     pays the bills. It's going to be really hard.''\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRAMM (for himself, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Bryan, and Ms. \n        Moseley-Braun):\n  S. 1815. A bill to provide for improved regulation of the securities \nmarkets, eliminate excess securities fees, reduce the costs of \ninvesting, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n            THE SECURITIES INVESTMENT PROMOTION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators D'Amato, \nDodd, Bryan, and Moseley-Braun in introducing the Securities Investment \nPromotion Act of 1996. This is important legislation incorporating \nreforms supported by business and by State and Federal Securities \nregulators.\n  This legislation moves forward in a significant way to define a \ndivision of labor between the State and Federal governments for the \nsupervision of the securities industry. In the process two very \nimportant goals are achieved. We improve administration of our nation's \nsecurities laws while at the same time greatly reducing the cost of \nthat regulation.\n  We must always remember that the cost of securities regulation, \nhowever desirable or effective that regulation may be, is ultimately \nborn by the people who invest. Today, that includes almost everyone. \nNot everyone may have a stock portfolio, although an increasing number \nof American families do. But most Americans have investments in a \nmutual fund or have a stake in a pension fund that invests in our \nnation's securities markets. More and more small businesses are funding \ntheir growth, expansion, and job creation with financing from the \nsecurities markets.\n  When I became Chairman of the Securities Subcommittee, I was struck \nby the number of State and Federal regulators, and people in the \nsecurities business, as well as investors, who commented on the need to \nreform out-of-date and unnecessary securities regulation. The most \nimmediate need in that regard the Congress addressed last year, with \nour bill to reform securities litigation. That was a measured, \nbipartisan effort.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today is a continuation of \nthat bipartisan spirit. I am proud to be joined by the Chairman of the \nBanking Committee, Senator D'Amato, as well as by the Ranking Member of \nthe Securities Subcommittee, Senator Dodd, together with Senators Bryan \nand Moseley-Braun of the Banking Committee. We have all worked closely \nin drafting the bill that we are introducing, and have in addition \nbenefited from comments and suggestions from the SEC, State securities \nregulators, trade associations, the stock exchanges, and self-\nregulatory organizations, among others. I invite further comments as we \nconsider this bill in the Committee and then on the floor of the \nSenate. I have intentionally sought to cast the net wide in seeking \ncomment from the public on this legislation, since, ultimately, what we \ndo in this bill affects the people of this country in very important \nways.\n  Mr. President, I would like to comment briefly on some of the key \nprovisions of the bill.\n  Title I of the bill is called the Investment Advisers Integrity Act. \nIt is an updated version of a bill that I introduced on the first day \nof the 104th Congress, S. 148. There are approximately 25,000 \nregistered investment advisers in the nation today, and the number \nkeeps growing. The SEC has testified that they do not have the \nresources to supervise effectively such a large number of advisers. In \nthe past, proposals were put forward to increase SEC funding for \nenforcement of the Investment Adviser Act of 1940 by assessing a $16 \nmillion tax on the industry. Even with such a tax, however, an \ninvestment adviser could have gone several years without an inspection.\n\n[[Page S5594]]\n\n  Title I of the bill tries a different approach, first suggested to me \nby former SEC Commissioner Rick Roberts. This approach addresses the \nproblem through a partnership between the Federal and State securities \nregulators, dividing up the responsibility. The States would have \nexclusive jurisdiction to register investment advisers who manage less \nthan $25 million in client assets. These are the investment advisers \nwhose activities are most likely to be within their home State. In \nfact, about half of all investment advisers do not personally manage \nany client assets at all.\n  The SEC would have exclusive responsibility for registration of \ninvestment advisers who manage $25 million or more of client assets, as \nwell as for all investment advisors to mutual funds. These are the \ninvestment advisers most likely to be engaged in interstate commerce, \nappropriately a Federal concern.\n  I would add, Mr. President, that this provision does not impose a \nFederal mandate on the States, for under the provisions of the bill, \nany State that did not want to assume the responsibility for \nregistration of investment advisers is not required to do so. The \nadvisers in such a State would then be required to register with the \nSEC, regardless of the size of their business.\n  The effect of this division of responsibility will be that between \ntwo-thirds and three-quarters of investment advisers will be supervised \nby the States where they do their business. On the other hand, perhaps \nas much as two-thirds or more of the assets under management will be \nmanaged by investment advisers supervised by the SEC, demonstrating the \nconcentration of managed assets in the hands of the larger investment \nadvisers, having multi-state operations.\n  I would like to express my appreciation to the representatives of the \ninvestment adviser industry, the SEC, and the Texas State Securities \nCommissioner, Denise Crawford, for their assistance in revising and \ncrafting this title of the bill, and the support that they have \nexpressed for this approach. Whereas today investment adviser \nsupervision is limited at best, and more often than not effectively \nnon-existent, this division of labor will mean that adequate resources \nand attention can not be brought to bear to encourage the integrity of \nthe industry and further increase the investment opportunities for \nAmerican families.\n  Mr. President, perhaps the most significant impact of this bill will \ncome from the provisions assigning responsibility for mutual fund \nprospectuses review to the SEC. Mutual funds spend tens of millions of \ndollars each year complying with a patchwork of varied and \noften conflicting State requirements governing the prospectuses by \nwhich funds are offered to investors. These requirements are merely \ndifferent, usually duplicative, and to not provide investors with any \nadded useful information than what is already required by the SEC. \nMoreover, complying with these requirements is time consuming. In just \none example, while a particular mutual fund was awaiting delays in \nclearing its prospectus with a certain State regulator, its value \nincreased by 16%. That was a 16% growth denied to the investors of that \nState who could not place funds with the mutual fund until its \nprospectus had cleared the State regulators. No investor was helped by \nthat delay. The mutual fund industry has dramatically increased the \ninvestment opportunities for American families of all levels of income, \nand I am please to further the efforts of my colleagues, Congressmen \nFields and Bliley, to move forward this important relief from \nunnecessary regulatory burden.\n\n  Similarly, stocks that are traded on the national stock exchange and \ntrading systems would be exempted from State regulation under the \nprovisions of this bill. Again, as with mutual funds, this is a \nnational business, the very kind of activity contemplated by the \nFounding Fathers with the interstate commerce clause of the Commission.\n  One of the provisions of the bill, which I consider of high \nimportance, is a requirement that the Chief Economist of the SEC \nconduct and publish an economic analysis of each new regulation before \nthe regulation can enter into effect. Mr. President, the SEC is a \nlawyer-heavy agency. The Officer of General Counsel, for example, has a \nbudget of over $10 million and 120 staff members. By comparison, the \nOffice of Economic Analysis, even with the increase required by my \namendment to the appropriation bill, has a budget of $3 million and \nabout two dozen employees.\n  The actions of the SEC in regulating the nation's capital markets \nhave a profound impact on the economy of the nation and of the world. \nIt is therefore of paramount importance that a high priority be given \nwithin the SEC to careful examination and analysis of the economic and \nmarket consequences of its regulations. Otherwise, we are in danger of \nregulating blindly, which the economic livelihood and health of the \nnation cannot risk.\n  While there are many other important provisions of the bill, I will \nconclude, Mr. President, by emphasizing the last section of the bill. \nThis provision addresses the need for improving the access to U.S. \nstock exchanges for the listing of world-class foreign companies. \nToday, U.S. accounting standards are in many points different from the \naccounting standards of other countries. They are not necessarily \nbetter, just different. Under current regulations, a foreign company \nwishing to list on a U.S. stock exchange would first have to meet U.S. \naccounting standards, which in effect may mean that the company would \nhave to keep two sets of books.\n  The SEC has sought to address this problem through a greater \nharmonization of international accounting standards. The bill \nencourages the SEC to redouble its efforts to achieve a level of \ngenerally accepted accounting standards and to report to the Congress \non its progress.\n  Our nation's stock exchanges are the preeminent exchanges in the \nworld. It is hard to see how we can continue that position long into \nthe next century while maintaining formidable obstacle to the listing \non our exchanges of the major corporations of the world. I do not see \nhow any American investor is protected by being forced to resort to the \nLondon or Frankfurt stock exchanges in order to invest in foreign \ncorporations.\n  Mr. President, this is important legislation. Congressman Jack Fields \nand the members of the House Commerce Committee have done the country a \ngreat service by setting in motion a process by which the Congress will \nbegin to delineate clearly the roles of the State and Federal \ngovernments in securities regulation. I hope that this bill can be \nadopted in short order and meet in conference with similar legislation \nrecently adopted unanimously by the House Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Securities Investment Promotion Act of 1996\n\n     SECTION 1.

Promoting Preeminence of American Securities \n                   Markets\n\n       Expresses the sense of the Congress that the SEC should \n     reinforce its efforts in developing generally accepted \n     international accounting standards in order to enhance the \n     ability of foreign corporations to list their stocks on U.S. \n     exchanges, and requires the SEC to report to Congress in one \n     year on its progress.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, it is with great enthusiasm that I rise \ntoday with my colleagues, the chairman and ranking member of the \nSecurities Subcommittee, Senator Gramm and Senator Dodd, and Senators \nBryan and Moseley-Braun to introduce the Securities Investment \nPromotion Act of 1996.\n  The U.S. securities market is the preeminent market in the world. It \nis a fair, efficient and orderly market. In 1995, the U.S. equity \nmarket capitalization of $7.98 trillion represented nearly half of the \n$16.48 worldwide equity market. The market is at an all time high, \nhaving increased in trading volume 168 percent in the last decade from \n77.3 billion to 207.4 billion. Clearly our securities market is a \nnational treasure.\n  This bill my colleagues and I introduce today represents a bi-\npartisan effort to improve regulation of the securities market. The \nlegislation seeks to maintain our preeminent securities market by \nmaking it even more efficient and more accessible to those individuals \nand entities who seek entry in order to raise capital.\n  The legislation streamlines securities regulation by peeling back \nlayers of duplicative, unnecessary and burdensome regulation--opening \nup the capital markets and promoting capital formation. It makes more \nefficient use of precious State and Federal resources by dividing \nrather duplicating regulatory responsibility. These changes will also \nstrengthen consumer and investor protection.\n\n\n                          investment advisers\n\n  The Securities Investment Promotion Act fills a significant \nregulatory gap in the area of investment advisers. As low interest \nrates have caused individuals to flock to the securities markets with \ntheir savings and retirement money--often seeking advice from an \ninvestment adviser--it becomes increasingly critical for Congress to \nensure that investment advisers are adequately regulated. The increase \nin mutual fund investments, which are usually managed by investment \nadvisers, has also contributed to the growing number of investment \nadvisers.\n  Right now, 22,000 investment advisers manage approximately $10.6 \ntrillion in assets. The SEC does not have sufficient resources to \nmaintain an adequate inspection program for investment advisers. \nAccording to some SEC estimates, they are only able to inspect some of \nthe smaller investment advisers once every 30 years.\n  The bill creates a rational system of regulation for investment \nadvisers by dividing between the SEC and the States responsibility for \nregulating investment advisers. States will regulate the smaller \ninvestment advisers who operate in their State and manage $25 million \nor less in assets. The SEC will regulate the larger advisers. This \nsystem will enable the States and the SEC to share regulatory \nresponsibility--better protecting investors.\n\n\n                              mutual funds\n\n  The Securities Investment Promotion Act of 1996 facilitates the \nregistration, operation and certain disclosures made by mutual funds. \nOver 30 million U.S. households, or about 31 percent now own mutual \nfunds. In part because of low interest rates, by the end of last year \nmutual fund assets hit the $2.7 trillion mark--exceeding bank deposits \nfor the first time.\n  This bill allows the mutual fund market to operate as a national \nmarket, comprehensively regulated by the SEC. Right now, when a mutual \nfund registers its shares it must register with the SEC and the States. \nAs a result, mutual funds must comply with a\n\n[[Page S5596]]\n\ncrazy quilt of regulation imposed by the laws of each of the 50 States. \nThis bill facilitates mutual fund registration by eliminating the \nrequirement that mutual funds register with the States.\n  The bill makes it easier for mutual funds to provide current \ninformation in advertisements; calculate their registration fees and \ninvest in other mutual funds in their family of funds. It also provides \nadditional consumer and investor protection by giving the SEC authority \nto prohibit mutual funds from naming their funds in a manner that could \nmislead or confuse investors.\n\n\n                           capital formation\n\n  The bill promotes capital formation by eliminating overlapping State \nand Federal requirements for registering certain types of securities, \nsuch as securities sold to ``qualified purchasers'' or securities that \nare listed on a national securities exchange or market system. It also \ngives the SEC flexibility to identify other exchanges or systems that \nshould qualify for the exemption from registration.\n  The bill promotes investment in small projects and business by making \nit easier for economic, business, and industrial development companies \nto raise money without having to register with the SEC. These companies \nwill not have to register their securities if 80 percent or more of the \nsecurities are sold to accredited investors within the State the \ncompany operates. This bill provides further relied for companies \noperating within one State. The SEC may now exempt from the securities \nlaws a company with $100,000 in assets that is operating within a \nState. The Securities Investment Promotion Act of 1996 raises this \nlevel to $10 million.\n  The bill provides liquidity and investment opportunities to business \ndevelopment companies--enabling these companies to invest more capital \nin small businesses. It also helps venture capitalists tap the capital \nmarkets to fund business endeavors by allowing individuals and entities \nto pool a certain amount of investment funds without having to register \nwith the SEC.\n\n\n                        regulatory modernization\n\n  The legislation updates the securities laws to reflect the reality of \ntoday's marketplace. It simplifies certain procedures for paying fees \nand making disclosures. It gives the SEC flexibility to adapt to the \nchanging financial market by giving the SEC authority to exempt \ntransactions, individuals or entities from the Federal securities laws.\n  The bill fosters awareness of the cost of regulation by requiring the \nSEC to publish an economic analysis of a proposed regulation before it \nbecomes effective. It also reduces the costs associated with revolving \ndoor compliance examinations, where one regulator completes its \nexamination only to be replaced by the next. The legislation requires \nthe regulators to coordinate examinations.\n  The Securities Investment Promotion Act of 1996 is a significant \npiece of legislation that will ensure that the U.S. securities market \nremains number one in the world. It is not a controversial bill, it \nenjoys support on both sides of the aisle. This bill thoughtfully and \ncarefully tightens the laws governing the securities market. I commend \nmy colleagues and their staff for their excellent work in drafting this \nlegislation and plan to move it quickly through the Banking Committee.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Gramm, \nD'Amato, Bryan, and Moseley-Braun in introducing the Securities \nInvestment Promotion Act of 1996.\n  The U.S. capital markets are vitally important for the good economic \nhealth not only of virtually every American company but for millions \nand millions of individual investors who have placed some of their \nassets either directly in securities or, as has become more and more \ncommon, into mutual funds.\n  We must recognize that sustained economic growth is heavily dependent \nupon the continuing ability of our capital markets and financial \nservices industry to function efficiently and with integrity. If \ncompanies find impediments to obtaining capital, they will not grow. If \nindividuals find impediments to their access to securities and other \ninvestments, they will not save. Taking steps to enhance the access of \nboth corporations and individuals to the securities markets is a \nprudent means by which Congress can help sustain or even increase the \nNation's rate of economic growth.\n  Furthermore, the American capital markets are the envy of the world. \nNo other nation enjoys the international reputation of our capital \nmarkets and it is necessary for Congress periodically to review and \nmodernize, where necessary, the laws that make our markets and our \nfinancial services industry the world's leader.\n  The legislation that is being introduced today is the culmination of \na lengthy bipartisan effort to reform those aspects of the securities \nlaws that are an outdated impediment to the efficient functioning of \nthe securities industry. The bill will also provide clearer statutory \ndirectives to both state and Federal regulators so that the integrity \nof--and confidence in--our capital markets and financial services \nindustry is enhanced.\n  Mr. President, let me provide a brief summary of the major elements \nof this legislation. The three main areas that the bill addresses are: \nimproving the regulation of investment advisors under the Investment \nAdvisors Act of 1940; modernizing and streamlining the regulation of \nmutual funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940; and, making \nmodest adjustments in the securities laws to account for changes in the \nfinancial world over the past 60 years.\n  Title I, the Investment Advisors Integrity Act, would provide much \nneeded clarity to regulators for the regulation of investment advisors \nunder the Investment Advisors Act of 1940. The most important feature \nof this title is to draw a clear, bright line between those registered \ninvestment advisors who should be regulated at the Federal level by the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, and those advisors who are more \nproperly regulated by the state that is the advisor's principal place \nof business.\n  The bill would require investment advisors with more than $25 million \nunder management to be regulated by the Securities and Exchange \ncommission, while those with assets under the $25 million threshold \nwould be regulated by the state.\n  This bifurcation is necessary because it is not realistic to expect \nthe SEC to be able to thoroughly supervise the more than 25,000 \nadvisors who are registered under the IAA nor is it reasonable to have \nthe advisor industry burdened by duplicative state and Federal \nregulation. This change will allow the state and Federal regulators to \nfocus on those parts of the industry that is within their regulatory \nexpertise, while freeing the industry from the burden of duplicative \nlayers of regulation.\n  The second title of the bill is entitled Facilitating Investment in \nMutual Funds. While most of my colleagues are aware of the rapid growth \nin the mutual fund industry, I wonder how many are aware that nearly \none out of every three American families has money invested, in some \nform or another, in mutual funds. Mutual funds, as of 1995, have \nslightly more than $2 trillion dollars under management, with $800 \nbillion coming from individual investors and $1.2 trillion coming from \ninstitutional investors.\n  The significantly increasing importance of the mutual fund industry \nled to a lengthy review by the Securities and Exchange Commission in \n1992, entitled ``Protecting Investors: A Half-Century of Investment \nCompany Regulation,'' which made recommendations for modernizing of the \nInvestment Company Act of 1940. The last time Congress revised the ICA \nwas in 1970, and many believe that it is approriate--a quarter century \nlater--for Congress to take a fresh look at the issue of modernization.\n  Several of the mutual fund provisions of the legislation being \nintroduced today were originally proposed by the SEC in their 1992 \nreport. Other suggestions have been forthcoming since that report and \nrepresent a careful balance between the need to make the Investment \nCompany Act fit the mutual fund industry as it exists today, without \nsacrificing any investor protection.\n  This section of the bill contains two major components: the first is \nto eliminate unnecessary state regulation of mutual funds, while \npreserving the state's authority to investigate for fraud and other \ntypes of wrongdoing. Mutual funds are highly regulated by the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission through the Investment Company\n\n[[Page S5597]]\n\nAct of 1940; in fact, this is one of the most successfully regulated \nindustries in America, borne out by the explosive growth in mutual \nfunds since the Act was passed. In 1940, there were 105 registered \ncompanies with $2 billion in assets (according to the SEC); today, as I \nmentioned above, there are more than 5,300 funds holding over $2 \ntrillion in assets.\n  The very success of SEC regulation has rendered most individual state \nregulations obsolete, not to mention that complying with these \nduplicative statutes is both expensive and burdensome on the industry. \nThe costs of this regulatory burden are passed onto consumers. The \nlegislation we are introducing today will preempt most state regulation \nof mutual funds, while preserving the state's necessary ability to \nprotect consumers through anti-fraud and other statutes.\n  Another area that will be modernized through adoption of this \nlegislation will be in the area of smaller funds whose investors are \neither wealthy individuals--defined in the bill as those with more than \n$5 million in investments--and institutional investors. These funds, \nwhich are exempt from many of the provisions of the Investment Company \nAct of 1940 because of their smaller size and unique nature, often \nprovide critically needed capital directly to new corporations and \ngenerally to America's emerging industries. By modestly expanding the \npool of people and institutions eligible to participate in such funds, \nthe legislation seeks to expand the amount of capital available for \ninvestment, particularly newer, small and moderate sized companies.\n  There are also enhanced mutual fund disclosure requirements \nbenefiting investors that we are continuing to develop, and I would \nanticipate that if and when this bill goes to mark-up, they will be \nadded to the legislation.\n  The last title of the bill contains a number of provisions that \nattempt to remove anomalies that have developed within the securities \nlaws as the financial world has changed over the last sixty years. \nThese changes, while modest in and of themselves, will nevertheless \nprovide significant and needed relief to both investors and industry.\n  In all, Mr. President, this is an extremely balanced and thoughtful \nbill that has been drafted in close consultation with the Securities \nand Exchange Commission and the North American Securities \nAdministrators Association, the umbrella group for the fifty state \nsecurities administrators. It has been written in bipartisan manner \nthat is increasingly rare in this body, and as a result, the bill \nprovides statutory reform that is needed by investors, corporations and \nthe financial services industry without sacrificing any consumer \nprotections. I hope that the Senate will move expeditiously to pass \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to sign on as a co-sponsor of \nthe Securities Investment Promotion Act of 1996. This comprehensive \neffort to modernize our regulation of the capital markets will help us \nachieve the most efficient possible regulatory scheme, while preserving \ninvestor confidence in our markets by maintaining needed investor \nprotection safeguards.\n  I come to this issue believing that our capital formation process is \nfundamentally sound. America's capital markets are the fairest, most \nsuccessful, and the most liquid the world has ever known. By virtually \nevery statistical measure, our capital markets are vibrant and healthy. \nThe stock market has been setting new records for some time now and is \nin the midst of the longest run in this century. This has been an \nunprecedented boom for companies, investors and Wall Street firms.\n  The manner in which we reform our regulation of securities is \nimportant because tens of millions of Americans increasingly rely on \nour nation's financial markets to save for retirement, fund their \nchildren's college education, and to receive a rate of return on \nsavings that exceeds the rate of inflation. Today, more than ever, the \npeople of America are investing in America. For the first time in \nhistory, mutual fund assets exceed the deposits of the commercial \nbanking system.\n  The growth in the mutual fund industry has been nothing short of \nphenomenal. Today, there are 2,222 stock funds, 2,576 bond and fixed-\nincome funds, plus another 1,000 money-market funds, according to the \nInvestment Company Institute. In fact, there are now twice as many \nmutual funds--with a value of around $2.8 trillion--as stocks listed on \nthe New York Stock Exchange. The reason for this huge expansion of \nfunds may be summed up in one word: demand. Funds continue to roll off \nthe assembly line because investors want more avenues in which to put \ntheir money.\n  Investors are attracted to mutual funds because the market has \nremained generally trouble-free and because of its relative safety. \nWhile much of the credit for this environment should go to go to the \nindustry itself, so too should credit go to an effective system of \nregulation. In our enthusiasm for updating and modernizing the \noversight of this marketplace, care must be taken to maintain vital \ninvestor protections that have helped this industry grow and prosper.\n  Our securities laws and regulations are designed first and foremost \nto protect investors and to maintain the integrity of the marketplace, \nthereby promoting trust and confidence in our system of capital \nformation. We should strive for a securities regulatory system that is \ntough--but one that also is fair and reasonable.\n  On balance, I believe that this legislation does a good job of \neliminating or modernizing laws and regulations that either are \nduplicative or outdated--without sacrificing investor protection. \nHowever, I also recognize that the introduction of this bill is just \nthe first step in a longer process and that further fine tuning and \nrevisions will be in order as we learn more about the practical effect \nof several of its specific provisions. I have decided to sign on as a \nco-sponsor despite the reservations I have about specific provisions \ncontained in the bill. I will seek out the comments and views of \nfederal and state regulators, industry representatives, and investor \nadvocates on these matters.\n  I would like to take just a few minutes to briefly highlight a few \nkey provisions of this legislation:\n  More rational investment adviser oversight. This bill seeks to \nrationalize the regulatory scheme for investment advisers. Over the \nlast decade, both the House of Representatives and the Senate have held \nnumerous hearings in which we have been told that our system of \ninvestment adviser regulation is woefully inadequate, both in terms of \nthe resources we devote to the effort and the laws that govern the \nindustry. Today, we take a modest first step in the effort to establish \na credible program of investment adviser oversight. While I applaud the \nsensible approach contained in this bill, it is my hope that Congress \ndoes not end its consideration of this issue here.\n\n  This bill will direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to focus \non the biggest investment advisers--those who manage more than $25 \nmillion of client assets. Investment advisers who fall below this \nthreshold will be overseen by the State securities regulators, who \nappropriately are given the task of overseeing the smaller, local \ninvestment advisers. Now, it may be that the $25 million is not an \nappropriate dividing line. I would look for guidance here to the \nregulators and the industry who will be questioned on this issue. If we \nlearn that the threshold is too high, too low, or too inflexible, I \nexpect we will make the necessary revisions.\n  The oversight of investment advisers is an extremely important issue, \nas more and more Americans turn to these financial professionals to \nhelp guide them through the increasing complexity of our financial \nmarkets. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives have \naddressed the issue of improving investment adviser oversight for \nseveral years now, but each time we have failed to reach an agreement \non how best to accomplish such a goal. Establishing a more rational \nsystem for determining jurisdiction is a helpful step. But, it is only \na first step. If we can all agree on this, I hope that we can also \nagree to come back next year and begin the process of evaluating \nwhether our investment adviser laws are adequate for the protection of \ninvestors. For example, as I understand it, there is little more to the \nfederal system of regulation than filling out some paperwork and paying \na one-time fee. There are no minimum standards of competency, training, \nor education to become an investment adviser. We\n\n[[Page S5598]]\n\nmust take a closer look at this law to determine where it may be \ndeficient and to make the necessary improvements.\n  Improved State-Federal Coordination. Today, both the Securities and \nExchange Commission and the 50 State securities regulators share the \nresponsibility for overseeing our capital markets. By and large, this \nsystem of shared regulatory responsibility has worked well, with the \nSEC taking responsibility for market-wide issues, while the States \nfocus their attention on the issues most affecting individual investors \nand small businesses.\n  I also believe that there is room for improved coordination and a \nmore clearly defined allocation of responsibility between the States \nand the SEC. I support the goal of eliminating duplicative and \noverlapping regulations that do not provide any additional protections \nto investors or to the markets but which do serve to increase the costs \nof raising capital. I believe this bill draws brighter lines of \nresponsibility between the States and the SEC, and streamlines the \nsecurities offering process for American businesses. However, I will \nwithdraw my support if any changes are made to the bill that will have \nthe effect of weakening the State role in policing sales practices, or \nthat will in any way undermine the enforcement authority of State \nsecurities regulators or the ability of defrauded investors to recover \ntheir losses in court under State laws.\n  Modernization of mutual fund oversight. This bill recognizes the \nfundamentally national character of the mutual fund industry by \nassigning exclusive responsibility for the routine review of mutual \nfund offering documents and related materials to the SEC and NASD. The \nlegislation also encourages further innovation in the mutual fund \nindustry by means of advertising prospectuses and fund of funds.\n  While I understand that this section of the bill generally \ncorresponds to a similar section contained in H.R. 3005 recently \napproved by the House Commerce Committee, I am troubled that the Senate \nversion fails to incorporate two key provisions of the House bill that \ndeal with Commission authority with respect to reporting and record \nkeeping requirements.\n  In closing, I want to say that it is my intention to carefully \nconsider the feedback and comments we receive on this legislation--from \nFederal and State securities regulators--from representatives of the \nsecurities industry--and from investor advocates. I will work to revise \nany provisions that are identified as having the potential to upset the \ndelicate balance between promoting capital formation and protecting \ninvestors that this bill now seeks to accomplish.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Kassebaum, and Mr. \n        Bond):\n  S. 1817. A bill to limit the authority of Federal courts to fashion \nremedies that require local jurisdictions to assess, levy, or collect \ntaxes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    the wisconsin works act of 1996\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure that \nwill assist the President of the United States in carrying out a \npromise he made to the people of Wisconsin that he would approve the \nWisconsin Works program. There have been some problems getting welfare \nactually acted on. I had a very nice letter from the President last \nyear for the work that we did on the welfare reform bill. But that \nmeasure got vetoed and so did a subsequent measure.\n\n  Now, the President has said that he supports the welfare reform \ndemonstration project in Wisconsin, known as Wisconsin Works. Well, \ntoday, on behalf of myself, Senators Coats, Abraham, Gramm of Texas, \nAshcroft, Craig, Coverdell, Grassley, Gregg, Santorum, Faircloth, and \nNickles, I am submitting a very brief bill, which, in substance, says \nthat when waivers are submitted by the Wisconsin Department of Health \nand Services to conduct a demonstration project known as Wisconsin \nWorks, those waivers shall be deemed approved.\n  We have heard many stories about the need to reform welfare, Mr. \nPresident, and one of those stories that has been repeated recently is \nthat of an experiment in Sedalia, MO, where applicants for food stamps \nwere sent to an employer. Many of them took jobs, which is good. It \nmoved them off public assistance. Those who were turned down because \nthey were not capable could stay on public assistance. Those who \nrefused to show up were taken off of the food stamp rolls. So there was \nan incentive for those who did not want to work. Two people went for \nthe job, but they were turned down because they tested positive for \ndrugs.\n  Under existing Federal law, the State of Missouri could not sanction \nthose people, even though they were turned down for a job because they \ntested positive for drugs. The simple point of that is that that \ncreates the most perverse of incentives--the incentive for people who \nare on public assistance and who do not want to have to take a job to \nget on drugs and they can stay on the public assistance rolls.\n  That is the kind of thing that needs to be changed. That is why we \nneed welfare reform. Today, Mr. President, I am simply acting to \nexpedite one of the many waivers now pending from the States, which has \nbeen delayed, I understand from the Governors, an average of 210 days. \nThis measure, if and when adopted, will deem the waivers submitted by \nthe State of Wisconsin to be approved.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Kassebaum, and Mr. \n        Bond):\n  S. 1817. A bill to limit the authority of Federal courts to fashion \nremedies that require local jurisdictions to assess, levy, or collect \ntaxes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             the fairness in judicial taxation act of 1996\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I introduce the Fairness in \nJudicial Taxation Act of 1996. I would like to thank Senator Hatch, \nSenator Kassebaum, and Congressman Manzullo for their leadership on \nthis issue. I hope that both the House and Senate will move quickly to \npass this bill.\n  This important piece of legislation will curb the awesome power that \nthe Federal courts gave themselves in the Supreme Court Case of \nMissouri versus Jenkins. As this body well knows, in that case the U.S. \nSupreme Court ruled that Federal courts could force towns and cities \nacross America to raise taxes--even if State law forbids a tax \nincrease. Amazingly, the Supreme Court failed to place any effective \nlimitation on this power.\n  This is outrageous and violates one of the basic principles our great \nNation was founded on--no taxation without representation. I really \ncan't think of a more un-American creature than a tax imposed by an \nunelected, unaccountable Federal judge. I urge my fellow Senators to \nremember--the power to tax is the power to destroy.\n  This Congress is working hard to reduce the tax burdens on American \nfamilies and small businesses. It would be a dereliction of duty not to \ndo what we can to protect the American taxpayer from the destructive \npower of judge-imposed taxes.\n  Today, I expect to be appointed to a national commission which is \ncharged with looking into ways to change the way the IRS operates so \nthat it will be fairer to the American taxpayer. The bill I introduce \ntoday is intended to deal with the same sort of problem--helping to \nprotect the American people from the abusive use of Federal power in \nthe collection of taxes.\n  In my view, and I believe in the view of the vast majority of \nAmerican taxpayers, it doesn't matter where the abuse comes from--the \nIRS or some Federal judge. The bottom line is that the scale has tipped \ntoo far in the direction of the Federal Government and away from \nprotecting the rights of the American people.\n  Now, we cannot by statute overturn Missouri versus Jenkins. And we \ndon't have the votes to pass a constitutional amendment. Since the \nSupreme Court has spoken, and we are stuck with judge-imposed taxes, \nthe Fairness in Judicial Taxation Act goes as far as we can. The bill \nsets up a six-part test which must be met before a judge can compel the \nraising of taxes. In brief, before a court could impose a tax, the \njudge would have to prove:\n\n  That there is no way--other than a tax--to achieve justice; right \nnow, courts can compel the raising of taxes\n\n[[Page S5599]]\n\nwithout even looking to see what else can be done;\n  The tax won't in reality make the problems the tax is supposed to fix \neven worse;\n  That the tax will not force property owners to leave the area, \nthereby actually reducing the amount of tax revenue for the town or \ncity;\n  The proposed tax will not cause property values to plummet; when \nproperty owners leave to avoid judge-imposed taxes, this can cause the \nvalue of land and property to go through the floor;\n  The tax will not override tax caps set by local law; in Missouri \nversus Jenkins, the Supreme Court actually ruled that Federal Judge can \nstrike down local tax caps;\n  The proposed tax will effectively redress only the narrow issue \nbefore the court; in some cases, Federal judges have used judge-imposed \ntaxation plans to pay for vast social engineering schemes.\n  As you can see, Mr. President, these six factors will make it \ndifficult--but not impossible--for courts to raise taxes. I wish we \ncould just overturn Missouri versus Jenkins, but we can't. So, this is \nthe next best thing.\n  Importantly, the Fairness in Judicial Taxation Act gives everyday, \naverage Americans the right to go before the court and be heard on the \nissue of tax increases. Congress might not be able to force courts not \nto raise taxes, but we can at least make the courts listen to people \nwho will be harmed by the tax increase. And anyone who wants to, and \nwho has appeared before the judge to oppose the tax, can file their own \nindependent appeal--immediately, and not at the end of the court case, \nwhich can drag on for many years.\n  Mr. President, this bill is good and fair and reasonable. It returns \npower back to the American people in a real and effective way.\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today \nSenator Grassley in introducing the Fairness in Judicial Taxation Act \nof 1996. I want to commend Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, and \nCongressman Manzullo for their leadership on this important issue.\n  In recent years, a number of judges have ordered local governments to \nimpose taxes on citizens as a means to remedy a constitutional \nviolation. In many of these cases, I have believed that Federal courts \nexceeded their limited jurisdiction under article III of the \nConstitution. While I fully understand the role of the judiciary in \nprotecting constitutional rights, I do not believe that judges should \nbe in the business of needlessly imposing taxes.\n  Our legislation addresses this issue by requiring Federal courts to \nmeet certain criteria before imposing a tax. The Federal court must \nfind that: There is no other means available to remedy the deprivation \nof rights, the tax will not contribute to the deprivation intended to \nbe remedied, the tax will not result in a loss of revenue, the tax will \nnot disproportionately affect any racial, ethnic, or national group, \nand plans submitted by a locality will not effectively redress the \ndeprivation.\n  These five criteria are similar to the analysis any effective \nlegislature would undertake before imposing a tax on its people. It is \na reasonable, moderate approach to a difficult issue.\n  Mr. President, in 1990, I joined Senator Danforth in supporting a \nconstitutional amendment which would prohibit judicial taxation. \nSenator Thurmond has advocated a legislative solution to this same \nissue. While these various approaches have not yet been successful, I \nbelieve they represent the emerging consensus that courts should stay \nout of the business of imposing taxes.\n  I would hope that the legislation we are introducing today will \ncontribute to the important debate about this issue.\n  Mr. President, my interest in the issue of judicial taxation grew out \nof the experience of the Kansas City, MO, school system. In that case, \nthe Federal judge has essentially taken over the school system by \nimposing a tax on the local population in order to finance \nimplementation of a magnet school plan. His intervention, I would \nargue, has created an undercurrent of ill will, exacerbated racial \ntension, and done little to solve, over the long term, the problems \nwith the Kansas City of school system.\n  School desegregation is not an easy issue. It is fraught with \nemotion, and there are no magic answers. But imposing a comprehensive \nsolution from the bench--without the support of the community--has not \nproven effective. We simply must find a better approach to this \nproblem--an approach which brings a community together.\n  I, for one, have strongly supported neighborhood schools. One of the \nreal strengths of our education system has been in its local base. The \nsense of connection among students, parents, school officials, and \ncommunities is a vitally important source of support for children. When \neducation loses its roots in the neighborhood, we lose the commitment \nand emphasis which are critical to academic success.\n  Moreover, at a time when the stresses and outright breakdown of many \nfamilies have denied to children the strong and positive messages they \nshould be receiving from the parents, the sense of connection and \nbelonging that a school can provide becomes even more vital.\n  I fear that complex, Rube Goldberg solutions involving busing, magnet \nschools, and the such--financied by judicially imposed taxes--undermine \ncommunity support for effective schooling. The business at hand is to \nguarantee that all our students have an opportunity for a quality \neducation in their neighborhoods. That is where we should devote our \nenergies and our financial resources.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Grassley in \nproposing legislation which deals with a key aspect of this problem--\nthe imposition of taxes by Federal courts. It is my hope that the \nSenate will act expeditiously on this important legislation, and \ncommunities will again work together to improve education for all their \nchildren.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Mr. Leahy, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Moseley-Braun Mr. Rockefeller, and \n        Mr. Simon) (by request):\n  S. 1818.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor retirement savings and security; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     retirement savings legislation\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, lack of retirement security is America's \nquiet crisis.\n  Americans who work hard all their lives--either in the workplace or \nat home--deserve peace of mind that a secure retirement awaits them. \nBut too many Americans live in fear that they cannot afford to retire \nbecause they do not have adequate pension coverage.\n  Right now, 51 million working Americans--more than half of private \nsector workers--have no private pension plan. Women are especially hard \nhit by this quiet crisis. Nearly two-thirds of working women do not \nhave pension plans. And if you work in a small business, you only have \na 1-in-4 chance of getting pension coverage.\n  Even those workers fortunate enough to have a pension plan cannot be \nsure their pensions will actually be there when they are ready to \nretire. Add to that the fact that more Americans are spending every \ndollar they earn just to pay the bills, leaving less and less for \nretirement, and it is no wonder people are worried about the future.\n  Working Americans should be able to count on a pyramid of income \nsources that, along with Medicare, provides them with a secure \nretirement. Social Security is the base of that pyramid, the foundation \nof retirement security. At the top of the pyramid are employer-provided \npensions and private savings.\n  From day one, Democrats in this Congress have had to fight to protect \nSocial Security and Medicare from attacks by the far right. And we will \ncontinue to defend those programs as the critical bedrock of retirement \nsecurity.\n  But Social Security and Medicare--alone--were never intended to \nprovide\n\n[[Page S5600]]\n\nfull retirement security. If people are going to retire with dignity \nand security, they need personal savings, and they need adequate \npension coverage. But too many obstacles exist in our current system \nfor millions of Americans to get and keep pension coverage.\n  That is why pension reform is one of the top 3 priorities for \nDemocrats between now and November. We are committed to getting some, \nif not all, of this package back to the President for his signature \nbefore this Congress ends.\n  Democrats plan to ease the fears of working Americans by making it \neasier for businesses to offer pension plans, and easier for workers \nwho do not have access to employer-sponsored pensions plans to set up \ntheir own, tax-free pension plans.\n  We will also establish a new kind of 401(k) plan to help people save \nup to $5,000 a year, tax-free, for retirement.\n  Workers will be able to take their pensions and retirement savings \naccounts with them when they change jobs. They will not lose what they \nhave already saved every time they take a new job. That is essential in \nan economy where the average worker will change jobs up to 8 times in \nhis or her career.\n  In addition to more pensions, this plan will make all pensions more \nsecure by requiring pension funds to be invested in a more timely \nmanner, and by increasing civil and criminal penalties for pension \nraiding.\n  Finally, Democrats in the Senate will push to dramatically increase \nwomen's retirement security by enabling them to earn pensions \nthemselves, and by making sure women are aware of the spousal pension \nfunds to which they may be entitled.\n  My colleague from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, predicted in a recent \nspeech that pension reform would be the big issue for the next \nCongress. I respectfully disagree with my colleague. Senate Democrats \nbelieve that pension reform is a big issue for this Congress. There is \nno reason the American people should have to wait that long.\n  People who work hard all their lives deserve to be able to retire \nwith dignity and security. We intend to ensure that they can, and we \nintend to do so this year.\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this \nopportunity to join my colleagues in introducing President Clinton's \npension legislation, the Retirement Savings and Security Act. This \nlegislation addresses some of the most serious concerns of the Nation's \nwork force, and it will have a positive and lasting impact on the \nworking people of this country. The Retirement Savings and Security Act \nwill help America's working people prepare for their retirement, and \nhelp ensure their future economic security.\n  This plan tackles the significant problems of pension coverage and \nportability by making it easier for people to enroll in pension plans, \nby making it easier for small businesses to offer benefits to their \nemployees, and by making it easier for people to save for their \nretirement.\n  A baby boomer will turn 50 every 7 seconds this year. The average \nAmerican will hold between four and eight jobs in his or her lifetime. \nThese trends require that we concern ourselves with increasing access \nto our Nation's pension system and ensuring that pensions are portable.\n  As the sponsor of S. 1756, the Women's Pension Equity Act, I want to \ntake special note of the attention the President's plan gives to some \nof the pension issues which have a disproportionate impact on women.\n  Our pension system was not designed for working women, either those \nin the work force or in the home. The statistics vividly make the case. \nWomen make up 60 percent of seniors over 65 years old, but 75 percent \nof the elderly poor. An elderly woman is twice as likely as a man to \nlive below the poverty line. One reason for the high incidence of \npoverty among older women is clear--less than one-third of female \nretirees receive any pension benefits at all and for those that do, the \naverage benefit is only half that of male retirees. Over half of all \nmale retirees receive pension benefits.\n  There are a number of reasons for the disparity in men's and women's \npension coverage and benefits. Women are more likely to move in and out \nof the work force to care for family, women are more likely to work at \nhome, or to work in industries without generous salary or pension \nbenefits, and women earn less compared to men--all of which contributes \nto little or no pension income.\n  This legislation encourages increased portability and lower vesting \nrequirements. Allowing workers to earn pension benefits quickly and to \ntake those benefits with them when they change jobs will directly \nbenefit women, who are more likely than men to take time out of the \nwork force to care for their children or their parents.\n  This legislation encourages small business to offer 401(k) plans. \nExpanding pension coverage into small businesses will directly benefit \nwomen, who disproportionately work in small businesses.\n  This legislation encourages employers to accept a lump sum rollover \nof a new employee's pension funds from the previous employer. Making it \neasier to transfer retirement funds directly into a new account, \nthereby decreasing the likelihood of pension savings being spent before \nretirement, will directly benefit women, who are almost a third more \nlikely to receive a lump sum payment as their sole pension income, will \nbenefit directly.\n  In addition, this plan contains several targeted initiatives that \nwere drawn, in part, from S. 1756, and that will help to further ensure \nretirement security for older women. These are initiatives to protect \nworking women and homemakers alike who face widowhood or divorce. The \ncurrent pension laws often leave widows and divorced women without any \nof the pension benefits earned by their husbands during many years of \nmarriage.\n\n  I am very pleased that the President acted to ensure that these \nprovisions were included in the administration's pension bill. The \nPresident understands that our pension laws have to reflect the reality \nfaced by women today in the work force, in the home, and in retirement.\n  I want to take particular note of the President's interest in dealing \nwith two problems affecting widows and divorced widows whose deceased \nhusbands participated in the Federal civil service retirement system.\n  The first provision in this legislation allows a widow or divorced \nwidow to collect their husband's civil service pension if he dies after \nleaving his civil service job and before collecting his pension \nbenefits. The second provision allows a court that awards a woman part \nof her husband's civil service pension upon divorce, to extend that \naward to any lump sum payment made if the husband dies before \ncollecting benefits.\n  These provisions ensure that women will not be left without pension \nincome in their retirement years because of absurd, yet potentially \ndevastating, pension loopholes in the civil service retirement system. \nSimilar language is included in S. 1756.\n  Mr. President, the President's pension initiative will result in \nsignificant improvements in pension coverage for older women. This bill \nis just another example of the President's commitment to increase the \neconomic security of all Americans.\n  All Americans need improved pension coverage. We need to know that we \ncan retire without falling into poverty or becoming a huge financial \nburden for our families. We need to know that the golden years are not \ngoing to turn into disposable years.\n  I commend the President on his efforts to expand pension coverage, \nportability, and security for all Americans and I commend the President \nfor making a special effort when it comes to older women living alone--\nthose most likely to live in poverty.\n  I am proud to be able to cosponsor this important initiative. All \nAmericans, women included, deserve to retire with dignity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Con. Res. 61\n\n       Whereas the most dangerous military competition in the \n     history of mankind has come to a close without a nuclear \n     holocaust;\n       Whereas men and women in the armed forces, intelligence \n     community, and foreign service community of the United States\n\n[[Page S5602]]\n\n     faithfully performed their duties during the period known as \n     the Cold War;\n       Whereas many of these persons were isolated from family and \n     friends and served under arduous conditions in far away lands \n     in order to preserve peace and harmony throughout the world:\n       Whereas these persons performed their duty in the most \n     successful, extended, military competition in the history of \n     mankind and ensured that weapons of mass destruction, capable \n     of destroying all humanity, were never released;\n       Whereas the self-discipline and dedication of these persons \n     were fundamental to the prevention of a Super Power conflict; \n     and\n       Whereas the silent determination of these persons brought a \n     peaceful victory to all the people of the world: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress acknowledges the service and \n     sacrifices of these Americans who contributed to historic \n     victory in the Cold War.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Representative \nRick Lazio of New York, in paying tribute to the dedicated Americans \nwho served in the Armed Forces, Intelligence Agencies, and the \nDiplomatic Corps during the Cold War. Their courageous efforts not only \nensured America's security, but eventually brought peace and freedom to \nmillions of people around the world who had suffered under communism \nfor decades.\n  In the aftermath of World War II, a new threat to freedom emerged. \nFifty years ago this spring, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill \nwarned the Western world of that new threat in a speech at Westminster \nCollege in Fulton, Missouri. ``From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in \nthe Adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the Continent * * *. \nThe Communist parties, which were very small in all these Eastern \nStates of Europe, have been raised to pre-eminence and power far beyond \ntheir numbers and are seeking everywhere to obtain totalitarian \ncontrol. Police governments are prevailing in nearly every case, and so \nfar, except in Czechoslovakia, there is no true democracy.'' To combat \nthis new threat Prime Minister Churchill called on us to work to \nprevent open hostilities and to ensure the ``* * * establishment of \nconditions of freedom and democracy as rapidly as possible in all \ncountries.'' He further called for cooperation between the United \nStates and her allies ``* * * in the air, on the sea, all over the \nglobe and in science and in industry, and in moral force * * *'' in \norder that we might have an ``overwhelming assurance of security.''\n  For the next four decades, the United States, with its Allies, stood \nresolute against Communist aggression. The full resources of our \nmilitary, intelligence organizations, and diplomatic corps were brought \nto bear to ensure freedom and prevent the spread of tyranny. The United \nStates, through the Marshall Plan, rebuilt Europe. We formed alliances, \nsuch as NATO, with our allies to provide a coordinated military \nresponse to Communist aggression. And the United States embarked on the \nStrategic Defense Initiative, to ensure that future generations would \nnot grow up fearing a nuclear holocaust.\n  Now, 50 years after Prime Minister Churchill's speech in Fulton, \nMissouri the United States is again the world's only super power. We \nagain are leading the world into a new age. Just as America's \nprincipled leadership was required for victory in the Cold War, so will \nour moral strength be required to face the challenges of the future.\n  Mr. President, I think it is only fitting that today we take a few \nmoments to recognize and thank those Americans who served our \ngovernment throughout the long years of the Cold War. Without their \ndedication, bravery, and sacrifice our victory would not have been \npossible. I am pleased to join Congressman Lazio in recognizing these \nAmericans and I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in this \nexpression of thanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5601-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5602-S5603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 62--RELATIVE TO THE NAMING THE FIRST OF \n          THE FLEET NEW ATTACK SUBMARINES THE ``SOUTH DAKOTA''\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 62\n\n       Whereas the battleship South Dakota (BB-57) was \n     commissioned on March 20, 1942, and was originally scheduled \n     to host the surrender of Japan in World War II;\n       Whereas the battleship South Dakota (BB-57) quickly became \n     the flagship of Admiral Chester W. Nimitz's 3d fleet and was \n     renowned as the famous Battleship ``X'';\n       Whereas the battleship South Dakota (BB-57) was one of the \n     greatest and most decorated battleships of World War II, \n     earning the Navy unit commendation, the Asiatic-Pacific \n     Campaign Medal with 13 battle stars, the World War II Victory \n     Medal, and the Navy Occupation Service Medal;\n       Whereas on January 31, 1947, after only 5 years of service, \n     the battleship South Dakota (BB-57) was decommissioned and \n     placed in reserve;;\n       Whereas during its 5 years of dutiful service, the crew of \n     the battleship South Dakota (BB-57) demonstrated both \n     dedication and courage in their efforts to preserve the \n     security of the United States and protect the freedoms of all \n     Americans; and\n       Whereas it is entirely appropriate to have the first of the \n     fleet of the new attack submarines of the Navy named the \n     ``South Dakota'' in order to honor the courage and commitment \n     of the brave crew of the battleship South Dakota (BB-57), and \n     to serve as a fitting tribute to one of America's truly great \n     battleships: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that the \n     Secretary of the Navy should name the first of the fleet of \n     the new attack submarines of the Navy the ``South Dakota''.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise to honor and recognize Floyd \nGulbrandson, Al Rickel, Charles Skorpik, Willie Wieland, and the rest \nof the dedicated crew of the famous World War II battleship BB-57, the \nSouth Dakota, by introducing a resolution to name the first of the next \ngeneration of new attack submarines (NSSN) the South Dakota.\n  Following naval tradition, naming the first vessel in a new fleet \nchristens the entire fleet as the class of the first vessel named. \nHence by naming the first submarine South Dakota, the entire NSSN fleet \nof four would be classified as the South Dakota class. This honor, \nnaming a class of submarines after the BB-57 is truly an appropriate \ntribute.\n  For my colleagues familiar with U.S. naval history, the name South \nDakota should recall a tradition of great battleships and great \nservice. As history records, two separate classes of battleships have \nborne the name South Dakota. Both were marked by innovative design, \nartillery power, and sea strength. Commissioned in 1908 and authorized \non August 19, 1916, BB-49, the first of a class of South Dakota \nbattleships was to include six potent vessels. However, after the \nUnited States signed the Washington Arms Naval Limitation Treaty on \nFebruary 6, 1922, construction of BB-49 and the entire South Dakota \nclass was canceled due to a 10-year prohibition on warship \nconstruction. The first South Dakota, BB-49, would never participate in \nsea combat as she was scrapped before completion. Naval combat for a \nSouth Dakota class of warships would have to wait until World War II.\n  The next class of South Dakota battleships, this time composed of \nfour vessels, was commissioned 33 years later in 1941, the first being \nBB-57. The four South Dakota class battleships were faster, stronger, \nand more resistant to damage than any other vessels constructed at that \ntime. In particular, stretching more than 600 feet and displacing more \nthan 43,000 tons of water, BB-57 was equipped with massive firepower, \nwhich included 9 16-inch guns, 16 5-inch guns, 68 40-millimeter guns, \nand 76 20-millimeter guns.\n  Both classes of South Dakota battleships represented the ingenious \ntechnological and planning expertise of America's battleship designers. \nThese ships were carefully designed to ensure that our strategic \ninterests and our defense needs were met. Particularly in the case of \nBB-57, the planning and design of the battleship were truly remarkable \nnaval achievements, considering treaty limitations prior to World War \nII. South Dakota represented future U.S. domination as a world naval \npower.\n  Of course, a well-designed battleship is useless without a well-\ntrained, dedicated crew. I would like to share with my colleagues an \nexcerpt from a letter I received from a crewmember of the South Dakota. \nMr. Elmer Pry's words represent the zeal, loyalty, and teamwork of \nthose who served on this ship.\n\n       This ship was the most fightingest hard hitting machine of \n     war that man has ever seen. We took it and by joe we dished \n     it out. I was a very proud person to have the honor\n\n[[Page S5603]]\n\n     to have been aboard her and I know all my shipmates felt the \n     same. She took us through hell and back. We were mostly a \n     green crew but with the help of the old salts we learned how \n     to do the job and we sure did it as the record shows but \n     I guess you have to give the credit to our beloved \n     skipper, Captain Thomas L. Gatch. He is the one that made \n     us a fighting crew. He trained us the day he came aboard \n     to shoot and shoot straight. . . . Because of him the ship \n     became a fighting machine.\n\n  Mr. President, Mr. Pry's words reflect that no resource we commit to \nthe defense of our country is more valued and more precious than the \nbrave individuals who sacrifice and serve. Admiral Nimitz once said, \n``We [cannot] relax our readiness to defend ourselves. Our armament \nmust be adequate to the needs, but our faith is not primarily in these \nmachines of defense but in ourselves''. This was especially true of the \nbrave crew of the South Dakota. To the American people, BB-57 became \nknown as the famed ``Battleship X'', the flagship of Adm. Chester W. \nNimitz's Third Fleet during World War II.\n  When the call to duty went out following the attack on Pearl Harbor, \nthe crew of the South Dakota answered with valiant service. The South \nDakota became the most decorated battleship of World War II. She \nparticipated in 9 major shore bombardments and shot down 64 enemy \naircraft. Collectively, the crew of the South Dakota endured many \nbattles and earned several distinguished awards, including the Navy \nUnit Commendation, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with 13 battle \nstars, the World War II Victory Medal, and the Navy Occupation Service \nMedal.\n  On October 26, 1942, the South Dakota entered its first major battle \nwith a green crew on deck. She was attacked by 180 enemy bombers in \nwhat is now known as the Battle of Santa Cruz Island. Defending both \nthe Enterprise and Hornet aircraft carriers, the South Dakota \nboldly exchanged gunfire and shot down an unprecedented 30 enemy \naircraft, rendering 2 enemy aircraft carriers inoperative. Through \nrepeated bombardments and heavy fire, only 1 bomb out of 23 struck the \nSouth Dakota. For their valiant actions and enduring perseverance, \nCaptain Gatch was decorated with the Navy Cross, the crew was presented \nwith the Navy Unit Commendation, and the South Dakota received the \nfirst of 13 battle stars. There is no question that BB-57 was \ninstrumental in our winning the naval war in the Pacific, thus \nprotecting many of the freedoms we and countless others around the \nworld enjoy today.\n\n  The name South Dakota is important in the history of World War II, \nnot just in terms of naval heroism, but also heroism by South Dakotans \non the homefront and the front lines. The State of South Dakota has a \nlong history of strong support for the protection of our national \nsecurity interests. Ten percent of the population of South Dakota, \n74,100 individuals, are veterans. Of those, 20,100 served our country \nduring World War II. Our veterans are representative of South Dakota's \nardent commitment to serving our Nation in times of peace and war.\n  However, families who stayed at home also contributed to and \nsupported the war effort. South Dakotans young and old dug deep into \ntheir pockets and piggy banks to keep American troops armed, fed, and \nclothed. During eight national fundraising campaigns, South Dakota \nexceeded its quotas. South Dakota consistently ranked first or second \nin the per capita sale of the Series ``E'' war bonds, known as the \npeople's bonds. South Dakota raised $111.5 million from the sale of \npeople's bonds--that is $173 for every South Dakota man, woman, and \nchild. I am proud to hail from a State that stands for such sacrifice \nand service.\n  Mr. President, On January 31, 1947, the South Dakota was \ndecommissioned and sold as scrap metal for $466,425. The mainmast and \nstubs of the 16-inch gun were saved from salvage and stand as a \nmemorial in Sioux Falls to commemorate those who served aboard BB-57. \nThe crew of the South Dakota and their descendants gather in Sioux \nFalls every 2 years to reminisce and offer their respects to those who \nserved our country in war.\n  It would be appropriate for the first of our next generation of \nattack submarines--the latest example of naval technological \ninnovation--to carry the name of America's most decorated battleship, \nthe South Dakota. NSSN will represent the next generation of undersea \nsuperiority. NSSN will have increased flexibility, maneuverability and \narmaments. If the NSSN is named South Dakota, it will carry the history \nof days ago.\n  My resolution honors the memory of those associated with the name \nSouth Dakota, whether it be the designers of the previous South Dakota \nclass ships, the veterans who served aboard the BB-57, or the thousands \nof South Dakotans who unfailingly have answered the call to serve our \ncountry. I hope my colleagues will join me in furthering the tradition \nof the South Dakota by joining as sponsors of this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5602-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 256--RELATIVE TO THE PRODUCTION OF RECORDS BY THE \n                    SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE\n\n  Mr. DOLE (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 178; and\n       (7) The Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund as adopted by \n     the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 \n     fully funds the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act \n     of 1994 without adding to the federal budget deficit.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions and the\n\n[[Page S5604]]\n\n     functional totals underlying this resolution assume the \n     Federal Government's commitment to fund Federal law \n     enforcement programs and programs to assist State and local \n     efforts shall be maintained and funding for the Violent Crime \n     Reduction Trust Fund shall not be cut as the resolution \n     adopted by the House of Representatives would require.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5603-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5604-S5609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE SENATE CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM ACT OF 1996\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 McCAIN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 4038\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Wellstone, \nMr. Graham, Mr. Simon, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, \nMr. Dodd, and Mr. Bingaman) submitted an amendment intended to be \nproposed by them to the bill (S. 1764) to authorize appropriations for \nfiscal year 1997 for military construction, and for other purposes; \nfrom the Committee on Armed Services; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert the following new title:\n                  TITLE ____--CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n     SEC. ____01.

Mr. President, I would like to briefly discuss the \nneed for reform of our intelligence agencies. This is a subject that \nhas occupied the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence at least since \nI was vice chairman during the mid-1980's, and I am encouraged that the \nCongress and the administration are making progress on this. I applaud \nthe work of Chairman Specter and Vice Chairman Kerrey for their efforts \nin this area.\n  I do not think there is any longer a serious question that our \nintelligence agencies need reform. The issue is what kind of reform, \nand how much.\n  For over 40 years, the CIA, the DIA, the State Department's \nIntelligence and Research Bureau, and every other agency or department \nthat has ever had any pretensions of playing a role in national \nsecurity or foreign policy, geared their intelligence activities to the \nnecessities of the cold war. The entire structure, which was poorly \ncoordinated, duplicative, inefficient, and often ineffective, was set \nup to respond to the Soviet threat.\n  Billions of dollars were spent on activities which today have little \nrelevance to our intelligence needs or budgetary realities and more \nimportantly, failed to even predict the greatest event since World War \nII--the disintegration of the former Soviet Union.\n  Appalling lapses have only recently come to light, the Aldrich Ames \ncase being the most notorious example. The CIA's payment of thousands \nof dollars to a Guatemalan colonel who it had reason to believe had \nbeen involved in the murder of an American citizen, is another. \nUnfortunately, there are others.\n  But beyond these widely publicized lapses in judgment and \nintelligence analysis, a culture developed within the intelligence \ncommunity that at times resulted in intelligence officials withholding \ncrucial information from other officials in the administration and \nCongress who were formulating and implementing policy. There are \nexamples of station chiefs failing to disclose information to our \nambassadors about a matter of grave importance. In Guatemala, the CIA \nstation chief reportedly failed to inform our Ambassador of information \nrelating to the murder of an American citizen by Guatemalan soldiers. \nThe Ambassador, left in the dark, told the victim's family that the \nEmbassy had no information about this crime.\n  I did not rise today simply to point out the failures of the \nintelligence community. Our intelligence agencies are comprised of hard \nworking, dedicated people who often provide critical and accurate \ninformation to the Congress and the executive branch. However, since \nthe end of the cold war our intelligence needs have changed \ndramatically while our intelligence agencies have not.\n  The U.S. intelligence community must reinvent itself to address more \neffectively the growing threats to our national security, including \nregional conflicts, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \ninternational organized crime, narcotics trafficking, and terrorism. In \norder to do so effectively, the intelligence community must reduce \nduplication between agencies, increase efficiency, create a greater \naccountability for the Director of Central Intelligence, and increase \nthe role of oversight to ensure that the reforms are cost effective.\n  In response to the changing role of U.S. intelligence, in 1994, \nformer Senator Dennis DeConcini and the senior Senator from Virginia, \nSenator John Warner, proposed the creation of a bipartisan commission \nmade up of Members of Congress, the administration, and the private \nsector to review the current condition of the intelligence community \nand propose ideas for how best to make lasting reforms. The \nIntelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 created the \nCommission on the Roles and Capabilities of the U.S. Intelligence \nCommunity chaired by former Secretary of Defense Les Aspin. \nUnfortunately, Les passed away several months after his appointment, \nbut his enthusiasm and hard work were not lost on the \nCommission's members or its staff.\n\n  The Commission's goal was to review the role of the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity in the post-cold war world. After almost a year's work, the \nCommission issued its findings and recommendations on March 1, 1996.\n  The Commission recommended that U.S. intelligence agencies should \nintegrate intelligence into the policy community, expand cooperation \nbetween agencies and the Congress and create greater efficiency in \norder to meet the intelligence requirements of the 21st century. I \nstrongly support these goals.\n  But the Commission did not go far enough. I am convinced that \nsubstantive reforms will not take root unless the Director of Central \nIntelligence is given more authority and control over the entire \nintelligence budget.\n  I have no doubt that Director Deutch is one of the CIA's finest \nDirectors. However, he does not have sufficient resources at his \ndisposal to fully reform the many different intelligence agencies \nthroughout the Federal Government.\n  Although Director Deutch is responsible for approving the annual \nbudget for our national intelligence agencies, over 95 percent of the \nintelligence budget is funded through the Department of Defense and 85 \npercent of the intelligence budget is utilized by agencies not under \nhis control. This must change.\n  I am encouraged that the Senate Intelligence Committee recently took \na step toward providing the DCI with greater control over the \nintelligence budget. On April 24, the committee supported the Clinton \nadministration's proposal to declassify the amount spent on the \nintelligence budget. More importantly, the committee supported \nproposals to give the DCI a role in appointing the heads of all the \nintelligence agencies and greater control over the entire intelligence \nbudget, including those intelligence agencies within the Pentagon. I \napplaud the committee's actions and while I hope the Senate will debate \nthis further, I urge the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nto support the Intelligence Committee's goals.\n  In addition to providing the DCI with more control over the \nintelligence budget, I believe that the cloak of secrecy should be \nremoved from the intelligence community to as great an extent as \npossible. As a government that prides itself on its openness, the \nUnited States should not restrict access to information that does not \njeopardize national security.\n  Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the senior Senator \nfrom New York, Senator Moynihan, the former vice chair of the \nIntelligence Committee. Senator Moynihan's knowledge of history and his \nexperience both before and during his service in the U.S. Senate give \nhim tremendous insight into how the intelligence community should be \nreformed.\n  I agree with Senator Moynihan's concern about secrecy in the \nintelligence community. The extraordinary and excessive efforts to \nclassify harmless information wastes money, discourages informed \ndebate, and leads to inaccurate information treated as fact by the \npeople who are responsible for crafting U.S. foreign policy. In \nreality, much of what is deemed to be secret can be found by picking up \nthe morning paper or watching CNN.\n  I hope that the Congress and the executive branch will work together \nto reform the U.S. intelligence community. The report on the Commission \non the Roles and Capabilities of the United States Intelligence \nCommunity is a good place to start, but its proposals should not be the \nonly reforms discussed. We must continue to work to ensure that the \nintelligence community becomes cost effective and addresses the \nintelligence needs of the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5611-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5611-S5612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO THE TOWN OF ALTON'S BICENTENNIAL CELEBRATION AND 200 YEARS \n                               OF HISTORY\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Alton, \nNH, on\n\n[[Page S5612]]\n\nthe occasion of their community bicentennial celebration. Almost 200 \nyears ago on June 16, 1796, the town of Alton was incorporated by the \nNew Hampshire House and Senate and approved by then-Governor Gilman. To \nhonor 200 years of history, the citizens of Alton have designated 1996 \nas a year of bicentennial celebrations with a variety of special town \nactivities. Alton's big Bicentennial Day celebration is planned for \nJune 16 and the bicentennial parade will take place August 17.\n  The history of Alton began around 1770 when the first pioneers \narrived in the area. Early settlers worked diligently to construct \nroads and bridges, schools and churches. The area now known as Alton \nthese settlers first moved to was truly majestic--the southern tip of \nLake Winnipesaukee along the shores of the Merrymeeting River, and \nnestled by the mountains. Today, Alton still sits in a very picturesque \narea of the lakes region of New Hampshire--not too far from my hometown \nof Tuftonboro.\n  Alton's first town hall meeting was held at the home of Capt. \nBenjamin Bennett. Town officers were elected on that day, March 13, \n1797, and other pertinent town matters were discussed. For hundreds of \nyears now, Alton has continued the town meeting tradition. As Alton's \nbicentennial proclamation states on behalf of Alton's residents, ``the \nprinciples of democracy and self-governance have prevailed on issues \nsuch as spending appropriations, building of meeting houses, support of \neducation, construction of highways and bridges, collection of taxes, \nelection of political representatives, and enforcement of laws.''\n  A number of significant events occurred for Alton in the 1800's. In \n1849, the railroad arrived in the town and the trains continued to stop \nin the Alton Bay area until 1935. Then, in 1872, the steamer, Mount \nWashington, was first launched in Alton Bay after being constructed \nthere. From 1880 to 1920, the Rockwell Clough Co. employed a number of \nresidents and became nationally known as the first manufacturer of cork \nscrews and the company that invented paper clips.\n  Recently, the people of Alton suffered through a devastating flood \nthat destroyed many homes. I had the opportunity to visit the area \nafter the flood and witnessed how quickly this community had joined \ntogether to rebuild. Rescue teams and volunteers, along with families \nand friends, worked together day and night to help their neighbors who \nwere victims of the flood. I was very impressed with the strength and \nfortitude this community displayed.\n  The public officials and residents of Alton have planned some festive \nactivities to recognize the 200 years of history their town has \nenjoyed. A number of exhibits will be on display in the townhall \nfeaturing clay pipes, summer camps, railroads, and the Alton Central \nSchool. The Alton Historical Society will provide a walking tour of the \ncity and conduct various other historical programs. A haunted hay ride \nand haunted house are also planned later in the year for Halloween. \nJune 16 will mark the big anniversary celebration with day-long \nactivities including a family picnic, fireworks, and a bicentennial \nmarch to Alton Central School.\n  My wife taught school in Alton, so this scenic lakeside town holds a \nspecial place in the hearts of the Smith family. I congratulate all the \nresidents of Alton on this historic milestone and wish them all an \nenjoyable year of celebration and remembrance. You all should be very \nproud of your heritage and 200 years of history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5611-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MARK HIMEBAUGH\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to observe Mark \nHimebaugh's 16th birthday.\n  For those who do not know Mark, he is one of America's many missing \nchildren. In November 1991, when he was 11 years old, Mark left his \nhome in Cape May County, NJ, to play. He was never seen again. His \nparents have not seen him in 4\\1/2\\ years. Despite the efforts of his \nparents, law enforcement, and an outstanding group of volunteers, his \nparents say they are no closer to recovering Mark than in November \n1991.\n  Mr. President, it is difficult to imagine the heartache and suffering \nof a parent who has a missing child. With each passing day, there is \ncontinuing concern, continuing fear, and continuing prayers for a safe \nreturn.\n  Unfortunately, each year, thousands of people across the country \ndisappear. Most of these are children. Despite the increased awareness \nand the additional tools law enforcement has acquired, the problem \ncontinues to be serious.\n  Our children are our most precious resource. They are our future. I \nhope with all my heart that the Himebaugh family is reunited with their \nson in the near future. And I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing \nthem strength to continue their search for Mark.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5612-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PREVENT TELEPHONE FRAUD\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I would like to briefly highlight \nthe work of several telecommunications companies and organizations, \nwhich together have created the Alliance To Outfox Phone Fraud. This \ncooperative alliance, which includes the Illinois Consolidated \nTelephone Co., is working to educate and enlist the assistance of \nconsumers in preventing telephone fraud, a rapidly growing crime which \ncosts consumers nearly $3.7 billion every year.\n  As telecommunications technology continues to improve, the potential \nfor fraudulent activity also rises. As hackers have become \nsophisticated enough to keep pace with new technology, telephone fraud \nhas grown because consumers are often unaware of the new dangers. \nTelecommunications fraud takes many forms--``shoulder surfers watch or \nlisten as customers enter their calling card numbers on pay phones; \ncriminals posing as police officers or telephone company \nrepresentatives try to bill calls to homes; and high-technology \ncellular thieves use cloning devices to steal cellular phone serial \nnumbers.\n  Summer travelers are particularly susceptible to telephone fraud. As \nwe approach the hectic summer travel season, I urge consumers to take \nprecautions to ensure that they do not become victims of this \nincreasing crime. Certainly, the efforts of the Alliance To Outfox \nPhone Fraud to increase consumer awareness are a step in the right \ndirection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5612-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5612-S5613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n JOSEPH GARDNER: A LIFE DEDICATED TO MAKING LIFE BETTER FOR PEOPLE AND \n                     EXPANDING THEIR OPPORTUNITIES\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, last week, the city of \nChicago, the State of Illinois, and the United States of America \nsuffered a grievous loss because of the death of Joseph E. Gardner. Joe \nGardner's life was devoted to helping people, to helping communities, \nto bringing people into our economy, to bringing economic growth and \nhope to communities without much of either, and to expanding \nopportunities for everyone.\n  I first met Joe when he was working at the Woodlawn Organization, \nmore years ago than I care to remember. And our paths have crossed \nfrequently ever since then. Joe worked on a wide variety of issues, but \nall of them were fundamentally about helping people, and especially \npoor people, make their lives better. I always admired his commitment \nto people and to neighborhoods, and the energy, the enthusiasm, and the \nsavvy he brought to his work.\n  Chicago is a city of neighborhoods, and Joseph Gardner was a product \nof Chicago neighborhoods. He was raised in the Lawndale neighborhood on \nChicago's West Side, and he graduated from Mount Carmel High School in \nWoodlawn. He earned his undergraduate degree at Loyola, an institution \nin Chicago, and went back to the West Side for a masters degree from \nthe University of Illinois at Chicago.\n  With his education and his obvious gifts, he could have done almost \nanything. But for Joseph Gardner, education was not a means to get away \nfrom his community and his neighbors. Rather it was a way to open doors \nfor poor neighborhoods and poor people who faced closed doors, and who \nhad the doors to opportunity slammed in their faces for far too long.\n  Joseph Gardner chose to give back to his city, and to his community. \nHe chose to devote his life to making it possible for disadvantaged \nyoung people to match and exceed what he had accomplished. He fought \nfor jobs, for decent housing, for education, for safe neighborhoods, \nfor families, and for children. Throughout his career at the\n\n[[Page S5613]]\n\nWoodlawn Organization, at Operation Push, where he was executive vice-\npresident, and in government, the fight was always the same--to open up \nopportunities for people, to expand the possibilities for people, to \nbuild hope, and self-respect, and economic security.\n  Joe Gardner made Chicago a better place. He died far too soon; there \nwas still so much he wanted to do. I will greatly miss him, and I know \nthe people of Chicago and the state of Illinois will miss him, \nparticularly the poor people he cared so much about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5612-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO HIS MAJESTY KING BHUMIBOL ADULYADEJ OF THAILAND\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nHis Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, who will celebrate the \n50th anniversary of his accession to the throne on June 9, 1996. This \nis indeed an auspicious occasion, as King Bhumibol is the first Thai \nking to have reigned for 50 years.\n  King Bhumibol has been the overseer and benefactor of remarkable \nchange and progress for his nation. From the beginning of his reign, he \nhas tirelessly devoted his time and effort to the well-being and \nwelfare of the Thai people. Under his stewardship, government has \nbecome an instrument of progress for people, as evident by the more \nthan 1,800 royal development projects he has initiated in the areas of \nagriculture, environmental conservation, public health, occupational \npromotion, water resources development, communications, and social \nwelfare.\n  During his reign, Thailand has experienced a dramatic transformation \nin its industrial structure to become a leader among developing \nnations. Manufacturing accounts for over 31 percent of the nation's \neconomy and exports are booming. Textiles have supplanted rice as \nThailand's major export item, and Thailand is now a major exporter of \nsophisticated high-technology products. King Bhumibol's leadership in \ndiversifying his nation's economy and encouraging foreign investment \nhas opened new doors of opportunity and prosperity to his people and \nhas propelled Thailand to a place of respected prominence among the \nnations of the Pacific rim.\n  Not only are the industrial and technological advances significant, \nbut King Bhumibol has achieved these gains while preserving the \ncultural integrity and national heritage of the Thai people. He is a \nmuch beloved leader and national patriarch, who has created a unique \nversion of the modern monarchy. Firmly committed to the development of \ndemocratic principles, he has always been on the side of peace and \nprosperity and has responsibly guided his nation within the parameters \nof his constitutional authority.\n  The United States and Thailand have enjoyed a longstanding friendship \nand economic partnership from which both nations have tremendously \nbenefited. I have had the privilege of visiting Thailand on several \noccasions to promote opportunities for trade and investment and have \nbeen profoundly grateful for the assistance and hospitality I have \nreceived. It has been an honor and a pleasure to work with this \nremarkable nation for the continued peace and prosperity of both of our \ncountries.\n  I know that my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join me in \ncongratulating King Bhumibol for his magnificent leadership and \nprosperous reign, as we look forward to many more years of friendship \nwith his great nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5613-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS \n                        VOLUNTARY SERVICE [VAVS]\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this year marks the 50th anniversary \nof the Department of Veterans Affairs Voluntary Service [VAVS]. Its \nhalf-century of caring for veterans and their families in communities \nacross the country has generated more than 440 million hours of service \nand introduced millions of citizens to the fulfillment and satisfaction \nof volunteering.\n  VAVS was born in the burgeoning, postwar VA medical system as VA \nhospital administrators sought a way to organize the spontaneous \nvolunteer movements that developed in communities near military and VA \nhospitals. From the start, VA officials recognized this volunteer \nmovement as a natural adjunct to the quality of health care provided \nveterans. In April 1946, under the leadership of General Omar Bradley, \nthen head of VA, representatives of eight national veterans and service \norganizations met in Washington, DC, to form a national advisory \ncommittee. The result of the meeting was a plan through which both \ncommunity organizations and individuals could participate in \nvolunteering and help manage those volunteer programs locally and \nnationally through advisory committees.\n  That plan was approved May 17, 1946, the birth date of the VA \nVoluntary Service. Today, there are 60 major veteran, civic, and \nservice organizations participating on the National Advisory Committee, \nwith more than 350 other national and community organizations \nsupporting VAVS.\n  Still based in the VA health care system, VA volunteers have expanded \nwith that system into every area of patient care and support, and have \nfollowed the VA mission into community settings such as hospice \nprograms, foster care, hospital-based home care, veterans outreach \ncenters, homeless veterans programs, and special events for the \ndisabled. In addition, community volunteers work increasingly with VA's \nother service delivery venues such as benefits offices and national \ncemeteries.\n  VAVS volunteers have been particularly active in supporting community \nprograms aimed at reaching and serving the homeless. These 1-to-3 day \nevents offer a variety of services to the homeless, and VA resources \nfocus on assisting veterans, who make up at least one-third of the \nhomeless male population in a typical community.\n  Volunteers have also become an integral part of the system of \nnational and local showcase events aimed at introducing persons with \ndisabilities back to mainstream activities. These include the National \nDisabled Veterans Winter Sports Clinic, the National Veterans \nWheelchair Games--the largest wheelchair athletic meet in the world--\nthe National Disabled Veterans Golden Age Games, and the National \nDisabled Veterans Creative Arts Festival. Corporate volunteers play a \nstrong role in these events and have become elemental to their success. \nGrowing participation from the corporate sector is setting the pace for \nthe future of VAVS, along with a strong and growing youth volunteer \nprogram that is introducing teenagers and college students to careers \nas well as to community service.\n  The focus remains as it was in those early post-World War II years, \nresponding to each community's desire to put its veterans first. That's \nwhy last year, volunteers contributed a total of 14,021,586 hours of \nservice through VAVS programs, 12,649,676 of which came from 93,821 \nregularly scheduled volunteers. Numbers do not tell the real story, \nhowever. There is no way to calculate a community's caring and sharing \nwith some of its most important citizens. For 50 years, VAVS has been \nthere to channel that caring in a productive, meaningful way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5613-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5613-S5614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DISTRICT COURT RULING SHOULD SPUR SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE TO REFORM \n                           CLASSIFIED PRICES\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on Monday, Minnesota District \nCourt Judge David Doty released a decision holding that class I prices \nused in the Federal milk marketing order system are arbitrary and \ncapricious. I rise today to applaud that ruling. It is the second such \nruling by the district court in 2 years. It is my hope that the \ncombination of this most recent ruling and Secretary of Agriculture Dan \nGlickman's commitment to restore equity in Federal orders will finally \nbe enough to change this discriminatory pricing system for good.\n  Mr. President, class I prices, prices that farmers receive for fluid \nmilk, increase at a rate of 21 cents for every 100 miles a farmer lives \nfrom Eau Claire, WI. This systematic discrimination against Wisconsin \ndairy farmers has never been adequately defended by the Department of \nAgriculture which has great administrative latitude to set these \nprices. Department officials have chosen to continue the discriminatory \npricing scheme when they had the authority to change it and the \nknowledge that it should be changed.\n\n[[Page S5614]]\n\n  Mr. President, this most recent ruling comes more than 5 years after \na group of Minnesota dairy farmers filed a class action lawsuit against \nthen-Secretary of Agriculture Clayton Yeutter charging that class I \nprices were unlawful under the basic authorities of the authorizing \nstatute. The plaintiffs also charged that the system had caused the \nloss of thousands of Upper Midwest dairy farms as the excessive prices \nprovided to other regions stimulated surplus production driving down \nprices to farmers in our region. Since this lawsuit was initiated, \nWisconsin has lost more than 6,000 family dairy farms who simply could \nnot compete with the mega-dairies in other regions who were enjoying \nthe artificially high fluid milk prices under the Federal order system. \nAs a Wisconsin State senator at that time, I was able to secure funding \nfor the State of Wisconsin to participate in the lawsuit as an amicus \ncuriae. Since that lawsuit was filed, and since I have been a Member of \nthe U.S. Senate, I and other members of the Upper Midwest congressional \ndelegation have taken all steps possible to push for reform of this \nsystem. Legislative reform of class I prices has proved nearly \nimpossible as Senators from regions benefiting from this system have \nrejected all suggestions for reform.\n  Two years ago, a different district court judge directed then-\nSecretary Espy to issue an amplified decision properly justifying a \n1993 final rule on Federal orders which failed to reform class I \nprices. One-hundred and twenty days later on August 12, 1994, an \namplified decision was issued by the Secretary. That decision, devoid \nof substance, was an insult to Wisconsin dairy farmers who have \nsuffered from the Department's approach to this issue.\n  Following the issuance of that amplified decision, the Minnesota Milk \nProducers Association filed another motion for summary judgment \ncharging that Secretary Espy's amplified decision was arbitrary and \ncapricious because it was unsupported by evidence and inconsistent with \nthe mandates of the authorizing statute.\n  On Monday, three Secretaries of Agriculture and four sessions of \nCongress after the initiation of this legal proceeding, the District \nCourt of Minnesota agreed with the plaintiffs. The court concluded that \n``the Secretary has wholly failed to provide an explanation of his \ndecision consistent with the requirements of the Agricultural Marketing \nAgreement Act.'' With respect to the use of Eau Claire, WI, as the \nreference point from which most fluid milk prices are determined, the \ncourt chided the Department for claiming it does not use Eau Claire as \na basing point, despite evidence to the contrary. Judge Doty stated, \n``The Secretary may not enforce what is clearly a single basing-point \nsystem without explaining how it reflects reasoned consideration of the \nstatutory factors. If Eau Claire is to be the basing point, then the \nSecretary must explain why, for each market to which a contemplated \norder relates, distance from Eau Claire is a relevant consideration.''\n  The court stopped short of finding class I prices illegal but found \nthat they have never been adequately justified by the Department of \nAgriculture and as such, the decision to maintain them was arbitrary \nand capricious. Judge Doty remanded the decision to Secretary Glickman \nfor 120 days after which the Secretary is to issue an amplified \ndecision on class I prices that reflects the factors mandated by the \nauthorizing statute.\n  It is my hope that in 120 days our current Secretary of Agriculture \nwill do the right thing and announce comprehensive changes to the \nclassified pricing system with class I prices based upon the economic \nfactors required by the statute--supply-and-demand factors, prices of \nfeeds, other inputs to production, and the public interest.\n  Interestingly, this time frame coincides with USDA's Federal order \nconsolidation process required in the 1996 farm bill. I have always \nsaid, Mr. President, that reform of these discriminatory class I prices \nand the elimination of Eau Claire, WI, as the single basing point for \nmilk prices could be accomplished through the legislative process, the \nadministrative process or the judicial process. The recently enacted \n1996 farm bill and Monday's district court ruling represent the \nconfluence of these three processes.\n  The Congress, through the 1996 farm bill, has directed the Secretary \nto consolidate the number of Federal orders from the current 33 to \nbetween 10 and 14. Implicit in that directive is administrative reform \nof the pricing structure for those new orders--an authority which the \nSecretary holds under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act. \nSecretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman has publicly admitted, both to \ndairy farmers and to Congress, that class I prices are unfair to the \nUpper Midwest and have produced ``regional inequities.'' He has \ncommitted to reduce class I differentials in the reform process. Now \nthe district court ruling has provided a clear ruling that the \nSecretary shall follow the economic criteria of the original \nauthorizing statute in setting those prices rather than bowing to \npolitical pressures from those regions that benefit from this \ndiscriminatory pricing system.\n  The Secretary has two choices.\n  He can comply with the court's order by reforming class I prices to \nbring them more in line with the economic realities in 1996. He can do \nthat both in issuing an amplified decision that complies with the \nstatute as required by the court as well as by implementing pricing \nreform as part of Federal milk marketing order reform required by 1996 \nfarm bill.\n  Or he can continue to fight the Upper Midwest in this lawsuit by \nseeking to delay the process further, rubber-stamping bad decisions by \nprevious Secretaries, causing the loss of even more dairy farms in the \nUpper Midwest and imposing huge costs on our rural communities that \ndepend on a thriving dairy industry.\n  I hope Dan Glickman chooses the first option.\n  This has been a long fight, Mr. President. It is time for it to end. \nIt is time for the Secretary and the administration to do the right \nthing. I will work with them to make that happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5613-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5614-S5615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CONGRESSIONAL, PRESIDENTIAL, AND JUDICIAL PENSION FORFEITURE ACT\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I join Senators Gregg and \nNickles in introducing long overdue legislation which creates tough new \nsanctions for public officials who engage in wrongdoing while they are \nin office. This legislation, the Congressional, Presidential, and \nJudicial Pension Forfeiture Act, prohibits the receipt of pension \nbenefits by Members of Congress, Presidents and members of the \njudiciary who engage in criminal conduct while in office. Those who \nengage in felonies that relate to abuse of office and undermine \nconfidence in public officials should not be entitled to receive \ngenerous pension benefits.\n  Recently, I have heard from many constituents about this issue. This \nis really something that reflects on the integrity of this institution. \nIt is an issue that affects any individual who aspires to public \nservice. Most I have heard from are upset with the ability of public \nservants to collect pension benefits after they have been convicted of \na felony while serving in a public office. Current law allows a former \nMember of Congress or a judge to collect their taxpayer financed \npensions even after they have been convicted of such offenses as \nperjury.\n  The bipartisan legislation we are introducing today would put an end \nto this practice. Taxpayer financed pensions are not an entitlement. If \npublic officials breach the public's trust they should forfeit their \nright to these pensions. They do not deserve these benefits if they \ncommit crimes while serving in office. Serving in public office is an \nhonor carrying tremendous responsibility. Whether you are the \nPresident, a Federal judge, or a Member of Congress you are always \naware of this responsibility. Few undertake this responsibility \nlightly.\n  Yet all of us are aware of recent cases involving egregious \nviolations of the public trust. Unfortunately, these individual cases, \nwhile isolated, tarnish the image of all public officeholders. They \nundermine public confidence in our democracy. They do so because the \npublic is led to believe that crime committed while serving in public \noffice pays. And to a certain extent, under the current law, it does. \nPublic officials can commit fraud or perjury\n\n[[Page S5615]]\n\nwhile in public office and are still able to collect generous pensions. \nThis is simply not right.\n  The bipartisan legislation we are introducing today will put an end \nto this. Judges, Members of Congress and the President will forfeit \ntheir pension benefits if they commit felonies while in public office. \nThe list of felonies which would result in a loss of pension are \ndirectly related to the performance of official duties. Among the \noffenses listed in the bill are bribery and illegal gratuities, \nimproper representation before the government, violation of \nantilobbying restrictions, false claims and fraud, abuse of the \nelectoral process, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and \nperjury.\n  Public service is both an honor and a privilege. It represents a \nsacred trust and thus we ought to have harsh penalties for those who \nbreach that trust. Those who violate this trust while serving in public \noffice should not be entitled to their pensions. The taxpayers have \nhelped finance these pensions. At a minimum, they are owed this kind of \naccountability.\n  Finally, I wish to thank Senators Gregg and Nickles for their \nleadership and support on this issue. Senators Gregg, Nickles and I had \nbeen working on a solution to this issue and I am confident that this \nlegislation is the appropriate response. I believe this is a problem in \nneed of bipartisan attention. Greater accountability will ultimately \nproduce public greater confidence in our three branches of \ngovernment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5614-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEMORIAL DAY 1996: SIMPLE TRUTHS\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to mention an \nupcoming, special American holiday, Memorial Day.\n  Last year, in honor of Father's Day, I read to you a letter from a \nfellow New Mexican, Chuck Everett. Mr. Everett originally wrote that \nletter while he was serving in Korea to his father who was back home in \nthe United States.\n  In that letter, a younger Chuck Everett talked about certain simple \ntruths--a son's longing to be with his dad on Father's Day; a soldier's \npatriotism; and hope for the future. The young soldier dedicated that \nparticular day to fathers, the support of free will, free speech, \nfreedom from fear, freedom of religion, and freedom of thought.\n  Today, in recognition of Memorial Day, I want to share with the \nSenate and the American people some more insightful thoughts by Mr. \nEverett. His poem, entitled ``Simple Truths,'' serves as a good \nreminder to those of us who serve in this esteemed Chamber, as well as \nto all Americans, that while our country derives much strength from its \ndiversity, we Americans also share basic ideals--ideals for which many \nmen and women have given their lives. As the country remembers those \nbrave Americans who fought for the United States, I submit that we are \na nation founded on ideas, notably the rights to life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness. These are simple truths to be cherished and \nprotected for future generations.\n  In memory of those who were killed or are still considered to be \nmissing in action, I respectfully ask that the text of Mr. Everett's \npoem be printed in the Record.\n  The poem follows:\n\n                             Simple Truths\n\n     Simple truths are emotions from the heart\n     To state those feelings we wish to share\n     With those with whom we do not stand apart\n     And sharing those ideals about which we care.\n\n     We ever strive to serve our God and country,\n     A nation born to hear the bells of freedom ring.\n     Bound not by the shackles of fear and affrontry.\n     But living free of oppression by dictator or king.\n\n     We dedicate our lives to the support of democracy,\n     Building a nation with simple truths in mind,\n     Glorified in living free from any aristocracy,\n     Striving for liberty and justice for all mankind.\n\n     Let our mission be to keep this country free, To stand tall \n           for what we feel is right or wrong,\n     Embracing ourselves in the principles of liberty\n     And always being on the alert and ever so strong.--C. \n           Everett.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5615-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WAYLAND V.F.W. POST 7581\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this weekend America honors its \nveterans through Memorial Day activities across the country. It is a \ntime when we thank our veterans for their service and remember those we \nhave lost. Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 7581 in Wayland, MI, will be \ncelebrating Memorial Day this year as it does each year. However, this \nyear will be especially significant because it marks the 50th \nanniversary of the post.\n  Wayland VFW Post 7581 was chartered at a ceremony in the Wayland High \nSchool gym on June 10, 1946, with 43 members. In 1949, a Ladies \nAuxiliary to the post was instituted. VFW Post 7581 dedicated its \nheadquarters on June 10, 1956. Most of the work on the building was \ndone by the members of the Post. Over the years, post membership has \ngrown dramatically. The post now maintains 289 members, including 74 \nlife members.\n  During its 50 years, the post has dedicated its efforts to providing \nservices for the Wayland community, including: Lite-a-Hike campaigns, \nblood banks, little league baseball, polio dances and the donation of \nflags to local schools. Last winter, the post made national news for \nhelping stranded motorists during the blizzard. The post also conducts \nmilitary funerals, participates in Memorial Day activities and assists \nveterans submitting claims to the Veterans' Administration.\n  Mr. President, the members of Wayland VFW Post 7581 have not only \nproudly served our country in military service, but they continue to \nserve through their commitment to community. I know my Senate \ncolleagues will join me in honoring the veterans of VFW. Post 7581 and \ncongratulating them on their 50 years of service to the community of \nWayland, MI.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5615-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5615-S5617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JANET RENO'S WORDS OF WISDOM\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we have a lot to be proud of in \nour country and we have many great role models. One role model, who \nrecently visited my home state and spoke to the graduates of the \nUniversity of South Carolina, is Janet Reno.\n  Janet Reno is our country's first female Attorney General and has \nexcelled in the role. She is a dedicated, top-flight public servant. \nAnd indeed, that was also her reputation in Florida, where President \nClinton plucked her in 1993 from her role as the State's attorney for \nDade County. Janet Reno was known in Dade County as a tough, front-line \ncrime fighter and she devoted herself to making communities safer, \nkeeping children out of trouble, reducing domestic violence and helping \nfamilies. She also targeted career criminals, dangerous offenders and \ndrug traffickers, promising strict and certain sentences that put them \naway and kept them away.\n  Janet Reno grew up in Florida and worked her way through Cornell \nUniversity. She wanted to pursue a law degree but was told that ``woman \ndidn't become lawyers.'' She ignored the advice and became one of only \n16 women in a class of 565 students to enroll in Harvard Law School in \n1960. When she graduated, people said, ``No one will hire a woman \nlawyer.'' She proved them wrong, of course. Janet Reno was and is a \ntrail-blazer.\n  In her speech to the USC graduates, Janet Reno talked about the \nfrustrations that faced her and her predecessors as Attorney General. \nShe said:\n\n       There is no vaccination for crime, as there is for polio. \n     The only thing we have is hard work, seven days a week, \n     parents raising children right, police walking the beat every \n     single night, and prosecutors putting criminals behind bars, \n     one by one. Our problems are complex and the answers rarely \n     simple.\n\n  Janet Reno encouraged the graduates avoid the deadly sins of our \npublic life: extremism, cynicism and defeatism. Her advice is sound and \nI think we could all benefit from it. I ask that her address be printed \nin the Record.\n  The address follows:\n\n    Spring Commencement Address by U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno\n\n       I am honored to share this day with you. It is so wonderful \n     to look out to see so many who have worked so hard to obtain \n     their diploma today. I especially want to say hello to my \n     fellow chemistry majors. In 1960, I earned my chemistry \n     degree from Cornell University. So, to you parents who worry \n     that your graduating sons and daughters still lack a clear \n     career goal, I suggest, give them a little more time; you \n     never know what might happen.\n\n[[Page S5616]]\n\n       Since my graduation in 1960, so many things in America have \n     changed for the better. In 1960, the Iron Curtain divided the \n     world between freedom and dictatorship. Just two weeks ago I \n     walked the streets of Budapest along side the free people of \n     Hungary, and I talked with Western Europeans and Eastern \n     Europeans alike about our common fight against crime. In \n     1960, even after the Supreme Court outlawed racial \n     segregation, much of America was still divided into two \n     nations, black and white. But in the civil rights efforts \n     that soon followed, our nation kept the promises the founding \n     fathers made and finally made equality the law of the land.\n       In 1960 when I graduated from college, people told me a \n     woman couldn't go to law school, and when I graduated from \n     law school, people told me law firms won't hire you. Thirty \n     years later, no one ever told me I couldn't be Attorney \n     General. You are graduating into an amazing era. In 1960, \n     nobody had ever heard of the Internet, no one had been to the \n     moon. The CAT scan was not invented until 1973. But even \n     though our world is more safe and our country is more just \n     and new technologies are changing our lives, nobody would say \n     that we are a nation without serious, serious challenges. \n     Many of these challenges seem so stubborn and unyielding, \n     such as violent crime, homelessness, and poverty. Others seem \n     complex and inscrutable, like the international economy and \n     the spread of AIDS. And others just seem overwhelming, like \n     the fear of terrorism or environmental catastrophe. But \n     America is a nation of optimists and problem solvers. Each \n     generation looks to its children to keep our society moving \n     and to make life better. After the parties and the vacations \n     and the graduate degrees yet to come, America will look to \n     you for help. For no matter where you go and what you do, you \n     can make a difference.\n       That's what I would like to talk about today. For in these \n     last 30 years, too many people of goodwill have looked at \n     these very hard problems and started throwing up their hands \n     and turning away. They are getting caught up in the three \n     deadly sins of our public life: extremism, cynicism, and \n     defeatism.\n       The first great threat to our optimistic spirit is \n     extremism, for it blinds us to the tough, tough choices we \n     all confront when we wrestle with the difficult problems of \n     today. The historian Arthur Schlesinger once observed that \n     America's progress and freedom were fueled by what he called \n     ``the vital center in American politics.'' He meant a place \n     where men and women of reason and goodwill could meet \n     regardless of their political party affiliation, a place to \n     hash out their differences and debate the problems of the \n     day. A lively debate to be sure, sometimes even unruly, but \n     one carried out on common terms with respect for the other \n     person. The vital center has always been a place where \n     people might be divided in their approach to solving a \n     problem, but where they were united, as Americans, in \n     their determination to act reasonably and to see the \n     virtue in other points of view. In short, the politics of \n     the vital center means using democracy as a process of \n     working together to find solutions that attack problems \n     with progress. Slow sometimes, terribly slow and \n     exhausting to be sure, but always in the American \n     tradition of reforms that are not perfect, but take us one \n     step forward, one important step forward.\n       Today I fear many Americans are forgetting about the vital \n     center. Too often in today's politics, on all sides, people \n     are confronting tough problems and retreating to extremes and \n     to simple solutions instead of embracing the complexity that \n     problem solving always demands and that democracy requires. \n     You may not like everything government does, I know I don't, \n     but the alternative is not to throw up your hands or turn to \n     violence. What we must do is to sit down together as \n     reasonable people and make our government do what is right \n     and stop doing what may be wrong-headed or wasteful. \n     Extremism wants to sprint when the race is really a marathon. \n     Extremism wants to escape the complexity of democracy and the \n     staggering diversity of human nature, but it never can. \n     Extremism argues that problems are easy to solve but if they \n     were, we would have licked them a long, long time ago.\n       As Attorney General, I deal with problems that frustrated \n     previous Attorney Generals for years, such as crime, \n     terrorism and domestic violence. There is no vaccination for \n     crime, as there is for polio. The only thing we have is hard \n     work seven days a week, parents raising children right, \n     police walking the beat every single night, and prosecutors \n     putting criminals behind bars, one by one. We're not a bumper \n     sticker away from solving terrorism. We have to be eternally \n     vigilant, close our borders to those who threaten us and work \n     slowly and patiently for peace in the lands where foreign \n     terrorists come from, just as we must fight the hatred and \n     the paranoia that fuels domestic terrorism. There is no sound \n     byte that can make domestic violence go away. We have to stop \n     abusers one by one and let them know that there is never an \n     excuse for hitting someone you love. We have to build \n     shelters one at a time to give victims a safe place away from \n     the abuse, and we have to help victims rebuild their lives \n     slowly and steadily.\n       The vital center knows that problems are complicated and \n     that answers are rarely simple. I hope that in your lives you \n     will choose the course of leadership, not partisanship. Think \n     twice when someone has a simple answer. Remember that so many \n     of our problems took decades to get where they are and that \n     no amount of sloganeering can fix them overnight. And don't \n     ever forget to listen. For I have learned so much when I have \n     listened to the people with whom I have disagreed. Sometimes \n     I have changed my mind. Sometimes I have changed theirs.\n       The second great threat to our nation's optimistic spirit \n     is cynicism. Maybe you have faced it already. The cynic knows \n     so much about what is wrong and why it can't be fixed. He can \n     tell you which baseball players strike out the most and why \n     planes and stock markets crash. She can tell you which public \n     figures were caught doing something wrong, why the current \n     peace negotiations are doomed, and why so many marriages end \n     in divorce. It may be a beautiful South Carolina day, but the \n     cynic knows it is going to rain someday. Of course, \n     cynicism never happens by itself, it always builds on \n     genuine problems and disasters. Watergate and other \n     scandals convinced millions of Americans that government \n     was permanently broken and that everyone in public life \n     was some sort of alien from ordinary American life, that \n     they might as well have landed in a spaceship. In fact, \n     you can look at any of our institutions and you can find a \n     scandal, and cynics told you so. Sports heroes, police \n     officers, business leaders, doctors, ministers, teachers \n     and politicians--everyone can point to people in all walks \n     of life who have fallen below society's standards. We can \n     use a funny line to dismiss politicians or teachers or \n     Wall Street bankers, but that's the easy way out and after \n     we do, what's different? Nothing, except that fewer good \n     people are willing to work to make our government better, \n     care for the helpless amongst us, or build a business that \n     puts its customers needs first.\n       At the very least, if you're finding yourself falling prey \n     to cynicism, consider its cousin, skepticism. At least the \n     skeptic has an open mind. The skeptic sees all the same \n     problems and asks all the same questions, but is willing to \n     let the answer be good or bad. And if you are a recovering \n     cynic, and you have made it back to skepticism, why not just \n     take the final step and become an idealist in the best \n     American tradition? And I don't mean for a minute that you \n     should be naive. The Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. talked \n     about the need for all of us to have a tough mind and a \n     tender heart. I can tell you that no one can come to \n     Washington and ever hope to do well if she does not start the \n     morning by asking tough questions and end the day getting \n     real answers. This nation was founded by idealists with tough \n     minds and with tender hearts, and they formed a government \n     designed to check the worst in human nature just as they \n     risked their lives to found a country that cherished freedom \n     and liberty over oppression. They took the hard way, and they \n     made a difference.\n       A month ago, as the sun was setting before it rose again on \n     Eastern morning, I was in Dover Delaware listening to \n     President Clinton honor Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and 32 \n     other Americans who died in the plane crash in Bosnia. They \n     were young and old, men and women, government workers and \n     business leaders, but they were all there because they \n     believed they could help a ravaged country heal from civil \n     war. These 33 lives, said the President, show us the best of \n     America. They are a stern rebuke to the cynicism that is all \n     too familiar these days. He talked about how family after \n     family told him how their loved ones were proud of their work \n     and believed in what they were doing and believed they could \n     make a difference.\n       Finally, I want to talk to you about the brother of \n     extremism and cynicism, defeatism. Not everyone faces \n     hopelessness, but no one is far away from someone who does. \n     It may be across town where a family can't afford to pay the \n     rent, or take the child to the doctor because they don't have \n     a job. It may be in the next classroom where a student is \n     convinced that he will never succeed, that no one cares, and \n     that street crime will be the only way out of a hard life. It \n     might be next door where a wife or child faces terror every \n     night at the hands of an abusive spouse or parent. You may \n     never find yourself at the bottom of life's pit, and, if you \n     do, I prey that you have the energy and courage to get up and \n     out. But you may know someone who has fallen, someone who \n     doesn't even want to try because he is sure it won't make a \n     difference.\n       I have been Attorney General now for three years, and my \n     faith in the American people and their ability to deal with \n     adversity has never been so strong. I have never been so sure \n     that we can prevail against the causes of wrong in this \n     world. I know we can defeat extremism and reclaim the vital \n     center. I know we can defeat cynicism and seek what is good \n     amidst all that is bad. I know we can defeat defeatism and \n     teach those who have fallen to get up and to hope again. It \n     won't be easy, and it will take a lot more than any speech \n     could ever do, but I come here today because you are the \n     future of this country.\n       I know you have the energy. I know you have the commitment. \n     I know you can make the choice to stand for what is right and \n     good in this world. If you choose public service you will be \n     choosing one of the most rewarding and fulfilling careers our \n     society can offer. But whether you are running a business, or \n     teaching a class, prosecuting criminals, or raising a family, \n     you can make a difference. In another spring time, 33 years \n     ago, the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n[[Page S5617]]\n\n     sat in a Birmingham jail, exhausted from years of seeking \n     justice for all. He was dispirited, and even some of his \n     fellow ministers were saying he should back off and wait for \n     progress to happen on its own. He must struggle to keep \n     cynicism out of his every thought, and sitting in that jail \n     cell day after day, with progress coming slowly or not at \n     all, he had to wonder why any man had a right to hope. But \n     Reverend King made his choice, he began writing until his \n     words filled the margins of a secondhand newspaper. The power \n     of his choice flowed out of a pen and into the conscious of \n     America. Today as you prepare to make your choices in life, I \n     would like to close with a few of those words from Dr. King's \n     letter from that Birmingham jail:\n       ``We must come to see that human progress never tolls in on \n     wheels of inevitability. It comes through the tireless \n     efforts and the persistent work of men willing to be co-\n     workers with God, and without this hard work time itself \n     becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. We must \n     use time creatively, and forever realize that the time is \n     always ripe to do right.''\n       I hope and pray that you will make your choice the choice \n     of standing for what is right and good in this world. Thank \n     you, congratulations, good luck, and God bless you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5615-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5617-S5619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO PRESIDENT LEE TENG-HUI, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nfirst popularly elected President of the Republic of China, Lee Teng-\nhui. All Americans congratulate the people of Taiwan for voting to \ncomplete their transition to democracy.\n  The election of President Lee on March 23, 1996, was the result of a \n10-year transition which some have called a political miracle in \ntwentieth-century Chinese politics, making Taiwan the first Chinese \ndemocracy.\n  President Lee and the people of Taiwan not only deserve \ncongratulations for their transition to democracy, they also deserve \nour continued support. As President Lee and the Taiwanese emerge as a \nforce for democracy, freedom and stabilization in East Asia, the United \nStates should encourage their efforts to be represented and respected \nin international organizations and negotiations as well. The United \nStates should also support and encourage constructive dialog and \nrelations between Taiwan and Beijing.\n  This transition to democracy is especially significant because it \ntook place against a background of mounting military intimidation, \npolitical threats, and diplomatic isolation from mainland China. \nDespite these intimidating threats, the people of Taiwan were not \ndeterred from casting their ballots for freedom and liberty.\n  On May 20 in Taipei, President Lee delivered his inaugural address to \nthe world as well as to the people of the Republic of China. He said:\n\n       My fellow countrymen: The doors have opened to full \n     democracy, with all its vigor in full swing. Today, most \n     deserving of a salute are the people of the Republic of \n     China: A salute to them for being so resolute and decisive \n     when it comes to the future of the country. A salute to them \n     for being so firm and determined when it comes to the defense \n     of the democracy. A salute to them for being so calm and \n     invincible when it comes to facing up to threats.\n\n  I join many in celebrating President Lee's triumph and the will of \nthe people of the Republic of China to march boldly down the road of \ndemocracy for the first time in the history of the Chinese people.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the complete text of President Lee's \ninaugural address be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  The text follows:\n\n         Full Text of President Lee Teng-Hui's Inaugural Speech\n\n       Your Majesty, Your Excellencies, Distinguished Guests, My \n     Fellow Countrymen, Ladies and Gentlemen:\n       Today we are assembled here to jubilantly and solemnly \n     celebrate the inauguration of the President and Vice \n     President before all our compatriots. This gather marks not \n     only the commencement of the ninth-term Presidency and Vice \n     Presidency, but also a fresh beginning for the future of the \n     country and the people.\n       Today, the 21.3 million people in this country formally \n     march in the new era of ``popular sovereignty.''\n       Today, the Chinese people enter a new frontier full of \n     hope.\n       Today, we in Taiwan firmly tell the world, with great pride \n     and self-confidence:\n       We now stand on the apex of democratic reform and will \n     remain there resolutely.\n       We have proved eloquently that the Chinese are capable of \n     practicing democracy.\n       We have effectively expanded the influence of the \n     international democratic camp and made significant \n     contributions to the cause of freedom and democracy.\n       Therefore, this gathering of today does not celebrate the \n     victory of any candidate, or any political party for that \n     matter. It honors a triumph of democracy for the 21.3 million \n     people. It salutes the confirmation of freedom and dignity--\n     the most fundamental human values--in the Taiwan, Penghu, \n     Kinmen and Matsu area.\n       My fellow countrymen: The doors have opened to full \n     democracy, with all its vigor in full swing. Today, most \n     deserving of a salute are the people of the Republic of \n     China:\n       A salute to them for being so resolute and decisive when it \n     comes to the future of the country.\n       A salute to them for being so firm and determined when it \n     comes to the defense of democracy.\n       A salute to them for being so calm and invincible when it \n     comes to facing up to threats.\n       From now on, the people as a whole, rather than any \n     individual or any political party, will be invested with the \n     ruling power of the nation. This is free will in full play, \n     the fullest realization of ``popular sovereignty,'' the real \n     compliance with the will of Heaven and response to human \n     wishes.'' the getting rid of the old and ringing in the new. \n     All the glory belongs to the people.\n       My fellow countrymen: At this very fresh start of history, \n     we pledge ourselves to launch the new era with a new \n     determination and new deeds. This is our common homeland, and \n     this is the fundamental support we draw upon in our struggle \n     for survival. Fifty years of a common destiny forged in \n     fortune and misfortune have united us all into a closely \n     bound and interdependent community. The first-ever popular \n     presidential election has reconfirmed our collective \n     consciousness that we in Taiwan have to work together as one \n     man.\n       How to make this land of ours more beautiful and how to \n     make its inhabitants feel safer and live a happier and more \n     harmonious life is the common responsibility of the 21.3 \n     million people!\n       ``Whatever the people desire is always in my heart.'' I am \n     fully aware of the needs of the people and I pledge myself to \n     do my best to deserve their trust. But no individual or \n     political party can single-handedly decide a policy of far-\n     reaching importance to the country. The government will soon \n     invite opinion leaders and other representatives from various \n     quarters to exchange views on major topics of future national \n     development. The consensus that emerges from such meetings \n     will launch the country into a new era.\n       The election is over, but the promises made during the \n     campaign will be kept and fulfilled as soon as possible. \n     Building a modern country entails the services of all \n     available talents. I am convinced that only when upright, \n     insightful, capable and experienced people, regardless of \n     their political affiliation or social group, participate in \n     the leadership of the government will political stability and \n     national growth be ensured.\n       The times are changing, so is the social climate. Keeping \n     in the old grooves while refraining from any innovation is \n     doomed to failure. Political maneuvering has no place in \n     political interaction, nor can self-interest have any role in \n     deciding upon a political position. No quarrels can be \n     started under the pretense of representing the will of the \n     voters. A boycott certainly is not the equivalent of checks \n     and balances. The ideal of democracy we are pursuing means \n     not just effective checks and balances; it demands hand-in-\n     hand cooperation for the welfare of the people among the \n     political parties.\n       Four years will soon pass. We have no time for wavering or \n     waiting. For the purpose of laying a solid and secure \n     foundation for the country and bequeathing a happy and \n     comfortable life to the future generations, let us get off to \n     a very good start today--May 20, 1996.\n       First, we have to broaden and deepen the democratic \n     exercise. Horizontally, we will share our democratic \n     experience with all Chinese and international friends. \n     Vertically, we will proceed to phase 2 constitutional reform, \n     promote clean elections, ensure clean and efficient \n     government, enhance law and order, restructure the political \n     landscape, and strengthen the multiparty political system, so \n     as to guarantee stability and development for democracy.\n       Economic growth and political democracy are equally \n     important. Without continued success in economic development, \n     we risk losing everything. We have to make sure that the plan \n     for turning Taiwan into a hub for business operations in the \n     Asia-Pacific region will proceed on schedule so that this \n     country may from a position of strength play a role to be \n     reckoned with in the international community and in the \n     process of national unification. In the meanwhile we have to \n     plan ahead for national development well into the next \n     century, nurture a liberalized and internationalized economic \n     regime in as short as possible a period of time, foster a \n     low-tax, obstacle-free business climate, renovate the land \n     system, improve the small and medium business, and greatly \n     enhance national competitiveness. Only when thus prepared \n     will we be able to compete in a new Asia-pacific age of \n     mutual benefit and co-prosperity, thus becoming an \n     indispensable partner for prosperity and development \n     internationally.\n       At the same time we do not intend to neglect development in \n     non-economic sectors. Our top priorities will be the judicial \n     system,\n\n[[Page S5618]]\n\n     education, culture, and social restructuring, which will have \n     to move ahead in tandem.\n       Judicial reform should be based above all on the rule of \n     law. All judicial judgments have to be fair and make sure \n     that all are equal before the law. The rule of law being the \n     foundation of democracy, the cause of democracy will be \n     compromised to a serious extent if court rulings are not \n     trusted by the people. The reform will also guarantee full \n     respect for any fundamental human rights including those of \n     prisoners and parties to a law suit. Rectitude and efficiency \n     in the court and prosecutorial system will have to be \n     drastically improved.\n       Reform in education aims to put into practice a concept of \n     education that imparts happiness, contentment, pluralism and \n     mutual respect. Such education is designed to develop \n     potentialities, respect individualism, promote humanism, and \n     encourage creativeness. All unreasonable restrictions will be \n     removed to allow the emergence of the life education system. \n     Ample room will be reserved for individual originality and \n     personal traits to ensure the continued pursuit of self-\n     growth and self-realization. The new generation will be \n     assisted to know their homeland, love their country and \n     foster a broad international view. Fortified in this manner \n     they can better meet international challenges and map out a \n     bright future for their country in an increasingly \n     competitive global village.\n       My fellow countrymen: After 5,000 years the Chinese are \n     still going strong solely because the derive sustenance from \n     an excellent culture. Under the strong impact of Western \n     civilization since the mid-19th century, Chinese culture has \n     gone through tribulations and shocks giving rise to a sharp \n     decline in national confidence. Bearing this in mind. I have \n     never stopped thinking about cultural regeneration. I am \n     hoping that the people of Taiwan will nurture a new life \n     culture as well as a broad and long-sighted view of life. The \n     new Chinese culture, with moorings in the immense Chinese \n     heritage, will draw upon Western cultural essence to \n     facilitate adapting to the new climate of the next century.\n       This is the essence of the concept of ``manage the great \n     Taiwan, nurture a new Chinese culture.'' All the major \n     cultures originated in a very restricted area. The 5,000-year \n     Chinese culture also rose from a small region called Chung \n     Yuan. Uniquely situated at the confluence of mainland and \n     maritime cultures, Taiwan has been able in recent decades to \n     preserve traditional culture on the one hand and to come into \n     wide contact with Western democracy and science and modern \n     business culture on the other. Equipped with a much higher \n     level of education and development than in other parts of \n     China, Taiwan is set to gradually exercise its leadership \n     role in cultural development and take upon itself the \n     responsibility for nurturing a new Chinese culture.\n       Managing the great Taiwan can nurture not just a new \n     culture, but also a new society. With political democracy, \n     Taiwan's society has become robustly pluralistic. The vigor \n     thus released will provide nourishment for new social life \n     and bring about further progress.\n       We will regenerate family ethics and build up a strong \n     sense of community beginning at the grass roots. This will \n     enable us to have a harmonious and communicative society \n     where all members can have the joy of family life. People \n     will also be encouraged to live a simple life and treasure \n     all available resources. The land should be used based upon \n     optimum planning, and nature conservation should be promoted \n     to make it possible for future generations to savor the \n     beauty of the landscape. In the same spirit, we will take \n     better care of the disadvantaged groups in the interests of \n     social harmony and human dignity. We also want to have in \n     place a social security system, fair to all and sure to \n     endure, that provides for freedom from want. But this system \n     can only be installed gradually, depending upon the \n     availability of funding support.\n       At the very time when we are engaged in the task of \n     developing the Republic of China on Taiwan, the overseas \n     Chinese are never out of mind. We do our very best continuing \n     to assist them in developing their careers. The welfare of \n     the Chinese in Hong Kong and Macao has always been of great \n     concern to us. We are ready to land them a helping hand to \n     help maintain democracy, freedom and prosperity in this area.\n       Today the existence and development of the Republic of \n     China on Taiwan has won international recognition and \n     respect. In the new international order of today, such basic \n     tenets as democracy, human rights, peace and renunciation of \n     force are universally adhered to; they are in full accord \n     with the ideals upon which our country was founded. We will \n     continue to promote pragmatic diplomacy in compliance with \n     the principles of goodwill and reciprocity. By so doing we \n     will secure for our 21.3 million people enough room for \n     existence and development as well as the respect and \n     treatment they deserve in the international arena.\n       My fellow countrymen: China has suffered a lot in the 20th \n     century. In the initial stages, it was buffeted with a series \n     of invasions, and over the last 50 years an ideological gap \n     has been responsible for the Chinese-fighting-Chinese \n     tragedy, resulting in confrontation and enmity among the \n     Chinese. I have been of the view that on the threshold of the \n     21st century the two sides of the Taiwan Straits should work \n     for ending this historical tragedy and ushering in a new \n     epoch when Chinese should help each other.\n       It is this consideration that over the past years has been \n     guiding our initiative in promoting a win-win strategy for \n     expanding cross-straits relations leading to eventual \n     national unification, but we are doing this on the premise \n     that the Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu area is well \n     protected and the welfare of its people safeguarded. \n     Unfortunately, the cross-straits relationship has experienced \n     bumps from time to time because the Chinese Communists have \n     refused to admit the very fact that the Republic of China \n     does exist in the area. Beginning last year, the Chinese \n     Communists, because of their opposition to democracy, \n     launched against myself a smear campaign using false charges \n     to damage my credibility, but I simply ignore their \n     irrational behavior and remain patient. An eye for an eye is \n     no solution to an historical question of 50 years.\n       In an attempt to influence the outcome of the first popular \n     presidential election in March, the Chinese Communist \n     conducted a series of military exercises against Taiwan, but \n     unrivaled restraint prevailed in this country. We know that \n     it is imperative that peace and stability be maintained in \n     the Asia-Pacific region. More important, we would not like to \n     see the sudden disappearance of the economic growth in \n     mainland China that has been made possible with great \n     difficulty by its openness policy over the years. Patience on \n     the part of the 21.3 million people is not tantamount to \n     cowardice. Because we believe quiet tolerance is the only way \n     to dispel enmity bred by confrontation. We will never \n     negotiate under threat of attack, but we do not fear to \n     negotiate. Our position is that dialogue will lead to the \n     resolution of any issues between the two sides of the Taiwan \n     Straits.\n       The Republic of China has always been a sovereign state. \n     Disputes across the Straits center around system and \n     lifestyle; they have nothing to do with ethnic or cultural \n     identity. Here in this country it is totally necessary or \n     impossible to adopt the so-called course of ``Taiwan \n     independence.'' For over 40 years, the two sides of the \n     Straits have been two separate jurisdictions due to various \n     historical factors, but it is also true that both sides \n     pursue eventual national unification. Only when both sides \n     face up to the facts and engage in dialogue with profound \n     sincerity and patience will they be able to find the solution \n     to the unification question and work for the common welfare \n     of the Chinese people.\n       Today, I will seriously call upon the two sides of the \n     Straits to deal straightforwardly with the momentous question \n     of how to terminate the state of hostility between them, \n     which will then make a crucial contribution to the historic \n     task of unification. In the future, at the call of my country \n     and with the support of its people, I would like to embark \n     upon a journey of peace to mainland China taking with me the \n     consensus and will of the 21.3 million people. I am also \n     ready to meet with the top leadership of the Chinese \n     Communists for a direct exchange of views in order to open up \n     a new era of communication and cooperation between the two \n     sides and ensure peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-\n     Pacific region.\n       My fellow countrymen: We in Taiwan have realized the \n     Chinese dream. The Chinese of the 20th century have been \n     striving for the realization of a happy, wealthy China and of \n     Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ``popular sovereignty'' ideal. For 50 \n     years, we have created in the Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and \n     Matsu area an eye-catching ``economic miracle'' and achieved \n     a world-acclaimed democratic reform. The Chinese who were \n     regarded as dictatorial, feudalistic, penurious, and backward \n     by Western countries one century ago have by now created in \n     the Taiwan area a new land of democracy, wealth and progress, \n     proudly enjoying enthusiastic recognition from the world. \n     This stand for not just a proud achievement of our 21.3 \n     million people; it marks a crucial departure for the Chinese \n     people to rise again to a new height of glory. We believe \n     that whatever is achieved by the Chinese in Taiwan can also \n     be achieved by the Chinese in mainland China. We are willing \n     to provide our developmental experience as an aid in mapping \n     out the direction of development in mainland China. The \n     fruits of our hard work can be used to assist in enhancing \n     the welfare of million of our compatriots on the mainland. \n     The Chinese on the two sides can thus join forces for the \n     benefit of the prosperity and development of the Chinese \n     nation as a whole.\n       My fellow countrymen: I wish to take this opportunity to \n     express my heartfelt gratitude for the trust you have reposed \n     in me. Today, I have accepted with humility and solemnity the \n     office of the ninth-term President of the Republic of China \n     at the swearing-in ceremony this morning. I fully understand \n     the meaning of this office as well as the duties of this \n     office. I pledge myself to the complete performance of my \n     duties to the best of my power. I would never fail you. \n     Meanwhile, I sincerely call upon all my fellow citizens to \n     give me wholehearted, unselfish and patient support so that \n     we may stride forward hand in hand into the 21st century. I \n     am convinced that during the next century the Chinese people \n     will be able to achieve the historic enterprise of peaceful \n     unification and do their very part for the peace and \n     development of the world.\n       May I wish the Republic of China continued prosperity and \n     all the distinguished guests health and happiness. Thank \n     you.\n\n[[Page S5619]]\n\n\n\n      THE CLOSURE OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE: A MATTER OF COMMON SENSE\n\n Mr. Pryor. Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk \nrecently, both in Congress and in the media, about reopening the area \nof Pennsylvania Avenue directly in front of the White House that was \nclosed due to security concerns. Reopening the street to commuter \ntraffic sound good to drivers who are inconvenienced. But before we \ntear down security structures at any Federal facility we should step \nback and review recent events in Oklahoma City and New York. The \nsecurity of Federal buildings has become a serious issue indeed, and \nwhen the lives of Americans are threatened we cannot afford to act \npolitically.\n  About 1 year ago, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, whose department \nis charged with protecting the President, ordered the Secret Service to \nclose Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic in front of the White \nHouse. His decision was not made precipitously but only after it was \ncalled for by the most comprehensive study of White House security in \nour Nation's history. That study, which was conducted by a body called \nthe White House Security Review, determined that the threat of violent \nacts against the White House, and other Federal buildings, had grown \nmuch more serious over the last decade.\n  It does not take a big study to tell us that times have changed and \nthat there is a greater threat to Federal buildings such as the White \nHouse. The World Trade Center bombing, the Oklahoma City bombing, not \nto mention the murder near CIA headquarters 10 miles from here, are \nample evidence of the threat that domestic terrorism now poses in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, all of us agree that the White House is the property \nof the public, that it should be as accessible as reasonable possible. \nBut the White House Security Review clearly found that the threat to \npublic safety from an open Pennsylvania Avenue far outweighed the \ninconvenience to commuters and sightseers in cars. After much \nconsideration the Review concluded that it was, not able to identify \nany alternative to prohibiting vehicular traffic on Pennsylvania Avenue \nthat would ensure the protection of the President and others in the \nWhite House complex from explosive devices carried in vehicles near the \nperimeter. These findings were endorsed by its independent bipartisan \nAdvisory Committee, which included former Secretary of Transportation \nWilliam Coleman and the former Director of the FBI and CIA, Judge \nWilliam Webster.\n  According to every authorative study of the situation, restricting \ncar traffic around the White House is more than reasonable. It is \nessential.\n  Many argue that Secretary Rubin's actions have had a negative effect \non America's enjoyment of the White House. However, tours have \ncontinued as scheduled, and visitors can now enjoy walking and biking \ndown Pennsylvania Avenue without danger of vehicular traffic. The White \nHouse is still the people's house and many would say that enjoyment has \nbeen increased by the evolving pedestrian mall.\n  Perhaps the strongest argument against closure of Pennsylvania Avenue \nin front of the White House is that it causes traffic problems for city \nmotorists. While it is true that closure of this area has increased an \nalready bad traffic problem, the Department of Transportation's Federal \nHighway Administration and the District of Columbia's Department of \nPublic Works are examining short-term and long-term measures to reduce \ntraffic problems in the city.\n  Again, inconvenience of drivers around the White House cannot take \nprecedent over the safety of the public who visit the White House, the \npublic servants who work in the White House and, of course, the \nPresident and his family. Our Government and society places a high \nvalue on human life and I think even the most anxious D.C. driver would \nnot want their zeal to get around town to result in harm to another \nAmerican.\n  It is also valuable to note that the creation of a pedestrian mall is \nconsistent with President Washington's vision for the White House, and \nit is similar to a proposal that President and Mrs. Kennedy endorsed a \ngeneration ago.\n  Mr. President, Americans have long been known for their freedom, but \nI like to think Americans are also known for their common sense. While \nI realize that restricting access to any public building is not \nconsistent with America's sense of freedom, I would argue that \nreopening Pennsylvania Avenue is contrary to our good common sense.\n  Mr. President, Secretary Rubin made a wise decision a year ago. He \nused his common sense and decided that closing Pennsylvania Avenue was \nthe right thing to do. Let's not overrule his good judgment or \njeopardize the people's house by reopening Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5617-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNITION OF CHISHOLM TRAIL ROUNDUP, FORT WORTH, TX\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, more than a hundred years ago, \ncattle drives made their way across the Texas plains toward the \nrailhead of Abilene, KS, along what came to be known as the Chisholm \nTrail. Within a span of only two decades, the Chisholm Trail not only \ntransformed settlements and towns, like Ft. Worth, into major centers \nof commerce, it also produced one of our Nation's most enduring folk \nheroes--the cowboy.\n  Since 1976, the Chisholm Trail Roundup has been held in the historic \nStockyards District of Fort Worth, TX. The Roundup celebrates the \nWestern spirit of adventure and perseverance and honors the cultures of \ntribe and Nation that forged a new way of life on the American \nfrontier. From native American dances to cowboy gunfights, the roundup \ndisplays all aspects of frontier life and creates an atmosphere in \nwhich learning about our history and enjoying the festival come \ntogether.\n  As one of the country's largest annual festivals, the Chisholm Trail \nRoundup is nonprofit and benefits Western heritage organizations. For 3 \ndays in June, Fort Worthians will gather once again to celebrate the \ncity's rich heritage and to relive one of the most memorable times in \nAmerican history.\n  As a Senator from the State of Texas, I would like to recognize the \nChisholm Trail Roundup and its efforts to remind us of our pioneering \nheritage. I appreciate the thousands of hours of work that have gone \ninto planning this year's event, and I am looking forward to many more \nroundups in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5619-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5619-S5620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           LARGE BINOCULAR TELESCOPE ON MT. GRAHAM IN ARIZONA\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to express my serious \nconcern with language contained in the final fiscal year 1996 \nappropriations measure which addressed the construction of the Large \nBinocular Telescope on Mr. Graham in Arizona, which is a sacred place \nto the Apache Nation and home to the endangered Mt. Graham red \nsquirrel. The Apache tribal and religious leaders have urged the \nCongress and the administration to protect their historic holy land. \nThey are joined by national Native organizations and by a broad cross-\nsection of the religious and environmental communities internationally. \nI am also troubled that because there has been no hearing in the \nCongress on this matter, the Apaches have not been afforded an \nopportunity to be heard on this important matter of religious freedom.\n  It is my understanding that the administration has stated its \nposition that construction should not proceed until and unless there is \nfull compliance with standard environmental and cultural reviews. This \nposition is consistent with the recent ruling by the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, and it would appear that the language addressing Mt. \nGraham telescope contained in the appropriations Act is not contrary to \nthis position. I can only assume that the administration and many of my \ncolleagues who have concerns both for the environment as well as Native \nAmerican rights have not insisted on the removal of this language \nbecause they also read it as allowing for the customary environmental \nand cultural reviews to be completed before construction on the \ntelescope is allowed to proceed.\n\n[[Page S5620]]\n\n\n\n     SALUTE TO ELIZABETHTON AND CARTER COUNTY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT \n                               COMMISSION\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today, I would like to commend the \ncity of Elizabethton and Carter County, TN, for their innovative work \nin helping attract businesses and residents to their community through \nthe use of the Internet. Last November, the Elizabethton and Carter \nCounty Economic Development Commission established a World Wide Web \nhome page to provide corporations looking to relocate or select sites \nfor expansion with instant access to the information they need on this \nregion in upper east Tennessee.\n  The Elizabethton and Carter County Community Profile is an online \nlisting that offers viewers demographic information on the area, \nincluding labor statistics, tax rates, education levels, population, \nhousing data, types and availability of transportation, and locations \nof business complexes and industrial parks. It encompasses more than \n120 pages of detailed community and economic information for \nconsultants, site selection, real estate and corporate executives \nthroughout the world and is a fine example of how advanced technology \ncan aid in the growth and development of every American city.\n  As a physician and a U.S. Senator, I know firsthand how useful the \nInternet has become in the last few years. When I was a heart \ntransplant surgeon in Nashville, I considered access to the Internet as \nvital to my work as any surgical instrument because it allowed me to \nobtain up-to-the-minute information on the latest medical techniques \nand procedures. It also allowed me to communicate easily with my \ncolleagues in transplant surgery throughout the country and across the \nglobe.\n  Since coming to the U.S. Senate, I have found a new use for the \nInternet--constituent communications. My World Wide Web home page--the \nfirst established by a Republican Member of Congress--now allows \nTennesseans to view legislation that I have introduced, as well as my \npress releases, flow statements, biographical information, committee \nassignments, and voting record with the click of a mouse. And I am able \nto communicate via e-mail with thousands of Tennesseans and Americans \nwho contact my office through my home page seeking further information \non specific issues. The Internet has revolutionized the way my Senate \noffice functions.\n  In much the same way, the information superhighway is revolutionizing \nthe way companies do business and the way cities and counties approach \neconomic development. Mr. President, Elizabethton and Carter County are \non the frontlines in this revolution. There are many much larger cities \nthat will have to struggle to obtain the technological advancements \nthat have been made in this community. Mr. President, I commend the \nElizabethton and Carter County Economic Development Commission for \ntheir foresight, innovation and creativity, and I look forward to \nseeing other cities and counties follow Elizabethton's and Carter \nCounty's lead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5619-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5620-S5621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WHY DO WE CALL TAXES A BURDEN\n\n Mr. PELL. Mr. President, there is a commonly held belief \nabroad in the land that all taxes are inherently burdensome. This is \nimplicit in an event recently noted, known as ``Tax Freedom Day.'' I \nwas moved to ponder this matter after reading an article in The \nWashington Post, entitled ``Why Do We Call Taxes a Burden'?'' by \nProfessor Rashi Fein. Professor Fein makes the point, most excellently, \nthat our language shapes our actions.\n  A ``burden'' is by definition oppressive. Our facile use of the term \nin connection with our taxes thereby encourages us to act to ease those \ntaxes. By such thinking, in fashioning a budget resolution, all manner \nof actions become justified. Let us jettison support for Medicare, \nMedicaid, Social Security, hiring of police officers, heating \nassistance to the poor, protection of our environment, education loans, \nUnited States humanitarian operations, civilian and military retirement \npensions, national defense, prosecution of drug smugglers, and Amtrak. \nThus, so this form of reasoning goes, will our ``burden'' be lifted. \nYet who among us would not assert that some, if not all of the \naforementioned programs are worthy in motive and intent, albeit perhaps \nnot flawless in execution?\n  Professor Fein posits that the weighing of appropriate tax and \nexpenditure policies is difficult when our language encourages us to \nthink of our taxes as burdens not connected to the benefits we derive \nfrom them. Police protection, clean air and water, an educated \npopulace, and a strong national defense benefit each and every one of \nus. Moreover, Federal entitlements--benefits citizens are entitled to \ncollect if they meet certain demographic or income definitions--reach \n49 percent of U.S. households, including 39 percent of families with \nchildren and 98 percent of the elderly.\n  As a moral proposition, we must be careful of our words, for our \nwords become our actions. And, as the adage goes, actions become \ncharacter, and our character becomes our destiny. In considering \namendments to the budget resolution, let us not join in vying to reduce \nour tax ``burden'' lest our destiny become a society ``less organized \nand less civilized.''\n  Mr. President, I ask that the article entitled ``Why Do We Call Taxes \na Burden'?'' be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n               [From the Washington, Post, May 17, 1996]\n\n                    Why do we Call Taxes a `Burden'?\n\n                            (By Rashi Fein)\n\n       I learn a lot watching C-SPAN. The other night, one of \n     Washington's leading economists was asked about using the tax \n     system to help reduce environmental damage. The response? It \n     certainly would be difficult, because it would increase the \n     ``tax burden.''\n       ``Tax burden'' is a phrase with which we are all so \n     familiar that we don't stop to think what it means--nor what \n     it implies. At first blush it seems value-free. But plainly a \n     ``burden'' is something to be lifted. We don't refer to the \n     monies we spend on movies, popcorn, milk or shoes as \n     ``burdens.'' We refer to them--and think of them--as \n     expenditures, some (movies and popcorn) optional, others \n     (food, shoes) necessary. We don't speak of our ``consumption \n     burden.'' Why, then, a ``tax burden''?\n       Is it that our tax payments are not optional but our food \n     expenditures are? That can't be it: We have to buy food. We \n     can choose between steak and hamburger (or yogurt and tofu), \n     but we can't choose between eating and starving. Indeed, the \n     penalty for not eating far exceeds the penalty for nonpayment \n     of taxes. yet we do not speak of the ``food burden.''\n       More likely, we think of taxes as a burden because we're \n     not quite certain what it is we're buying when we pay them. \n     We miss, somehow, the connection between our tax dollars and \n     the fire protection, the highways, the security against \n     foreign powers and the biomedical research that our dollars \n     buy. The problem is that few of the benefits we derive can be \n     seen, touched or smelled. Moreover, the benefits we derive \n     from government expenditures most often accrue to everyone; \n     they do not come packaged in discrete units--this box of \n     defense for me, this piece of highway for you.\n       And many of us assume that we'd continue to get whatever it \n     is we're getting from government even if we didn't pay our \n     taxes. Without spending our dollars, we'd have no milk on our \n     tables, but we can't really imagine that schools and roads \n     would disappear if you and I didn't buy them with our tax \n     dollars. Clearly, government doesn't determine how many \n     potholes to fill only after it deposits our tax dollars. If I \n     don't buy that book, that restaurant meal, that aspirin--or \n     if I cheat on my taxes--does government really subtract from \n     the pothole-fixing budget or the salaries of judges? That's a \n     tough connection to make--but without that connection, my \n     taxes come to seem irrelevant, hence unnecessary, hence a \n     ``burden.''\n       Of course, no government program would suffer if you or I \n     consumed less (and thus paid less in sales tax) or if I \n     cheated on my return (and thus paid less in income tax). But \n     if you and I both underpaid, everyone else would have to pay \n     more. And it surely stretches language beyond acceptable \n     usage to call not taking advantage of one's neighbors a \n     ``burden.''\n       Burdens are by definition oppressive, and our facile use of \n     the term in connection with our taxes thereby encourages us \n     to do everything we can (within the law) to ease them. \n     Cheating on our taxes comes to seem acceptable (at least \n     understandable), even though tax evasion is precisely \n     analogous to shoplifting. If we take fire protection, \n     guarantees on educational loans, clean air and water but fail \n     to pay for them, we are stealing.\n       Our language shapes our attitudes. To weigh appropriate tax \n     and expenditure policies in difficult when our language \n     encourages us to think of our taxes as burdens not connected \n     to the benefits we derive from them.\n       Some weeks ago, I received a brochure encouraging me to \n     open an IRA. In that brochure, a 1040 tax return was labeled \n     ``pain,'' while the application for an IRA was labeled ``pain \n     killer.'' By implication, taxes (like pain) are to be \n     avoided. By implication, I can continue to enjoy the benefits \n     of government expenditures without paying for them.\n\n[[Page S5621]]\n\n       We can debate ``value for money,'' the wisdom of particular \n     government policies, programs and expenditures. We can argue \n     as to whether we're spending too much here, not enough there. \n     But that debate is distorted if we enter it with the view \n     that any government expenditure--which means my tax dollar--\n     is inherently burdensome.\n       I feel as I do because I remember what Justice Holmes wrote \n     in 1904: ``Taxes are what we pay for a civilized society'' \n     and what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said in 1936, ``Taxes, \n     after all, are the dues that we pay for the privileges of \n     membership in an organized society.''\n       Now, at century's end, our economists tell us taxes are a \n     burden, and our pension funds tell us taxes are a pain. Is it \n     any wonder that our leaders vie to reduce the burden and the \n     pain, even if in so doing our society becomes somewhat less \n     organized and less civilized? \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5620-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GEORGIA O'KEEFFE COMMEMORATIVE STAMP\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, since the Soviet Union broke up in \nDecember 1991, Russians have undergone five very painful years of \npolitical and economic transition. Life is difficult and uncertain for \nmany average Russians. In Russia's most recent elections, held last \nDecember, Communists gained control of the Russian legislature and pro-\nreform parties were marginalized. Earlier this year, that Parliament \nvoted to abrogate the treaty which disbanded the Soviet Union. While \nrejecting the Parliament's vote, President Yeltsin is nevertheless \npursuing closer ties with its former Soviet neighbors. President Boris \nYeltsin has also made several key personnel changes in the last few \nmonths, dismissing some of the key reformers. War continues to rage in \nChechnya. At the same time, Russia has agreed to adhere to stringent \neconomic requirements to continue to receive funding from International \nMonetary Fund.\n  Against this backdrop, on June 16, in less than a month, Russians \nwill go to the polls to elect a President. Whatever the outcome, this \nelection will have profound implications for the course of reform in \nRussia, the future of democracy in Central and Eastern Europe and the \nformer Soviet Union, the development of United States-Russian \nrelations, and in fact, global stability.\n  I fear that we are not giving enough thought and attention to what is \ntaking place in Russia and particularly to how the impending election \nmight affect United States-Russian relations. Accordingly, majority and \nminority staff members of the Foreign Relations Committee were recently \ntasked with visiting Russia to get a sense of the issues and the \ncandidates in the lead-up to the elections. They have prepared a report \nbased upon their visit which I would commend to my colleagues.\n  The report makes no predictions about the outcome of the election. \nRather, it presents some of the issues confronting the candidates and \nthe electorate, including economic and key foreign policy issues. I \nwould ask that the report summary be placed in the Record at the end of \nmy remarks.\n  The bottom line is that no one can predict what will happen in Russia \nin the coming weeks and months. I believe, however, that it is \nimportant to be as informed as possible about developments in Russia so \nas to avoid uninformed or knee-jerk reactions to events there. I \nbelieve the committee staff report makes a useful contribution to the \ndiscussion.\n  I am pleased to note that the staff trip was conducted and the report \nwas written on a bipartisan basis. I would like to thank Senator Helms \nand his staff for the high level of cooperation they have offered on \nthis venture. I know that we share the goal of supporting continued \nreform in Russia, and as Russia heads into a period of uncertainty, I \nam hopeful that we can continue to work together to promote that goal.\n\n\n                        summary of key findings\n\n  On June 16, 1996, the Russian Federation will hold Presidential \nelections. By any estimation, this election--just over a month away--\nwill have profound implications for the course of reform in Russia, the \nfuture of democracy in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet \nUnion, the development of United States-Russian relations, and in fact, \nglobal stability. No clear favorite candidate has yet emerged.\n  The Russian presidential election comes in the wake of five very \npainful years of political and economic transition. Ironically, just as \nthe Russian economy shows evidence of imminent growth, the Russian \nelectorate's hostility to reform and pro-reform candidates is peaking.\n  The Russian people appear to fear change more than they dislike \nPresident Boris Yeltsin. However, voter discontent runs deep and \nnostalgia for the better, more stable and predictable times, whether \nbased on reality or not, is the order of the day. Many equate\n\n[[Page S5622]]\n\ndemocracy with a breakdown of order, rampant crime and corruption, and \noppression by the mafia.\n  At this point, it appears that the Communist candidate, Gennadiy \nZyuganov, has the largest amount of support among the electorate. \nZyuganov has a chameleon-like ability to tailor his message to a \nparticular audience. It is, therefore, difficult to distinguish his \ntrue beliefs from his campaign rhetoric, and by extension to predict \nhow the Communist Party, if it captures the Presidency, would manage \nthe Russian economy, political system, and foreign policy.\n  Many in Russia conclude that an electoral victory by the Communists \nwould inevitably result in dictatorship. Such fears may not be \noverblown: anecdotal information indicates that some reformers are \nkeeping their exit visas current through the presidential election. The \ngloomier analysts even predict a prompt reopening of the gulags and the \nreemergence of political trials.\n  Two trends in the Russian economy may serve to sustain market reforms \nin Russia even if an anti-market candidate is elected President. The \nfirst is the growing base of small businesses. The second is the \nincreasing flow of economic power to the regions.\n  President Yeltsin has predicted that he will prevail in the first \nround of the June 16 election, gathering enough of the vote to win the \nelection outright. While such an outcome is nearly impossible, Yeltsin \nis widely viewed as a likely second place finisher--which is sufficient \nto get him into the run-off.\n  While President Yeltsin's core supporters within the electorate are \noutnumbered by those committed to the Communists, it is widely believed \nthat he has much more opportunity to broaden his support as the \ncampaign wears on.\n  Vladimir Zhirinovsky must be considered a serious contender if for no \nother reason than that he has consistently exceeded the expectations of \nmost analysts. While he is reviled by most opponents, Zhirinovsky has a \nloyal, if somewhat fractious electoral base. His high negative rating \nmakes his chances of victory near impossible. A widely split vote among \npro-reform candidates, however, could propel him into the second round, \nthereby creating the nightmare scenario for Russia's democratic \nreformers: a runoff between Zyuganov and Zhirinovsky.\n\n  Grigory Yavlinsky considers himself to be the last, true democratic \nreform leader in Russia. Certainly, he is the last democrat with \nanything resembling a popular constituency in Russia today, although \nmany question whether his popularity extends much beyond Moscow and St. \nPetersburg.\n  The key to Yavlinsky's electoral strategy is to build a coalition--\nthe so-called ``third force''--with fellow candidates Svyatoslav \nFyodorov and General Alexandr Lebed. The three--all of whom have \ncollected the necessary one million signatures to be listed on the \nballot--have tentatively agreed to support the most popular among them. \nThe problem is that each of the three believes himself to be that \nperson.\n  Aside from the campaign performance of the various candidates for the \nPresidential election, other factors which may influence the outcome \ninclude voter turnout and the ever present threat of fraud. Even if the \nJune election is relatively fair, charges of fraud will likely be made \nby those who fail to make the second round.\n  Russian politicians readily admit that foreign policy will not play a \nmajor role in the upcoming presidential election campaign. That being \nsaid, Russia's identity and role in the world is a theme that all \ncandidates are exploiting--and to which voters seem to be responding.\n  Given the resonance that nationalist themes have among the \nelectorate, it is not surprising that the current government is \nemphasizing Russian integration with other countries of the former \nSoviet Union, rethinking its relationship with the United States, and \nopposing NATO expansion.\n  Russian officials go to great lengths to emphasize that the \ngovernment is pursuing integration with its neighbors as distinct from \nreintegration. According to these officials, the distinction is that \nreintegration would imply a reimposition of a command economy and \nreestablishment of the Soviet Union, while integration implies a \nvoluntary relationship on the model of the European Union.\n  After the break-up of the Soviet Union in December 1991, there was \ngeneral euphoria in Washington and Moscow about the prospects for a \nUnited States--Russian partnership on a wide range of foreign policy, \narms control, and other issues. By 1994, however, several events had \noccurred which collectively served to dampen enthusiasm in both \ncapitals about the prospects for close United States-Russian \ncooperation.\n  Both Washington and Moscow had unrealistic expectations about the \npossibilities for United States-Russian relations. Still, many \nRussians, while readily admitting that things had changed, are \nreluctant to abandon the notion of a Russian-United States \npartnership--particularly on issues of mutual interest such as arms \ncontrol and the fight against organized crime and terrorism.\n  Even those who admit to a cooling in relations with the United States \npoint to United States-Russian collaboration in Bosnia as a success \nstory and a model for future cooperation. Given previous United States-\nRussian divisions over Bosnia--with the Russians traditionally taking \npositions sympathetic to the Serbs--Russian satisfaction with the \ncurrent IFOR arrangement is particularly noteworthy.\n  While Russian officials continue to voice their opposition to NATO \nexpansion, their arguments are often contradictory and muddled. It is \ndifficult to gauge whether apparent Russian apprehensions are genuine \nor calculated.\n  Russian officials offer an unapologetic though naive defense of \nRussia's relationship with Iran. They regard Russia's relations with \nIran as normal, and perceive Iran neither as enemy nor ally. Russian \nofficials completely dismiss suggestions that Iran may use technology \nacquired from Russia to develop a nuclear weapons program.\n  Russian foreign policy analysts are divided over whether close \nrelations can be forged with the People's Republic of China. \nNonetheless, despite this skepticism, many endorse expanded cooperation \nwith China as a useful counterbalance to the United States on issues \nsuch as NATO expansion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5621-4", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5622-S5623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COMMANDER STEPHEN P. METRUCK, U.S.C.G.\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nexpress my sincere thanks to Lieutenant Commander Stephen Metruck who \nhas served as my legislative assistant for oceans and fisheries issues \nfor the past 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  Steve has done an outstanding job and has honored himself and the \nCoast Guard with his dedication and quiet dignity. His talents and the \ndepth of his knowledge brought a unique perspective on the issues on \nwhich he advised me, and he will be missed. I know that the Coast Guard \nneeds to retain officers with his experience and capability and Steve's \ndedication to the Service compels him to return to the field, but I \nwould welcome his permanent service in my office. Our loss is the Coast \nGuard's gain, and Steve will be leaving my staff shortly to return to \nserve as the Executive Officer of the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office \nin Buffalo, NY.\n  Steve came to my staff on detail from the United States Coast Guard \nto assist me with my work on the Senate Commerce Committee Subcommittee \non Oceans and Fisheries. As Ranking Member of that Subcommittee--and in \nmy prior role as Vice Chairman of the subcommittee's predecessor, the \nNational Ocean Policy Study--I had planned to sponsor a number of \nimportant legislative measures including the reauthorization of the \nMagnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act and was pleased to \ngain someone with Steve's experience and expertise in marine safety and \nenvironmental policy.\n  For over 2\\1/2\\ years, Steve has been a crucial part of my \nlegislative team. I have come to rely on his expertise in Coast Guard, \nmarine, coastal and fisheries issues. As we all know around here, it is \ncritical to have staff that can produce high quality work under short \ndeadlines and with constantly shifting priorities. Steve was a master \njuggler. He was a quick study and in short order he began to work \nclosely with Committee staff where he helped\n\n[[Page S5623]]\n\ndraft several bills and amendments, including the omnibus rewrite of \nthe Magnuson bill as well as innumerable floor statements, memos and \nletters.\n  Another key aspect for any staff in my office is to provide courteous \nand helpful constituent service. Steve demonstrates an amazing ability \nto be sensitive yet fair to all parties involved in an issue. I believe \nthat most of my constituents--fishermen, coastal residents, \nenvironmental activists and others--who he has served would agree that \nhe is always extremely helpful and treats everyone equally and with \nrespect.\n  As he leaves to continue his duty with the Coast Guard, I join the \nmembers of my staff and everyone who has had the pleasure to work with \nSteve Metruck during his time in the United States Senate in wishing \nhim well in his service. I know Steve will continue to honor his \nuniform, his country, and his family with the decency, intelligence, \nand integrity he brought to his service on my staff. He is to be \ncommended for his deep and abiding belief that we must do everything we \ncan to responsibly protect and preserve the environment. Good luck, \nLieutenant Commander Stephen P. Metruck, and thank you for a job well \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5622-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA FLYING TEAM\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to offer my sincere \ncongratulations to the men and women of the University of North Dakota \nFlying Team, who recently captured their third consecutive national \nchampionship at the National Intercollegiate Flying Association's 48th \nannual Safety and Flight Evaluation Conference in Daytona Beach, FL.\n  The championship places an emphasis on safety, and is comprised of \nnine different events that test a variety of aviation skills, both on \nthe ground and in the air. In addition to scoring an overall win, UND \nwas first in combined scoring for the five ground events, and second in \nthe Judges Trophy, which is awarded on the basis of a team's overall \ndepth.\n  A national championship is clearly a tremendous accomplishment, and I \ncommend each and every member of the team. Although a significant \nachievement, I want my colleagues to know that this is only the most \nrecent triumph for what has been without question the most successful \nNIFA team in the country. This year's national championship is the UND \nFlying Team's tenth in the last twelve years, and the fifth for \nretiring team coach John Bridewell.\n  This victory was a team effort from start to finish, but several \nindividuals deserve special recognition. Mike Smieja placed first in \nAircraft Recognition, the fourth time he has won that event at the \nnational tournament. Larry Freer was another repeat winner, taking \nfirst place in Simulated Comprehensive Aircraft Navigation (SCAN) for \nthe second consecutive year. Freer also placed seventh in Simulator \nFlying. Robert Shaw captured second place in Computer Accuracy, and \nSusan Bailey took home second place in the message drop, in her very \nfirst competition.\n  This victory and the women and men who made it possible are a credit \nto the university and UND's Center for Aerospace Sciences, an \ninternationally recognized center for aerospace learning.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair. An interesting \nfundraising letter came to my attention. It was written by actress \nPriscilla Presley, Elvis Presley's former wife.\n  Accompanying the letter was another from actor, Robert Redford.\n  These letters are promoting a special evening of ``Arts, Letters and \nPolitics'' in Beverly Hills benefiting a group called ``Americans for a \nSafe Future.''\n  During this special star-studded evening, there will be a lavish \nreception, followed by a ``program of celebrity prose and poetry \nreadings'' by movie stars Ed Harris and Amy Madigan. The Master of \nCeremonies will be Ed Begley, Jr.\n  Other names on the letterhead include such Hollywood luminaries as \nrock star Don Henley and TV producers Gayle Hurd and Gary Goldberg.\n  For as little as $250 or as much as $5000, one can attend this \nglittering fund raising event at the beautiful Chateau Marmont in \nBeverly Hills.\n  The letter goes on to note that proceeds from this fund raising event \nwill benefit Americans for a Safe Future and ``its continuing efforts \nto protect our environment, our children, and our future from \nradioactive contamination.''\n  Well, Mr. President, I want to protect our environment, our children, \nand our future from radioactive contamination.\n  We all do.\n  But I will not be making a contribution to this group.\n  I will not be sending a check.\n  I will not be going to Beverly Hills to listen as movie stars read \npoetry.\n  Because this group is on the wrong side of the environment, Mr. \nPresident.\n  They are actually opposing what they claim to uphold.\n  While these movie stars claim to be protecting our children from \nradioactive contamination, their efforts are inadvertently exposing our \nchildren to radioactive contamination.\n  I am not suggesting that these movie stars want to do this because of \na lack of intention.\n  I am sure they are well meaning. I am certain they think they are \ndoing the right thing.\n  But they are misinformed, and they are harming those they really want \nto protect.\n  ``Americans for a Safe Future'' claim they are protecting the \nColorado River from the low-level radioactive waste facility planned \nfor Ward Valley in the Mojave Desert.\n  If the Ward Valley site is built, they say radioactivity from Ward \nValley will leak into the Colorado River.\n  Robert Redford says so.\n  Ed Begley, Jr. says so.\n  Priscilla Presley says so.\n  Don Henley says so.\n  That is all some people need to hear to reach for their checkbooks \nand take up the cause.\n  Sadly, some are content to get information about radioactive waste \nand desert hydrology from rock singers and movie stars, even if \nprominent and distinguished scientists say otherwise.\n  I want to refer to this chart, because it speaks for itself. There \nare the Hollywood movie stars, and here are the scientists who risk \ntheir reputation in saying that Ward Valley is unlikely to leak \nradioactivity into the Colorado River. Where are you going to put this \nwaste? Nobody wants it. California has met the Federal laws that we set \nup to allow them to do it. This is the site the National Academy of \nSciences has recommended, and here we are listening to movie stars \nraising money that it will not be there, but they do not propose to put \nit anywhere.\n  Mr. President, I believe we ought to listen to geologists and \nhydrologists when the subject is radioactive waste and desert \nhydrology, and we ought to listen to movie stars when the subject is, \nwell, movies.\n  Sadly, the activism of movie stars has temporarily eclipsed the \nfindings of scientists.\n\n[[Page S5624]]\n\n  Secretary Babbitt is ignoring the National Academy of Sciences report \nthat he himself commissioned and the taxpayers paid for--and we are at \nan impasse today.\n  And because of that impasse, low-level radioactive waste is piling up \nat 800 sites around California, including most major colleges and \nhospitals.\n  Some of the sites are in densely populated areas, vulnerable to \naccidental radioactive releases from fire, flood or earthquake.\n  ``Americans for a Safe Future'' are headquartered in Santa Monica, \naccording to their letterhead. I asked my staff to review the 2,106 \nradioactive materials licenses in California, and they quickly found 13 \nin Santa Monica. There are 432 in Los Angeles County. And yes, some are \neven in Beverly Hills.\n  Do these activists and movie stars know that radioactive waste is \npiling up in California neighborhoods, hospitals and college campuses, \nbecause they are standing in the way of a facility in the remote and \nunpopulated desert?\n  Do they know that fire, earthquake or flood could result in a release \nof radioactive materials from these sites?\n  Are they suggesting we halt cancer treatment or AIDS research that \nuses radioactive materials?\n  Mr. President, these activists and movie stars may be sincere, but \nthey are sincerely wrong. They do not realize the effect of their \nactivism. They are endangering the environment and their communities \nwhile they intend to do the opposite.\n  Mr. President, like most Americans I like to go to the movies and see \ntalented actors and actresses practice their craft.\n  And as talented as these actors and actresses are, the are not \nexperts in the field of hydrology or radioactivity.\n  Nor am I. That is why I rely on experts. And the experts of the \nNational Academy of Sciences have spoken.\n  Ward Valley is safe. Let us get the waste out of populated \nneighborhoods, and out to a monitored site in the remote desert where \nit belongs.\n  I urge these movie stars who lend their names and talents to these \ncauses to examine the facts and the scientific evidence about Ward \nValley, and to reconsider their actions.\n  I know that they want a safe future. We all do.\n  But I do not believe we need to trade a safe present to achieve that \ngoal. A single, licensed, monitored disposal site at Ward Valley will \nnot only result in a safe future--but it gets the waste being \nstockpiled in hospitals and college campuses out of our neighborhoods \nand away from our children today.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor a bipartisan bill Senator Johnston \nand I have introduced to end the impasse: S. 1596, the Ward Valley Land \nTransfer Act.\n  Let us listen to science, and end this stalemate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  I see other colleagues seeking recognition.\n  I wish you a pleasant recess, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week, attorneys for the President \nof the United States filed an appeal with the Supreme Court to delay \nthe sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by Paula Jones. Ms. \nJones is a former Arkansas State employee.\n  The President's strategy is to try to delay the lawsuit until after \nhe leaves office. among the reasons he cites for the need for delay is \nthe Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940. This law lets \nthose who serve in the military postpone civil litigation until the \nsubject's completion of active duty military service.\n  Columnist Maureen Dowd writes about this issue in this morning's, New \nYork Times. She says it is a move ``that marks a new level of chutzpah \nin American politics.'' She says, ``As a society, we haven't preserved \nour sense of shame. But Bill Clinton is doing his best to preserve our \nsense of shamelessness.''\n  Why is this? Ms. Dowd goes on to explain: ``* * * Mr. Bennett (the \nPresident's attorney in the case) is getting paid too much to make the \nhideous mistake of reminding the public of one of Mr. Clinton's \nimprovidences (his maneuvering on the draft) in defense of another (his \nwandering eye).'' That is a quote from Maureen Dowd's column in today's \nissue of The New York Times.\n  In a ``Dear Colleague'' letter dated May 21, Bob Stump, the chairman \nof the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, also addressed this issue \nof the President allegedly serving in the armed forces. Mr. Stump, I \nmight remind my colleagues, was once a member of the President's own \nparty. Here is what Mr. Stump says, speaking about the President's use \nof the 1940 act:\n       This ignoble pleading is a slap in the face to the millions \n     of men and women who either are serving on active duty, or \n     have served on active duty in the armed forces of the United \n     States. In 1969, President Clinton ran away from his military \n     obligation, dodging the draft, claiming that he `loathed the \n     military.' Now, President Clinton by claiming possible \n     protection under The Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, \n     makes a mockery of the laws meant to protect the honorable \n     men and women who serve their country in the armed forces of \n     the United States.\n  Mr. President, I have given a series of statements on this floor \nregarding the President's absence of moral leadership for this country. \nI have been very specific about when he has failed to set a good \nexample for those he serves and leads. I have been specific about how \nhe says one thing and does another.\n  I think moral leadership, from my definition, is doing what you say \nyou are going to do.\n  This is yet another example--this use of the Soldiers' and Sailors' \nCivil Relief Act of 1940--where the President of the United States, \nalbeit a citizen, is indeed the Commander in Chief, but he probably is \nnot doing what the intent of the law is. The Constitution empowers him, \nof course, to be their leader.\n  With that power, he has responsibilities. Responsibilities to set the \nbest possible example for those in the military.\n  The U.S. Navy has recently undergone enormous public criticism. One \nof the most damning incidents was sexual harassment associated with \nTailhook. Congress and the public have put great pressure on the Navy \nto assign responsibility and accountability for that outrageous \nbehavior. Admirals and captains could not hide behind loopholes, helped \nby clever lawyers, to avoid accountability. They had to face trial, and \ntake responsibility for their actions.\n  In his appeal to the Supreme Court, the President would like to avoid \ntaking that responsibility. What kind of message does that send to the \nmen and women he leads as Commander in Chief?\n  Is not the mark of a true leader one who would do the same that he \nasks of those he leads? How can a leader have one standard for himself \nand another for everyone under him--a double standard? Is this setting \na good example? Is this leadership? And what kind of military would we \nhave if our officers chose to follow their leader, in this case the \nCommander in Chief, and avoid responsibility in the same way? Well, of \ncourse, you know the answer. The integrity of the military would be \nseverely compromised.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a good illustration of why moral leadership in \na President is so important, just as Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nobserved. I have quoted him so many times on this floor in this series \nof speeches that I am not going to quote him again, but FDR laid out \nvery clearly that if there is anyplace you are going to question a \nPresident, it is his moral leadership. In this President, there is a \nfundamental lack of moral leadership.\n  It has a corroding effect on the public's trust in their Government \nand authorities. It breeds cynicism. That is my great fear, and that is \nwhy I have reluctantly taken the floor recently with my observations \nabout the President not doing what he said he would do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett).

Mr. President, I must observe before I speak briefly \nabout what I intend to speak about, the Senator from Iowa does not seem \nso reluctant; he says he reluctantly takes the\n\n[[Page S5625]]\n\nfloor, and he certainly has been persistent, and today at least he has \ntaken the floor criticizing the President for what he has not done.\n  The minority leader just finished reading the statement in the \nChamber that describes accurately the circumstances of the filing on \nbehalf of the President, and it categorically rejects the assertions \njust made by the Senator from Iowa. But it is an even-numbered year. We \nall know what that means. And being President certainly means you are \nsubject to criticism. I understand that, as do others who serve in \npublic office. I believe the American people understand all of us have \nthings about us that are positive, things that are not so positive \nperhaps. None of us are perfect.\n  This President, like President Bush and President Reagan, President \nCarter and others before them, I suspect, resides in the White House \ntrying to figure out how to do the best job he can to move this country \nforward and serve the best interests of this country.\n  It is easy to be critical. I hope all of us would understand that the \njob of the President of the United States is a tough job. It is tough \nfor Republicans and tough for Democrats. This is a country with a lot \nof good and a lot of opportunity, and I hope all of us can work \ntogether to help this President and future Presidents realize that \nopportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5624-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I take the floor to say that it appears to \nme we may be talking about National Missile Defense or the Defend \nAmerica Act very soon. Perhaps it will even be laid down before we \nfinish tonight so there is a cloture vote when we come back. I am not \nsure.\n  I want to observe--and I have done this for years that I have been in \nCongress--that we just finished a budget in which there was a lot of \ntalk about reducing the Federal deficit, the need to reduce Federal \nspending, and the Defend America Act, or the National Missile Defense \nProgram, is a program, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \nthat just to build--not to operate, just to build--will cost between \n$30 billion and $60 billion. Now, the operational costs will be much, \nmuch greater than that.\n\n  It seems to me the funding question ought to be posed and ought to be \nanswered by those who bring a spending program to the floor of the \nSenate that says let us spend up to an additional $60 billion more on a \nprogram that I do not think this country needs because the National \nMissile Defense Program, or the Defend America Act, will not truly be \nan astrodome over our country that will defend us against incoming \nmissiles. It presumes that we should build a defense against ICBM's in \nthe event a rogue nation would launch an ICBM with a nuclear tip \nagainst our country, or in the event there is an accidental nuclear \nlaunch against our country.\n  Of course, a nuclear device might very likely come from a less \nsophisticated missile like a cruise missile. We have thousands and \nthousands and thousands of cruise missiles proliferating this world. \nThey are much easier to get access to. A nuclear-tipped cruise missile \nis a much more likely threat to this country than the ICBM, or perhaps \na suitcase and 20 pounds of plutonium and the opportunity to turn it \ninto a nuclear device, or perhaps a glass vile no larger than this with \nthe most deadly biological agents to mankind.\n  Of course, we will spend $60 billion on a star wars program, at the \nend of which it will be obsolete and will not protect this country \nagainst that which we advertise we need protection.\n  We had an ABM system built in North Dakota. Billions and billions of \ndollars in today's money went into that in northeastern North Dakota. \nIt was declared mothballed the same month it was declared operational. \nIn other words, the same month they declared operational a system which \nthey said we desperately needed they decided would no longer be needed, \nand it sits up there as a concrete monument to bad planning. It was an \nexpenditure of the taxpayers' money that, in my judgment, need not have \nbeen made.\n  Now we are told that we have the need for a national defense program, \nor Defend America Act, of some type that will defend us only against a \nvery narrow, limited threat, not a full-scale nuclear attack from an \nadversary, because it will not defend us against that, will not defend \nus against a nuclear attack of cruise missiles. It cannot do that. It \nwill not defend us against a nuclear attack by a terrorist nation \nputting a nuclear bomb in a suitcase in the trunk of a Yugo car, a \nrusty old Yugo at a dock in New York City. But we are told $60 billion \nto build and how many tens of billions of dollars to operate is what is \nnecessary.\n  I say to those who will bring that to the floor, while you do that, \nplease bring us a plan telling us who is going to pay the tax to build \nit. Where are you going to get the money? Who is going to pay the tax? \nAnd then describe why that is necessary and the fact when you get done \nyou have not created the defense for America you say you are going to \ncreate.\n  There are many needs that we have in this country in defense. Many \nremain unmet. This kind of proposal ranks well down, in my judgment, in \nthe order of priorities. If it is technologically feasible to be built \nto protect this country, it ranks well down in the order of priorities. \nMy hope is that we will have a full, aggressive, interesting debate on \nthis because it is not a debate about pennies. It is a debate about a \nmajor, sizable spending program, new spending program at a time when we \nare trying to downsize and at a time when we are talking about the need \nto control Federal spending.\n\n  Those who bring this to the floor of the Senate have an obligation to \ntell us how it is going to be paid for. The announcement of this so-\ncalled Defend America Act was made at a press conference recently, and \nthe question was asked: Where do you get the money for this? And the \nanswer at the press conference by Members of the Senate was: Well, we \nwill leave that to the experts.\n  No, it will not be left to the experts. This Congress will have to \ndecide who pays for a new Federal spending program that will cost $60 \nbillion plus and after being built will not in fact defend this country \nagainst a nuclear attack.\n  There are many needs that we have in our defense system in this \ncountry. Some worry that we are in a circumstance where we will decide \nto downsize in defense too much: We will be unprepared to meet an \nadversary; we will be unprepared to meet a threat.\n  I understand that. I understand this country has gone through this in \nprevious periods, and I do not want us to be in that position. But I \nalso understand that in every area of the armed services there are \nweapons programs that simply seem to have a life of their own and they \ntend to build and build, and they become not so much a justifiable \nprogram that is necessary to defend our country, but they become a \nprogram that is supported by a range of politicians and corporations \nand other interests that give it a life of its own, even when it \nbecomes unnecessary or when the science and the technology demonstrate \nit is not needed.\n  I hope we will have an aggressive discussion about this, about the \nthreat and about the amount of proposed expenditure, and about who is \ngoing to come up with the money, and especially about whether, in fact, \nthis is needed for this country's defense.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your indulgence. I yield the floor, \nand I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5625-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5625-S5626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE INTERSTATE STALKING ACT\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to talk about a bill that I \nhope we can clear tonight in the Senate because it is a very important \nbill that will begin to protect the victims of stalking all over this \ncountry. You know, we did not really know much about stalking until the \nlast few years. That is because it was a hard crime to pin down. \nStalking is threats. It is harassment. It is the constant terrorizing \nof a victim, whether the act that is said would be done is actually \nperpetrated or if, sometimes, it is not. But whether it is or is not, \nit is a very tough thing for a\n\n[[Page S5626]]\n\nvictim to continue to be in fear, to wonder, ``Am I going to have \nsomeone stick a knife in my back? Am I going to be able to walk in my \nneighborhood without fear? Am I going to be able to go to sleep at \nnight without fear?\"\n  Then, in fact, we have found that the victims of this stalking \nactually become victims sometimes. When Congressman Ed Royce and I \nstarted working on this we had a press conference in which we had some \nincredible stories of stalking victims. A woman from California who was \nconstantly threatened, who moved to Florida to escape this stalking \nfrom this person that she really did not know and who was clearly \ndemented--she moved to Florida and one night did become a victim. The \nperson broke into her home and threatened her with a knife. She did get \naway without injury.\n  But then there was the stalking victim whose husband was outside with \nhis wife and she was shot to death, he was shot, and this was from a \nperson who had constantly threatened his wife. So they could have \nprevented it if there had been some way to do it, but, in fact, there \nwas no way to do it because stalking was not a crime until recently.\n  Now we have the situation in which you have the stalking in one \nState, the person moves to another State, and they do not have the \ncoverage in the other State because the actual harassment was in the \nfirst State and when it happened in the second State you had to \nestablish it. The Interstate Stalking Act will make it a Federal crime \nto cross State lines to do the State crime of stalking. It does not \nmake stalking a Federal crime, but it does make crossing State lines to \ndo it, when it is a crime, a crime. That would give protection to the \nwoman who moved from California to Florida. It will give protection to \nmore of the people who have had the terrorizing experience of being \nconstantly barraged by threats from another person. Many people in \npublic life have had this experience. It is a scary thing to happen. To \nlive in fear most of the time, or some of the time, is something we do \nnot have to put up with in our society.\n  This is a bill that passed unanimously in the House a couple of weeks \nago. It was passed out of the Judiciary Committee today on a very \nbipartisan basis. I thank Senator Hatch and Senator Biden for \nexpeditiously having hearings on this bill and putting it through the \ncommittee. Now I am very concerned because I thought this would be a \nbill that would not cause any problem and I would, of course, like to \nsee it go through tonight because I think the President will sign this \nbill. I think the President is going to see the need for this bill. I \nthink if he can sign it before we come back from the Memorial Day \nrecess, that that might save a life. It might save a victim from being \nharassed. It really might help a victim. If it helps one victim in this \ncountry, then why not do it?\n\n  If we pass it tonight, it will go straight to the President because \nthe bill is in the form that it passed the House. This should not be a \ntough bill.\n  I am asking my colleagues on the Democratic side to clear this bill. \nWe thought that it was cleared. Perhaps it was not. Perhaps they can \nmake a phone call, if someone has a concern on their side. I think we \nought to be able to do what is right. This is a bill that ought to \npass. It is a bill that has merit. It is a bill that is not \ncontroversial or it would have been stopped before now.\n  So I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will see fit \nto find out if there is a real problem with this bill. Or if it is a \nproblem with something else, perhaps they will clear this bill, because \nit might save one life. It might save one person from being victimized \nand it would be worth it if we could do that.\n  This is a bill that passed along with Megan's law on the House of \nRepresentative's side. Megan's law has already been signed by the \nPresident. This will allow victims of any kind of domestic violence \nharassment or if it is not a domestic partner or a spouse but a \nstranger who is doing the harassment, it will also provide protection \nif a person crosses State lines to do that.\n  Mr. President, I hope it is not too late tonight. I would like to see \nthis bill cleared because it is important. It is the right thing. It is \nbipartisan and I think there may be something on the other side that \ncould easily be worked out.\n  I just ask my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle to \nexpedite this. We might save a life and it would be worth it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday President Clinton acknowledged--\nbelatedly--that the post-cold-war era presents us with new national \nsecurity challenges. He stated, ``The end of communism has opened the \ndoor to the spread of weapons of mass destruction * * *.'' \nUnfortunately, while the President is finally willing to recognize the \nthreat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, he \nremains unwilling to seriously respond to it--with progress, as opposed \nto pronouncements--on national missile defense.\n  Most Americans do not know--let me underscore--most Americans do not \nknow that the United States has no defense against ballistic missiles. \nIf you were to ask the average American, in fact to ask anybody in this \nChamber unless they are on the Armed Services Committee, they might not \nknow. If you were asked a question, ``If a missile, an incoming missile \nwas headed toward Chicago, what should the President of the United \nStates do?'' and the people will tell you in these little focus groups, \n``Shoot it down''--we can't. We don't have a defense. So, if a rogue \nstate such as North Korea launched a single missile at the United \nStates, we could do nothing to stop its deadly flight towards an \nAmerican town or city.\n  In his speech yesterday President Clinton pointed to his $3 billion \nbudget request for missile defense programs as evidence of a ``strong, \nsensible national missile defense program.'' This happens to be 21 \npercent less than the President's own national security advisers \nproposed in their Bottom-Up review of U.S. defense needs. It is also 30 \npercent less than what the Senate Armed Services Committee provides in \nthis year's defense authorization bill. In short, it is not enough for \na determined and effective effort to defend the American people from \nthe threat of ballistic missiles.\n  President Clinton attacked the Defend America Act, which I introduced \n2 months ago, claiming:\n\n       They have a plan that Congress will take up this week that \n     would force us to choose now a costly missile defense system \n     that could be obsolete tomorrow.\n\n  This is simply not true. The Defend America Act only forces to commit \nnow to deploy a national missile defense system by the year 2003. The \nchoice of what type of system is left up to the Secretary of Defense \nwho will report back to the Congress on the requirements for an \neffective ballistic missile defense system. And making a decision to go \nforward with missile defense now will not, as the President argued \nyesterday, lead to America deploying an obsolete system.\n  The programs we currently have in development can serve as the \nbuilding blocks for a system that meets the missile threat as it \nemerges. Furthermore, as with the procurement of any weapons system, \nmoving from development to deployment requires lead time. You cannot do \nit in a week or a year or 18 months. It does not happen overnight. The \nPresident's assertions contradict those of his own Secretary of \nDefense, who recently stated that these technologies ``would be quite \ncapable of defending against the much smaller and relatively \nunsophisticated ICBM threat that a rogue or a terrorist could mount any \ntime in the foreseeable future.''\n  That is the Secretary of Defense.\n  I would like to address the issue of cost. There has been quite an \nuproar about a Congressional Budget Office estimate of the cost of \ndeploying a national missile defense system pursuant to the Defend \nAmerica Act. The CBO stated that total acquisition costs for the year \n2010 would range from $31 billion to $60 billion, if such a system \nlargely consists of advanced space-based components. However, the \nDefend America Act does not specify any required components of a \nnational missile defense system to include space-based components. On \nthe other hand, the CBO says that a ground-based system with upgraded \nspace-based sensors\n\n[[Page S5627]]\n\nwould run around $14 billion. Section 4 of the Defend America Act \nstates:\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall develop for deployment an \n     affordable and operationally effective national missile \n     defense system which shall achieve initial operational \n     capability by the end of 2003.\n\n  The decision on what is affordable and effective is left up to the \nSecretary of Defense. What I would like to know is how CBO estimated a \nnational missile defense system whose components are unknown. It seems \nto me that the CBO approach was somewhat like a family deciding they \nare going to buy a house and being told by a real estate agent that it \nwill cost them anywhere between $40,000 to $4 million. That is the \nrange.\n  That is true, houses come in many prices. There are two-bedroom homes \nand then there are the mansions and the couple's decision would come \ndown to what they need and what they can afford. Those are the same \nguidelines we need to use here. What does the United States need to \nprotect its citizens, and how can it best be done and how can we \nachieve this protection in an affordable manner?\n  Outlining these estimates are a good way to avoid a serious debate on \na most serious issue. The American people deserve better, because we \nare talking about the safety and security of their children and their \ngrandchildren and themselves.\n  You would not know, if you follow some of the press coverage of this \nissue, that the cold war is over.\n\n  We do not need a so-called space shield to defend against an attack \nof thousands of missiles. We do, however, need to defend the American \npeople against the much more limited threat of an accidental launch or \nan attack by rogue and terrorist regimes, such as North Korea and Iran, \nwho are acquiring a limited, but deadly, capability to deliver weapons \nof mass destruction with ballistic missiles.\n  As President Clinton's former Director of Central Intelligence \ntestified, the threat of ballistic missiles is growing and the \nadministration is not addressing this frightening reality. This is \nPresident Clinton's former Director of the CIA.\n  In his testimony before the House National Security Committee, James \nWoolsey stated:\n\n       Ballistic missiles can, in the future they increasingly \n     will, be used by hostile states for blackmail, terror, and to \n     drive wedges between us and our allies. It is my judgment \n     that the administration is not currently giving this vital \n     problem the proper weight it deserves.\n\n  Through budgetary scare tactics and skewed analysis, the \nadministration is trying to confuse this issue and avoid answering the \ncentral question of whether or not the American people should be \nprotected. By seeking to proceed to the Defend America Act today, I \nhope to move beyond rhetoric and misinformation to a serious debate on \na critical matter affecting the future security of all Americans.\n  I believe the number one responsibility this Government has to its \ncitizens is to provide them with protection. That is what the Defend \nAmerica Act is all about.\n  So, again, let me repeat the question: If you had an incoming \nballistic missile and you ask somebody in my State or any State, What \nshould the President do, they would say, ``Shoot it down.'' And your \nresponse would have to be, ``We cannot. We have no defense.''\n  I suggest those who say it is a decade away go back and look at some \nof the predictions made in the past. I believe we have that obligation. \nWhen we talk about the cost, $14 billion is a lot of money, but so \nwould be the human cost and any added cost if some rogue state or some \naccidental launch directed a missile toward the United States.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1635\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I am proud to be a principal cosponsor \nof the Defend America Act of 1996. This legislation will fill a glaring \nvoid in United States national security policy by requiring the \ndeployment of a national missile defense system by 2003 that is capable \nof defending the United States against a limited, accidental, or \nunauthorized ballistic missile attack.\n  Mr. President, ironically, most Americans already believe that we \nhave such a system in place. This assumption is understandable since, \nunder the Constitution, the President's first responsibility is to \nprovide for the defense of the American homeland. Unfortunately, the \ncurrent President has decided that this obligation is one that can be \nindefinitely delayed. In my view, the time has come to end America's \ncomplete vulnerability to ballistic missile blackmail and attack.\n  The President and his supporters in Congress have argued that there \nis no threat to justify deployment of a national missile defense \nsystem. This is simply not true. The political and military situation \nin the former Soviet Union has deteriorated, leading to greater \nuncertainty over the control and security of Russian strategic nuclear \nforces. China's recent use of ballistic missiles near Taiwan, and \nveiled threats against the United States, clearly demonstrates how such \nmissiles can be used as tools of intimidation\n\n[[Page S5628]]\n\nand blackmail. North Korea is developing an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile that will be capable of reaching the United States once \ndeployed. Other hostile and unpredictable countries, such as Libya, \nIran, and Iraq, have made clear their desire to acquire missiles \ncapable of reaching the United States. The technology and knowledge to \nproduce missiles and weapons of mass destruction is available on the \nopen market.\n  It is also important to bear in mind that a national missile defense \nsystem can actually discourage countries from acquiring long-range \nmissiles in the first place. In this sense, we should view national \nmissile defense as a powerful non-proliferation tool, not just \nsomething to be considered some time in the future as a response to \nnewly emerging threats.\n  The policy advocated in the Defend America Act of 1996 is virtually \nidentical to that contained in the fiscal year 1996 defense \nauthorization bill, which was passed by Congress and vetoed by the \nPresident. Like the legislation vetoed by the President, the Defend \nAmerica Act of 1996 would require that the entire United States be \nprotected against a limited, accidental, or unauthorized attack by the \nyear 2003. It differs from the vetoed legislation in that it provides \nthe Secretary of Defense greater flexibility in determining the precise \narchitecture for the system.\n  The Defend America Act of 1996 urges the President to begin \nnegotiations to amend the ABM Treaty to allow for deployment of an \neffective system. But it also recommends that, if these negotiations \nfail to produce acceptable amendments within 1 year, Congress and the \nPresident should consider withdrawing the United States from the ABM \nTreaty. Nothing in this legislation, however, requires or advocates \nabrogation or violation of the ABM Treaty.\n  Mr. President, it is important to point out that in 1991, Congress \napproved, and the President signed, the Missile Defense Act of 1991, \nwhich established policies similar to those advocated in the Defend \nAmerica Act of 1996. Like the Defend America Act, the Missile Defense \nAct of 1991 called for deployment of an initial national missile \ndefense system by a date certain and provided for a follow-on system. \nBoth also urged the President to begin negotiations to amend the ABM \nTreaty.\n  Although there are clear differences between the Defend America Act \nof 1996 and the Missile Defense Act of 1991, I believe that these \nsimilarities are worth pointing out. A number of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle are now saying that they oppose a policy to \ndeploy by a date certain. But this is what we did in the 1991 Act. \nSeveral of these same Senators now also seem to be opposed to any \namendments to the ABM Treaty, even though the 1991 Act clearly urged to \nthe President to negotiate such amendments.\n\n  Mr. President, it has been asserted that a commitment to deploy a \nnational missile defense system might jeopardize the START II Treaty. \nBut the Missile Defense Act of 1991 was signed into law at the same \ntime that negotiations on the START I Treaty were being concluded. \nIndeed, at the same time that START I was being finalized, Russian \nPresident Yeltsin proposed that the United States and Russia cooperate \non a ``Global Defense System''. I find it hard to believe that anything \nin the Defend America Act would jeopardize START II any more than the \nMissile Defense Act of 1991 jeopardized START I. Those who make this \nassertion are simply giving Russian opponents of START II another \nexcuse to oppose the agreement.\n  Mr. President, opponents of the Defend America Act have also argued \nthat it would lock us into a technological dead end; that in 3 years we \nmay have better technology available to do the job. The fact is that \nthere are no technologies in development other than those identified in \nthe Defend America Act. The Administration's so-called ``three-plus-\nthree'' national missile defense plan relies on the exact same \ntechnologies that would be employed if the Defend America Act were \npassed. The only difference is that under the Defend America Act, \ndevelopment of those technologies would be accelerated. Once again the \nAdministration and its congressional allies are just making excuses for \nnot getting on with the business of defending America.\n  Mr. President, the last issue I want to deal with is the question of \ncost. We have heard some rather careless assertions made about the cost \nof the Defend America Act. It is true that if the Secretary of Defense \ndecided to deploy a constellation of space-based lasers, a \nconstellation of ``Brilliant Pebbles'' space-based interceptors, a \nconstellation of ``Brilliant Eyes'' space-based sensors, and 300 or 400 \nground-based interceptors at multiple sites the cost could be as high \nas $60 billion over the next 15 to 20 years. But Mr. President, under \nthe Defend America Act, the Secretary of Defense could also select a \nmore modest deployment that could be achieved for $5 to $10 billion. \nThe Air Force and the Army both have developed such low-cost proposals. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, a system consisting of \n100 ground-based interceptors, four new ground-based radars and a \nconstellation of Brilliant Eyes sensors would cost approximately $14 \nbillion over the next 6 years.\n  These are clearly affordable costs when compared with the costs \nassociated with other major items in the defense budget. An entire \nnational missile defense system could be acquired for less than an \nadditional 20 B-2 bombers. The cost would be about the same for the \nCorps SAM theater missile defense system, which the administration \nstrongly supports even though we already have four core theater missile \ndefense systems in development to protect forward deployed forces.\n  In my view, those who assert that we cannot afford an NMD system have \nsimply gotten their priorities wrong. With an annual defense budget of \n$260 billion to $270 billion, it is irresponsible to argue that we \nshould not spend $1 billion per year on the defense of the American \nhomeland.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that the Defend America Act \nof 1996 is balanced and timely legislation. I understand that opponents \nof this legislation do not want to allow the Senate to vote on this \nissue. But the President will not be able to hide from it. If the \nPresident's allies in the Senate stand in the way of a vote on the \nDefend America Act to protect him from having to sign or veto this \nlegislation, the American people will nonetheless know who stands for \ntheir defense and who does not.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5627-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5628-S5631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DEFEND AMERICA ACT INCREASES NUCLEAR THREAT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while the stated intent of the so-called \nDefend America Act is to reduce the threat of nuclear missiles to the \nUnited States, in fact, the Defend America Act, so-called, will \nactually increase that threat. Its passage would actually make us less \nsecure. It should be renamed the Make America Less Secure Act, rather \nthan the Defend America Act.\n  Do we want defenses? Of course. The issue is not do we want to \ndefend. The issue is, against what threats? What threats do we create \nin the process of deploying defense? At what price? What resources do \nwe deny ourselves for other threats that may be more real?\n  This is not simply the Republican leadership of the Congress--Senator \nDole, Speaker Gingrich and others--versus President Clinton. In support \nof President Clinton's position are the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Defense Department.\n  Now, this is the letter which General Shalikashvili wrote to Senator \nNunn relative to this bill. He said in this regard:\n\n       . . . efforts which suggest changes to or withdrawal from \n     the ABM Treaty may jeopardize Russian ratification of START \n     II and, as articulated in the Soviet Statement to the United \n     States of 13 June 1991, could prompt Russia to withdraw from \n     START I. I am concerned that failure of either START \n     initiative will result in Russian retention of hundreds or \n     even thousands more nuclear weapons, thereby increasing both \n     the costs and risks we may face.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       We can reduce the possibility of facing these increased \n     cost and risks by planning [a national missile defense] \n     system consistent with the ABM treaty. The current National \n     Missile Defense Deployment Readiness Program, which is \n     consistent with the ABM treaty, will help provide stability \n     in our strategic relationship with Russia as well as reducing \n     future risks from rogue countries.\n\n\n[[Page S5629]]\n\n\n  So the conflict that exists here is between the congressional \nRepublican leadership on the one hand and President Clinton, the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, and the Defense Department on the other hand. Of \ncourse, there are supporters of each of those two leadership groups. \nThat is the contrast here. We have the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the \nDefense Department that have adopted, with the administration's \nsupport, a National Missile Defense Deployment Readiness Program. With \nthis so-called Three-plus-Three program, we would develop the system in \n3 years and then, depending on the threat, depending on the cost, \ndepending on the situation that exists, we would then decide whether to \ndeploy, and could deploy within 3 years of that decision.\n  That is the Defense Department position. That is the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff position. That is the administration position: not a commitment \nnow to deploy prematurely and unilaterally, which would jeopardize our \nrelationship with Russia and undermine our determination that they live \nup to START I and START II. Such a position, as is in this bill, would \nplay right into the hands of those supernationalists and jingoists in \nRussia who right now are running for President of that country.\n  This is the worst time to be introducing this kind of legislation. \nThis is not just me saying this. I am not alone in saying or suggesting \nthis. It is not just Senator Levin from Michigan who is doing it. It is \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff who are saying: do not do anything \nunilaterally to undermine the ABM Treaty, because by doing so Russia \nhas informed us that they will no longer comply with START I and will \nnot ratify START II. They tell us the result--and now I quote--``with \nthe result that Russia would retain hundreds or even thousands more \nnuclear weapons, thereby increasing both the costs and risks we may \nface.''\n  That is the issue before the Senate. Do we want to precipitate that \nkind of action on the part of Russia by a premature, unilateral \ndecision that we are going to deploy a system which is inconsistent \nwith a critical security agreement between ourselves and Russia? It was \nthe wrong time to do it last year and, after much effort, we avoided \nit. It is particularly the wrong time to do it this year because there \nwill be an election going on in Russia in the next few weeks. This bill \nwill be seized upon by people in Russia who do not believe in START I, \nwho do not want to ratify START II. It will be seized upon by them as \nevidence for why they should not ratify START II. That is the fear that \nGeneral Shalikashvili has set forth.\n\n  Now, in addition, this legislation will threaten a number of \ninternational security efforts besides the START treaties. The so-\ncalled Nunn-Lugar, or cooperative threat reduction program, which helps \nto secure, store, and dismantle former Soviet nuclear warheads so that \nthey cannot again threaten any nation, would also be put at risk. \nNegotiations for a comprehensive test ban treaty to outlaw all nuclear \nweapon tests and help prevent the development of new nuclear weapons \nwould be delayed. Russian ratification of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention would be sidelined. So, instead of eliminating the world's \nlargest stockpile of chemical weapons, Russia could leave its chemical \nweapons in place.\n  This bill could relegate other important cooperative security \narrangements with Russia to the scrap heap.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There are other important cooperative security \narrangements with Russia that we have built upon and we have created. \nWe have built, finally, some trust and some confidence between our two \nmilitaries. Our Defense Department does not view Russia as an \nadversary, but as a partner in cooperative security. Take a look at \nwhat is happening in Bosnia, where we have Russian soldiers under U.S. \ncommand in the implementation force. Take a look at what has happened \nwith the United States and Russian de-targeting of our nuclear \nmissiles, where no longer are missiles on either side targeted on the \nother's nations.\n  If we threaten unilaterally to violate the ABM Treaty, as the Defend \nAmerica Act does, it could play right into the hands of those in Russia \nwho want to return to a hostile relationship. By committing to build \nthe system, by making that commitment now to build a system by the year \n2003, the Defend America Act also locks us into possibly the least \ncapable technology.\n  That is another thing that the Pentagon is not agreeing with. They \nwant to develop the technology and, if and when a decision needs to be \nmade, to utilize the best technology that is available.\n  The Defense Department's missile defense program, which is also the \nadministration's missile defense program, the so-called three-plus-\nthree plan, will develop missile defense technology that will permit a \ndeployment decision as soon as 3 years, and then 3 years thereafter, if \nthere is a threat that warrants the deployment, and if the military \ncapability of that system is such that it is effective, and if the cost \nis such that it justifies the advantage to us, then we can deploy the \nsystem. And because the threat is estimated to be 15 years away, we can \ncontinue to develop the technology to make it as effective as possible.\n  Mr. President, we have threats now with terrorists acquiring and \nusing chemical weapons. It happened in the Tokyo subway, and it could \nhappen here in this country. That is a real threat. And there have been \nefforts to smuggle nuclear weapon materials from facilities in the \nformer Soviet Union. It is probably no harder to smuggle nuclear \nmaterials or weapons into the United States than to smuggle drugs. We \nhave very few efforts underway to halt that deadly enterprise. Less \nthan 20 pounds of plutonium could make a bomb which could destroy an \nAmerican city. Mr. President, 20 pounds of very easily transportable \nplutonium can destroy a city. Yet the proposal before us is to spend \ntens of billions of dollars against threats which are uncertain, which \nthe intelligence experts say has not materialized and is unlikely to \nmaterialize in the next 15 years, at the same time that we are \nunderfunding needed defenses against real threats such as the terrorist \nthreat using chemical weapons.\n  At best, the Dole-Gingrich crash program would only counter a handful \nof foreign missiles--less than the number contained on a single Russian \nsubmarine. Alternatively, some 50 Russian submarines and their missiles \nwould be eliminated outright if the START I and II treaties are \nimplemented. It is clear which approach is more reliable and cost-\neffective.\n  By committing to build a system by 2003 the Defend America Act also \nlocks-in the least capable technology. The result would be a very \n``thin'' system, according to the Pentagon. Why lock ourselves into \nsuch technology prematurely when the threat may eventually demand \nbetter technology? Our intelligence agencies estimate no new countries \nwill build missiles able to reach the continental United States for 15 \nyears. The risk of a missile launched against the United States is \nalready drastically deterred by the guarantee of prompt and devastating \nretaliation.\n  Let's look at the price tag. The ``Defend America Act'' says, in \nessence, ``build a system by 2003, whatever the cost.'' When asked \nabout the system's cost, Senator Dole admitted ignorance. CBO estimates \nthat just buying this system will cost between $31-$60 billion. If the \nAdministration requested money for a new weapon system with no \nblueprint and no idea of the cost, Congress would flatly reject it. It \nshould do so with the Dole-Gingrich bill.\n  If we pour money into premature missile defenses, resources will be \nlacking for other defense efforts that improve our security. To deal \nwith security threats to the U.S. we must exercise cooperative threat \nreduction, nonproliferation and arms control efforts. We must also \nmaintain our conventional military forces sufficient to dissuade any \nnation from using weapons of mass destruction against us.\n  Our strategy to secure the U.S. against weapons of mass destruction \ndemands balance. Supporters of the Dole-Gingrich legislation are \nlooking backwards at a non-existent Soviet\n\n[[Page S5630]]\n\nUnion instead of looking forward to meeting the real emerging threats \nto our national security.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the letter from \nGeneral Shalikashvili to Senator Nunn be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 1996.\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on Armed Services, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn: In response to your recent letter on the \n     Defend America Act of 1996, I share Congressional concern \n     with regard to the proliferation of ballistic missiles and \n     the potential threat these missiles may present to the United \n     States and our allies. My staff, along with the CINCs, \n     Services and the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization \n     (BMDO), is actively reviewing proposed systems to ensure we \n     are prepared to field the most technologically capable \n     systems available. We also need to take into account the \n     parallel initiatives ongoing to reduce the ballistic missile \n     threat.\n       In this regard, efforts which suggest changes to or \n     withdrawal from the ABM Treaty may jeopardize Russian \n     ratification of START II and, as articulated in the Soviet \n     Statement to the United States of 13 June 1991, could prompt \n     Russia to withdraw from START I. I am concerned that failure \n     of either START initiative will result in Russian retention \n     of hundreds or even thousands more nuclear weapons thereby \n     increasing both the costs and risks we may face.\n       We can reduce the possibility of facing these increased \n     cost and risks by planning an NMD system consistent with the \n     ABM treaty. The current National Missile Defense Deployment \n     Readiness Program (NDRP), which is consistent with the ABM \n     treaty, will help provide stability in our strategic \n     relationship with Russia as well as reducing future risks \n     from rogue countries.\n       In closing let me reassure you, Senator Nunn, that I will \n     use my office to ensure a timely national missile defense \n     deployment decision is made when warranted. I have discussed \n     the above position with the Joint Chiefs and the appropriate \n     CINCs, and all are in agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            John M. Shalikashvili,\n\n                            Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I close, finally, with the last line of General \nShalikashvili's letter: ``I have discussed the above position with the \nJoint Chiefs and the appropriate CINCs, and all are in agreement.''\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee if I may have 5 minutes within which to proceed.\n  Mr. THURMOND. The able Senator from Virginia can have 25 minutes if \nhe wants to. I am very pleased to hear him speak.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will inquire of my distinguished \ncolleague from Michigan, before he departs the floor. I ask my \ncolleague from Michigan this. The Senator's opening statement was that \nwe should call this bill ``less secure.''\n  Mr. President, my understanding is that we have absolutely no ability \nin this country today to interdict an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile, or indeed a short-range ballistic missile. I ask my \ndistinguished colleague this. We have no security, so how can we be \nless than what I view is zero today?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Well, we do have some missile defense against the short-\nrange missiles, as my good friend from Virginia knows. We are trying to \nimprove those defenses. That is an effort that I think almost all \nSenators support, which is the defense against those short-range \nmissiles that provide the real threat that those rogue countries indeed \nhave. We have the Patriot missile capability, the anti-missile \ncapability, and are trying to improve that, for which our committee \nfunded the efforts. We are seeking defenses against those theater \nshort-range missiles that provide the real threats.\n  If I can complete my answer, on the long-range missile, the question \nis twofold----\n  Mr. WARNER. If I can interrupt, I will first respond, and then I \nwould appreciate it if we could continue. I am fully aware of the \nPatriot system. As a matter of fact, I am the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, and my distinguished colleague from Michigan is the \nranking member and, indeed, we work on that together. We recognize that \nthose short-range systems, the Patriot, have to be deployed to the \nregion. Theoretically, they cannot run all over the United States. So a \nrogue attack, if it could be mounted, with a short-range theater \nmissile somehow against the continental units of the United States is \ndependent on the ability to quickly deploy from what few locations we \nhave in that system to some other part of the United States.\n  To me, that is highly impractical. That is theoretical. Putting that \naside, let us agree, I hope, that the United States does not have any \nindigenous ability to defend against an intercontinental missile, \nalbeit fired by mistake, fired by a terrorist organization, or perhaps \nintentionally, against Alaska or Hawaii, from say, Russia or China. Am \nI not correct on that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator's question raises the exact reason why the \nDefense Department has adopted the National Missile Defense Deployment \nReadiness Program, which will put us in a position, in 3 years, \nhopefully, where we can make a decision as to whether or not--those are \nthe key words, ``whether or not''--to deploy the kind of defense which \nthe Senator has just described, without committing us now to do so for \ntwo reasons. The two reasons are that we do not want to make a \ncommitment now, according to our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, to \ndeploy a system which could undermine the ABM Treaty, which, in turn, \nwould then cause Russia not to reduce the number of warheads that she \nhas and could cause Russia not to ratify START II. It is in the \ninterest of this country that Russia ratify the START II Treaty. The \nother reason given for the Defense Department's position in favor of \nthe National Missile Defense Readiness Program, which will address the \nthreat the Senator talks about, is that they will then be in a position \nto use the best technology available and not commit themselves \nprematurely to deploy a system that may be an inferior technology.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I listened carefully as my colleague from \nMichigan recited his argument. But I come back to his opening statement \nthat this would make us ``less secure.'' We have nothing from which to \ngo to a lesser security today, in terms of our ability tomorrow or \ntonight to interdict a stray, unintentional missile, or indeed one \nfired by a terrorist at the United States. Can we agree on that point?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No. We can, I hope, agree on this. If, in fact, our \ncommitment to deploy a system now causes Russia not to ratify START II, \nor to pull out from START I, leaving her with thousands of additional \nwarheads that she otherwise would have gotten rid of, it will indeed \nmake us less secure. That is why this bill should be called the Reduce \nAmerica's Security Act of 1996--because the commitment to deploy this \ndefense prematurely will, in the view of General Shalikashvili and the \nJoint Chiefs, who share his view, cause Russia to pull out from START \nI, not to ratify START II, and that will make us less secure.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, it is obvious that we are not going \nto come to closure on that point. But we have each made our positions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senators that under the \nrules we are operating by, there are five minutes for morning business. \nDoes the Senator wish to ask for additional time?\n  Mr. WARNER. The chairman has put in a request that we have more time. \nI ask unanimous consent that we may proceed for a period in the \ncolloquy of another 3 or 4 minutes, and then the Senator from Virginia \nwill close with a set of remarks of his own.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Virginia \nis recognized to engage in a colloquy, following which the Senator from \nVirginia is recognized for 5 minutes for morning business.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  I say this to my good friend. I, with modesty, mention the fact that \nin the period when the ABM Treaty was negotiated, I was privileged to \nbe serving in the Department of Defense and, more specifically, under \nthe Secretary of the Navy. I followed the preparations and the \nnegotiations for the ABM Treaty. Mr. President, it was my privilege to \naccompany the President of the United States and the Secretary of State \nand our chairman to Moscow in May of 1972. My principal responsibility \nwas to conclude the negotiation of the Incidents at Sea Treaty, on \nwhich I have been the principal negotiator, and to be\n\n[[Page S5631]]\n\nthe signatory on behalf of the United States on that Executive \nagreement with the Soviet Union and with the Soviet Navy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. A landmark agreement it was.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is still in effect today, although modified. It is a \nliving Executive agreement, in a sense.\n  Departing from that and going back to the ABM Treaty, I remember \nreviewing this at that time and in the past 2 or 3 years in the course \nof the debates. Those that were present at that time were clearly of \none mind that that treaty was never designed to apply to the short-\nrange theater systems. I might ask, does my distinguished colleague \nconcur in that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do indeed, and that is why we are developing theater \nsystems.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. Well, that is my concern. This ABM treaty has \nindeed, in my judgment, impeded the unfettered, unrestrained technical \nknowledge that this country has available to devise means for a defense \nof the short-range systems. I just wanted to put that point alongside \nthe points of my distinguished colleague from Michigan. That concludes \nmy inquiry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could comment briefly on that, I do not think the \nDefense Department or the Joint Chiefs would agree that we have been \nconstrained in the development of the short-range systems, the so-\ncalled ``theater systems.'' We are proceeding apace with those systems, \nand I think we have been assured by the Defense Department that not \nonly would we agree that the ABM Treaty does not cover the short-range \nor theater systems, but that the Defense Department does not feel that \nthe ABM Treaty has constrained that development. Article 6 of the \ntreaty was written, however, very expressly to prevent each nation from \nturning non-ABM systems into ABM systems. That was also part of the \ntreaty which was ratified.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would simply close this debate with the \nobservation that my criticism is not directed at President Clinton but, \nindeed, to a succession of Presidents who have laid down, should we \nsay, a framework within which our scientists, research and development, \nand others have been contained. And, if you look carefully at the \nassertions by the chairman and others, yes, we have not limited them \nwithin that framework. But I take the position that the framework \nshould never have been laid down in the first place predicated on the \nABM Treaty in the short-range missile defense systems. That never \nshould have applied to any of our research and development as \ncomponents for a defense against short-range attack.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5628-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5631-S5632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DEFEND AMERICA ACT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to turn to the legislation at \nhand which was addressed by the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  I rise today to join my colleagues in supporting this crucial \nlegislation to protect the American people from the very real threat of \nlong-range ballistic missile attack. I find it curious that the day \nafter President Clinton made headlines by claiming that he supports a \nNational Missile Defense System, the Democrats in the Senate are \npreventing the Senate, as the distinguished chairman stated, from even \ndebating and considering a bill that would provide for such a system.\n  It was timely, in my judgment, for this debate because the interest \nof the American people have been drawn to the fact that we do not have \na defense against an accidental or unintentional firing of a long-range \nstrategic ballistic missile. That, I think, is agreed on by all.\n  During his speech yesterday at the Coast Guard Academy, President \nClinton made a series of points on national missile defense. Let us \nexamine carefully his assertions.\n  The President begins by talking about theater missile defense: ``Our \nfirst priority is to defend against existing or near-term threats, like \nshort-and medium-range missile attacks on our troops in the field or \nour allies.'' So far, I concur. This is also the priority that \nRepublicans established years ago, in the wake of the Persian Gulf war. \nOn trips to that theatre during that war I saw the destruction of \nIraq's use of the scud. I experienced with other Senators, a scud \nattack on Tel Aviv on February 18, 1991. It impacted a considerable \ndistance from where we were at the Defense Ministry Building.\n  The President then continues, ``And we are, with upgraded Patriot \nmissiles, the Navy Lower and Upper Tier and the Army THAAD.'' What are \nthe facts? The facts are that the administration's recent BMD Program \nUpdate Review shifted the focus of TMD efforts to point defense systems \n(Patriot PAC-3 and Navy Lower Tier) at the expense of the more \npromising and capable area wide systems (THAAD and Navy Upper Tier). As \na result of this review, $2 billion was stripped from the THAAD program \nover the FYDP; and the Navy Upper Tier program remains little more than \na science project--with no acquisition or deployment strategy. These \nactions were taken despite last year's clear legal requirements to \naccelerate both programs. Once again, the Armed Services Committee has \nhad to come to restore both of these programs--adding almost $500 \nmillion to the administration's inadequate request in the Senate bill.\n  Next, the President addresses the threat: ``The possibility of a \nlong-range intercontinental missile attack on American soil by a rogue \nstate is more than a decade away.'' I say wrong Mr. President. The \nPresident and many of our Democrat colleagues are relying on a recent \nintelligence community assessment which reportedly claims that the \nthreat of ballistic missile attack against the United States is 15 \nyears away. Several important qualifications must be highlighted. \nFirst, that intelligence assessment was carefully crafted to consider \nonly threats to the continental United States--not Alaska and Hawaii. \nThe threat to Alaska, in particular, from a long-range ballistic \nmissile currently under development by North Korea is real and near-\nterm. Also, that 15-year scenario is based on the assumption that rogue \nnations will develop their missiles indigenously--without foreign help. \nWe all know that these nations are receiving substantial foreign \nassistance for their weapons development programs. Such assistance will \nsubstantially accelerate the threat.\n  We should not be lulled into a sense of complacency by such reports. \nRemember the assessments we received just prior to the Gulf War--Iraq \nwas supposed to be least 5 years away from a nuclear weapons \ncapability. After Desert Storm, and the U.N. inspections, we were \nshocked to learn the true extent of the advancements in the Iraqi \nnuclear program\n  A focus on the threat from rogue nations also ignores the substantial \nmilitary capabilities both Russia and China--both nations with \nintercontinental missiles capable of reaching our shores. We all know \nof the threats the Chinese made during the recent stand-off with \nTaiwan. They correctly know that the United States is currently \ndefenseless against ICBM attack. And the President may take comfort in \nthe Russian promise that they are no longer targeting the United \nStates. But we all know that--even if this representation is true--\nretargeting is a relatively quick and easy thing to change. I would \nprefer us to rely on limited U.S. defenses, rather than Russian \npromises, for our security.\n  In criticizing the Defend America Act, the President claims that \n``They have a plan that Congress will take up this week that would \nforce us to choose now a costly missile defense system that could be \nobsolete tomorrow. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this \ncost will be between $30 and $60 billion.'' The facts? The Defend \nAmerica Act does not specify a particular architecture for a national \nmissile defense system--it simply says that the United States should \nhave a highly effective system to defend against limited, accidental or \nunauthorized ballistic missile attacks. There is nothing new here. This \nis technology that we have been investing in--to the tune of $38 \nbillion--since the early 1980s. We are simply saying that the time for \n``science projects'' is over, the time has arrived to turn this \ntechnology into a deployed system that will protect Americans.\n\n  Weapons development programs--on average--take a decade from start to \nfinish. As technology advances, those advancements are incorporated \ninto the weapons. Why should NMD be any different--why does the \nPresident think that an NMD system would be\n\n[[Page S5632]]\n\n``obsolete'' by the time it is deployed in the year 2003? There is no \nbasis for such a claim.\n  Concerning the CBO cost study, the $30 to $60 billion range the \nPresident refers to represents the high end of the CBO's conclusions. \nAccording to the study, a NMD system capable of protecting the United \nStates could be developed and deployed for less than $14 billion over \nthe next 13 years--or about a billion dollars a year. This is a \nrelatively smaller cost--less than \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of the DoD \nbudget--to protect the United States from attack.\n  I should also point out that other cost estimates--these coming from \nthe administration--are much lower than CBO's. For example, the Air \nForce has said that it would cost only $2.5 billion to deploy such a \nsystem; and the Army estimates a cost of $5 billion.\n  The President states: ``Those who want us to deploy this system \nbefore we know the details and the dimensions of the threat we face I \nbelieve are wrong. I think we should not leap before we look.'' This is \nnot a surprising statement from a President who is a recent ``convert'' \nto the need for a national missile defense system. Republicans have \nbeen following ``the details and dimensions of the threat'' for over a \ndecade. What more do we have to wait for before committing to defend \nthe United States? The threat is not diminishing. Approximately 30 \ncountries currently have ballistic missiles, with varying ranges, and \nmany of these nations either have or are actively seeking to acquire \nwar heads of mass destruction--nuclear, chemical or biological. There \nis no lack of appetite in the world for such ``status symbols.'' \nWeapons of terror, intimidation. I submit that the only thing \ninevitable about the missile threat we face is that the threat will \ncontinue to increase. The President seems to believe that we have the \nluxury of time to sit around and discuss and contemplate the threat--\nall the while with Americans remain unprotected against an \nunintentional or terrorist firing of one or more missiles. I say it is \ntime to act to protect our Nation before it is too late.\n  One of my favorite lines in the President's speech is: ``It is \n(Defend America Act) would weaken our defenses by taking money away \nfrom things we know we need right now.'' This from a President who \nsubmitted a budget request that was $18.6 billion below the FY96 level \nfor defense; and the same President who recently threatened to veto the \nFY97 Defense Authorization Bill passed by the House because it contains \n$12 billion more than he requested. A President who has a history for \ninadequately funding our military.\n  Finally, the President claims that: ``It is (Defend America Act) \nwould violate the arms control agreements that we have made and these \nagreements make us more secure.'' Again, the facts. There is nothing in \nthe defend America Act which would violate the ABM Treaty. The Act \ncalls on the President to negotiate changes to that Treaty to allow for \nthe deployment of an effective NMD system. I should point out to my \ncolleagues that the ABM Treaty--a 25-year old agreement with the Soviet \nUnion--was never intended to be a static agreement. The Treaty itself \nincludes provisions for amendments--and, in fact, the Treaty has been \namended over the years. Why, all of a sudden, is the Treaty now not \namendable?\n  I firmly believe that Americans here at home and U.S. troops deployed \noverseas should be protected by highly effective missile defenses as \nsoon as is technologically possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/23/senate-section/article/S5631-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. WARNER.
