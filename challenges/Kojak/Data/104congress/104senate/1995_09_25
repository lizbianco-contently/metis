When I recently congratulated our colleague from \nDelaware, Senator Roth, on his ascension to the chairmanship of the \nFinance Committee, he was gracious enough to tell me that he would \nwelcome my ideas as the committee begins to deal with tax reform. I do \nhave some ideas I would like to share with Chairman Roth, and I will \ntake the opportunity within the morning business period \n\n[[Page S 14148]]\nthis morning to share them with the Senate as a whole.\n  I say quickly that many of these ideas are similar to those that were \nexpressed recently by Senator Dole when he addressed this topic in \nChicago.\n  First, Mr. President, we will start with a little history, and I call \nyour attention to this chart.\n  We have learned from the 1992 campaign you cannot talk about taxes \nwithout a chart, so I decided to get with the program.\n  Here on the chart you have a red line, and that red line matches the \nleft-hand side of the chart. It shows revenue to the Federal Government \nfrom the end of the Second World War until now. It is expressed as a \npercentage of the total economic output of the Nation, or what the \neconomists call gross domestic product [GDP].\n  See how exciting that red line is, Mr. President. It is flat, \nunchanging, unwavering. Now let us look at the green line up here. This \ngreen line shows the top personal tax rates, and the chart showing that \nis on the right-hand side. Back here, at the end of the Second World \nWar, the top marginal tax rate was 91 percent, and it has moved around \nin the time from then until now.\n  You will notice there was this one bump. You may remember that, Mr. \nPresident. That was the Lyndon Johnson surcharge for the Vietnam war, \nwhen everything was left as it was but there was to be a 10-percent \nincrease added after you had fixed your tax return. Interestingly \nenough, that is the only time that you see any correlation between the \ntop personal tax rate and the Federal receipts as a percentage of GDP. \nThis has gone from 91 percent under Harry Truman down to 28 percent \nunder Ronald Reagan and back up to 40 percent under Bill Clinton, but \nthe impact on receipts has been negligible, if not zero.\n  That should put to rest the notion that it was the Reagan tax cuts \nwhich caused the deficit to soar. The Reagan tax cuts did not impact \nthe percentage of GDP that came into the Government in that period of \ntime.\n  No, Mr. President, no matter how many tax reform bills were passed, \nno matter how much Congress tinkered with the tax rates, the amount of \nmoney the Federal Government received as a percentage of the economy \ndid not move more than a point. Why? Because every time Congress \nreformed the system, taxpayers adjusted their behavior in response to \nthat reform and the percentage of their aggregate income coming to the \nFederal Government stayed about the same. As I said, one exception is \nthis 10-percent surcharge blip that happened before they had an \nopportunity to adjust.\n  Now, what did change--I will talk about this later on--is the rate at \nwhich the economy grew. In these years, the Reagan years, we had a \nperiod of high economic growth, indeed, the longest sustained period of \nhigh economic growth that we have had in this century.\n  Now, that is important to keep in mind because you look at this flat \n19-percent result. Nineteen percent of a big economy produces more \nmoney for the Government than 19 percent of a small one. So what we \nreally want most of all is growth. Now, as I said, I will get back to \nthat later on.\n  As I reflect on all of the debates held over the years on tax policy, \nI realize that there is one word that comes up over and over again--\nfairness. Every time we make a change in the tax law, we are told that \nit is necessary to make things more fair. Franklin Roosevelt pushed for \na 91-percent tax rate in the 1930's in the name of fairness. ``Share \nthe wealth.'' That was the cry. Sharing, means being fair. Well, 91 \npercent is by itself not fair. If it was fully enforced on everyone who \nhad money to invest, it would shut down the economy. People would move \nout of the United States as they have moved out of the European \ncountries that have tried these kinds of confiscatory rates. So to \noffset the impact of this confiscatory rate, Congress enacted a series \nof deductions and exceptions, each one with its own fairness rationale.\n  What we have done, Mr. President, is this: tip the Tax Code this way \nto encourage that activity or tip it that way to discourage the other \none. And every time we do this, the code gets bigger and more complex. \nThe rich hire more accountants and advisers to help them stay rich, or \nworse, they refrain from investments that create more jobs and more \neconomic growth in order to avoid the impact of the latest reform.\n  Do you remember the windfall profits tax? With oil prices going \nthrough the roof and inflation gathering steam back in the 1970's, \npeople decided that it was not fair that oil companies, by selling \nproven reserves already in the ground, would make more money than they \nhad planned on--windfall profits. So in order to be fair about it, \nCongress put an extra tax on those profits. Well, new domestic oil \ndrilling dropped off, jobs went overseas, and gaslines formed. Congress \neventually had to repeal the windfall profits tax after it had done its \ndamage. And at the time of the debate on the repeal, it was argued \nagain that the tax was not fair.\n  During the recess, Mr. President, back home I sat down with my \naccountant. It was time to finally file my income tax. I had gotten an \nextension on the 15th of April. And that was up on the 15th of August.\n  As we went over the details of my tax return, we got into a \ndiscussion of this very issue. And my accountant, unprompted by me, \nmade an interesting comment. He said, ``Senator, the present system is \nnot fair to anybody.'' I find that a great irony, Mr. President, that \nwe have in the name of fairness for some created a system that is \nunfair to everybody.\n  So, I say to Senator Roth, as he asked for my suggestions, I start \nwith this one. Let us get out a clean sheet of paper and repeal the \npresent Tax Code in its entirety. Let us abolish the IRS as it \ncurrently stands. Let us stop the tinkering and create a new system \nbased on the principle that the purpose of taxes is to raise money to \nrun the Government, not to set priorities in the economy. I will repeat \nthat, Mr. President, because it is the heart of what has been wrong and \nwhat we must do to make things right. The purpose of taxes is to raise \nmoney to run the Government.\n  Now, the new word that we should enshrine in every tax debate is \nneutrality. Neutrality is easier to define than fairness because we can \ntest in advance whether a tax system is neutral. We cannot test whether \nor not it is fair because fairness is in the eye of the beholder. \nNeutrality means that the Tax Code should not be used to punish the bad \nguys and reward the good guys. We have other laws for that. The Tax \nCode should be used to collect money for the Government in as neutral \nand nonintrusive a way as possible leaving the marketplace free to set \neconomic priorities based on true economic demand.\n  Neutrality also means that payment for labor and capital would have \nthe same tax rates. When you look at it this way, some interesting \nthings start to happen. A tax code that is neutral can also be simple; \nanyone can figure it out, and the goal of a 1040 on a postcard becomes \nachievable. One that is neutral and simple is also one that can be \nstable; it need not change. We regress the way we do it now.\n  Now, there is great power in this idea. With a stable tax code, you \nwill be able to start a business and know that the tax laws will not \nchange on you midstream. You will be able to buy a house, take out a \nloan, put money aside in a savings account or make any other investment \nyou want and know that there will not be a nasty surprise coming after \nthe next election.\n  A tax code that is neutral, simple, and stable--that should be \nAmerica's goal for the 21st century. And if we get it, I believe there \nwill be an added bonus. A system that is neutral, simple, and stable \nwill also be the system that comes the closest to being fair.\n  Now, I hear the question: ``Does this mean, Senator Bennett, that you \nare endorsing a flat tax?''\n  I want to see the recommendations that will be coming from the tax \nstudy commission that Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich appointed, the \none headed by Jack Kemp, before I lay out any specifics. But, yes, I do \nendorse the concept of a flat tax as one way to get a system that is \nneutral, simple, stable, and fair. There may well be others. I am a \ncosponsor of the Nunn-Domenici proposal, but I salute the Kemp \ncommission for looking at all of them, as I know they are doing.\n  Now, the purists will say, to be completely neutral a flat tax should \nhave no deductions. Theoretically they are \n\n[[Page S 14149]]\nright. However, I want to be sure that in making the transition from \nthe present to a better tax system, we do not permit American \nhomeowners to be adversely affected by higher mortgage interest \nburdens. Home mortgage interest rates currently reflect the value of \nthe existing tax deduction. If we wipe out that single deduction in a \nsingle step and leave fixed interest rates where they are, we will \npenalize everyone who has a mortgage. The deduction should be phased \nout and only after homeowners can refinance their mortgages at rates \nthat are more advantageous to them than are the existing rates with the \ntax deduction. And until that happens, I endorse leaving the home \nmortgage interest deduction as it is.\n  On the question of charitable contributions, I point out that we are \nconstantly asked in this Chamber on the Federal level to take care of \npeople who are in trouble, to support educational institutions, \nresearch projects, the arts, or all other kinds of good works in \nsociety. Right now much of the burden in these areas is being \nshouldered by good-hearted Americans who want to help through churches \nand other charities beyond just paying their taxes. These charities are \nusually better run and more efficient than the Government.\n  We should find a way to encourage those Americans who voluntarily \ngive beyond their tax payments to engage in these kinds of activities \nand thus save the Government money. So I support a continuation of the \ncharitable deduction. And I assume that at least Elizabeth Dole will \nagree with me on this one.\n  Now, the deductibility of State and local taxes in Federal income tax \nsystems is, for me, an issue with constitutional overtones. I believe \nthat States have an equal standing with the Federal Government under \nthe Constitution and income should only be taxed once. That is a \nprinciple. As I have said, I will wait for the Kemp commission to \nreport on specific rates and levels for a flat tax, but I do ask the \nKemp Commission to consider fully the impact of any proposal on the \ndeduction of mortgage interest, charitable contributions and State \ntaxes.\n\n  I want the Commission to explore all approaches, just so long as they \nare neutral, simple, stable and fair.\n  Let me repeat my longstanding support for indexing the tax rate for \ncapital gains as an immediate improvement in the present system. Taxes \nshould be on real income, not paper income. Our present system of \ntaxing paper profits as if they were real is not only a drag on the \neconomy, but, in my view, it is contrary to the fifth amendment \nprohibition against taking.\n  In terms of purchasing power, many Americans have experienced such a \nloss of their property through the tax law; the Government has taken \nit. Here is an example.\n  Suppose, Mr. President, you invested $10,000 in a business in 1975, \njust before the great inflation of the 1970's. Say the business \nsurvived till now but has paid you no dividend and no interest, no \nreturn at all on your money. Your $10,000 has been locked up in that \ninvestment for over 20 years.\n  Finally, last year you found a buyer who paid you 20,000 1994 \ndollars. In purchasing power, you had a loss. To break even, you would \nhave had to sell for $27,540 because your 10,000 1975 dollars lost more \nthan half their value in that timeframe. But in tax terms, you owe \nUncle Sam $2,800 for so-called capital gains.\n  You not only lost $7,540 in purchasing power on the principal, you \nlost an additional $2,800 in taxes. The unindexed capital gains tax \nconfiscated a portion of your investment, not your gain. In real terms, \nthere was no gain. As I said, Mr. President, to me, that constitutes a \ntaking in violation of the spirit of the fifth amendment. It is time to \nstop it, stop taxing inflationary imaginary gains.\n  Our system of double taxation of corporate profits, if the profits \nare paid out as dividends, tilts the investment community away from \nequity investment and toward debt. A system that is truly neutral, \nsimple, stable, and fair would avoid this tilt.\n  The taking on of huge debt by corporate America in the 1980's was not \ndriven by the fabled greed of the Reagan years that some commentators \ntalk so much about. It was driven by the nonneutrality of the Tax Code.\n  As I said at the beginning, the principal economic goal that we \nshould have is growth. If the tax system produces--back to the chart--\n19 percent of GDP as revenue to the Government and the economy grows \nfaster than Government spending does, it is clear we can do something \npositive about our national debt. An expanding GDP allows us to reduce \nthe deficit with increased revenue and not depend on spending cuts \nalone.\n  Mind you, I am not saying we do not need to make the cuts, because \nclearly we do and for a whole series of reasons. However, if we try to \nsolve the deficit problem entirely with spending cuts and ignore the \ngrowth side of the equation, we are turning our backs on our biggest \nopportunity for financial stability in the years to come.\n  I have seen economic studies that show that if we can increase the \nrate of growth by simply one-half of 1 percent per year--in other \nwords, if we can grow at around 3 percent a year instead of 2.5 percent \na year, the additional tax revenue that will come from that one-half \npercent, combined with the cuts we propose in Government spending, will \nallow us to balance the budget in less than 7 years. That is what \nSenator Dole was talking about in Chicago a few weeks ago.\n  Some say the way to get this growth is to have the Federal Reserve \ndevalue the currency. I disagree. We have seen the dollar drop \nsignificantly in recent years, reducing America's share of control of \nthe world's goods, but it has not brought the growth we need. We cannot \ninflate our way to prosperity, nor can we devalue our way to \nprosperity, as we learned in the stagflation years of the seventies. We \nneed sound money with price stability tied to a neutral, simple, \nstable, and fair Tax Code. That is the key to our achieving the higher \nrate of real growth, combined with discipline on the spending side, \nthat will give us what we need in our fiscal future.\n  Those are the ideas I would share with the new chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Mr. President. I believe that the Senate author of \nthe Kemp-Roth bill, who is that chairman, will be receptive to this \nrecommendation.\n  If I can recap at this point, our financial future depends on the \nfollowing principles:\n  First, we need a tax system that is neutral, simple, stable and fair, \nbased on the concept that its purpose is to raise the money we need to \nrun the Government and not to set economic and social priorities.\n  Second, income should only be taxed once.\n  Third, phantom income should not be taxed at all.\n  Fourth, our deficit problems should be attacked by both spending cuts \nand revenue growth, with the recognition that true revenue growth \nderives not from higher rates but from a stronger economy.\n  These are the principles that are the root to the solution of our \neconomic ills. I salute Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich for their \nleadership in creating a commission to focus on economic growth and \nintelligent tax policy for the next century, and I look forward to the \ncommission's report with great anticipation.\n  Now, Mr. President, since I prepared these remarks, we have had a \nvery busy schedule in the Senate, and I was unable to deliver them in \nthe timeframe that I had anticipated. As often happens, events overtake \nyou, and there are some other things that have occurred since I \nprepared this presentation that I would like to share with you at this \ntime.\n  On September 13 in the Wall Street Journal, Robert L. Bartley, who is \nthe editor of the editorial page of the Journal, produced a piece \ncalled ``Giving up on Growth.'' I am dependent upon Mr. Bartley for the \nfirst recognition of this 19-percent reality, as he has highlighted \nthat again and again on the pages of the Journal.\n  I will not take the time to read all of his editorial ``Giving up on \nGrowth,'' but he talks about many of the same things I talked about \nhere. How, if we could only get the economy to grow at the same rate it \ndid during the Reagan years, during the years, Mr. President, when the \nmarginal tax rate was down here rather than up there, that we could \nsolve most of our deficit problems, because the income would be so \n\n[[Page S 14150]]\nmuch higher in an economy growing at 3 percent plus than it will be at \nan economy growing at 2.5 percent that it tips the equation favorably \nin our balance.\n  He points out that the Clinton administration has resigned itself, if \nyou will, to 2.5 percent as the highest possible growth we can achieve \ninto the next century, turning their backs on the Reagan experience and \nthe empirical evidence of the Reagan years.\n  However, whenever this is brought up, people immediately turn to the \ndeficit issue, and we are confronted with the next chart, Mr. \nPresident, the chart showing the red ink, the sea of deficits, if you \nwill. Here in nominal dollars is the record of the amount of deficits \nwe had in the last century, so small at the beginning that you cannot \neven find them on this chart. This little bump is the First World War. \nWe have the Second World War. But here we are, ``You see, when Ronald \nReagan is elected President, look at the deficits. How can you stand \nthere, Senator Bennett, and say that we must go back to the Reagan \nyears of high growth when the price we paid for that growth was the \ntremendous explosion of deficits?''\n  Then to really scare us, we are shown the next chart, when all of \nthese deficits are accumulated in the form of the national debt, and \nthe national debt goes up to the point where it is projected by the \nyear 2005 to be $9 trillion.\n  This is a chart that scares everybody today. Well, Mr. President, let \nme comment briefly on this chart, before I move to the others, and take \nan experience out of my own lifetime.\n  When I was hired as the chief executive officer of the company that I \nheaded for half a dozen years, we had some debt. It was $75,000. Today, \nthat company has debt in excess of $7.5 million. If you were to put \nthat debt on a chart like this, it would be even more dramatic than \nthat. Clearly, you need to do something, Senator, this company is \nheaded for bankruptcy because the debt has soared from a mere $75,000 \nto $7.5 million. But, of course, that does not tell the story.\n  When we had a debt of $75,000, our total sales were $250,000. Our \ndebt was more than 25 percent of our total sales. Today, a debt of $7.5 \nmillion on a company with sales of close to $300 million is an \ninsignificant issue indeed. But while we happen to have debt on the \nbalance sheet of about $7.5 million, we have cash on the balance sheet \nof close to $60 million. You may ask why do you not pay off the debt? \nWell, it is left over from mortgages on buildings that were built at \nthe time when we did not have that much cash, and there is a prepayment \npenalty attached to it. That debt is in no way threatening the \nexistence of the corporation; whereas, the $75,000 debt caused us some \nsleepless nights. So it is not the nominal amount of the debt that we \nshould look at, but the debt in relation to something else.\n  Let us go, for a clearer picture, to the next chart. Here is the \nchart of deficits listed in dollars that are adjusted for purchasing \npower. What in the previous chart was a mere blip for the Second World \nWar now, in purchasing power, makes it clear that the highest deficit \nwe have ever had in our history was in the Second World War, and none \nof the subsequent deficits have come close to it. What has happened to \nthe economy? How big was the economy during the Second World War \ncompared to the economy now?\n  So on the next chart we have computed the debt not as a piling up of \nnominal dollars, but as a percentage of GDP, or a percentage of the \neconomy. And now you see that in the Second World War, the debt was \nclose to 130 percent of total output. That is, we were spending 30 \npercent more than the entire economy was producing in the days of the \nSecond World War, as the debt soared. And as soon as the war ended, the \ndebt, as a percentage of GDP, began to fall, and fall dramatically, all \nthe way down to during the 1970's, at roughly 30 percent of the \neconomy. From 130 down to 30--a very different picture than the \nskyrocketing red ink on the previous chart.\n  So if you look at it in historic terms, Mr. President, today the \ndebt, as a percentage of the economy, is roughly what it was when \nDwight Eisenhower was President of the United States. We did not feel \nthat the economy was in danger of political collapse and financial \ncollapse during the Eisenhower Presidency. But there are differences. \nObviously, the major difference is this one. It is growing now. In the \nEisenhower Presidency, it was shrinking.\n  Let us look at the nature of the budget. In the Eisenhower \nPresidency, roughly 50 percent of the budget was devoted to defense. \nToday, I wish I could ask the distinguished occupant of the chair to \nrespond because he serves on the Armed Services Committee and could \ngive us a more correct answer. But the defense budget is about 6 \npercent--no, it is less than that, of the GDP and falling. And it is a \nrelatively small percent of the total budget. What happened here--\nreferring to the chart--that did not happen here? Well, in Eisenhower's \ntime, there was no Medicaid, there was no Medicare, there were no \nmiddle class entitlements. As I say, the defense spending constituted \nabout 50 percent of the budget.\n  What has happened is that entitlement spending has taken hold, \nregardless of whatever else is happening in the economy, and \nentitlement spending, as we have seen from the Commission headed by the \nSenator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey], is going to take us over the cliff.\n  Are we in danger of immediate financial distress? No. When you look \nat it in this historical context, no. Do we need to do something about \nour financial circumstance right now, however? Yes, because these lines \nare going up instead of down. This is the first time in our history, \nMr. President, that the lines have been going up in peacetime. Always \nbefore, when the lines went up, it was because of a war, and then they \ncame down. Well, the cold war is over and the lines are still going up.\n  Now, Mr. President, as I said earlier, there are two parts of this \nline. One has to do with the amount of debt, and the other, since it is \na percentage, has to do with the size of the economy. You can start \nthese yellow lines moving down if you cut spending. But you can also \nstart them coming down if you increase the size of the economy. We are \nback to growth, as one of the major solutions--one of the ignored \nsolutions--to our fiscal circumstance.\n  Robert Bartley asks the question in his editorial:\n\n       Have the Republicans given up on growth?\n\n  He says, talking about the importance of growth:\n\n       Such discussion ought to start with the heirs of Ronald \n     Reagan, the President who presided over our last period of \n     acceptable growth. But with the withdrawal of Jack Kemp, no \n     strong growth message comes from any of the GOP Presidential \n     contenders, and even the newly ascendant Republicans pitch \n     their rhetoric toward sacrifice rather than hope.\n\n  I object to his characterization of the majority leader's position. I \nthink his statement in Chicago, which is in concert with the statement \nI have just made here, makes it very clear that he at least is \ndetermined to support growth as a major goal should he accede to the \nPresidency. Steve Forbes has just entered the Presidential list, \ncalling for growth as the major goal of the Forbes administration. So \nthere are contenders who, contrary to Mr. Bartley's comment, are \nfocusing on growth. But as a general rule, his criticism, I think, is \nwell taken.\n  He goes on:\n\n       Even Representative Dick Armey's flat tax, in fact an \n     incentive-boosting and investment-oriented initiative, has \n     been promoted so far with arguments about simplification. It \n     is almost as if Republicans are ashamed to promise growth.\n       Despite their congressional triumph, that is, Republicans \n     are still spooked by rhetoric about ``the rich'' and a \n     ``decade of greed.'' In the off-year elections, President \n     Clinton's every campaign appearance was marked by assaults \n     against the 1980s; when votes were counted, the 1980s won. \n     The Republicans could boost their own fortunes, and give the \n     nation a badly needed psychological lift, if they started to \n     claim their own birthright, to promise a return to the \n     economic growth of the Reagan years.\n\n  I conclude, Mr. President, by going back to the original chart once \nagain, which has been up for so much of my presentation but needs to be \nlooked at again. We have been told ad nauseam that the reason we are in \ndeficit now is because of the disastrous tax cuts of the Reagan years. \nThe fact is, the tax cuts of the Reagan years have no impact on the \npercentage of the economy that came to the Federal Government.\n  As Mr. Bartley points out, they had a tremendous impact upon the rate \nat which that economy grew. Nineteen \n\n[[Page S 14151]]\npercent of a rapidly growing economy produces more money for the \nGovernment than 19 percent of a stagnant economy.\n  Mr. President, I certainly support spending cuts. We need to enforce \nspending cuts for a whole series of reasons.\n  I conclude by saying that the Republicans in this Senate need to \nrecognize, as Senator Dole called on us to recognize in his speech in \nChicago, that our main goal for the economy should be long-term \nsustained growth in excess of the 2.5-percent rate for which the \nClinton administration is prepared to settle.\n  If we can do that, Mr. President, if we can get the growth rate back \nup to where it was in the Ronald Reagan years and then with spending \ncuts get some control over the runaway entitlement pressures, we will \nsee this line of yellow bars begin to move back down as it has done \nthroughout our history.\n  We will leave to our children not only a Federal debt that is under \ncontrol but an American economy that is growing rapidly enough to \ncreate the number of jobs and job opportunities that our children and \ngrandchildren so richly deserve.\n  I apologize for the length of this presentation. As I say, we have \nopportunities only so often in morning business in which to give them, \nso I have combined several topics here in a single presentation on a \nMonday afternoon.\n  I thank the Chair for his attention. I yield the floor. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I understand that the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], has the balance of the time of 15 \nminutes. I ask unanimous consent that I have a portion of his time, if \nnot all of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota, by previous \norder, was to be recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  Without objection, the Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/25/senate-section/article/S14147-6", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14151-S14155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          DOT INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT CONCLUDES NO WRONGDOING\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, earlier this year newspaper reports detailed \nallegations that FAA personnel may have withheld or destroyed documents \nto avoid the public release of information embarrassing to our \ncolleague and Democratic leader Daschle and Deputy Administrator Linda \nDaschle, his wife.\n  Shortly after there appeared further allegations that Mrs. Daschle \nmay have violated the terms of her recusal at the FAA by involving \nherself in the agency's consideration of certain policy proposals by \nthe leader for the consolidation of air charter inspections.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Aviation, \nSenator McCain, requested a full investigation of these allegations by \nthe Department of Transportation office of inspector general.\n  Senator Daschle supported that request because he felt the \nallegations needed a thorough inquiry.\n  Last Thursday, after an exhaustive investigation of 7 months, the \ninspector general released his report finding no basis in fact for \nthese allegations.\n  Mr. President, whenever allegations originally are carried in the \npress with great fanfare, are investigated and found to be groundless, \nfairness to all concerned requires that we take the same notice of the \nresolution as we did the original charge.\n  Mr. President, let me read just one paragraph from the inspector \ngeneral's report as it relates to these allegations. I think it says it \nall.\n\n       This investigation disclosed no evidence to substantiate \n     that documents were destroyed as alleged. Nor did this \n     investigation disclose evidence to substantiate that Deputy \n     Administrator Daschle violated her recusal. Accordingly, it \n     is recommended that this investigation be closed.\n\n  For the benefit of those who may have missed the stories in \nSaturday's newspapers, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreport of the inspector general be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  [From the Department of Transportation, Office of Inspector General]\n\n     Report of Investigation--Alleged Destruction of FAA Documents \n                        Concerning B Aviation\n\n\n                             i. predication\n\n       This investigation was predicated on a letter from Senator \n     John McCAIN to Inspector General A. Mary SCHIAVO dated \n     February 8, 1995, requesting an investigation into \n     allegations raised by Gary M. BAXTER, Aviation Safety \n     Inspector, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Great Lakes \n     Regional Office, Des Plaines, Illinois. Senator McCAIN \n     transmitted a letter which BAXTER wrote to Senator Larry \n     PRESSLER dated January 3, 1995, containing four separate \n     allegations, one of which alleged destruction of records. On \n     February 3, 1995, FAA Administrator David HINSON also \n     referred the allegation of record destruction to the OIG \n     requesting an investigation.\n       BAXTER alleged that unspecified FAA documents were \n     destroyed by FAA personnel during the processing of a request \n     for documents under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). \n     The FOIA request was made by Attorney Matthew MALONEY in \n     April 1994, seeking records pertaining to B AVIATION (B) \n     of Rapid City, South Dakota. MALONEY represents the families \n     of two of the victims of a February 1994, crash of a B \n     aircraft in North Dakota. Essentially, BAXTER alleged that \n     documents were destroyed because the public release of those \n     documents may be embarrassing to Senator Tom DASCHLE of South \n     Dakota and his wife, Linda DASCHLE, who is Deputy \n     Administrator of the FAA.\n       Linda DASCHLE was nominated FAA Deputy Administrator by the \n     President on November 19, 1993, and confirmed by the Senate \n     on November 20, 1993. At the outset of our investigation, \n     Deputy Administrator DASCHLE disclosed to the OIG that in the \n     summer of 1994, she had selected an FAA employee from Rapid \n     City, South Dakota, to temporarily serve on her immediate \n     staff. This disclosure raised issues concerning Deputy \n     Administrator DASCHLE's recusal from matters involving her \n     husband because the employee had been directly involved in \n     working with Senator DASCHLE's staff during 1993 and 1994 on \n     the issue of consolidated inspections.\n\n\n                             ii. background\n\n       On February 24, 1994, a plane owned and operated by B, \n     crashed in Minot, North Dakota. The crash killed everyone on \n     board, including a B pilot and three Indian Health Service \n     doctors. The investigation by the National Transportation \n     Safety Board (NTSB) cited both pilot error and poor weather \n     conditions as factors contributing to the crash.\n       B was established in 1968 by Mr. Merl BELLEW and a former \n     partner. The company consists of an air taxi operation, a \n     repair station, and a pilot school. It employs approximately \n     eight individuals and owns and operates approximately 20 \n     small aircraft. B is an authorized FAA air taxi operation, \n     in accordance with 14 CFR Part 135. As such, it is required \n     to undergo bi-annual inspections by the FAA in order to \n     ensure its compliance with Federal Aviation Regulations \n     (FARS). Additionally, B contracts with certain government \n     agencies to provide various services. These agencies include \n     the Department of Agriculture (USDA), U.S. Forest Service \n     (USFS) and the Department of Interior (DOI), Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs (BIA).\\1\\ Unlike the FAA which inspects for \n     compliance with the FARS, these agencies inspect for \n     compliance with contract specifications once a year.\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Over the past 10 years, Senator DASCHLE has performed \n     constituent services on behalf of B which involved contacts \n     by Senator DASCHLE and his staff with officials of the FAA. \n     The most significant area of constituent service involved the \n     issue of consolidated inspections for aviation charter \n     operations.\n       In 1992, BELLEW personally raised the issue of \n     consolidating aviation inspections to Senator DASCHLE. B \n     voiced concern over alleged redundant inspections conducted \n     by the FAA and the USFS. This prompted the Senator to become \n     involved on behalf of his constituent. Between June 1992, and \n     April 1994, Senator DASCHLE and his staff pursued the issue \n     of consolidating aviation inspections through meetings and \n     correspondence with the FAA and the USFS.\n       Senator DASCHLE ultimately introduced an amendment to the \n     Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture \n     Reorganization Act of 1994 transferring USDA aviation \n     inspection authority to the FAA. The amendment was \n     unanimously adopted by the Senate but resulted in compromise \n     legislation based on questions raised by Congressman Charlie \n     ROSE. The compromise legislation required a study be \n     performed by a joint FAA/USDA review committee. In its \n     report, dated May 1995, and signed by the Secretaries of \n     Agriculture and Transportation on July 31, 1995, the \n     committee concluded that ``Alternate 1 [i.e., the current \n     system] was the only alternative which fully satisfied the \n     mission preparedeness and safety oversight criteria contained \n     in the Act.''\n\n[[Page S 14152]]\n\n       By letter dated August 8, 1995, Senator DASCHLE requested \n     that the Government Accounting Office (GAO) review the \n     results of that study and address nine specific questions \n     concerning the issue of consolidating inspections, leaving \n     the issue unresolved. The merits of Senator DASCHLE's \n     proposal were beyond the scope of this investigation.\n       Our investigation identified issues beyond the scope of the \n     alleged destruction of documents and the related issue of \n     Deputy Administrator DASCHLE's recusal. These issues are \n     being resolved through a separate inquiry by the OIG.\n\n\n                           iii. jurisdiction\n\n       The Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the Department of \n     Transportation (DOT) was created under the Inspector General \n     Act of 1978 (P.L. No. 95-452). Under the Act, the OIG has \n     broad authority to conduct audits and investigations \n     concerning the programs and operations of the DOT. The DOT is \n     comprised of 10 Operating Adminsitrations including the FAA. \n     In conducting investigations under the Act, determinations \n     are made concerning investigative authority. The following \n     jurisdictional determinations were made in this case:\n       1. The allegation concerning the alleged destruction of FAA \n     documents was made by an FAA employee and concerned several \n     aspects of the programs and operations of the FAA including \n     the FAA's regulatory oversight of B OIG determined that \n     investigative authority over alleged destruction of FAA \n     documents, is within the jurisdiction of the OIG. OIG also \n     determined that investigative authority over the FAA's \n     regulatory oversight of B is within the jurisdiction of the \n     OIG.\n       2. An issue was also presented concerning the recusal of \n     FAA Deputy Administrator Linda DASHCLE. On February 6, 1995, \n     Deputy Administrative DASCHLE disclosed to OIG that she had \n     selected an FAA employee from Rapid City, South Dakota, to \n     temporarily serve on her immediate staff. This employee had \n     been directly involved in working with Senator DASHCLE's \n     office on the proposal to consolidate aviation inspection. \n     OIG determined that investigative authority over the Deputy \n     Administrator's adherence to her recusal is within the \n     jurisdiction of the OIG.\n       3. In many cases, issues are presented in which the \n     investigative authority of the OIG overlaps with other \n     investigative authority. For example, constituent service \n     performed by a U.S. Senator and the programs and operations \n     of the USFS are not within the jurisdiction of the DOT/OIG. \n     The NTSB is independent of DOT and, therefore, is not subject \n     to OIG audit or investigation. However, the Intersection \n     between FAA employees and USFS personnel; the interaction \n     between FAA employees and Senator DASCHLE and his staff; and \n     the interaction between FAA and NTSB personnel were each \n     relevant to the investigation of the alleged destruction of \n     documents. Accordingly, OIG determined that investigative \n     authority over these interactions is within the jurisdiction \n     of the OIG.\n\n\n                            IV. METHODOLOGY\n\n       The OIG staff conducted the following interviews: (1) \n     Senator Tom DASCHLE; (2) Linda DASCHLE, the Deputy \n     Administrator of the FAA; (3) A current and former member of \n     Senator DASCHLE's staff; (4) FAA officials who interacted \n     with the Deputy Administrator's office; (5) FAA officials \n     involved in responding to the FOIA request; (6) FAA Aviation \n     Safety Inspectors in Rapid City, South Dakota; (7) United \n     States Forest Service personnel; and (8) Departmental and FAA \n     ethics officials.\n       The OIG staff obtained and reviewed the following \n     documents: (1) a copy of the documents submitted by the FAA \n     to MALONEY in response to the FOIA request; (2) FAA files \n     related to the FOIA request; (3) working files of those \n     responsible to respond to the FOIA request; (4) documents \n     requested from Senator DASCHLE's office; (5) Senator Hank \n     BROWN's inquiry to the FAA pertaining to B, based on a \n     letter from Bill DICKSON, Regional Aviation Officer, USFS, \n     dated April 1984; and (6) documents pertaining to the recusal \n     of the Deputy Administrator from FAA matters involving her \n     husband and South Dakota.\n       The OIG staff obtained and reviewed the following reports: \n     (1) the ``Statement of the Office of Senator Tom Daschle \n     Regarding Consolidated Federal Air Charter Safety Inspections \n     and Related Matters,'' issued on February 17, 1995, in \n     response to media attention given to Senator DASCHLE's \n     relationship with B (2) NTSB Factual Report on the B \n     crash, NTSB ID: CHI94GA093; (3) ``Boeing 757 Wake Turbulence, \n     A Review of the Actions of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration;'' (4) ``Interagency Aviation Inspections, A \n     Joint USDA/DOT Study,'' Report to the United States Congress \n     Pursuant to Section 306 of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform \n     and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994, \n     P.L. 103-354.\n\n\n                        V. INVESTIGATIVE RESULTS\n\n                  A. Alleged destruction of documents\n\n                              1. Synopsis\n\n       We investigated the alleged destruction of documents \n     related to the April 1994, FOIA request pertaining to the \n     February 1994, crash of an aircraft owned and operated by \n     B The crash, which resulted in the death of three U.S. \n     Department of Health and Human Services, Indian Health \n     Service (IHS) doctors, and a pilot employed by B, occurred \n     while B was performing services under an IHS contract.\n       We concluded that no documents were destroyed. However, we \n     confirmed that FAA withheld certain documents. The FAA \n     transmittal of documents to MALONEY indicates that some \n     documents were withheld ``for legal review'' but fails to \n     appropriately cite applicable exemptions and fails to \n     reference the scope of the documents withheld, thereby \n     denying the requester the right to appeal under the FOIA. The \n     documents withheld primarily consisted of B company manuals \n     which may have been withheld under FOIA exemption four, Title \n     5 U.S.C. Sec. 552(b)(4). This exemption allows for the \n     withholding of privileged or confidential commercial \n     information. Nonetheless, the FAA was required to specify \n     this in the response to MALONEY, which was not done. We \n     attribute this to carelessness and a significant lack of \n     procedures in the FAA for handling FOIA requests. We also \n     identified three sets of circumstances which resulted in \n     BAXTER's suspicions that documents were being destroyed. \n     Details surrounding those circumstances are provided below.\n       Our conclusions regarding a lack of proper procedures for \n     handling FOIA requests parallel the findings contained in a \n     report by the Department of Transportation's General Counsel \n     and the FAA Deputy Administrator in July 1994, concerning a \n     FOIA request on the Boeing 757 Wake Turbulence issue. We \n     confirmed that the FAA has taken corrective actions in \n     response to that report, the report had not been issued and \n     the corrective actions were not yet in place at the time of \n     the MALONEY FOIA request.\n\n                             2. Background\n\n       The statutes and regulations applicable to this matter \n     include: Title 5 U.S.C., Section 552, the Freedom of \n     Information Act; Title 49 C.F.R., Part 7; FAA Order 1200.3, \n     Public Availability of Information; and Title 18 U.S.C. 2071, \n     Concealment, removal, or mutilation of records and reports.\n       Gary M. BAXTER, Aviation Safety Inspector, FAA, Great Lakes \n     Region (GLR), was the Staff Specialist assigned to handle B \n     FOIA requests. By letter, dated January 3, 1995, to Senator \n     Larry PRESSLER, BAXTER alleged that documents which were \n     releasable under the FOIA were improperly withheld or \n     destroyed. The FOIA request in question, dated April 27, \n     1994, was filed with the FAA by Matthew MALONEY, Attorney, \n     SHERMAN, MEEHAN & CURTIN, P.C., Washington, D.C. The FOIA \n     request was for documents in the custody of the FAA \n     pertaining to B, an FAA certified air taxi operation. The \n     request listed nine categories of documents including ``all \n     data or information in the custody of the FAA received from \n     any government agency or official, including elected \n     officials.''\n       On May 5, 1994, BAXTER forwarded the FOIA request to Cathy \n     JONES, Manager, FAA, Flight Standards District Office (FSDO), \n     Rapid City, South Dakota, the office responsible for B's \n     certification. JONES directed her staff in the FSDO to gather \n     all B related documents and provide them to her. On May 12, \n     1994, BAXTER verbally advised JONES she did not have to \n     provide: national database information; her notes notifying \n     her employees of the B accident; her instructions to her \n     employees about gathering information to assist the NTSB; and \n     documents relating to B's pilot school and repair station. \n     Nonetheless, JONES decided to only segregate her notes and \n     the national database printout. Our inquiry disclosed that \n     JONES sent all other documents, including the pilot school \n     and repair station records, to BAXTER.\n       In his letter to Senator PRESSLER, BAXTER stated: ``She \n     [JONES] told me that the Division Manager of Flight Standards \n     Division had told her to destroy some parts of B's Operator \n     File because of Senator DASCHLE's intervention on behalf of \n     his wifes [sic] (Linda DASCHLE #2 in the FAAs) friend Mr. \n     Merl BELLEW, (Owner of B Aviation). She went on to say that \n     she did get rid of some of the documents but forgot exactly \n     what other parts she was told to destroy.''\n\n        3. Circumstances which raised suspicions about documents\n\n       Our inquiry disclosed no evidence that David HANLEY, \n     Division Manager, FAA GLR, or JONES, destroyed or withheld \n     documents in response to the FOIA request. Additionally, \n     HANLEY did not instruct JONES to destroy or withhold any \n     documents pertaining to the FOIA request. JONES and HANLEY \n     each provided sworn affidavits denying the allegations. \n     However, the inquiry disclosed that three sets of \n     circumstances involving the FAA's handling of documents \n     contributed to the basis for questions raised by BAXTER \n     concerning the response to the request.\n     a. The Bown memorandum\n       The first circumstances involves a misinterpretation of \n     instructions from JONES to BAXTER. On May 13, 1994, JONES \n     called BAXTER to advise she was sending the FOIA package to \n     him. During that conversation, JONES suggested to BAXTER that \n     HANLEY review the documents. JONES wanted the package of \n     documents reviewed because it contained an unedited draft \n     memorandum of a meeting between Richard BOWN, Operations Unit \n     Supervisor, Rapid City FSDO, and William DICKSON, Regional \n     Aviation Officer, United States Forest Service (USFS), \n     Lakewood, Colorado. At the time of its original preparation, \n     in December 1993, two paragraphs from the draft version were \n\n[[Page S 14153]]\n     edited out before the memorandum was finalized. This editing was done \n     at the direction of HANLEY because he viewed these paragraphs \n     as containing BOWN's opinions. OIG's review of the draft \n     memorandum disclosed that BOWN's opinion supported the \n     consolidation of inspections. The final version of the \n     memorandum was sent to Senator DASCHLE's staff by BOWN at the \n     request of Senator DASCHLE. Because the draft memorandum \n     differed from the final version, JONES was unsure whether \n     the release of the document under the FOIA request was \n     appropriate and wanted HANLEY to review the document.\n       Our inquiry disclosed JONES affixed a yellow post-it note \n     to the package of documents which indicated HANLEY needed to \n     review the package containing the draft memorandum described \n     above. Despite written and verbal requests from JONES to \n     BAXTER for HANLEY to review the documents, BAXTER did not \n     follow through on JONES' request and HANLEY never saw the \n     documents. The FOIA response was signed out by [deleted] \n     Flight Standards Division, FAA GLR, for HANLEY on July 14, \n     1994.\n     b. The package of Forest Service documents\n       The second circumstance which contributed to BAXTER's \n     suspicion involves a package of 61 pages of USFS documents \n     pertaining to B, which were received by BAXTER from JONES \n     in response to a subsequent B FOIA request in December \n     1994. During an interview, BAXTER told the OIG these \n     documents raised concern on his part because he did not \n     receive them from JONES during his processing of the earlier \n     MALONEY request and because one document in particular was \n     titled ``Response to DASCHLE Squeeze.''\n       We have reviewed the documents in question. They contain \n     information pertaining to USFS inspections which were \n     critical of B, and USFS opinions of the FAA which were also \n     critical. The documents also detail efforts by Senator \n     DASCHLE's office to have the USFS relinquish its inspection \n     authority. However, our investigation disclosed that at the \n     time the FAA responded to the MALONEY FOIA request in July \n     1994, the FAA was not in possession of these documents. The \n     FAA did not receive these documents until September 1994, \n     when they arrived in the Rapid City FSDO. The documents were \n     sent to Rapid City by an air safety investigator, National \n     Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). An interview of the NTSB \n     investigator disclosed that the documents received were from \n     an attorney (name unrecalled by the NTSB investigator). The \n     investigator told the OIG that since the accident \n     investigation of the B aircraft that crashed in February \n     1994, had been concluded, the documents were of no further \n     use and were forwarded to the Rapid City FSDO.\n     c. Documents withheld for further legal review\n       The third circumstance involves 28 pages that were \n     initially withheld in July 1994, under the MALONEY FOIA \n     request. These documents contained, among other things, \n     information relating to the FAA's interaction with Senator \n     DASCHLE's office and USFS inspections of B In November \n     1994, MALONEY inquired as to the disposition of the \n     documents. BAXTER became suspicious of the way these \n     documents were handled when he inquired with the Office of \n     Assistant Chief Counsel (OACC), GLR, and learned they had \n     misplaced the documents. Upon receipt of a second copy of the \n     documents from BAXTER, OACC eventually approved their \n     release.\n       In a cover letter sent with the initial release of \n     documents to MALONEY, dated July 14, 1994, the FAA GLR \n     indicated that they released 615 pages in response to the \n     FOIA request. They advised MALONEY that ``the Great Lakes \n     Assistant Chief Counsel is currently reviewing a small number \n     of pages. This office will respond to you regarding the \n     additional information as soon as it has been cleared.'' Our \n     interview with the GLR Assistant Chief Counsel's Office \n     disclosed they misplaced the documents in question, and, \n     therefore, forgot to review them. Our investigation disclosed \n     OACC never located their original copy of the pages but \n     obtained a second copy from BAXTER. Following a subsequent \n     written request by MALONEY in December 1994, these additional \n     pages were reviewed and released.\n\n                4. OIG's analysis of FAA's FOIA response\n\n       Our investigation disclosed that the FAA maintained no \n     record of the documents released nor did they maintain an \n     exact duplicate set of the documents produced in response to \n     the MALONEY FOIA request. Instead the investigation disclosed \n     the FAA lacked proper procedural guidelines in handling FOIA \n     requests as described below. As part of our inquiry, we \n     obtained from MALONEY a copy of all documents he received in \n     response to his FOIA request. We also obtained a copy of the \n     documents from the FAA, Office of Public Affairs (OPA), \n     for comparison purposes.\\4\\\n       The documents sent to OPA were prepared by [deleted] FAA, \n     GLR, on February 7, 1995. As part of that process, [deleted] \n     told the OIG [deleted] created a handwritten index of items \n     sent and withheld under the MALONEY FOIA request.\\5\\\n       The handwritten index reads as follows:\n\nItems sent to APA [sic]                                       616 Pages\n    1.

The items indicated on the index as ``Items not sent'' \n     were, in fact, sent to MALONEY in July 1994.\n       2. The ``Accident Prevention Counselor File'' identified as \n     Item (1) in the ``Items not sent'' section consisted of five \n     pages, not 23 as indicated. We determined this through \n     interviews and a review of the original file at GLR.\n       3. The ``Repair Station File'' identified as Item (4) in \n     the ``Items sent to APA'' section was, in fact, not sent to \n     MALONEY. The file consisted of the company manual and related \n     documents.\n       4. The ``Current 135 File'' identified as Item (6) in the \n     ``Items sent to APA'' section consisted of 275 pages. \n     However, MALONEY only received 124 pages. The 151 pages not \n     received were the ``B Aviation Company Manual.'' \\7\\\n       5. The ``Provided to RAP FSDO by USFS on 9-23-93'' group of \n     documents identified as Item (1) in the ``Items sent to APA'' \n     section consisted of 23 pages. MALONEY received only nine of \n     these pages. The remaining four pages, which were USFS \n     documents, were not sent.\n       In addition, we compared the pages withheld for legal \n     review by the OACC with the documents initially received by \n     MALONEY. The comparison disclosed that in the original \n     response to the FOIA request, MALONEY, in fact, received all \n     of the substantive documents. Therefore, MALONEY received the \n     documents twice, in July 1994, and December 1994. This \n     contradicts FAA GLR's assertion that the documents were \n     ``withheld'' by OACC.\n\n             5. Senator Daschle's interaction with the FAA\n\n       We examined the official activities of FAA personnel in \n     connection with B during the period 1985 to 1995, including \n     the issue of consolidating aviation inspections of air \n     charter companies. This examination also included a review of \n     documents provided by Senator Daschle's office in response to \n     our request. We also interviewed Senator Daschle and current \n     and former members of his staff. These investigative steps \n     were necessary in order to identify documents generated in \n     connection with Senator Daschle's interaction with the FAA \n     and thus identify the universe of documents which may have \n     been the subject of the alleged destruction.\n       The investigation disclosed three pertinent areas of \n     constituent service performed by Senator Daschle involving \n     B, during the period 1985 to 1995. In each case, Senator \n     Daschle's efforts were in response to complaints about \n     specific government aviation inspectors or inspection \n     processes. The most significant area involves the issue of \n     consolidating aviation inspections. Our examination of \n     documents provided by Senator Daschle's office disclosed no \n     documents which may have been the subject of destruction by \n     FAA employees.\n\n                             6. Conclusion\n\n       As stated above, our inquiry disclosed no evidence that \n     David Hanley, Division Manager, FAA, GLR, or Jones, destroyed \n     or withheld documents in response to the FOIA request. \n     Additionally, Hanley did not instruct Jones to destroy or \n     withhold any documents pertaining to the FOIA request. Jones \n     and Hanley each provided sworn affidavits denying the \n     allegations.\n       Our inquiry concluded that the FAA GLR's procedures for \n     processing FOIA requests were careless and haphazard at best. \n     The procedures followed by the GLR were vague and did not \n     require accountability for what documents were sent, or not \n     sent, to the requester. Because accountability records were \n     not maintained, the FAA was unable to provide an accurate \n     description of which documents had and had not been sent to \n     Maloney. The FAA GLR was unable to recreate the B FOIA file \n     as it existed at the time they responded to Maloney's \n     request. In addition, the FAA GLR did not follow proper \n     procedures by its failure to: (1) notify the requester in \n     writing that documents were withheld; (2) cite a FOIA \n     exemption which justifies the withholding of documents; and \n     (3) set forth the names and titles of each person responsible \n     for a denial of records.\n       A comparison of the records obtained by the OIG from OPA \n     with the records obtained from Maloney disclosed the FAA GLR \n     improperly withheld 200 pages of documents from Maloney. The \n     FAA failed to notify Maloney that documents were withheld \n     and, therefore, did not afford Maloney the opportunity to \n     appeal the withholding. Of the 200 pages, 151 pages were \n     composed of the ``B Aviation Company Manual'' and 45 pages \n     were B's ``Repair Station File'', which consists of the \n     repair station manual and related certifications. The \n     remaining four \n\n[[Page S 14154]]\n     pages were generated by the USFS and pertained to their inspections of \n     B The company manuals may be protected under exemption \n     four of the FOIA, which protects ``trade secrets and \n     commercial or financial information obtained from a person \n     and privileged or confidential'' information.\\8\\ No \n     explanation can be given for the withholding of the remaining \n     four pages.\n       Our inquiry disclosed that the cited deficiencies on the \n     part of the FAA GLR in processing FOIA requests reflect an \n     agency-wide lack of procedures in the FAA. Further evidence \n     of the agency's lack of procedural safeguards for the \n     processing of FOIA requests is included in a report, dated \n     July 28, 1994, prepared by the General Counsel of the \n     Department of Transportation and the FAA Deputy \n     Administrator, submitted to Secretary Federico Pena and \n     Administrator David Hinson, pertaining to the review of the \n     FAA's response to a FOIA request regarding the B757 wake \n     vortex. The report cited national problems including: a lack \n     of sufficient resources and attention on the FOIA function; \n     no restriction on who may be asked to process FOIA requests; \n     and, inadequate searches for documents. Due to the \n     inadequacies of the FAA in dealing with FOIA requests, the \n     report recommended the following: ``(1) The FAA Administrator \n     should give consideration to enhancing organizational \n     responsibility and accountability for FOIA responses. (2) The \n     Administrator should give serious consideration to \n     establishing an FOIA office within the FAA Office of Public \n     Affairs. (3) There appears to be a real need for FOIA \n     training that focuses on the procedural requirements of \n     the FOIA as well as the substantive exemptions.\\9\\''\n       Our inquiry disclosed that the FOIA request regarding the \n     B757 wake vortex was received by the FAA on December 27, \n     1993, and responded to on February 10, 1994, approximately \n     three months before the MALONEY FOIA request was received by \n     the FAA GLR. Additionally, our inquiry disclosed by the time \n     the report regarding the FAA's response to the B757 wake \n     vortex FOIA was issued on July 26, 1994, the FAA GLR had \n     already submitted its first response to MALONEY on July 14, \n     1994. Therefore, the corrective action suggested in the \n     report submitted by the General Counsel of the Department of \n     Transportation and the FAA Deputy Administrator was not in \n     place at the time the FAA was responding to the MALONEY \n     request.\n       On July 17, 1995, Administrator HINSON forwarded to the OIG \n     a summary of the FAA's ``FOIA Activities and Improvements,'' \n     for the period September 1994 through June 1995. \n     Administrator HINSON cited a number of agency-wide \n     improvements including: the establishment of a national FOIA \n     office in OPA; the development of a FOIA checklist; and the \n     installation of a new automated headquarters FOIA tracking \n     system.\n\n         B. The recusal of Linda DASCHLE, Deputy Administrator\n\n                              1. Synopsis\n\n       We investigated a number of issues concerning Deputy \n     Administrator DASCHLE's recusal from participating in certain \n     matters before the Department. The primary issue concerned \n     her selection of an FAA Aviation Safety Inspector (ASI) from \n     Rapid City, South Dakota, to temporarily serve on her \n     immediate staff. The ASI was directly involved in the \n     consolidation of inspection issue during 1993 and 1994, \n     including direct contacts with Senate DASCHLE's staff. The \n     ASI also has supervisory duties pertaining to FAA inspections \n     of B, and had personally met Senator DASCHLE. Other issues \n     concerned reports that Deputy Administrator DASCHLE and her \n     staff had discussions and contacts concerning the issue of \n     consolidated inspections. We also examined the failure of \n     Deputy Administrator DASCHLE to document her recusal until a \n     year after her appointment.\n       We concluded that Deputy Administrator DASCHLE did not \n     violate her recusal. We found that Deputy Administrator \n     DASCHLE refrained from discussing the consolidated inspection \n     issue or otherwise participating in the issue of consolidated \n     inspections. Deputy Administrator DASCHLE told the OIG that \n     she had been unaware of the ASI's involvement in the \n     consolidated inspection issue. She does not consider her \n     selection of the ASI to contradict her recusal but told the \n     OIG that had she known beforehand about the ASI's involvement \n     she would not have made the selection. We find her position \n     on this issue to be credible.\n       We confirmed that Deputy Administrator DASCHLE did not \n     discuss the consolidated inspection issue with a USDA \n     official who contacted her. We reviewed the federal \n     regulations governing such matters. We also consulted with \n     DOT and FAA ethics officials. We concluded that no \n     requirement existed that Deputy Administrator DASCHLE file a \n     written disqualification (i.e., recusal).\n\n                             2. Background\n\n       As part of our inquiry, we examined the recusal of Linda \n     DASCHLE from all FAA matters involving her husband. We \n     examined this issue based on the self-disclosure made by \n     Deputy Administrator DASCHLE to Inspector General A. Mary \n     SCHIAVO and Deputy Inspector General Mario A. LAURO, Jr. on \n     February 6, 1995. During that meeting, Deputy Administrator \n     DASCHLE advised of her selection of Richard BOWN for a \n     temporary detail as her special assistant in the Summer 1994. \n     A controversy arose concerning BOWN's selection to work on \n     Deputy Administrator DASCHLE's immediate staff because of his \n     previous involvement with the USFA on the consolidated \n     inspection issue. Deputy Administrator DASCHLE advised \n     Inspector General SCHIAVO and Deputy Inspector General LAURO \n     that during his detail to her immediate staff, BOWN had \n     documents in his possession in FAA headquarters relating to \n     the duplicate inspection issue which he offered to show her. \n     She refused to review them and informed BOWN of her \n     recusal.\\10\\\n\n      3. The selection of BOWN to the Deputy Administrator's staff\n\n       Our inquiry disclosed Deputy Administrator DASCHLE \n     attempted to personally call BOWN to invite him to a \n     breakfast meeting she was hosting in Sioux Falls, South \n     Dakota, on June 25, 1994. Deputy Administrator DASCHLE was \n     unable to reach BOWN and made the invitation through BOWN's \n     supervisor, who also attended. The meeting consisted of FAA \n     management employees from South Dakota. During this meeting, \n     Deputy Administrator DASCHLE and BOWN met face to face for \n     the first time. At the conclusion of the meeting, Deputy \n     Administrator DASCHLE related to BOWN that she was interested \n     in detailing a pilot/safety inspector to Washington for a \n     temporary period in order to enhance her goal of bringing \n     field experience to her staff.\n       Subsequent to this conversation, Deputy Administrator \n     DASCHLE and BOWN engaged in approximately one to two \n     telephone conversations during which she asked him to accept \n     a temporary detail as her special assistant, and defined to \n     BOWN what his responsibility would be. By August 1994, BOWN \n     had agreed to accept a 90 day detail to Washington D.C. BOWN, \n     a GS-14, was temporarily paid at the GS-15 level, which \n     according to Deputy Administrator DASCHLE is standard pay for \n     her special assistants.\n       Our interview of Deputy Administrator DASCHLE disclosed \n     that she did not contact JONES, BOWN's supervisor, about his \n     qualifications nor did she examine BOWN's personnel file for \n     information about his employment history. Deputy \n     Administrator DASCHLE indicated she selected BOWN for the \n     following reasons: 1) she was impressed by BOWN because of \n     his participation during the June 25, 1994, breakfast \n     meeting; and, (2) her husband's statements to her regarding \n     his knowledge of BOWN.\n       Deputy Administrator DASCHLE indicated BOWN was very vocal \n     during the breakfast meeting as he was very willing to speak \n     out candidly about his critical feelings involving FAA \n     leadership in headquarters. Regarding Senator DASCHLE's \n     comments about BOWN, Deputy Administrator DASCHLE stated her \n     husband related to her he knew BOWN through his (the \n     Senator's) involvement in the aviation community in South \n     Dakota.\\11\\ Deputy Administrator DASCHLE stated her husband \n     never specifically recommended or suggested she select BOWN \n     but only related he was impressed by BOWN and other employees \n     in the Rapid City FSDO. According to Deputy Administrator \n     DASCHLE, the Senator characterized the employees in that \n     office as ``good people.''\n       During our interview of the Senator, he stated he advised \n     Deputy Administrator DASCHLE that he had heard of BOWN. He \n     disclosed to us he has met BOWN on three or four occasions, \n     the first time occurring several years ago. Their contact has \n     been very limited, and he does not believe he would recognize \n     BOWN if he saw him. The Senator stated he did not connect \n     BOWN with the consolidated inspection issue and was not sure \n     at what point he knew of BOWN's involvement in the issue. The \n     Senator was ``almost positive'' Deputy Administrator DASCHLE \n     had no knowledge of BOWN's involvement.\n       [deleted] Assistant to Senator DASCHLE, told the OIG that \n     [deleted] never discussed BOWN'S involvement in the \n     consolidated inspection issue with Deputy Administrator \n     DASCHLE. [deleted] communicated with BOWN several times each \n     week while working on the issue, but [deleted] never \n     suggested to Senator DASCHLE that BOWN be rewarded for his \n     efforts. [deleted] did not know how BOWN was selected for the \n     temporary position with Deputy Administrator DASCHLE, and \n     [deleted] stated that [deleted] did not communicate with BOWN \n     on the consolidated inspection issue while BOWN was assigned \n     to Deputy Administrator DASCHLE's staff. [deleted] was aware \n     of Deputy Administrator DASCHLE's recusal policy.\n       Deputy Administrator DASCHLE stated she did not become \n     aware of BOWN's involvement with her husband in the \n     consolidated inspection issue until September 1994, when BOWN \n     arrived in Washington. She and Senator DASCHLE each told the \n     OIG they never discussed BOWN's involvement in the \n     consolidated inspection issue. In fact, Deputy Administrator \n     DASCHLE stated she did not become aware of her husband's \n     involvement in the issue until the Spring 1994, when she \n     received a telephone call from James R. LYONS, Assistant \n     Secretary, Natural Resources and Environment, USDA, \n     soliciting her involvement in the consolidated inspection \n     matter. Deputy Administrator DASCHLE stated that when \n     informed during the telephone call of her husband's \n     interest in the issue, she immediately informed LYONS of \n     her recusal and terminated the conversation. We confirmed \n     this with LYONS.\n       When BOWN began his detail in September of 1994, he advised \n     Deputy Administrator \n\n[[Page S 14155]]\n     DASCHLE he had brought with him a package of USFS documents relating to \n     B\\12\\ Many of these documents made reference to Senator \n     DASCHLE and his involvement in the duplicate inspection \n     issue. Deputy Administrator DASCHLE stated BOWN never showed \n     her the documents but just wanted her to be aware that he had \n     them. Due to the nature of the documents, Deputy \n     Administrator DASCHLE advised BOWN he should not have the \n     documents in the office due to her recusal from matters \n     involving her husband. The Senator stated Deputy \n     Administrator DASCHLE advised him of the incident involving \n     the documents.\n\n               4. Deputy Administrator DASCHLE's recusal\n\n       The applicable regulations governing recusals is found at 5 \n     CFR Part 2635, Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of \n     the Executive Branch. Specifically, Subpart E, ``Impartiality \n     in Performing Official Duties,'' Section 2835.502 states, in \n     part: ``Where an employee knows that a particular matter \n     involving specific parties in likely to have a direct and \n     predictable effect on the financial interest of a member of \n     his household, or knows that a person with whom he has a \n     covered relationship is or represents a party to such matter, \n     and where the employee determines that the circumstances \n     would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the \n     relevant facts to question his impartiality in the matter, \n     the employee should not participate in the matter. . .''\n       In addition to the regulation, [deleted] General Law \n     Branch, FAA, advised the OIG that the FAA follows an \n     unwritten policy that an employee must recuse himself or \n     herself from all matters, not just financial matters, with \n     which he or she has a conflict of interest.\n       Deputy Administrator DASCHLE stated that from the outset of \n     her appointment in November 1993, she recused herself from \n     all matters with which her husband has a specific interest. \n     Our inquiry disclosed Deputy Administrator DASCHLE did not \n     officially circulate anything in writing to her staff \n     regarding her recusal although she indicated she verbally \n     advised her staff of her recusal. Senator DASCHLE and Deputy \n     Administrator DASCHLE told the OIG that her recusal policy \n     does not prevent her from generally knowing about certain \n     issues such as the consolidated inspection matter, but from \n     acting on them. We confirmed this with the Department's \n     ethics attorney.\n       In her first memorandum memorializing her recusal, dated \n     November 18, 1994, (one year after her appointment) Deputy \n     Administrator DASCHLE stated, in part, ``As you are aware, \n     upon assuming the position of Deputy Administrator, I recused \n     myself from participation in all DOT/FAA matters in which my \n     husband, Senator Thomas Daschle, has had a role.'' Then, on \n     advice of FAA Counsel, she revised her recusal due to the \n     election of her husband to Senate Minority Leader. Her \n     revised recusal, dated January 19, 1995, states, in part, \n     ``Because my husband represents the State of South Dakota in \n     the United States Senate, I have disqualified myself from \n     participating in any [emphasis added] particular matter that \n     would have a direct and predictable effect on that State. . \n     .''\n       Deputy Administrator DASCHLE maintained she had no \n     conversations with her staff members regarding the \n     consolidated inspection issue nor did she discuss the issue \n     during the June 1994, breakfast meeting she attended in Sioux \n     Falls. However, during one interview of an FAA official, it \n     was alleged to the OIG that [deleted] FAA, had conversations \n     with Deputy Administrator DASCHLE about the consolidated \n     inspection issue. Allegedly, [deleted] received a directive \n     from Deputy Administrator DASCHLE to settle the USFS matter \n     and subsequently conveyed this to a senior staff member. In a \n     sworn statement, [deleted] indicated, ``. . . I have made \n     statements on DASCHLE wanting issues resolved. In such cases, \n     I was making reference to Senator Tom DASCHLE.''\n\n                5. Deputy Administrator DASCHLE and B\n\n       Deputy Administrator DASCHLE told the OIG she has taken \n     flights on B aircraft since her appointment as Deputy \n     Administrator. According to Deputy Administrator DASCHLE, \n     these flights were with her husband on his official business \n     and were either paid for out of personal funds or campaign \n     funds. Deputy Administrator DASCHLE has not utilized B \n     aircraft in her capacity as Deputy Administrator.\n       Deputy Administrator DASCHLE and BELLEW have known each \n     other for approximately 14 years. She met BELLEW in 1981 \n     while she was working for the Civil Aeronautics Board. Deputy \n     Administrator DASCHLE stated she has never intervened on \n     behalf of B in any FAA matter and, further, was never \n     approached by BELLEW in an attempt to solicit her \n     intervention. In addition, no documentation was discovered \n     which suggested that Deputy Administrator DASCHLE intervened \n     with respect to the consolidated inspection issue or with \n     regard to B\n       An additional allegation was raised during our inquiry that \n     Deputy Administrator DASCHLE dispatched an accident \n     investigation team from Washington D.C. to investigate the \n     crash of a B aircraft that occurred on February 24, 1994. \n     The dispatch of a headquarters team deviates from standard \n     practice of local investigative teams conducting crash \n     investigations in their immediate area. The allegation was \n     not substantiated. Deputy Administrator DASCHLE and Senator \n     DASCHLE both deny any involvement in sending an accident \n     investigation team from FAA headquarters. An interview of an \n     FAA official involved in the accident investigation disclosed \n     that certain characteristics of the flight, the operator, and \n     of those individuals killed in the crash prompted the FAA \n     headquarters Accident Investigation Division's involvement.\n\n\n                          VI. Recommendations\n\n       1. This investigation disclosed no evidence to substantiate \n     that documents were destroyed as alleged. Nor did this \n     investigation disclose evidence to substantiate that Deputy \n     Administrator DASCHLE violated her recusal. Accordingly, it \n     is recommended that this investigation be closed.\n       2. This investigation disclosed that at the time of the \n     subject FOIA request, FAA lacked sufficient internal \n     procedures and safeguards concerning the processing of FOIA \n     requests. The investigation disclosed improvements have since \n     been made in response to recommendations from a previous \n     Departmental review. It is recommended that FAA Administrator \n     HINSON continue to monitor the FAA's FOIA activities and \n     improvements. In addition, the OIG will include in its FY \n     1997 annual planning, a Department-wide review of FOIA \n     procedures.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ In April 1995, press reports indicated the USFS no longer \n     contracts with B OIG confirmed with the USFS that all \n     approvals of B have expired and a decision was made not to \n     renew approvals at this time.\n     \\2\\ The GLR received five FOIA requests pertaining to B\n     \\3\\ BAXTER informed JONES that the national database \n     information would be obtained from the FAA, Mike Monroney \n     Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\n     \\4\\ On February 7, 1995, as a result of media interest in the \n     case, the OPA requested from GLR a copy of all documents sent \n     to MALONEY.\n     \\5\\ The index, created months after the fact, is the only \n     record we found which itemizes, in any way, the FAA's \n     response to the MALONEY FOIA request.\n     \\6\\ A review of the documents within each group disclosed \n     that each index category was labeled according to the top \n     document in that grouping and, according to [deleted] does \n     not mean that all documents in that group are appropriately \n     described. For example, Item 2 in ``Items sent to APA'' \n     reflects 89 pages of a letter from Senator DASCHLE. The \n     letter was actually one page. The other documents in this \n     group were unrelated to this letter.\n     \\7\\ The FAA did not create a record or otherwise justify \n     withholding these documents or any other documents under a \n     FOIA exemption in reference to the MALONEY request. The FOIA \n     regulations require that the requester be notified of his \n     right ``to appeal to the head of the agency any adverse \n     determination.'' The regulations further state that ``any \n     notification of denial of any request for records . . . shall \n     set forth the names and titles or positions of each person \n     responsible for the denial of such request.''\n     \\8\\ Reference The Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C., \n     Section 552(b)(4).\n     \\9\\ See ``Boeing 757 Wake Turbulence, A Review of the Actions \n     of the Federal Aviation Administration'' for more detailed \n     information. The report also suggested preparing a FOIA \n     Processing Checklist that could be attached to each FOIA \n     request. Our inquiry disclosed that this recommendation has \n     been implemented in the GLR.\n     \\10\\ These documents are the same documents discussed in \n     Section V(A)(3)(b) of this report, ``Circumstances Which \n     Raised Suspicions about Documents.''\n     \\11\\ Senator Tom DASCHLE is an FAA-certified pilot.\n     \\12\\ During an interview of BOWN, he indicated he received \n     the package of documents from an inspector in the Rapid City \n     FSDO shortly after beginning his detail in Washington.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I have a footnote to these remarks. I have \nknown Tom and Linda Daschle for a good many years now. In the position \nthat Senator Daschle is in as leader of the Democratic minority here in \nthe Senate, one of the attributes that Senator Daschle has is that he \nis straightforward, that he is honest, and he is of great character.\n  I have known his wife, Linda, now for a good many years, having dealt \nwith her and the association she represented and now as Deputy Director \nof FAA. I do not think anyone that has known her would doubt her \ncharacter. Being the daughter of a Baptist minister, the training that \nshe received in her early years is still with her today.\n  Those who know them well believe that the allegations were not true, \nand I think our belief in this couple was vindicated by the report from \nthe Inspector General of the Department of Transportation.\n  Mr. President, I felt it was incumbent upon me as a friend and as a \npart of this side of the aisle that these remarks be made for the \nrecord and the vindication of our good friends be noted in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/25/senate-section/article/S14151-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S 14156]]\n\n\n                  MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--S. 1254\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, the skyrocketing Federal debt, now soaring \ntoward $5 trillion, has been fueled for a generation now by \nbureaucratic hot air--and it is sort of like the weather--everybody \ntalks about it but almost nobody did much about it until immediately \nafter the elections in November 1994.\n  But when the new 104th Congress convened this past January, the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives quickly approved a balanced budget amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution. On the Senate side, all but 1 of the 54 \nRepublicans supported the balanced budget amendment--that was the good \nnews.\n  The bad news was that only 13 Democrats supported it--which killed \nhopes for a balanced budget amendment for the time being. Since a two-\nthirds vote--67 Senators, if all Senator's are present--is necessary to \napprove a constitutional amendment, the proposed Senate amendment \nfailed by one vote. There will be another vote either this year or in \n1996.\n  Here is today's bad debt boxscore:\n  As of the close of business Friday, September 22, the Federal debt--\ndown to the penny--stood at exactly $4,949,192,404,249.15 or $18,787.22 \nfor every man, woman, and child on a per capita basis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/25/senate-section/article/S14156-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens).

DEMONSTRATION AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) On and after October 1, 1995, the Secretary of Housing \n     and Urban Development shall carry out a demonstration program \n     with respect to multifamily projects whose mortgages are \n     insured under the National Housing Act and that are assisted \n     under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 and \n     whose present section 8 rents are, in the aggregate, in \n     excess of 110 percent of the fair market rent of the locality \n     in which the project is located, including projects whose \n     section 8 contracts expire on or after October 1, 1996. These \n     programs shall be designed to test the feasibility and \n     desirability of the goal of ensuring, to the maximum extent \n     practicable, that the debt service and operating expenses, \n     including adequate reserves, attributable to such multifamily \n     projects whose mortgages are insured under the National \n     Housing Act and that are assisted under section 8 of the \n     United States Housing Act of 1937 and whose present section 8 \n     contract rents are in excess of the fair market rent of the \n     locality in which the project is located can be supported \n     with and without mortgage insurance under the National \n     Housing Act and with and without above-market rents and \n     utilizing project based assistance or, with the consent of \n     the property owner and the residents, tenant based \n     assistance, while taking into account the need for assistance \n     of low and very low income families in such projects. In \n     carrying out this demonstration, the Secretary may use \n     arrangements with third parties, under which the Secretary \n     may provide for the assumption by the third parties (by \n     delegation, contract, or otherwise) of some or all of the \n     functions, obligations, and benefits of the Secretary.\n       (1) Goals.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \n     shall carry out the demonstration programs under this section \n     in a manner that--\n       (A) will protect the financial interests of the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) will result in significant discretionary cost savings \n     through debt restructuring and subsidy reduction; and\n       (C) will, in the least costly fashion, address the goals \n     of--\n       (i) maintaining existing housing stock in a decent, safe, \n     and sanitary condition;\n       (ii) minimizing the involuntary displacement of tenants;\n       (iii) restructuring the mortgages of such projects in a \n     manner that is consistent with local housing market \n     conditions;\n       (iv) supporting fair housing strategies;\n       (v) minimizing any adverse income tax impact on property \n     owners; and\n       (vi) minimizing any adverse impact on residential \n     neighborhoods.\n     In determining the manner in which a mortgage is to be \n     restructured or the subsidy reduced, the Secretary may \n     balance competing goals relating to individual projects in a \n     manner that will further the purposes of this section.\n       (2) Demonstration approaches.--In carrying out the \n     demonstration programs, the Secretary may use one or more of \n     the following approaches:\n       (A) Joint venture arrangements with third parties, under \n     which the Secretary may provide for the assumption by the \n     third parties (by delegation, contract, or otherwise) of some \n     or all of the functions, obligations, and benefits of the \n     Secretary.\n       (B) Subsidization of the debt service of the project to a \n     level that can be paid by an owner receiving an unsubsidized \n     market rent.\n       (C) Renewal of existing project-based assistance contracts \n     where the Secretary shall approve proposed initial rent \n     levels that do not exceed the greater of 120 percent of fair \n     market rents or comparable market rents for the relevant \n     metropolitan market area or at rent levels under a budget-\n     based approach.\n       (D) Nonrenewal of expiring existing project-based \n     assistance contracts and providing tenant-based assistance to \n     previously assisted households.\n       (b) For purposes of carrying out demonstration programs \n     under subsection (a)--\n       (1) the Secretary may manage and dispose of multifamily \n     properties owned by the Secretary as of October 1, 1995 and \n     multifamily mortgages held by the Secretary as of October 1, \n     1995 for properties assisted under section 8 with rents above \n     110 percent of fair market rents without regard to any other \n     provision of law; and\n       (2) the Secretary may delegate to one or more entities the \n     authority to carry out some or all of the functions and \n     responsibilities of the Secretary in connection with the \n     foreclosure of mortgages held by the Secretary under the \n     National Housing Act.\n       (c) For purposes of carrying out demonstration programs \n     under subsection (a), subject to such third party consents \n     (if any) as are necessary including but not limited to (i) \n     consent by the Government National Mortgage Association where \n     it owns a mortgage insured by the Secretary; (ii) consent by \n     an issuer under the mortgage-backed securities program of the \n     Association, subject to the responsibilities of the issuer to \n     its security holders and the Association under such program; \n     and (iii) parties to any contractual agreement which the \n     Secretary proposes to modify or discontinue, the Secretary or \n     one or more third parties designated by the Secretary may \n     take the following actions:\n       (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Secretary or third party may remove, relinquish, extinguish, \n     modify, or agree to the removal of any mortgage, regulatory \n     agreement, project-based assistance contract, use agreement, \n     or restriction that had been imposed or required by the \n     Secretary, including restrictions on distributions of income \n     which the Secretary or third party determines would interfere \n     with the ability of the project to operate without above \n     market rents. The Secretary or third party may require an \n     owner of a property assisted under the section 8 new \n     construction/substantial rehabilitation program to apply any \n     accumulated residual receipts toward effecting the purposes \n     of this section.\n       (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may enter into \n     contracts to purchase reinsurance, or enter into \n     participations or otherwise transfer economic interest in \n     contracts of insurance or in the premiums paid, or due to be \n     paid, on such insurance to third parties, on such terms and \n     conditions as the Secretary may determine.\n       (3) The Secretary may offer project-based assistance with \n     rents at or below fair market rents for the locality in which \n     the project is located and may negotiate such other terms as \n     are acceptable to the Secretary and the project owner.\n       (4) If, after reducing rents as provided in subsection (3) \n     hereof, the project would be unable to pay full operating \n     costs (including normal operating expenses, reasonable \n     reserves, full debt service, and reasonable allowances for \n     vacancy losses and debt service coverage/owner return), the \n     Secretary may offer to pay all or a portion of the project's \n     debt service, and shall restrict the portion of debt service, \n     if any, to be paid by the project to the amount consistent \n     with payment of such full operating costs. The Secretary may \n     offer to make such payments monthly from the appropriate \n     Insurance Fund, for the full remaining term of the insured \n     mortgage.\n       (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Secretary may forgive and cancel any FHA-insured mortgage \n     debt that a demonstration program property cannot carry at \n     market rents while bearing full operating costs.\n       (6) For demonstration program properties that cannot carry \n     full operating costs (excluding debt service) at market \n     rents, the Secretary shall approve project-based rents \n     sufficient to carry such full operating costs and shall offer \n     to pay the full debt service in the manner provided in \n     section 216(c)(4) hereof.\n       (d) Selection.--The Secretary shall select multifamily \n     projects whose mortgages are insured that are from different \n     geographic areas of the nation, from States and localities of \n     varying sizes, of different occupancy profiles by income, \n     race, and age, of different financial and physical \n     conditions, and other factors as determined by the Secretary.\n       (e) Community and Tenant Input.--In carrying out this \n     section, the Secretary shall develop procedures to obtain \n     appropriate and timely input from officials of the unit of \n     general local government affected, the community in which the \n     project is situated, and the tenant of the project.\n       (f) Limitation on Demonstration Authority.--The Secretary \n     may carry out demonstration programs under this section with \n     respect to mortgages not to exceed 30,000 units over fiscal \n     years 1996 and 1997: Provided, That not less than fifty \n     percent of the units participating in the demonstration shall \n     be in projects that are assisted under section 8 new \n     construction/substantial rehabilitation contracts which \n     expire after September 30, 1997.

The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  The Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development \nand independent agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 1996 \nembodies a comprehensive and systematic restructuring of Federal \nprograms and activities within its jurisdiction.\n  Critical activities are refocused and supported.\n  Reforms to begin the difficult process of restoring fiscal reality \nand improving efficiency are initiated.\n  Over $1 billion of obsolete and failed activities are terminated.\n  The proliferation of small, burdensome, categorical programs is \ncleared away and delegated in block grants to States and local \ngovernments.\n  Unsustainable policy mandates are repealed.\n  Now, Mr. President, there is no longer any dispute over the critical \nneed to reduce excessive Federal spending and to bring the budget back \ninto balance. It has been nearly 30 years since the Federal Government \ncurbed its appetite for spending to match its income. Since that time, \nFederal outlays have increased from $184 billion to nearly $1.6 \ntrillion. The gross Federal debt has soared from less than $370 billion \nto nearly $5 trillion. Interest on the Federal debt now exceeds the \n$260 billion annual expenditure for all domestic discretionary programs \nby over $100 billion.\n  Unless these alarming budgetary trends are reversed, resources \navailable for discretionary programs such as those funded in this \nappropriations bill will soon shrink to negligible levels. The \ncommittee accepts measured reductions in discretionary spending as a \nnecessary component of the multiyear budgetary plan to balance the \nFederal budget by the year 2002, if only because the consequences of \nfailing to make such prudent reductions will be devastating, not only \nfor ourselves, but our children, and their children. In addition, a \nbalanced Federal budget will fuel new vitality in our Nation's economy \nwhich will provide the revenue necessary to sustain the priority \nprograms which we propose to continue.\n  The artificial stimulus of runaway deficit spending has failed. It is \ncollapsing under the weight of a massive Federal debt, and is being \ncrowded out by the pressure to meet interest payments on the debt and \nother mandatory costs. The bitter medicine of the congressional budget \nresolution is the only antidote to this poisoning of our Nation's \neconomic health. If we stay the course, and cure our addiction to \ndeficit spending, we have our best chance of sustaining the truly \ncritical programs included in this appropriations bill.\n  Finally, the budget crisis has created a rare opportunity to address \nlong-festering problems and reexamining long-entrenched social dogma \nunderpinning many failed governmental programs.\n  Welfare reform, in part, is being implemented in the restructuring of \nlow-income housing assistance programs funded in this appropriations \nbill. The 1960's era strategy of building high-rise public housing for \nfamilies has failed. There is broad acceptance that these drug-\ninfested, crime-breeding blights must be demolished. This bill provides \na targeted focus on such efforts, but it also examines the root causes \nof such horrendously expensive failures and recommends comprehensive \nreform proposals to prevent such conditions from reoccurring, including \nefforts to encourage employment by recipients.\n  The committee recommendation provides for the termination or \nconsolidation of scores of duplicative, wasteful or otherwise \nunnecessary programs and activities. The bill terminates five \nagencies--the Corporation for National and Community Service, \nAmeriCorps, the Office of Consumer Affairs, the Chemical Safety and \nHazard Board, the Community Development Financial Institutions Board, \nand the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, whose functions \nare transferred to the Secretary of the Treasury. In addition, the bill \nreflects the previously mandated termination of the Resolution Trust \nCorporation.\n  Another aspect of this bill is the assessment of the value of \nservices provided by agencies, such as the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. In some cases, existing delivery schemes and organizational \nstructures have been found deficient. For example, while most veterans \nmedical facilities deliver top quality health services, many instances \nof systemic inefficiencies and a number of cases of substandard care \nhave been painfully documented.\n  The committee is recommending accelerated adoption of modern medical \npractices for health care delivery in the VA system. In addition, the \ncommittee has targeted budgetary reductions in the Washington, DC, \nheadquarters bureaucracy which impede, rather than facilitate, \ninnovation and initiative at the local hospital and clinic level.\n  Mr. President, in the short time since I have assumed the \nchairmanship of this subcommittee, I have appealed and appealed again \nto the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for his help and assistance. \nDuring consideration of the budget resolution, I expressed my concern \n\n[[Page S 14177]]\nover the potential impact of discretionary budget reductions on the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and I specifically requested the advice \nand recommendations of the Secretary on how we could minimize the \nadverse effects of the constrained resources.\n  I wrote to the Secretary again after the House passed its \nappropriations bill in July and again in August. In each instance, the \nSecretary has not only failed to be responsive but has embarked instead \non an concerted campaign to whip up opposition by veterans \norganizations and members of his own Department against any reforms or \nchanges or improvements in the way the Department does business.\n  We can admire the Secretary for his tenacious advocacy of veterans \nservice and benefits, but as the chief administrator of a $37 billion \nagency, he must also accept responsibility for working with the rest of \nthe administration and the Congress in improving management of his \nDepartment to meet the challenges of a declining discretionary Federal \nbudget.\n  Despite the $9 billion overall reduction in the bill for \ndiscretionary appropriations, we are recommending an increase of $235 \nmillion for VA medical care. In a few instances, the committee was able \nto recommend modest increases in other VA accounts over the levels \ncontained in the House-passed bill, such as $5 million for medical \nresearch and $59 million to accelerate veterans claims processing. \nThere should be no doubt our goal is to improve services and benefits \nfor our Nation's veterans. What is more important, during these times \nof budgetary constraint, our goal can be accomplished with overall \nreductions in the rate of increase of funding for the Department if we \ninsist that the VA modernize its operations and reduce administrative \noverhead.\n  With the cooperation and help of the veterans, their service \norganizations and the Secretary, we could achieve this goal that we all \nshare.\n  Mr. President, the committee has also seized this opportunity to \nprobe deeply into the structure and management of the Environmental \nProtection Agency. The critical mission served by the EPA requires \nsubstantial direct funding and, through its regulatory authorities, \nimposes a tremendous financial burden on the economy and on all \nAmericans.\n  The committee has recommended a new focus in the agency on improving \nthe quality of the scientific basis for its regulatory decisionmaking.\n  In addition, the committee reviewed the internal resource allocation \nmanagement structure of EPA and is recommending a number of \nimprovements to assure better cooperation with other levels of \nGovernment and to focus Federal expenditures on activities of greater \nenvironmental benefit.\n  The amount provided for EPA is $5.66 billion. While this represents a \nreduction of about $1 billion below the fiscal year 1995 level, it is \nan increase of $769 million, 16 percent over the House.\n  The cuts below last year come primarily from Superfund and sewer \ntreatment earmarks. As to Superfund, it is my strong view that there is \nno need to throw more money at a program which does not work and which \nbadly needs to be reauthorized, revamped, and modernized. There is \noverwhelming documentation of how lawyers and other administrative cost \nburdens are milking the lion's share of these funds. This allocation of \nresources serves neither the environment nor the taxpayers, nor those \nwho are being assessed charges for these activities.\n  While the authorizing committee is preparing reform legislation, we \npropose a moratorium on low-priority Superfund work.\n  Last year's bill also included about $800 million in sewer \nconstruction earmarks for specific cities. All of that is eliminated in \nthis year's bill. By eliminating these earmarks, the committee was able \nto increase to $1.5 billion the appropriation for the State revolving \nfunds which are distributed on an equitable formula basis to finance \nwastewater treatment facilities across the Nation. This is a 21 percent \nincrease in a critical form of assistance to States and localities in \nmeeting Federal clean water mandates and safe drinking water mandates \nif the measure is authorized.\n  The recommendation provides close to current funding levels for EPA's \ncore operating programs--research, standard setting, technical \nassistance activities--while eliminating programs which are not crucial \nto the agency's core mission or which duplicate private sector or other \nagencies or State activities.\n  The committee recommends providing full funding to the States for \ntheir critical environmental programs which they run. More than 40 \npercent of the appropriations, $2.34 billion, goes directly to the \nStates for grants to meet environmental mandates. This is an increase \nof $310 million over last year, and by providing those funds in a \nseparate account for the first time, we can be sure that EPA will not \nbe dipping into State funds to fund its own activities.\n  A great deal of attention has been focused on the so-called \nlegislative riders included in the House-passed bill. Although House \nfloor action concerned 17 of these provisions, the House bill, as it \nwas finally passed, contained a total of 23 of these riders.\n  As cochairman of the regulatory reform task force, as a member of the \nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee, I am well aware of the \nneed to restructure and redirect many of the regulatory policies of \nEPA. Furthermore, many of us are concerned over how current \nenvironmental statutes have been broadly interpreted, indeed in some \ninstances we could say misinterpreted, by some courts to mandate \nactions never contemplated by the Congress.\n  I have been working, in those capacities in which I serve, to seek \nthe fundamental changes in our environmental laws which are long \noverdue and necessary to reduce regulatory burdens while protecting our \ncitizens and the environment and ensuring that the vitally important \nwork of improving the environment continues and that we not step \nbackward. These are, however, very complex issues which demand close \nexamination and careful consideration. That is why in formulating our \nrecommendations, rather than using the House bill as a base, we did an \nindependent assessment of those issues that could and should be \naddressed in this appropriations bill.\n  In drafting this bill, we set forth the standard that we would limit \nthe so-called ``riders,'' administrative provisions or legislative \nprovisions, as they might be called, to matters which have previously \nbeen enacted into law in appropriations acts, or passed the Senate in \nother current legislation, are needed to eliminate duplication or \nunnecessary spending, or were narrowly drafted to meet a specific \nmisapplication of law or policy.\n  Only one of the 23 House riders met this test: A limitation against \nEPA mandated car pooling. Two were modified to limit their application \nor clarify their intent--car inspection and maintenance and wetlands \noverfiling by EPA--and two others relating to drinking water were \ncombined. The rest have been stricken.\n  The committee is recommending three additional provisions: One \nrelating to MTBE use in Alaska, foreign refineries, and Superfund \nlistings, all of which have been previously enacted. These are eight \nprovisions that the committee believes are appropriate and necessary to \nwarrant consideration. A list of these provisions are included in the \nagency summary attached to my statement.\n  Mr. President, one aspect of this bill which deserves special \nattention, however, is the committee's recommendations for the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development.\n  The committee's report contains an extensive analysis of the \nmanagement and budgetary morass afflicting this Department along with \nan explanation of our proposed reforms. The committee's recommendations \nreflect many months of work on a focused and detailed examination of \nHUD and its housing programs. Beginning with a series of special \nhearings in January, and drawing upon the previous work of the HUD \ninspector general, the General Accounting Office, and the National \nAcademy of Public Administration, the committee probed deeply into \nthese complex issues. The committee's preliminary recommendations were \nreflected in the rescission bill enacted earlier this year which cut \nHUD funding by $6.3 billion and redirected housing budgetary resources \ntowards the \n\n[[Page S 14178]]\nmore critical concerns of demolishing failed and obsolete projects.\n  At that time the committee urged prompt action by the authorizing \ncommittees on urgently needed legislative reforms. These statutory \nchanges are needed to curb the cost of these discretionary programs. \nUnfortunately, since this legislation has not yet moved, we have been \ncompelled to include these reforms in the appropriations bill, because \nwithout these changes, the funds we appropriated would be wasted in \nperpetuating many of the inefficient, ineffective, counter-productive \npolicies which created this mess in the first place. Our only \nalternative would have been to terminate funding, which would result in \nthe displacement of thousands of families which depend on this \nassistance, and loss of desperately needed affordable housing \nopportunities.\n  Mr. President, that is the crux of the issues confronting us. We \neither take on this enormous task, not only of finding the substantial \nbudgetary resources necessary to sustain these programs, but also of \nrestructuring a host of very complex housing laws and programs, or, \nabdicate our responsibilities for providing housing assistance to needy \nfamilies. We chose the more difficult and burdensome course.\n  Reforming these housing programs will take time, it will take \ndiscipline, it will take concerted effort, and it will entail \nsacrifice. If we fail, the consequences for families currently \nreceiving or seeking assistance could be catastrophic, especially if we \npermit the current inventory of public and assisted housing stock to \ndeteriorate further. The repercussions for our cities will be equally \ndire if these housing developments, rather than slowing or halting the \ndecline of inner-city neighborhoods, merely become examples of further \ndisinvestment.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that this bill does stand for a \ncommitment to the important goals of the Federal assisted housing \nprogram. It not only provides the funding necessary, but together with \nneeded program reforms, it represents a coherent strategy for cleaning \nup the mess at HUD, and enabling us to place these programs on a sound \nfooting to survive the further rounds of budget cuts which will follow \nover the next several years.\n  During Committee markup of this bill, concern was expressed over the \npotential cost of the legislative provisions associated with the HUD \nmulti-family inventory. The three provisions in question were proposed \nto reduce the ongoing subsidy cost of maintaining these 1.6 million \nunits of privately owned apartments which are covered by an assistance \ncontract or by a FHA mortgage guarantee. The first would permit HUD to \nconduct a limited demonstration of its mark-to-market initiative along \nwith other multi-family project workout strategies. The second provides \nauthority to maintain project-based assistance for expiring contracts \nunder limited circumstances. The third reforms the Low-Income Housing \nPreservation and Resident Homeownership Act [LIHPRHA] by replacing \nexpensive section 8 subsidies with one-time capital grants and loans as \na lower cost incentive to preserve existing affordable housing stock.\n  The HUD multifamily portfolio costs taxpayers about $8 billion each \nyear to subsidize, maintain, and pay-off loan losses, and these costs \nare rising because of inflationary factors and deterioration in this \naging inventory of apartment buildings. The administrative provisions \nproposed by the committee are intended to enable HUD to reduce these \ncosts by terminating subsidies for substandard or non-viable projects, \nand to squeeze out excessive subsidies from others. While these steps \nare necessary to substantially reduce the long-term cost of this \ninventory, when compared to the existing budgetary baseline, the \nmeasures recommended would cause a temporary increase in outlays. These \ncosts in fiscal year 1996 result from recognition of mortgage guarantee \nlosses, capital costs of preserving older assisted projects, and \nproviding alternative subsidies to replace more costly section 8 \ncontracts.\n  Unfortunately these costs cannot be accommodated within the \nsubcommittee's very constrained budget allocation, even though they \nsave money over the longer term.\n  I might add that we have worked with the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development, Office of Management Budget and Congressional Budget \nOffice, and staffs on both sides of the aisle, to come to agreement on \nthese very difficult problems. We have found that the solution to these \nproblems is in no way simple and its complexities has forced us to \npostpone the implementation of these actions. We hope to continue to \nwork with the Members on both sides, as well as the agency, OMB, and \nCBO, as we seek to unravel some very, very difficult problems which are \nfacing us here.\n  The Committee, therefore, was forced to insert language which would \nhave the effect of delaying the effective date of these provisions \nuntil fiscal year 1997. This does not lessen the need to take immediate \naction on these issues, nor the Committee's intent to seek alternatives \nwhich can be accommodated within this year's budget allocation.\n  I hope as this bill progresses, we will be able to come to better \nsolutions which can begin the process of unraveling these difficult and \ncostly problems earlier rather than later.\n  Failure by Congress to address this issue during this session will \nonly exacerbate the budgetary shortfall threatening this large and \ncritical inventory of assisted housing, and will lead to needless \ndisplacement of tens of thousands of low-income families, including the \nelderly and disabled, in fiscal year 1996 and beyond.\n  Mr. President, this appropriations bill reflects two principal \nconcerns, both budgetary in nature. The first is the reversal in trend \nof annual increases in budgetary outlays for discretionary activities.\n  Over the past decade, discretionary outlays for programs funded in \nthis bill have increased at an average annual rate approaching 15 \npercent per year, primarily driven by the cumulative growth in low-\nincome housing assistance programs and inflationary costs related to \nveterans medical care. The congressional budget resolution for fiscal \nyear 1996, H. Con. Res. 67, however, abruptly reverses this trend, \nhalting further continued expenditure growth in these programs. To \ncomply with this dramatic shift in spending policies, the recently \nenacted Rescission Act for fiscal year 1995, Public Law 104-19, \ncanceled a total of $8,500,000,000 in previously appropriated funds for \nprograms included in this bill.\n  The second, and perhaps more significant budgetary concern is the \nfuture year constraints reflected in the budget resolution 7-year \nprojection toward eliminating the Federal deficit by the year 2002. \nWhile overall nondefense discretionary expenditures are required to \ndrop by 2.9 percent in fiscal year 1996, the reduction proposed for \nfiscal year 1997 totals 4.4 percent, and approximately 2 percent per \nyear thereafter.\n  The committee, therefore, is confronting a profound shift from year-\nto-year budgetary increases to a multi-year period of substantial \ndeclines in aggregate funding support, in addition to the erosion in \nprogram levels resulting from inflationary factors. This reversal in \nfunding trends is especially substantial for activities and programs \nsustained by funding in this appropriations bill.\n  The bill as recommended appropriates a discretionary total of $61.6 \nbillion in budget authority. While this is $1.3 billion more than the \nHouse-passed measure, it is nearly $9 billion less than the President's \nbudget request and the originally enacted fiscal year 1995 level.\n  The White House, and some of my colleagues, have protested the \noverall size of these reductions. Frankly, when the committee \noriginally established its subcommittee budget allocations, I also felt \nthat programs funded in this bill should receive greater budgetary \nsupport. But to oppose this measure on the basis of its aggregate \nfunding level fails to account for the necessary improvements and \nreforms we are proposing, and ignores the crisis of deficit spending \nwhich requires much more sacrifice and budgetary reductions in the \nyears to come.\n  Mr. President, this is only a first step in long difficult march \ntoward a balanced budget.\n  The change in direction from the growing budgets of the past to this \ndeclining one was abrupt, and could be moderated to avoid some \ntemporary \n\n[[Page S 14179]]\ndisruption. There should be no confusion or doubt, however, that these \nreduction must be made, and will be made either in fiscal year 1996, or \nsoon thereafter.\n  Mr. President, for the reasons I have set forth, I believe this is a \nresponsible and necessary bill, one which the Senate should support and \npass. It addresses our urgent need to rein in Federal spending. It does \nso in a manner that limits and targets these resources to the highest \npriority needs, and aggressively pursues improvements in program \nmanagement to require increased effectiveness from these expenditures. \nFinally, where appropriate and necessary, the committee has recommended \nprogram and policy reforms which correct well documented deficiencies \nin current activities.\n  I urge all my colleagues will support this bill, and I hope it will \nbe enacted into law soon.\n  I truly hope that my colleagues will support this bill and I hope \nthat it will be enacted into law in the very near future.\n  Mr. President, before turning to my distinguished ranking member, I \nask unanimous consent that a bill summary of H.R. 2099 be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Bill Summary--H.R. 2099\n\n\n                         appropriations summary\n\n       F.Y. 1995 enacted--$89,920,161,061.\n       F.Y. 1996 request--89,899,762,093.\n       F.Y. 1996 House--79,697,360,000.\n       F.Y. 1996 Senate--80,983,986,000.\n       (Includes VA mandatory items).\n\n\n                             agency summary\n\n     Department of Housing and Urban Development\n       F.Y. 1995 enated--$25,453,518,000.\n       F.Y. 1996 request--24,340,032,000.\n       F.Y. 1996 House--19,391,383,000.\n       F.Y. 1996 Senate--20,329,167,000.\n       The Committee is proposing landmark changes in the \n     structure and nature of housing policies to enable local \n     housing agencies, community organizations, and the private \n     housing industry to adjust to declining Federal subsidy \n     levels which have sustained and expanded this enterprise over \n     the past 30 years. These program and policy changes cannot be \n     implemented without some hardships and dislocations. However, \n     unless this process is immediately undertaken with focused \n     deliberation and determination, the potential for devastating \n     loss of affordable housing stock and homelessness will \n     greatly increase.\n       In addition to these policy changes, the Committee is \n     recommending major restructuring of the Department's programs \n     to eliminate an unwieldy number of proliferating categorical \n     activities, in favor of broad, multi-purpose, financial \n     assistance grants to States and local units of government. \n     This effort is designed to reduce the crushing weight of \n     Federal administrative and regulatory burdens on local \n     program managers, and to reduce sharply an agency which \n     widely has been cited as among the most dysfunctional in the \n     Government.\n       The Committee concurs with much of the criticism voiced of \n     this Department, and agrees that this organization must be \n     completely transformed if it is to survive under the \n     budgetary pressures and popular demands for greater program \n     accountability. It is clear, however, that irrespective of \n     whether this Department continues to exist, there remains a \n     substantial and growing need for housing and urban \n     development in the Nation. Previous commitments by Congress \n     to meet these housing needs make it incumbent on the Federal \n     Government to continue a major role in this area. Moreover, \n     the magnitude of previous appropriated budgetary commitments \n     and financial obligations of the Department demand a \n     substantial and effective entity to administer them. Fiscal \n     prudence alone demands aggressive efforts to protect these \n     financial interests.\n       The bill consolidates or eliminates a number of the 240 HUD \n     categorical grants into block grants. This bill eliminates \n     funding for the following separate HUD appropriations:\n       1. Flexible Subsidy Program.\n       2. HOPE I, II, III, and VI.\n       3. Congregate Services.*\n       4. Homeownership Trust.\n       5. Sec. 235 Homeownership Refinancing.\n       6. Housing Counseling Assistance.*\n       7. Service Coordinators.*\n       8. Public Housing development.\n       9. Public Housing amendments.\n       10. Tenant opportunity program.*\n       11. Pension Fund program.\n       12. New Initiatives.\n       13. Family Investment Centers.*\n       14. Family self-sufficiency coordinators.*\n       15. Loan Management.\n       16. Section 23 Conversions.\n       17. Foster child care.*\n       18. Special Purpose Grants.\n       *May be funded under supportive services block grant.\n     Department of Veterans Affairs\n       F.Y. 1995 enacted, $18,244,869,061.\n       F.Y. 1996 request, 19,245,000,093.\n       F.Y. 1996 House, 18,361,637,000.\n       F.Y. 1996 Senate, 17,976,943,000.\n       (Discretionary only).\n       The cost growth in medical services provided to veterans \n     cannot be continued during this period of declining \n     discretionary budgetary resources. It is imperative that the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs aggressively pursue reforms in \n     management and service delivery to utilize available funds \n     more efficiently, to prevent reductions in assistance levels \n     to eligible veterans.\n       The veteran population is declining, and its needs are \n     changing as it ages. While the Veterans Health Administration \n     historically has been a hospital-based health care delivery \n     system primarily serving acute care needs, its population is \n     demanding community-based, outpatient and preventive health \n     care services. Far less is being demanded in the way of \n     inpatient services.\n       It is clear that VA can do more with less--and can become a \n     more efficient, customer-oriented, high-quality health-care \n     delivery system. Numerous inefficiencies have been identified \n     in the VA medical system, including an over-reliance on \n     hospitalization rather than ambulatory care, excessive \n     payments related to its affiliations with medical schools, \n     poor management of its pharmaceutical procurement and \n     delivery systems, its bureaucratic administration of \n     ascertaining veterans eligibility for care, and its \n     insistence on maintaining services in under utilized areas.\n       VA must become a more agile, efficient, and modern health \n     care delivery system, transitioning away from the hospital-\n     based health care delivery system of the past. While less \n     than the amount requested, the Committee recommendation for \n     VA medical care represents the largest dollar increase over \n     current funding levels in the VA, HUD, and Independent \n     Agencies Appropriations bill, and will enable the Department \n     to begin to implement major, systemic changes to its health \n     care delivery system to enable it to become a leaner, more \n     efficient system.\n       In view of the pending reoganization of the Veterans Health \n     Administration, and potential changes which may result, the \n     Committee has put a moratorium on new major construction \n     spending. However, the Department is to ensure that all \n     critical code deficiencies and accreditation requirements are \n     met through minor construction spending.\n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n       F.Y. 1995 enacted--$14,376,684,000.\n       F.Y. 1996 request--14,260,000,000.\n       F.Y. 1996 House--13,671,800,000.\n       F.Y. 1996 Senate--13,798,500,000.\n       NASA has been engaged in a comprehensive redirection of \n     basic operating principles to promote greater efficiency and \n     flexibility in pursuing major scientific and engineering \n     development programs. The Committee recommendation leaves \n     intact the Nation's commitment to deploy the International \n     Space Station, while making significant reductions in lower \n     priority activities of the agency.\n       Also included in the bill are funds to continue critical \n     investments in aeronautical technologies which underpin the \n     future competitiveness of our Nation's commercial aircraft \n     manufacturing industry. These high value, high technology \n     products are crucial to maintaining one of our most \n     significant sources of export sales and domestic \n     manufacturing employment.\n       The Committee also maintains adequate funding to pursue an \n     effective global-climate-change research program, and to \n     follow through on other on-going scientific mission \n     developments.\n     Environmental Protection Agency\n       F.Y. 1995 enacted--$7,240,887,000.\n       F.Y. 1996 request--7,359,409,000.\n       F.Y. 1996 House--4,892,430,000.\n       F.Y. 1996 Senate--5,661,927,000.\n       The Committee of the Nation to securing improvements in the \n     environment and to protect vital natural resources is \n     reflected in the Committee's recommendation to continue \n     substantial funding for this agency despite the overall \n     constraints of discretionary budgetary limitations. The \n     future year reduction in these funding levels will erode our \n     ability to maintain current levels of environmental \n     protection unless reforms are undertaken now to focus these \n     resources on the most significant threats to our air, water, \n     and land resources.\n       The Committee held a hearing earlier this year on the need \n     to reform the Environmental Protection Agency, with a \n     particular focus on a report compiled by the National Academy \n     of Public Administration at this Committee's request. NAPA \n     recommended major systemic changes to EPA, and identified \n     numerous areas in which EPA is unnecessarily duplicating or \n     micromanaging state and private sector environmental \n     protection activities. NAPA recommended management and \n     structural changes which could bring about significant \n     efficiencies and improvements in the way EPA operates. In \n     addition, NAPA agreed that EPA is not adequately prioritizing \n     activities and resources based on risk to human health and \n     the environment.\n       The Committee believes the NAPA recommendations should \n     provide the basis for change at EPA. The Committee's \n     recommendation for EPA is intended to begin to implement the \n     NAPA's suggestions, streamline EPA activities, and focus its \n     resources on high-risk areas.\n       The Subcommittee recommendation includes eight legislative \n     provisions within EPA. All but one of the so-called riders in \n     the House bill have been eliminated or modified. The \n     Subcommittee limited most of the \n\n[[Page S 14180]]\n     provisions to ones that have been included in previous VA-HUD bills or \n     other legislation, or eliminate duplication or unnecessary \n     spending. The provisions included are:\n       1. Prohibiting EPA from requiring centralized inspection/\n     maintenance facilities in FY96. This is the same language as \n     was included by the Senate in the National Highway System \n     bill.\n       2. Prohibiting EPA from requiring employers to adopt car-\n     pooling plans in FY96. This language is one of the House \n     ``riders'' and is the same language as was included in the \n     FY95 rescission bill.\n       3. Prohibiting EPA from regulating radon and several other \n     drinking water contaminants in FY96 unless the drinking water \n     law is reauthorized. This provision is fully consistent with \n     EPA's own attempts to negotiate extensions to the Court-\n     ordered deadlines for these low-priority contaminants. For \n     each of the contaminants in question, the relative risk is \n     low or the science is not fully developed to support science-\n     based rulemakings.\n       4. Prohibiting EPA from requiring in FY96 the use of MTBE \n     in Alaska where there have been health concerns raised \n     associated with the use of MTBE in FY96. This provision was \n     carried in the FY94 VA-HUD bill, and does not exempt Alaska \n     from Clean Air requirements.\n       5. Prohibiting EPA from vetoing decisions made by the Corps \n     of Engineers regarding wetlands permits in FY96. This \n     provision is intended to prevent EPA from overfiling on the \n     Corps, and will streamline the Corps permitting process.\n       6. Prohibiting EPA from adding any new sites to the \n     Superfund National Priorities list in FY96 unless requested \n     by the Governor or tribal leader, unless the Superfund law is \n     reauthorized. This is the same language included in the FY95 \n     rescissions bill, and is consistent with the Subcommittee's \n     decision to limit Superfund spending to current health risks \n     pending reauthorization.\n       7. Authorizing an exemption from water pretreatment \n     standards for industrial dischargers to the Kalamazoo water \n     plant if environmental standards are met through a local \n     pretreatment program. This provision is narrowly crafted and \n     will not result in any environmental degradation; it will \n     prevent duplicative and unnecessary wastewater treatment \n     construction.\n       8. Foreign refiner baseline: Prohibiting EPA from enforcing \n     the foreign refiner baseline for reformulated gasoline. This \n     same provision was included in the FY95 VA-HUD bill, and \n     ensures that foreign refiners are held to the same \n     environmental standards as domestic refiners.\n     National Science Foundation\n       F.Y. 1995 enacted--$3,360,520,000.\n       F.Y. 1996 request--3,360,000,000.\n       F.Y. 1996 House--3,160,000,000.\n       F.Y. 1996 Senate--3,200,000,000.\n       The Committee's recommendation continues current funding \n     levels for the NSF which is responsible for most of the basic \n     research grant funding provided by the Federal Government. \n     Basic research, which seeks to improve our understanding of \n     fundamental scientific principles and processes, provides the \n     knowledge base which enriches our society and from which \n     spring the development of applied technologies which drive \n     our economy. Moreover, the Foundation is responsible for \n     model educational and human resource developmental activities \n     which seek to stimulate improvements in science and \n     mathematics education. These goals of the agency remain a \n     critical national priority which hopefully will be sustained \n     despite the impending reductions in discretionary budgets.\n     Federal Emergency Management Agency\n       F.Y. 1995 enacted--$821,907,000.\n       F.Y. 1996 request--806,119,000.\n       F.Y. 1996 House--694,937,000.\n       F.Y. 1996 Senate--463,437,000.\n       The Committee's recommendation for the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency ensures an adequate level of resources for \n     retaining a strong and capable national disaster management \n     system. While no funds are provided for the disaster relief \n     fund (a reduction of $320 million from the request and the \n     F.Y. 95 level), approximately $7 billion currently is \n     available for disaster relief owing to the recent \n     supplemental appropriation in Public Law 104-19.\n\n\n                        Privileges of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Steve \nIsakowitz, a staff member on temporary assignment to the committee, be \npermitted privileges of the floor during consideration of H.R. 2099.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Andrew Wheeler, \nlegislative fellow for Senator Inhofe, be permitted privileges of the \nfloor for the duration of the VA-HUD bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Before yielding to my distinguished ranking member, I say to this \nbody and to my colleague that it is a great honor and pleasure to be \nworking with the Senator from Maryland on this bill.\n  I had the pleasure of serving in the minority when she chaired this \ncommittee, and I found that she has tremendous knowledge, \nunderstanding, and insight into these programs.\n  I have addressed in my remarks the need to begin to make some very \nsignificant reforms in the funding and in the operations of the \nagencies included within this appropriations bill.\n  For the most part, the reforms we are advocating are ones that she \ninitiated when she chaired this committee. They understand the vitally \nimportant work of all the agencies. Yet, she is also dedicated to the \nnecessary reforms to assure that they provide the services that they \nare expected to provide in the most efficient and effective manner.\n  While we do not agree on all issues in this bill, I say that it is \nwith great appreciation that I have been able to work with my \ndistinguished ranking member and her staff. I believe she has continued \nto supply very useful and helpful changes and recommendations.\n  I look forward to working with her on this and other measures, \nparticularly as we seek to achieve a final product that will be signed \ninto law by the budget and will carry on the funding of the agencies \nfunded by this VA-HUD bill.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to thank the chairman of the VA-\nHUD Subcommittee for his very cordial remarks to me. I must say I feel \nthe same about him.\n  I think we have worked very hard on this bill. I thank both him and \nhis staff for what we have been able to do. We worked hard under very \ndifficult conditions to get this bill to the floor.\n  Mr. President, this is the toughest year that I have ever faced as a \nmember of the Appropriations Committee. What made this year so tough? \nOur allocation, both the allocation to the full committee and then the \nallocation to this particular subcommittee.\n  The allocation, as the President knows, is the sum total that we have \nto fund over 25 different Federal agencies, 7 of which are Cabinet \nlevel.\n  Quite frankly, Mr. President, the VA-HUD Subcommittee's fiscal year \n1996 allocation is, indeed, skimpy. It is $5 billion below the Budget \nCommittee's assumption in budget authority and $500 million below the \nassumption in outlays.\n  What does that mean? It means that the bill before the Senate \nappropriates a total of $61 billion in discretionary budget authority \nwhich is, yes, $1.3 billion above the House, but almost $9 billion \nbelow President Clinton's fiscal year 1996 request and last year's \nfunding level.\n  Our allocation gave us little to work with in dealing with a bill \nthat came from the House of Representatives. Under these conditions, \nSenator Bond has done a commendable job.\n  I chaired this committee for 6 years. I brought six bills to the \nfloor, so I know how much work it actually takes to do this. I want to \nthank Senator Bond for working so hard to maintain our cooperative \nworking relationship.\n  I am particularly grateful to Senator Bond's efforts to continue many \nof the initiatives for reform developed by this subcommittee over the \npast several years. His efforts are clear. He has clearly left \nfootprints in the sand in trying to move a reform agenda both in the \nareas of HUD and EPA. I want to thank him for this.\n  For example, this bill in reforming HUD puts into action the \nrecommendations of the National Academy of Public Administration to \nreform the structure of HUD and consolidate its maze of programs.\n  When I chaired the committee, I saw that HUD had over 200 programs, \nsome a line item, a lot of them not really getting a dollar's worth of \nservices for home ownership for the poor, as it was, for a dollar's \nworth of taxes.\n  I know how it goes in Washington. If you propose any idea to change \nanything, somebody is going to come up with 12 ideas on why you will \nkeep it.\n  That is why I turned to an independent group called the National \nAssociation of Public Administrators to really scrub down both HUD and \nEPA so that we would know from a management standpoint what we needed \nto do to get our hands on both of those agencies to make sure that we \nare getting a dollar's worth of service for a dollar's worth of taxes.\n  I believe in this legislation this bill does streamline EPA. It \nfollows the \n\n[[Page S 14181]]\nNAPA recommendations to streamline EPA's management and it gets started \non a strategy to put EPA's resources where they are needed most. We \nwant EPA to be a risk-based agency in which they focus on risk to human \nhealth and the environment as their highest priorities.\n  Now, NAPA studied the need to reform both HUD and EPA. The studies \nwere commissioned by this subcommittee more than 2 years ago in an \neffort to give the agencies what I call a navigational chart. \nNavigational charts are strategic plans to help the agencies do what \nthey are most needed to do and in the most efficient way. This is where \nwe have embarked upon reform, and I believe we have embarked upon it in \nHUD and EPA.\n  There are other things about this bill that I like, one of which is \nin the area of the space program, the fact that Mission to Planet Earth \nfunding is almost fully restored. A House bill cut much of this crucial \nspace science program and the House language to close NASA space \ncenters has been removed from this bill. This is very important to \nhelping NASA as it goes through budget cuts yet needs to keep America's \nspace program flying high.\n  Because of the initiatives and framework put forth by Senator Bond, I \nbelieve we will be able to sustain what was badly being devastated.\n  Second, another area that is very much appreciated is that veterans \nmedical research is fully funded at the President's request of $257 \nmillion.\n  VA medical research is absolutely crucial, not only to America's \nveterans, but it provides hands-on specific clinical research \nassociated with patient care, and much of what comes out of VA medical \nresearch goes immediately into the civilian population. It is an \nexcellent program. I am pleased it is funded at $257 million.\n  Third, this bill also will help those who want to help themselves. In \nthe area of housing, it contains a moving to work demonstration for \npublic housing residents, and Republican ceilings and income disregards \nto help support the working poor.\n  In other words, in HUD we want to focus on giving help to those who \npractice self-help, and to have coordination with welfare reform. Now, \nif you work, you are actually penalized and unable to get into public \nhousing; and also in the area of rent.\n  I believe this reform begins to reward work which, Mr. President, is \nwhat we have to start doing in our public policy--rewarding work, \npromoting family stability, and particularly two-parent households.\n  Another thing that this bill does is removes something called Federal \nhousing preference. I believe that these preferences that look only at \nrewarding the pathology involved with people are creating zip codes of \npoverty--and zip codes of pathology.\n  What we need in public housing is a mix among the poor--those who do \nnot want to be poor and are working to get out of poverty and off of \nwelfare, and also those who are now the working poor but whose incomes \nare so modest that a public housing subsidy actually would reward work; \nand I believe that is what we are going to do.\n  I am also pleased that in the area of the National Science Foundation \nthe committee's recommendation continues to current funding levels for \nthe National Science Foundation which is responsible for most of the \nbasic research funding and research grant funding provided by the \nFederal Government, basic research which seems to improve our \nunderstanding of the fundamental scientific principles and processes, \nand provides the knowledge base which enriches our society. It also \ncontinues to look at the strategic interests of the United States and \nhow we can promote those.\n  Moreover, the foundation is responsible also for model education and \nhuman resource development activities which seeks to stimulate \nimprovement in science and math education. Boy, do we need it. I am \nglad that the funding will be there to continue to help the science \nfoundation do that.\n  These goals of the agency remain of critical national priority, which \nhopefully will be sustained despite the impending reductions in \ndiscretionary budgets.\n  For FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the figures related thereto be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Federal Emergency Management Agency\n\nFiscal year:\n    1995 enacted...........................................$821,907,000\n    1996 request............................................806,119,000\n    1996 House..............................................694,937,000\n    1996 Senate.............................................463,437,000\n  Let me say the committee's recommendation for FEMA ensures that \nadequate level of resources for retaining a strong and capable national \ndisaster management system.\n  This is absolutely crucial as we see hurricanes, earthquakes, and \nother natural disasters affecting the American people. I am glad that \nFEMA--and which is now funding--is moving to a risk-based strategy \nwhich, of course, enables us to meet those concerns that will most \nlikely affect American communities.\n  While no funds are provided for the disaster relief fund, \napproximately $7 billion is currently available, owing to the recent \nsupplemental appropriations and Public Law 104-19.\n  However, Mr. President, this bill also has several warning lights for \nme. One is an absolute red light. That is the fact that this bill \ncontains no funding for national service. National service creates an \nopportunity structure. It enables young people to earn credit for \nhigher education while serving in their communities. What does that \ncredit mean? It means that, if you work in a national service program, \nlike AmeriCorps, you will earn a voucher that you can use to reduce \nyour student debt. It gives help to those who practice self-help. It \ngives middle-class young people access to the American dream like their \nparents have, and it gives poor kids an access to the American dream by \nalso working and working toward that.\n  This is very important because national service is exactly what we \nneed. It fosters voluntarism. It rekindles the habits of heart. But it \nactually provides help to our young people with the biggest debt that \nthey face when they graduate--their student loan debt which is their \nfirst mortgage. Without national service in this legislation, I cannot \nsupport the bill.\n  Also, another flashing light is in the area of veterans' medical \ncare. This bill reduces veterans' medical care to $511 million below \nthe President's request, and $327 million below the House level. This \nis another area that I cannot support.\n  This bill would also deny benefits to vets who become mentally and \nphysically incapacitated. They served us during the wars, they served \nus unconditionally, and I oppose placing conditions on their earned \nbenefits.\n  Our veterans did not hesitate to risk their lives for our freedom and \nindependence. There should be no hesitation to fund their health. When \nthey went to war we told them we would provide health care, and I \nbelieve promises made should be promises kept.\n  Another flashing light concerns EPA and the funding in this bill. EPA \nmust be funded to protect environmental health and human safety. This \nbill funds EPA at $1.7 billion below the President's request. I believe \nit will hinder EPA's ability to do its job even though management \nreforms will be adopted and streamlined.\n  Finally, this bill removes HUD's authority to enforce the Fair \nHousing Act as it applies to the property insurance industry. This bill \nmeans that HUD will have difficulty in enforcing, investigating, and \neven hearing and referring complaints about property insurance \ndiscrimination.\n  I am opposed to this because removing this authority from HUD is \nreally a step backward.\n  I will be offering amendments to address these concerns that I have \njust raised, and so will some of my colleagues.\n  In closing, I want to thank Senator Bond again for his hard work and \nhis willingness. He wrestled with policy issues, and a very skimpy \nallocation. I again thank him for his cordiality in working with me, \nbut also for his resourcefulness in trying to grapple with these fiscal \nand policy juggernauts that we are facing.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the debate. I know that there will \nbe debate this afternoon on some of the top issues facing us. \n\n[[Page S 14182]]\n\n  I now yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n         Committee Amendments Agreed To En Bloc With Exceptions\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendments be considered and agreed to en bloc with the following \nexceptions, which I believe have been cleared on the other side. The \nexceptions are the amendments on page 8, lines 9 and 10, VA medical \ncare; page 12, line 9, VA major construction; page 21, line 1 through \npage 22, line 4, VA administrative provisions relating to parcel of \nland in Wichita, KS, and VA supply fund; page 22, line 10 through page \n34, line 24, HUD assisted housing, public housing demolition, and \nrenewal accounts; page 38, line 24 through page 39, line 2, homeless \nassistance; page 44, lines 1-7 fair housing; page 45, lines 4-13, \nOffice of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight; page 51, line 3 through \npage 128, line 20, HUD administrative provisions; page 141, lines 5-12, \nSuperfund general revenues; page 141, line 15 Superfund inspector \ngeneral; page 141, line 20, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease \nRegistry; page 143, line 17 through page 151, line 10, water \ninfrastructure/SRF; program and infrastructure assistance; and EPA \nadministrative provisions; page 158, lines 13-14, human space flight \nand delayed availability of funding; page 168, line 12 through page 169 \nline 19, fair housing transfer to Department of Justice and Office of \nFederal Housing Enterprise Oversight transfer to Treasury; page 177, \nline 16 through page 178, line 5, EPA contractor conversion; Office of \nConsumer Affairs termination; and that the bill, as thus amended, be \nregarded for the purpose of amendment as original text, provided that \nno points of order shall be considered to have been waived with respect \nto the committee amendments adopted by this motion.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the committee amendments, with the noted exceptions, were agreed \nto.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I gather that Members seeking to amend those \nprovisions which are excepted will have to seek the guidance of the \nParliamentarian on asking that the other amendments be set aside. I \nleave that to their ingenuity, and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n   Amendment No. 2776 To Committee Amendment On Page 158, Lines 13-14\n\n  (Purpose: To reduce the appropriation for the implementation of the \n   space station program for the purpose of terminating the program)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside in order for me to offer an amendment dealing \nwith the space station.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, there is no agreement on time. I \ndiscussed this with Senator Mikulski, and at some point, perhaps this \nafternoon, with the consent of the majority leader, we will be able to \nreach a unanimous-consent agreement. My preference would be to go for \nan hour or so this afternoon, but most of my colleagues who wish to \nspeak on this side of this issue are out of town and will not return \nuntil the morning.\n  So I had hoped we could get an agreement to debate for 1 hour before \nthe vote. I understand the majority leader wanted the vote immediately \nafter the party caucuses tomorrow, and I have no objection to that. I \nwould prefer the hour of debate take place after the caucuses, but I \nwant to be cooperative with the majority leader, and I do not want to \ncomplicate his problem in scheduling the Senate.\n  Now, Mr. President, I call up my amendment on the space station.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself and \n     Mr. Warner, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Bradley, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Simon, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2776 to committee amendment on \n     page 158, lines 13-14.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike lines 14 through 15 on page 158 and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following: ``$3,504,000,000, to remain available \n     until September 30, 1996: Provided, That of the funds made \n     available under this heading, no funds shall be expended on \n     the Space Station program, except for termination costs.''\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Now, just for opening, Mr. President, this amendment \ncuts $1,833,000,000 from the human space flight portion of the NASA \nbudget, and it terminates the space station program.\n  Now, Mr. President, I guess this is about the sixth consecutive year \nI have stood here in an effort to kill this program. I do not do this \nevery year because I enjoy it; I do it because I have a deep and \nabiding feeling, a passionate feeling that there is not anything wrong \nwith this country except the priorities Congress has set for the \nNation. When it comes to the space station, let me just begin by making \na simple proposition for my colleagues.\n  If you think going to Mars is a highly desirable thing to do, even \nthough in today's dollars it would cost $500 billion, then you should \nvote against this amendment. If you think determining how well the \nhuman body copes with long periods in space and that that is a \nsufficient justification for the space station, vote against our \namendment. If you think the United States ought to equivalent of $25 \nmillion a day for the entire 10-year period the space station will be \ndeployed--let me repeat that--if you think the benefits from the space \nstation justify taking $25 million of taxpayers' money every single day \nfor 10 years, vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  If you think it is a wise use of the taxpayers' money to build \nsomething which indeed will be an engineering feat--not a scientific \nfeat; please distinguish between the two; there is not any question, \nMr. President, about our ability to throw this space station into \nspace; we can do that; we may have a few calamities along the way, but \nwe can do that--but if you think it is a wise use of the taxpayers' \nmoney to build something--you have heard that old expression, my mother \nused to say, ``It is worth its weight in gold''? If you think that the \nspace station is worth 25 times its weight in gold, vote ``no'' on our \namendment.\n  If you think it is worth it to put this engineering feat in space \nwith some idea of going to Mars and beyond--which I will prove to you \ncategorically in a moment is the only justification for it--and that it \nis worth $12,880 of the taxpayers' money for every pound of water, \nchicken breast, supplies, or anything else we send up there--that is \nright. You can buy chicken at Giant for 59 to 69 cents a pound. For the \nspace station, it is $12,880 per pound. If you believe all that, vote \n``no'' on this amendment.\n  Now, Mr. President, Carl Sagan, is a well-known physicist and author, \nand I want to quote some of the things he says in a new book he has \nwritten.\n  Let me say at the outset that Carl Sagan favors the space station. I \ncan understand why somebody of his stature and in his position would \nfavor the space station. But a moment ago I told you the only \njustification for the space station is to explore Mars and beyond. And \nfrom Carl Sagan's new book, let me give you a few quotes:\n\n       I would argue that if we are not eventually going to send \n     people to worlds as far away as Mars, we have lost the chief \n     reason for the space station.\n\n  If you want to argue with that, be my guest.\n\n       A permanently occupied human outpost in Earth orbit, a \n     space station, is far from an optimum platform for doing \n     science, either looking down at the Earth or looking out into \n     space or for utilizing microgravity. The very presence of \n     astronauts messes things up.\n\n  Almost every physicist in the country, Mr. President, will tell you \nthat \n\n[[Page S 14183]]\ndoing research in microgravity with human beings on board is an \noxymoron. You bump your head against the bulkhead, you take a step, you \njar the space station and your experiment is lost.\n  Continuing to quote Dr. Sagan:\n\n       A space station is also unnecessary for human exploration \n     of the Moon. Apollo got there very well with no space station \n     at all. . . . But the only substantive function of a space \n     station, as far as I can see, is for long duration \n     spaceflight.\n\n  Now, if this were country lawyer Dale Bumpers, Charleston, AR, \ntelling you this thing, I would not expect you to pay any attention to \nit. And Carl Sagan is not the only person I am going to quote. I am \ngoing to quote some of the most outstanding experts in America who \nagree with me.\n  Carl Sagan goes on:\n\n       The only tangible and coherent goal of a space station is \n     eventual human missions to near-Earth asteroids, Mars, and \n     beyond.\n\n  And listen to this, I say to my colleagues:\n\n       Historically, NASA has been cautious about stating this \n     fact clearly, probably for fear that Members of Congress will \n     throw up their hands in disgust, denounce the space station \n     as the thin edge of an extremely expensive wedge and declare \n     the country unready to commit to launching people to Mars.\n\n  Well, I would certainly hope Congress would do that.\n  In the past, the authorities at NASA have been very reluctant to talk \nabout Mars, because when you talk about Mars, you have to talk about \n$500 billion in today's dollars. Is it not amazing our priorities \naround here? I do not want to get ahead of myself. I will come back to \nthat in a moment.\n  Carl Sagan goes on, and I agree with him totally on this one and I \nthink most people will, but they will not vote that way:\n\n       There are other matters, clear crying national needs, that \n     cannot be addressed without major expenditures; at the same \n     time the Federal discretionary budget has become painfully \n     constrained. Disposal of chemical and radioactive poisons, \n     energy efficiency, alternatives to fossil fuels, declining \n     rates of technological innovation, the collapsing urban \n     infrastructure, the AIDS epidemic, a witches brew of cancer, \n     homelessness, malnutrition, infant mortality, education, \n     jobs, health care--there is a painfully long list. Ignoring \n     them will endanger the well-being of the Nation.\n\n  I do not see how anybody could say that any better.\n  Mr. President, if you are one of these poor, innocent souls that has \nbeen deluded into believing that somehow or another we are going to do \nmedical research in space, let me give you some more. This is Dr. Allan \nBromley, Presidential science adviser, in a letter to the Vice \nPresident:\n\n       The space station is needed to find means of maintaining \n     human life during long space flights. This is the only \n     scientific justification, in our view, and all future design \n     efforts should be focused on this one purpose.\n\n  Further,\n\n       The Federation of American Societies for Experimental \n     Biology opposes using biological research as a major \n     justification for the space station.\n\n  A quote from the American College of Physicians:\n\n       We agree that much, if not all, of the money slated for the \n     space station, the superconducting super collider--\n\n  This is before we killed that thing--\n\n       SDI, defense intelligence, could be better spent on \n     improving the health of our citizens, stimulating economic \n     growth and reducing the deficit.\n\n  I could not have said it better.\n  And here is a statement by the American Physical Society from July \n1994. The American Physical Society is 40,000 physicists. Virtually \nevery physicist in America belongs to it:\n\n       The principal scientific mission of the station is to study \n     the effects on humans of prolonged exposure to a space \n     environment. Medical researchers scoff at claims that these \n     studies might lead to cures for diseases on Earth.\n\n  Dr. Rosenthal, Harvard Medical School, testifying for the American \nCancer Society in 1994:\n\n       Statements have been made and published to the effect that \n     vital cancer research would be done in space, and that is \n     cited as a reason for supporting space station funding. We \n     cannot find valid scientific justification for these claims \n     and believe it is unrealistic to base a decision on funding \n     the space station on that information. Based on the \n     information we have seen thus far, we do not agree that a \n     strong case has been made for choosing to do cancer research \n     in space over other critically needed research here on Earth.\n\n  Dr. Sean Rudy, Arthritis Foundation, before the Budget Committee of \nthe House:\n\n       Space station proponents have indicated that the space \n     station will provide a first-class laboratory. We used to \n     have first-class laboratories in universities and medical \n     schools across this country. Reports by the NIH and National \n     Science Foundation have indicated that over 51 percent of the \n     biological laboratory research space is deemed inadequate for \n     the conduct of research. Furthermore, the National Science \n     Foundation report estimated that the capital construction \n     backlog for laboratories on Earth is $12 billion. Should our \n     priorities now be a first-class laboratory in space or \n     correction of a longstanding deficiency in laboratories \n     throughout the country?\n\n  James Van Allen, world-famous astrophysicist and discoverer of the \nVan Allen radiation belt around the Earth:\n\n       There's been nothing that resulted from the manned space \n     program, essentially nothing in the way of extraordinary \n     pharmaceuticals or cures for disease or any extraordinary \n     crystals which have revolutionized electronics. It's all \n     false, it's not true.\n\n  That is not Dale Bumpers talking, but Dr. James Van Allen, one of the \npremier astrophysicists of this century.\n  Mr. President, so much for life sciences. And then there is that \nthing about microgravity. Dr. Bloembergen of Harvard summed up, \n``microgravity is of microimportance.'' I am reluctant to continue \nreading what scientists say, but repeating Carl Sagan, ``The very \npresence of astronauts messes things up.'' Dr. Allan Bromley again, \nPresidential science adviser, said,\n\n       The human habitation of the space station is fundamentally \n     incompatible with the requirement that microgravity \n     experiments be unperturbed.\n\n  The Space Studies Board of the National Research Council:\n\n       The Board believes specifically that more microgravity \n     research progress could be achieved in a shorter period of \n     time and at a fraction of the cost through an expanded \n     program of Spacelab missions and of free flier experiments.\n\n  In short, you do not have to have a manned space craft to do \nmicrogravity research.\n  Mr. President, let us go to spinoffs. Everybody is always talking \nabout what the spinoffs are going to be. I have yet to find anybody who \nsays that the spinoffs are more than negligible. We have developed a \nspace suit. There is no great demand for space suits in our Nation. \nThere is, however, a great need to reduce crime, to feed the hungry, to \neducate our children, to house our people. But there is no demand for \nspace suits.\n  As Carl Sagan said, ``The spinoff justifications constitute an \nadmission that the program cannot stand on its own two feet and cannot \nbe justified by the purpose for which it was originally sold.''\n  And listen to this one from the Wall Street Journal. I want all my \nopponents to scratch this subject out of their comments. They always \nmake this point, and I want to kill it before it gets off the ground:\n\n       Many widely believed origins of consumer products in the \n     Apollo program are simply untrue. Tang, hyped by General \n     Foods Corporation as a drink of astronauts, was first \n     marketed in 1957. Velcro . . . was developed in the 1940's. \n     And teflon . . . emerged from company labs in 1938, long \n     before rockets cleared the Earth's atmosphere. So too, \n     Corning Ware cookery hit the market several years before man \n     reached space.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, there is an argument that we can grow protein \ncrystals in space, or that we can do valuable research in physics by \ngrowing gallium arsenide metal crystals that could be used in \nmanufacturing semiconductors. I am not going to continue reading to \nyou, but I have quote after quote after quote saying: Totally false.\n  Just use your common sense, colleagues. I want you to get up in \nopposition to this amendment and tell me about all the medical advances \nwe have gotten out of the billions and billions we have spent on the \nspace program. Tell me what it has done for cancer, AIDS, multiple \nsclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, arthritis. Tell me what \nsingle advance made in the last 30 years came out of space. The \nRussians have had space stations since the mid 1970's. They are lucky \nthat one has not been knocked out of the sky by a piece of debris. \nSomething could happen one of these days. We can only hope that, after \nspending $90 billion to deploy this thing, it will not be knocked out \nof the sky by a baseball-size piece of space debris.\n  When I talk about $94 billion for the cost of this thing, that is \njust this \n\n[[Page S 14184]]\nyear's estimate. Last year, the estimate was $72 billion. It goes up \nmonumentally every year. Do you know what it does not include? It does \nnot include that 1 to 2 percent chance that one of the shuttles is \ngoing to meet with a major catastrophe. Do you know what else it does \nnot include? It does not include the risk, as I said, of a baseball-\nsize piece of debris hitting the space station, which is goodbye, \nadios, adieu, space station. No, the $94 billion figure assumes that \neverything is going to go perfectly. Who here believes that?\n  Carl Sagan wrote me a letter and told me--I think perhaps you all got \nthe same letter--how excited the people were about ``Apollo 13.'' I \nhave not seen it. I understand it is a great movie, and I intend to see \nit. They were very brave men, but no braver than the one sitting near \nme right now, the first American to orbit the Earth. I consider John \nGlenn one of the dearest friends I ever had, but he just happens to be \nwrong on this issue. Everybody is entitled to their own positions.\n  I will tell you all an interesting little anecdote. I was down at the \nSmithsonian one day and I saw that capsule John Glenn orbited the Earth \nin, and I came back and I said to him, ``John, weren't you terrified? I \nwould be scared to death to get in that thing.'' He said, ``Well, to \ntell you the truth, I was sitting up their whistling. They had already \nscrubbed the flight a couple of times and I expected they would scrub \nit again. And then they said, `You have 60 seconds,' and I did not have \ntime to get scared.''\n  I looked at that capsule with new admiration for my colleague, one of \nmy dearest friends. When I saw those people retrieve the Hubble \ntelescope, I was glued to my television set just as you were. And last \nweek, the astronauts were out on the arm of the totem pole retrieving \nanother satellite that had gone awry. These are magnificent, brave \npeople. But, colleagues, that is not what this debate is about. We have \na lot of brave people in the country who cannot find jobs.\n  But back to what you get out of it, I am just simply saying the \nAmerican people have a right to expect us to do what is right for the \nfuture. The 1994 revolution, in my opinion, said: We do not believe \nyour priorities are right. I can tell you, a lot of people who are on \nMedicare would not have voted the way they did if they had known \nMedicare was going to take a whopping $270 billion trouncing.\n  Carl Sagan said in his letter to me that he was for the space station \nbecause he believed in the exploration of space. So do I. He said he \nbelieved in it because it was a case of international cooperation with \nthe Europeans, Russians, Canadians, and the Japanese. He thinks that is \nhealthy. I think it is healthy for there to be international \ncooperation on anything, whether it is space, medicine, you name it. \nLet me tell you something, colleagues. In a perfect world, I would be \nfor this. If we did not have a nearly $5 trillion debt and the threat \nof certain people in the U.S. Congress saying we are going to bring \nthis country down--can you imagine somebody saying that? If the \nPresident does not do what we tell him to, this country is coming to a \nscreeching halt.\n\n  Words should be measured very carefully because people pay attention \nand get justifiably frightened. It scares me to think that people in \nthis body have the power to do that.\n  But let's look at the international cooperation on the space station: \nThe Canadians and the Italians are cutting back; the Germans and the \nFrench are negotiating on what they want to do. The Russians, who \nintend to do a lot, will only do it if we give them the money. Russia \ndoes not have enough bread to feed its people so they are not going to \nbe able to participate unless we give them the money.\n  I am not all that opposed to helping Russia. I want to do everything \nI can to help democracy work in Russia, and one of the best ways to \nmake democracy work is to give people jobs and bread and something to \neat. The reason they have the revolution is they did not have bread or \nfood or anything to eat. I want to help them make it work.\n  Where is the Russian launch going to take place? It will take place \nin Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan is no longer a part of Russia. That is where \ntheir cosmodrome is. That is where their launch site is. It is not even \nin Russia. So talk about things that can go wrong, this one can go \nwrong.\n  I think about the problems here, and those that I mentioned a moment \nago. It drives me crazy that Public Broadcasting is being cut \ndramatically. It drives me crazy that the National Endowment for the \nArts and the National Endowment for the Humanities are being virtually \neliminated, cut in half. Those are things that have a civilizing \ninfluence on our society, that would make us a little more cultured and \ntherefore a little less likely to kill each other because somebody \ndented your fender at the stoplight.\n  The New York Times last week said that the demand for student loans \nis skyrocketing. Do you know why? Because tuition is skyrocketing. \nEverybody is saying how are these college kids who are getting out of \nschool, how are they going to pay this debt back? They are loaded with \nbig debt. So our answer is to cut student loans and that way they will \nnot accumulate the debt in the in the first place. However, they will \nnot get an education either.\n  Every one of the things I mentioned--from crime, to medical research, \nto education, to infant mortality rate, cutting health care for the \nelderly, cutting health care dramatically for the poorest of the poor, \ncutting money for the Environmental Protection Agency because they \nregulate things so we can drink clean water and breathe clean air--we \nare cutting. But we fund the space station.\n  Six Senators took a trip overseas about a month ago. We did not dare \ndrink the water. We brushed our teeth with bottled water that we took \nwith us. Fortunately, in this country we have made some progress in \ncleaning up our drinking water.\n  So what is our solution to the progress we have made? Two-thirds of \nthe water is now swimmable, two-thirds of the water in the country is \nnow fishable, whereas in 1971 only one-third was. So now the idea is to \ncut back on the regulation. So we, too, will have the opportunity to \nbrush our teeth in bottled water until it runs out.\n  Just last Friday the House said we are going to cut the earned-income \ntax credit that poor working people use to stay off welfare, something \nthe majority leader, President Bush, President Reagan, almost \neverybody, has applauded as the greatest program we have ever invented \nto keep people off welfare. What are they going to do with it? Whack it \nin half.\n  I talked to a woman the other day who works hard and does not make \nvery much money. She told me how much money she made. I said, ``How \nmuch do you pay for child care?'' She said, ``I pay $50 a week for one \nchild,'' she is a single mother, ``$50 for one child and $43 for one \nchild.'' That is $93 a week. If you knew what she made, you would \nwonder how on Earth she is doing it.\n  Let me digress another moment to say we are not providing enough \nchild care in the welfare bill to allow the people to go to work that \nwe say have to go to work--50 percent by the year 2000. No woman is \ngoing to go to work and leave her children at home alone.\n  If you do not have child care, she will not go to work. She will sit \nhome and starve. But the other thing, this woman gets no help. She \nworks. She works 8 hours a day and sometimes longer and she works hard. \nShe gets at the end of the year that earned-income tax credit which is \noftentimes the difference between eating and not eating for families.\n  So what are we doing? We are dropping that program from a program \nthat covers 20 million people to a program that covers 9 million in the \nHouse of Representatives and 11 million in the Senate. We will probably \ncompromise at 10 million.\n  When it comes to cutting around here, if you are poor, it is easy to \ncut you because you do not have a PAC. You do not make campaign \ncontributions and you do not provide jobs in your State. So it is easy \nto cut poor folks.\n  It is easy to cut the Environmental Protection Agency. It is \nobviously easy to cut student loans, though I thought that program was \nsacred. But we are cutting it.\n  We are cutting title 1, which is the program that is a remedial \neducation program to give first graders a start in life--teaching them \nto read. We are cutting that.\n\n[[Page S 14185]]\n\n  But we are not cutting the Seawolf. We are not cutting the B-2 \nbomber. We are not cutting the space station. I know the Presiding \nOfficer would be disappointed if I did not point out we are not going \nto stop giving away billions of dollars worth of gold underneath \nFederal land--the rankest form of corporate welfare.\n  I can say if you do not want to be cut around here, just make \nsomething that explodes and we will give you all the money that you \nwant.\n  I give NASA credit for one thing. They took a leaf out of the \nPentagon's book. They spread the contracts for the space station among \n36 States. A person does not have to be a rocket scientist to know all \nyou have to have around here are 26 States that have as many as 10 \njobs, and you cannot kill it, because that is 52 votes.\n  So we have 36 States with a piece of the action. Do you know what is \ninteresting? Eighty-three percent of this $94 billion goes to \nCalifornia, Alabama, Texas, and Florida. All the other 32 States are \nfighting for 17 percent of the money. But if there is $1 million in \nyour State, that means you probably have 50 jobs.\n  People will come up on the floor and say, ``I do not like the space \nstation, and I would like to vote with you, but we have a few little \njobs down in my State.''\n  Mr. President, 44 States contribute more as a percentage of the tax \nburden for the space station--listen to this--44 States contribute more \nthan they get back.\n  The thing that drove me nuts about the B-1 and the B-2 is they \nchanged missions. When the cold war ended and we found out the B-2 was \nnot as stealthy as we thought, we just said, ``Well, we will make it a \nconventional bomber.'' All you have to do is change the mission to keep \nthe money flowing. We also have now made a conventional bomber out of \nthe B-1.\n  The space station had eight missions. Here they are. This is what we \nstarted out to do with the space station. Over a period of 10 years, we \nscrubbed it as a staging base; we scrubbed it as a manufacturing \nfacility; we scrubbed it as a space-based observatory; we scrubbed it \nas a transportation node; we scrubbed making it a servicing facility; \nwe scrubbed making it an assembly facility; we scrubbed making it a \nstorage facility; and we are now down to the last possible mission, a \nresearch laboratory. And I just got through telling you that almost \nevery physicist and physician in the country says that is palpable \nnonsense.\n  Let me show you some figures. Bear in mind that when Ronald Reagan \nmade his great speech about how we were going to go build the space \nstation, that was in 1984. Mr. President, just to remind you--and I \nknow I do not need to; you were there. You heard President Reagan say \nwe are going to build this space station, and it is going to cost $8 \nbillion; 10, 11 years ago it was going to cost $8 billion. By 1994, we \nhad already spent $11.2 billion. The construction of the project will \ncost $17.4 billion between 1995 and the year 2002, the magic year that \nwe are going to balance the budget. But the money we have spent, the \nmoney we are going to spend in building it, you add to that the shuttle \nflights needed to launch it, service and use the station, $50 billion. \nAnd just to operate it for 10 years is $13 billion and station-related \ncosts is $1.9 billion, for the total paltry sum of $94 billion.\n  What you get out of the eight missions is a space laboratory. The \nother seven are gone.\n  It is all a question of priorities and where your heart is, \ncolleagues.\n  Here is what it is going to cost us over the next 7 years to build \nthe space station and deploy it--$32 billion. Here is the tax cut we \nare going to give people who make $100,000 and more, $245 billion. A \nvast majority of these people are ``them what has.'' We used to have an \nold expression in Charleston, AR: ``Them that has gets.'' Two-hundred \nand forty-five billion dollars for that, and then a $58 billion \nincrease over the next 7 years for defense.\n  What are we doing to accommodate all of this? We are going to cut \nMedicare by $270 billion and Medicaid by $182 billion. I promise you \nthat I intend to vote against both, if those are the final figures.\n  We are cutting student loans by $10 billion at a time when the need \nfor loans is soaring because tuition is soaring.\n  The earned income tax credit, which I mentioned a moment ago, we are \ncutting by $23 billion; other domestic programs by $188 billion, so \nthat we can increase defense by $58 billion and fund the space station.\n  When are we going to learn that our national security does not just \ndepend on how many tanks, planes and guns we have? It has nothing to do \nwith the space station.\n  As an aside, I stood on this floor a few weeks ago and debated \ncreating yet one more method of financing foreign arms sales. In the \n1980's, Mr. President, we sold about 20 to 25 percent of all the arms \nsold in international commerce. In the 1990's, we have gotten up over \n50 percent.\n  We already have four methods of financing foreign arms sales. And the \nDefense appropriations bill comes in here and approves yet a fifth \nmethod of financing foreign arms sales to some of the countries that \nare most likely to default. And, if that happens, the taxpayers will \npick up the tab.\n  Mr. President, what does it take to kill a program? I do not know. I \nbelieved when I came here that one Senator could make a difference. \nThere have been a few times that I have been able to make a difference. \nIt was a very difficult thing for me coming from the Governor's mansion \nto the U.S. Senate where you have to introduce bills, hold hearings, \nfinally get it passed through a subcommittee, get it passed through the \nfull committee, and hope to get it on the floor and send it over to the \nHouse where it goes through the same procedure, and then the President \nmay veto it. That takes about a year. But when you are a Governor, you \ncan just sign your name occasionally and make something happen. I used \nto go home at night about 50 percent of the time immensely gratified \nfor something which I had signed my name to that day that I knew was \ngoing to happen. Here it is totally different.\n  I am not going to belabor this any further. I have said about all I \ncan say. There are a lot more quotes that I could use.\n  But I am asking you to search your own conscience. If you were \ndebating this on national television, how do you think it would come \nout? If you were debating mining land reform on national television, \nhow do you think it would come out? Everybody knows how it would come \nout--about 90-10 to fix mining law. The space station would be a little \nbit closer. But, you see, there will not be a national television \ndebate. We will all go home and tell the chamber of commerce that the \nhardships they are enduring and all the cuts we had to make in their \nhealth care and education programs was to balance the budget by the \nyear 2002. And they will never really know why their lives grow more \nprecarious and why they are more unsettled, and why they think \naffirmative action, or gays in the military, or prayer in school, or \nterm limits, or desecration of the flag are really their problems. As \nlong as you can keep them talking about those things and divert their \nattention from the real problems in the country, you have a winner. So \nfar it has worked magnificently.\n  The reason is because they work for a living. They do not have time \nto keep up with what we are doing.\n  So when you say, ``We had to do this for you, we had to liberate you \nfrom welfare, we had to do all of these things to balance the budget,'' \nyou have no choice but to believe it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nickles). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, probably about 90 or maybe even 95 percent \nof the time around here the Senator from Arkansas and I agree and agree \nwholeheartedly. He stated that correctly. We are friends. We are close \nfriends. I do not know anyone here I consider more a friend than the \nSenator from Arkansas. If the Senate of the United States has anyone \nwho deserves the title of being an accomplished orator, it certainly is \nthe Senator from Arkansas.\n  So we do normally agree on things and we are close friends, but every \nyear we seem to lock horns on this particular issue and we go at it on \nthis because I am profoundly in disagreement with him on the amendment \nthat he has put forward today.\n  I rose in the Senate in early August, and I made a statement that \ncovered \n\n[[Page S 14186]]\nsome of the benefits of NASA-funded research including the space \nstation. I talked about the need for curiosity. All advancement in \nhumankind, wherever it is, comes because someone is curious, someone is \ncurious about how you can do things differently, how you can do things \nbetter. Can I invent something? Can I make an improvement in medical \nscience? Can I do something in engineering? Can I do something in \nagriculture?\n  That curiosity is at the heart of all progress and at the heart of \nwhat makes this country great, because we throughout our history have \ninvested more in basic research and technology than any nation. Out of \nthat has come the technological leadership of the whole world.\n  In my August 1, 1995, statement I talked about advances in \nagriculture. When I was a kid back in Ohio, 48 to 50 bushels was a good \ncorn crop. We had the record corn crop in Ohio, 239 bushels, last year \nin part because our country invested in basic research.\n  I talked then about metals and about aerodynamics. The Federal \nGovernment funded basic research in these areas which permitted the \ngrowth of the aviation industry in this country and our leadership in \nthe world. And I spoke about research in medicine as well as research \nin space and telecommunications.\n  Mr. President, we have a very basic question, it seems to me, and \nthat is, who is going to be responsible for the class of 2015 or 2025 \nor 2050? Any great nation invests in the future for its children. One \norganization we have in Government that is setting out to do the 10-, \nthe 15-, the 25-year research more than any other agency really is \nNASA.\n  Twenty years ago, we invested in a number of different things--\ndigital technology, a number of things that some people thought were \nfoolish to put money into, but we went ahead with it. And now we have a \nnumber of advances relating directly from that investment, including \nbetter imaging for medicine. Let me explain. We were able to apply some \nof that digital technology to the Hubble telescope. Some digital \ntechnology was developed especially for the Hubble, to enable \nastronomers to distinguish very minute points of light. We applied this \ntechnology, and some associated computer enhancements to medical \nimaging. And it turns out that we are now able to detect breast cancer \ntumors five times better than we used to be able to do. This was an \nunexpected benefit from the much-maligned Hubble telescope. This shows \nthe potential payoff from long-term research--from preliminary Federal \ninvestment in basic research on digital technology to application on \nthe Hubble to application in breast cancer detection.\n  In this country, we have been fortunate to have a balance in research \nup until recent years. And that balance was between Government and \nprivate investment, where major American corporations put forward, \nsponsored their own research laboratories, and did fundamental basic \nresearch, the 8-, the 10-, the 12-, the 15-year projects that they did \nnot expect to get immediate market-oriented payoffs from.\n  Now we find that going down. Businesses are not making as much \ninvestment in basic research. And the Federal Government too, if some \nhave their way, will reduce its investment in basic research. The \nbalance we had with private and Government basic research, where the \nGovernment would take on the more risky projects, those that were less \nguaranteed of immediate success that would benefit the marketplace, is \nnow going down. In the past, the Government took on such things as the \nManhattan project, things that moved us ahead in nuclear weaponry and \nour nuclear knowledge in general in this country. But there was that \nkind of balance back and forth between private and Government research \nprojects. And now that has gone down.\n  I would like to quote liberally from a Wall Street Journal article \nwritten by Gautam Naik, a staff reporter to the Wall Street Journal, an \narticle that was published in May of this year. He talks about:\n\n       In the late 1980's, Bob Lucky had what he calls ``a great \n     fantasy.'' As a researcher at AT Corp.'s celebrated Bell \n     Labs, he was designing a silicone robot the size of a grain \n     of sand. Injected into the human body, it would act as a \n     microsurgeon, traveling to specific locations to fix \n     problems.\n\n  He goes on to say he was proud of that. ``The benefits to society \ncould be tremendous,'' but they scrapped that project ``because it had \nno bearing on its main business.'' Mr. Lucky, who was a 31-year \nveteran, is now at a different company.\n  ``Chasing far-out notions,'' the Journal goes on to say, ``has been a \nhallmark of industrial research in America. But some of the biggest \nU.S. corporations have cut back sharply on research into `basic \nscience'--the exploration of how nature works at a fundamental level.'' \nAnd now they are pursuing ``short-term goals to commercialize products \nmore quickly.''\n  The following quote from the article startled me: ``Corporate labs, \nhome to 75 percent of the Nation's scientists and researchers, are \nreplacing a cherished culture of independence with a results-oriented \napproach.''\n  ``In past decades, the devotion of basic research without regard to \nboosting the bottom line spawned a steady stream of breakthroughs, \nincluding the transistor, the solar cell and the forerunner to today's \nlaser--all at Bell Labs.'' Now they are cutting back. Cutbacks have \ntaken a toll. ``Some disillusioned scientists have fled to academia,'' \nand so on. And ``already, U.S. companies are falling behind in advanced \ndata-storage devices and technology for oil exploration,'' as one \nexample. The short-term response, he says, has to keep the stockholders \nhappy.\n  ``The National Science Foundation,'' the article continues, \n``calculates that U.S. spending on basic research declined slightly to \n$9.7 billion in 1993 and didn't rise last year.\n  ``In a survey by R Magazine, half of all companies with `research \nand development' budgets of $50 million or more plan to cut spending \nthis year, for a 3.5 percent decline overall. (About 10 percent of the \nR budget is typically devoted to basic research.)''\n  These are startling figures because the United States, instead of \ngoing ahead with the goose that has laid the golden egg in this \ncountry, basic research, that has given us the new handle on the \nfuture, is cutting back, cutting back in a tremendous way.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this entire article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 22, 1995]\n\n         Technology--Corporate Research: How Much Is It Worth?\n\n                            (By Gautam Naik)\n\n       In the late 1980s, Bob Lucky had what he calls ``a great \n     fantasy.''\n       As a researcher at AT Corp.'s celebrated Bell \n     Laboratories, he was designing a silicon robot the size of a \n     grain of sand. Injected into the human body, it would act as \n     a microsurgeon, traveling to specific locations to fix \n     problems.\n       ``I was damn proud of the stuff we did. The benefits to \n     society could be tremendous,'' Mr. Lucky says. But AT \n     scrapped the RESEARCH because it had no bearing on its main \n     business. Mr. Lucky, a 31-year veteran of Bell Labs, is now \n     at Bellcore.\n       Chasing far-out notions has long been a hallmark of \n     industrial RESEARCH in America. But some of the biggest U.S. \n     corporations have cut back sharply on RESEARCH into ``basic \n     science''--the exploration of how nature works at a \n     fundamental level--to pursue short-term goals and to \n     commercialize products more quickly. Corporate labs, home to \n     75% of the nation's scientists and researchers, are replacing \n     a cherished culture of independence with a results-oriented \n     approach.\n       In past decades, the devotion to basic RESEARCH without \n     regard to boosting the bottom line spawned a steady stream of \n     breakthroughs, including the transistor, the solar cell and \n     the forerunner to today's laser--all at Bell Labs. Now, in \n     the 1990s, the cutbacks are taking a toll. Some disillusioned \n     scientists have fled to academia. Already, U.S. companies are \n     falling behind in advanced data-storage devices and \n     technology for oil exploration.\n       Some experts worry the shift is an even greater threat to \n     the future. ``It's a shorterm response aimed at keeping \n     stockholders happy. Without question this will hurt American \n     competitiveness,'' warns Albert Link, an economics professor \n     at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.\n       Companies counter that as competition intensifies and \n     technology accelerates, they must push harder to get more \n     direct value out of their RESEARCH. ``We need to focus on \n     customers' needs,'' says Daniel Stanzione, who has \n     hammered at that doctrine since becoming president of Bell \n     Labs in March. A former president of AT's $6 billion \n     public network equipment division, he is the first hard-\n     core business manager to run the famed RESEARCH arm.\n\n[[Page S 14187]]\n\n       The National Science Foundation calculates that U.S. \n     companies' spending on basic RESEARCH declined slightly to \n     $9.7 billion in 1993 and didn't rise last year. In a survey \n     by R magazine, half of all companies with ``RESEARCH and \n     development'' budgets of $50 million or more plan to cut \n     spending this year, for a 3.5% decline overall. (About 10% of \n     the R budget is typically devoted to basic RESEARCH.)\n       Those figures mask far more significant cuts in some areas. \n     Among U.S. makers of communications gear and electronics, \n     spending on basic RESEARCH dropped 64% between 1988 and 1992 \n     to $350 million. Even government-funded basic RESEARCH at \n     universities and colleges, which has risen in the last five \n     years, is expected to fall slightly in 1995, according to the \n     National Science Foundation.\n       International Business Machines Corp. has chopped $1.7 \n     billion from its annual R budget since 1992, a 33% \n     reduction to $3.38 billion by last year. In the science-\n     oriented RESEARCH division, annual spending has fallen to \n     $450 million from $625 million in 1990. The staff of \n     scientists has been cut nearly 20% to 2,600; the number \n     pursuing basic RESEARCH is down by half to 200.\n       In the 1980s, IBM labs explored the subatomic mysteries of \n     neutrino particles. In the 1990s, an IBM lab perfected the \n     collapsible ``butterfly'' keyboard in just a year; it might \n     have taken seven years in the old days. Impressive, but \n     keyboards are hardly the stuff of high science.\n       Bernard Meyerson, an IBM fellow and senior manager at the \n     IBM lab in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., says that despite the \n     reductions, ``core RESEARCH was preserved.'' But he concedes \n     that cutting back is ``a dicey process'' because ``you won't \n     see the impact of funding cuts until it's too late.''\n       Elsewhere the changes have been subtle but no less \n     significant. Xerox Corp.'s PARC lab, which invented laser \n     printing and on-screen icons, now gets detailed ``contracts'' \n     from the company's product divisions directing its RESEARCH. \n     At GENERAL Electric Co., the portion of R spending devoted \n     to long-term projects is down to 15% from 30% in the 1980s.\n       Such changes are sweeping Bell Labs, perhaps the most \n     famous lab in the world. AT still devotes 10% of its annual \n     $3 billion R budget to basic RESEARCH, but ever bigger \n     chunks will be shifted away from physical science--the lab's \n     traditional strength--to information science, which is \n     closely tied to AT's core business. Bell Labs managers used \n     to be promoted solely on the basis of technical achievement. \n     Now they must also display business acumen.\n       ``That wonderful culture at Bell Labs'' is disappearing, \n     laments Phillip Griffiths, director of the Institute for \n     Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., one of the last \n     strongholds of purely theoretical RESEARCH in the U.S.\n       It is difficult to quantify what may be lost because of \n     such shifts. Fiber optics, for one, might have been delayed \n     for decades if not for fundamental discoveries made at Bell \n     Labs, GE and IBM. In the early 1960s, scientists stumbled on \n     a curious find: Gallium arsenide was a natural laser. When \n     they zapped an electrical current through it, it emitted an \n     intense beam of light, thus making practical the laser that \n     was first demonstrated by Hughes Aircraft in 1960. Scientists \n     realized this ``semiconductor injection laser'' could be \n     manipulated to transmit vast amounts of data at nearly the \n     speed of light.\n       As many big U.S. companies are backing away, some foreign \n     concerns are pushing on. Major high-tech companies overseas \n     increased R spending 23% from 1988 to 1993, says Schonfeld \n     & Associates of Lincolnshire, Ill.\n       At NEC Corp.'s RESEARCH Institute in Princeton, N.J., about \n     30 miles form Bell Labs' campus, scientists delve into \n     condensed matter physics, quantum mechanics and biology. \n     Joseph Giordmaine, a physicist, put in 28 years at Bell Labs \n     but bolted for Japan's NEC in 1988.\n       Now, as a senior vice president, he presides over some \n     truly far-out projects. In one, a fly, its limbs affixed in \n     wax, is set before a TV screen flashing a series of images. A \n     delicate probe connects a single neuron in the fly's brain to \n     an instrument that measures how fast it registers the TV \n     images.\n       The RESEARCH may one day yield insights into how to design \n     a super-fast computer. ``Basic RESEARCH means you have to be \n     able to take risks and accept failure,'' says Mr. Giordmaine.\n       Greg Blonder, who invented the wristphone at Bell Labs, has \n     spent most of his career studying physical sciences and their \n     role in future technologies. In January, he switched to \n     ``human-centered engineering,'' aimed at making AT products \n     more ``customer friendly.''\n       He admits to nostalgia for bygone days. ``There's no thrill \n     equivalent to the feeling when you discover something late at \n     night, and you know that no one else in the universe knows \n     it.'' he says. ``I miss that.''\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I will not go on to read all of this, but \nit goes on and gives examples of different companies, but it also \nindicates how foreign countries, foreign nations are putting more into \nresearch. And it indicates that NEC, a Japanese concern, has an \ninstitute now, an NEC Corp. research institute, in Princeton, NJ, about \n30 miles from where Bell Labs' campus is located, and there the \nscientists are delving into condensed matter physics, quantum \nmechanics, and biology. And some of these scientists from some of the \nother laboratories that used to be our standard bearers in this country \nare now over there working for a Japanese corporation to continue basic \nfundamental research.\n  Well, I will not belabor the point any further except to say that I \nthink it is a tragedy when we cut back in private investment also at \nthe same time we hear proposals to cut back in what we spend on \nresearch at the Federal level. We have seen attacks in those areas all \nthe way through the budget process this particular year.\n  There is another article. I would ask unanimous consent that the \narticle by Brenda Forman called ``High-Risk, Basic Research Is \nCritical'' be printed in the Record, Mr. President.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Space News, July 17-23, 1995]\n\n                 High Risk, Basic Research Is Critical\n\n                           (By Brenda Forman)\n\n       If Congress applied the same logic to families as it is \n     applying to federally funded university research, it would \n     decree that nobody have children.\n       Children and basic research both represent large, up-front \n     investments over a protracted period of time with absolutely \n     no guarantee of any return--although the payoffs, when (and \n     if) they come, can be spectacular. A risky, dubious gamble, \n     right? Obviously one that any savvy investor or deficit-\n     minded congressman set on an early return and a dependable \n     product should avoid at all costs.\n       But without children, there is no future. And without high-\n     risk, basic research unrelated to specific products or bottom \n     lines, the reservoir of technological advances on which the \n     country's current prosperity and power is based will run dry \n     in an alarmingly short time.\n       It is both ignorant and self-deluding to think that the \n     United States can get better results from its research \n     investment by insisting that research be focused on specific, \n     practical, immediately identifiable applications. That is \n     simply not how the big break-throughs happen.\n       As little as human conceit might wish to admit it, the \n     truly fundamental discoveries seldom occur where we have \n     decided to look. Instead, they have a curious habit of \n     turning up on accidental bypaths when researchers were \n     looking for something else entirely.\n       A long list of this century's major technological advances \n     have been made this way and Americans are coasting on their \n     momentum to this day--penicillin, X-rays, the enabling \n     advances that made transistors and DNA fingerprinting \n     possible, not to mention the ubiquitous Post-It.\n       Meanwhile, decades of research and uncounted millions of \n     dollars determinedly focused on a cancer cure have failed \n     utterly.\n       Reviewing the history of technological prediction should \n     chasten those who would imagine that research can be \n     consciously directed to produce breakthroughs. In retrospect, \n     such predictions can border on the hilarious.\n       Remember how World War I commanders insisted there could \n     never be a combat role for aircraft? Remember how IMB was \n     once told it could only expect to sell about 30 computers? \n     Remember how Arthur D. Little told the inventor of Xerox \n     there was only a market for about 500 of his machines? \n     Remember how the computer was going to create the paperless \n     office? Then tell me how we expect politicians--or anybody \n     for that matter--to predict where research should best be \n     focused.\n       The hard truth is that major advances occur when somebody \n     gets both curious and lucky--and also has the resources to \n     pursue their hunch. Congress is now withdrawing that third \n     essential factor. The result will be a classic case of penny \n     wise, pound foolish: in return for a largely trivial budget \n     reduction, the country will forfeit much of its potential \n     future wealth.\n       Of course, the damage probably will not be all that \n     apparent before the next re-election campaign and so possibly \n     few members of Congress will care. But they should. Such \n     effects are like termites: they undermine a structure for a \n     long time before the house begins to buckle, and by then the \n     damage is irreparable.\n       It is equally illusory to decree that universities should \n     confine themselves to purely basic research, leaving such \n     things as engineering research to unidentified others. There \n     is no such thing as purely basic research--what is basic in \n     one context can turn into applied in another. Trying to draw \n     such artificial dividing lines between interrelated and \n     intimately interwoven research areas sounds rather like \n     establishing union-style rules and rigid job definitions for \n     scientific research. Industry is increasingly moving to \n     eliminate such obstacles to productivity and flexibility on \n     the factory floor. It seems oddly retrogressive to try to \n     institute them now in the world of research.\n       It is also purest fantasy--if indeed not just plain \n     cynicism--to expect the private sector to fill the gap left \n     by Congress' gutting of government investment in basic \n     research. No corporation required to fulfill Wall Street's \n     merciless insistence on continuous quarterly growth can \n     afford to invest in such risky, \n\n[[Page S 14188]]\n     speculative, long-term ventures with no immediate, identifiable \n     positive impact on its bottom line.\n       When you get right down to it, this is the government's \n     job, and Congress is shirking it.\n       Of course, Americans will probably persist in having \n     children (people are buying junk bonds again, too) but if we \n     pursue our present course in science and basic research, \n     those kids will not live as well and will occupy a weaker and \n     less confident position in the world of the coming century. \n     That looks to me like a remarkably odd example of the current \n     Congress' vaunted family values.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, what she points out in this article is much \nthe same as what was pointed out in the Wall Street Journal article. It \nis a recounting of what is happening in American industry.\n  And she says in that, and starts off--I was rather taken by the \nanalogy she makes. She says:\n\n       If Congress applied the same logic to families as it is \n     applying to the federally funded university research, it \n     would decree that nobody have children.\n\n  Who knows what the outcome of a child being born is? You do not \nreally know for sure.\n\n       But without children, there is no future. And without high-\n     risk, basic research unrelated to specific products or bottom \n     lines, the reservoir of technological advances on which the \n     current country's prosperity and power is based will run dry \n     in an alarmingly short time . . . As little as human conceit \n     might wish to admit it, the truly fundamental discoveries \n     seldom occur where we decided to look. Instead, they have a \n     curious habit of turning up on accidental bypaths when \n     researchers were looking for something else entirely . . . \n     [Things like] penicillin, X-rays, the enabling advances that \n     made transistors and DNA fingerprinting possible.\n\n  Those things occurred when people were looking for something else \nwhen they were doing basic research.\n  Mr. President, at a time when both the private and Federal investment \nin science, research and development is declining, we truly do have to \nask ourselves, Who is going to be responsible to the students \ngraduating in the class of 2015? Quite simply, the international space \nstation is the next logical step along with other efforts in our \njourney into space and our investment in the future, our investment in \nresearch for the future. Along with that, the station is also the \nlargest international scientific cooperative effort ever undertaken.\n  The space station is being built right now. We have over 25 tons, \n50,000 pounds of flight hardware has already been fabricated here in \nthe United States. It is already built. The first launch is on \nschedule, still on schedule for late 1997, with the station permanently \nmanned in 2002.\n  I would add that in addition to those 50,000 pounds of American \nequipment already fabricated, already built, we have over 60,000 pounds \nby our international partners. So, with the space station weighing over \n400,000--just about 400,000 pounds--we have over one-fourth of the \nstation already built, already prepared, more coming out every day.\n  Contrary to what was said earlier, the space station will provide a \nworld-class, permanently occupied laboratory in Earth orbit. Research \nwill be conducted on the station in a whole range of scientific \ndisciplines, including biotechnology and biomedicine, material science, \ncombustion science, and other areas.\n  This will truly be a science and technology institute in space. It is \nthe promise of research on this international space station. The \nscience and technology institute in space will have specialty areas of \nbiotechnology, physiology, material science, combustion science, \nphysics, and biology on the space station. And to carry that out there \nhave been cooperative efforts between NASA and NIH. We have U.S. space \nstation research facilities that will be used by other nations as well \nas ourselves.\n  You know, control over gravity is something we have not been able to \nhave throughout the whole history of the world. I remember when I was a \nboy back in New Concord, OH. It was great to get up in a big oak tree \ndown on a little cliff. I thought it was great. You were sort of almost \ngoing out of this world at that point, it seemed to me, you were so \nhigh up. Little did I know I would be able to fly later on, get farther \noff the ground and farther up in space. It has been a whole progression \never since the Wright brothers of how high we can go and use our new \ncapabilities to do basic research.\n  But now, all at once, control over gravity will allow scientists to \nexplore the natural world in unprecedented ways. All life on Earth, \nincluding human life, has evolved under the direct influence of \ngravity. The space station provides scientists the laboratory they need \nto explore the role that gravity plays in the cycle of life from \nconception through old age. On the space station scientists will \nexplore the systems of the body ranging from muscle and bone to the \nimmune system under low-gravity conditions that are unique, not only in \nthe history of biomedical research, but also in the history of all life \non Earth.\n  On Earth, gravity limits our ability to explore and understand the \nfundamental principles that govern basic physical processes. Even such \nthings as burning of fuel, the solidification of metals, the growth of \ncrystals, space station research promises to expand our understanding \nand control over these processes that are vital to the economic health \nof our country. Using just the 7- to 14-day low-gravity opportunities \nthat have been afforded by space shuttle flights, orbital researchers \nhave already begun to deliver a steady stream of scientific and \ntechnological insights that are strengthening the U.S. economy and \nimproving the quality of life on Earth for generations yet to come.\n  The space station will allow researchers from the universities, \nindustry, and Government to expand the promising research begun on the \nspace shuttle by conducting high-quality science and technology \nexperiments year round.\n  Space station will support global environmental observation, high-\nenergy astrophysics research. The international space station \nrepresents only one-seventh of 1 percent of the Federal budget, about \n15 percent of the NASA budget, but one-seventh of 1 percent of our \nnational budget. I think that is a good investment.\n  Now, a little more detail. I mentioned biotechnology. By studying \nprotein crystals and protein crystal growth, orbital research enhances \nour ability to accurately describe proteins and enzymes and viruses at \nthe molecular level. This ability, coupled with research on these \nfundamental building blocks of life, will enable scientists to develop \nnew drugs and vaccines more quickly and effectively.\n  Space station researchers will study the processes that control the \ngrowth of human tissues outside the body called tissue culture. Future \nresearch may lead to an improved understanding of normal and abnormal \ntissue, cancerous tissue, with important implications for the \ndevelopment of new drug therapies and applications for transplant \nresearch in the physiology.\n  Space research provides unique insights into how the heart and lungs \nfunction, the growth and maintenance of muscles and bone, perception, \ncognition, and balance in the neurosciences, and the regulation of the \nbody's many systems in regulatory physiology.\n  In combustion science, scientists use low gravity to simplify the \nstudy of complex combustion processes. Because combustion is used to \nproduce 85 percent of Earth's energy, even small improvements in \nefficiency will have large environmental and economic benefits.\n  In material science, researchers use low gravity to advance our \nunderstanding of the relationships among the structure, the processing, \nand properties of materials. Findings in material science have very \nbroad applicability to industrial processes, including the production \nof semiconductors, glass, metals, alloys, polymers, and ceramics.\n  Fluid physics: Researchers use low gravity to study the properties \nand behavior of fluids, liquids, gases and mixtures.\n  Fundamental knowledge of fluid behavior is essential to industrial \nactivities, ranging from energy production to materials engineering.\n  Microgravity physics: Scientists use low gravity to test fundamental \ntheories of physics with degrees of accuracy that far exceed the \ncapacity of Earthbound science.\n  Physics in low gravity expands our understanding of changes in the \nstate \n\n[[Page S 14189]]\nof matter, including those changes responsible for high-temperature \nsuperconductivity. If we make major breakthroughs in that area alone, \nit will likely be worth the expenditure on the space station in my \nopinion.\n  Gravitational biology: Scientists study gravity's influence on the \ndevelopment, growth and internal processes of plants and animals. Their \nresults expand fundamental knowledge that would benefit medical, \nagricultural, and other industries.\n  I mentioned first in that list of things we are looking at \nbiotechnology. Let me give more detail on that.\n  Protein crystal growth data from space that can revolutionize \npharmaceuticals in the 21st century. Rapid advances in biotechnology, \ncombined with enhanced data from protein structures, promise to \nrevolutionize the pharmaceutical industry.\n  Researchers seek to design the structure of proteins and ultimately \nto design drugs that interact with them. Penicillin is a well-known \nexample of a drug that works by blocking a protein's function. In order \nto define protein structure with precision, researchers analyze protein \ncrystals. Unfortunately, many Earth-grown crystals have flaws that \nlimit their usefulness as data sources, or they are just plain too \nsmall to provide adequate data.\n  Orbital experiments provide researchers with superior protein \ncrystals for analysis and also help scientists understand the \nfundamental concepts about the crystallization process. These are \nthings that they cannot do the same on Earth. This information can be \nused to improve crystallization techniques on Earth, in fact.\n  Researchers will soon use enhanced data on protein structure derived \nfrom space station research to design a new generation of drugs to \ntarget a long list of specific diseases. These drugs promise to \nrevolutionize health care, and orbital research will feed this \nrevolution with the protein structure data that it needs.\n  NASA researchers have already used space shuttle missions to produce \nprotein crystals for a variety of clinical conditions, including \ncancer, diabetes, emphysema, and immune system disorders. These space-\ngrown crystals were far superior to any crystals grown on Earth for \nrevealing the structures of protein and supporting the development of \ndrugs.\n  Examples: Recombinant DNA human insulin. The Hauptman Institute in \nBuffalo, in collaboration with Eli Lilly & Co., has obtained an \nimproved description of human drug concept based on space-grown \ncrystals. To those who say nothing has come out of the program, that is \njust not true. They are currently working on a design of a nontoxic \ndrug that will bind insulin, thereby improving the treatment of \ndiabetic patients.\n  Porcin elastase. Elastase is a protein which is involved in \nemphysema. The refined structure of this protein was obtained using \nspace-grown crystals. Vertex Pharmaceuticals is designing drugs based \non this data to improve treatment for emphysema.\n  HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. NASA is supporting the microgravity \ncrystallization of HIV reverse transcriptase, a critical enzyme for \nviral replication, and it is believed that this research will better \ndefine the enzyme structure so that effective pharmaceuticals can be \ndeveloped to inhibit the HIV virus.\n  The structural biology research group at Marshall Space Flight \nCenter, NASA's center of excellence in biotechnology, was the first to \npublish the structure of a major human antibody that recognizes the \nAIDS virus.\n  Human serum albumin, HSA, is a primary binding protein in the blood \nand is responsible for distributing drugs throughout the body. Eli \nLilly & Co., again, is using this structural information from space-\ngrown crystals to design drugs that exhibit improved interactions with \nHSA, the human serum albumin. The potential impact of this HSA \nstructure on drug design and delivery is enormous.\n  Protein crystal growth promises a pharmaceutical revolution. \nBiotechnology is broadly defined as a set of techniques for rearranging \nand manufacturing biological molecules, tissues and living organisms.\n  This field is one of the most dynamic segments of our high-technology \neconomy. Armed with the advanced techniques of biotechnology and \ndetailed data on the structure of key proteins, researchers are already \ncreating new generations of drugs. Researchers use data on the \nstructure of proteins to design drugs at the molecular level that will \ninteract with specific proteins and treat specific diseases.\n  This approach promises to produce superior drugs for a wide range of \nconditions and may replace the trial-and-error approach to drug \ndevelopment that has been the rule for centuries.\n  The international space station will become one of the world's \npremier sources for critical data on protein structures needed for this \nnew method of drug development. In addition, the space station will be \nused to study and understand the physics involved in protein crystals \nin order to overcome the difficulties which currently limit much of \nthis research on Earth.\n  Let me list the companies that are involved with this. These are \ncompanies that not only interested, they are cooperating, they are \nputting their own money into this kind of research: Schering-Plough of \nNew Jersey; Eli Lilly in New Jersey; Upjohn in Michigan; Bristol-Myers \nSquibb in New Jersey; SmithKline Beecham in Pennsylvania; BioCryst in \nAlabama; Du Pont Merck in Delaware; Eastman Kodak in New York; and \nVertex in Massachusetts are working with NASA's center for \nmacromolecular chrystallography to produce high-quality protein \ncrystals for new drug development.\n  Researchers have already used space shuttle missions to produce \nsuperior protein crystals for research on clinical conditions including \ncancer, diabetes, emphysema and immune system disorders.\n  Can I claim we have the answers in all those matters at this point? \nNo, I cannot, but I certainly can claim that we are on the way with a \nwhole new approach in research because of the protein crystal growth \nthat has already occurred.\n  In collaboration with Eli Lilly & Co., the Hauptman Institute of \nBuffalo, NY, is using data from space on human insulin to design a drug \nthat will bind insulin, thereby improving the treatment of diabetic \npatients. NASA is supporting space research on an enzyme that the HIV, \nthe virus that causes AIDS, needs to reproduce. This research seeks to \nbetter design the enzyme structure so that effective pharmaceuticals \ncan be developed to inhibit the HIV virus.\n  The pictures of some of the protein crystals that have been grown in \nspace show that they come out several times larger than they do in \nsimilar growth attempted on Earth. It means they are easier to deal \nwith, easier to define, easier to work with for the researchers on \nEarth.\n  Another area in which work is going on: I was at Houston not long \nago, just before the flight of STS-70, the so-called ``Ohio flight,'' \nwhere four out of the five members of the flight crew were from Ohio. \nOne of the pieces of research equipment they were taking up was called \na bioreactor. Let me talk about that for just a moment.\n  Growing tissue samples, tissue culturing is one of the fundamental \ngoals of biomedical research. Scientists use laboratory containers \ncalled bioreactors to grow or culture samples of body tissues. \nScientists could use cancer tumors and other tissues that are \nsuccessfully grown outside the body to test and study treatments, like \nchemotherapy, without risking harm to patients.\n  These tissues from bioreactors will also offer important medical \ninsights into how tissues grow and develop in the body. NASA engineers \nhave already created breakthrough technologies for cell culture \nresearch on the ground and major breakthroughs can be expected once \ntime on the space station becomes more available, and they have already \ndone some of the first work on flights.\n  NASA-developed bioreactors have already produced the first 80-day \nlung culture, the first normal human intestine culture, and major \nbreakthroughs in the quality of cancer tumor cultures. Those superior \ntissues may be grown in Earthbound bioreactors when compared with \ntraditional cell culturing techniques. There are still limits on Earth \nto the size and quality of the tissue. What the scientists are doing on \nthe space program, they believe that far superior tissues can be grown \nin the \n\n[[Page S 14190]]\nextended microgravity afforded on the space station, and preliminary \ntests on the space shuttle support this idea. They show that the \ntheories appear to be correct.\n\n  In the long term, tissues cultured outside the body then may be used \ndirectly for replacing damaged tissues or treating diseases or \neventually replacing organs.\n  Some of the highlights of recent research: Dr. Jeanne Becker of the \nUniversity of South Florida has applied NASA technology to create a \nbreakthrough in culturing ovarian cancer tumors for cancer research. \nDr. Josh Zimmerberg of the NIH National Institute for Child Health and \nDevelopment is using NASA developed bioreactors in NASA-funded resident \ntechnical staff to pursue the AIDS research goals under a 1994-98 NASA \nNIH joint venture.\n  Dr. Lisa Freed of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is using \na NASA bioreactor to grow cartilage cells on biodegradable scaffolds. \nHer work shows a clear prospect for using the space station to produce \nmodels and transplantable cartilage tissues that could revolutionize \ntreatment for joint diseases and injuries.\n  I mentioned the flight of STS-70. I was there with the crew when they \nwere building up for this flight in July of this year. In July of this \nyear, a NASA bioreactor flew to orbit aboard the space shuttle \nDiscovery. The primary purpose of this experiment was to test the \nperformance of the bioreactor, which worked successfully. Poorly \ndifferentiated human colon carcinoma cells were grown in a bioreactor \naboard Discovery. Their growth was compared with that of similar cells \nin a bioreactor in normal gravity, as well as in conventional, two-\ndimensional tissue cultures. The space-grown clusters of cells were \napproximately twice as large as the ground-based samples. But the \nsignificance of this must be determined by much study on the ground and \nmany more data points from the space experiments. Ground-based analysis \nby Dr. J. Milburn Jessup of the Harvard Medical School will address the \nhistology of the specimens and the production of specific protein such \nas CEA.\n  NASA and NIH have signed agreements on biomedical research. NASA and \nNIH have recently signed an agreement that will combine the unique \ntalents and experience of both agencies in biomedical research and \nexploit NASA's bioreactor technology to produce three-dimensional \ntissue cultures for laboratory research. This agreement will increase \nthe capabilities of biomedical researchers throughout NASA by \ntransferring NASA technology to NIH and establishing a center within \nthe National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\n  The new center will teach this new technology to hundreds of \nneighboring NIH intramural laboratories that currently employ other \ntissue culture techniques as part of their ongoing research.\n  The initial goal of the agreement is to engineer a human lymph node \nmodel for AIDS research and then to extend the use of this technology \nto a broad spectrum of tissues available at NIH. This collaborative \neffort will enable researchers to culture tissues previously deemed too \ncomplex for current tissue culturing technology.\n  To accelerate the development of this critical tissue culturing, \ntechnology research grants were recently awarded under the NASA \nresearch announcement. Included in the selections are support for two \nresearch centers located at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \nat Cambridge, and the Wooster Institute in Philadelphia, that will \ntransfer the NASA bioreactor technology for culturing three-dimensional \ntissues to university researchers. These centers expand the pace of \ntechnology transfer in the biotechnology areas begun when NASA and NIH \nestablished a joint cooperative program within the NIH Institute for \nChild, Health and Human Development to exploit the NASA-developed \nbioreactor technology.\n  Dr. Jeanne Becker has pointed out that it has a potential particular \nbenefit for cell culture research and breast cancer research. \nTechniques developed for use in space have advanced the state of the \nart for growing ovarian and breast cancer samples in the laboratory, \nleading to progress in women's health. Why is it important to focus on \novarian and breast cancer? Well, as a result of better forms of \ntreatment and improved means of early diagnose, overall survival rates \nfrom cancer have doubled since the early 1900's. However, breast cancer \nand ovarian cancer continue to be responsible for over one-third of all \ncancer in women.\n  Recent statistics indicate that one in nine women will be diagnosed \nwith breast cancer during her lifetime. Although screening mammography \nhas contributed significantly to the early detection of breast cancer, \nsurvival rates for this disease have remained relatively unchanged for \nover a decade. Equally discouraging is the fact that current survival \nfor ovarian cancer is nearly the same as it was over 30 years ago, with \na 5-year survival rate of 39 percent. These statistics underscore the \nneed for more research in these areas and the use of improved \ntechnologies to better study these diseases which destroy the lives of \nso many women.\n  For more than three decades, humankind has benefited from new \ntechnologies derived from NASA-sponsored research, including studies \nfocused on several areas pertinent to women's health. Now, through a \njoint collaboration between NASA and the University of South Florida, \nresearch focused on the development of three-dimensional tissue models \nof breast and ovarian cancer is being undertaken to gain a better \nunderstanding of breast and ovarian cancer.\n  Using a specialized tissue culture chamber designed by NASA, the \nbioreactor, scientists are able to generate three-dimensional cellular \ngrowth that forms tissue-like structures that are similar to tissues \nfound in the human body. Using conventional culture techniques, breast \nand ovarian cancer cells do not grow to form a tumor. In the NASA \nbioreactor, cancer cells have grown into masses that resemble the \noriginal tumor.\n  So when opponents of the space station say what good has come out of \nit, I would suggest that new leads into ovarian and breast cancer may \nbe worth the price that we pay. For the first time, these cancer cells \nhave grown into masses that resemble the original tumor, and in their \nsame three-dimensional orientation.\n  Through the benefits of NASA-developed technology, medical science \nnow has a means to culture cancer tissue samples in the laboratory so \nthat they closely resemble structures found in the human body. The \nability to grow these particular types of tumors is a real advantage \nbecause they are extremely difficult to culture outside the body. In \nparticular, cancer researchers continually strive toward the \ndevelopment of improved tissue models of human disease, and the ability \nto produce reliable tissue models of breast and ovarian cancer is \ncritical for furthering our understanding of the factors important in \nthe growth and spread of these devastating diseases.\n  The breast and ovarian cancer tissue samples cultured in NASA'S \nbioreactor will be evaluated for usefulness in testing sensitivity, \nchemotherapeutic, and biological agents, including hormonal therapy, \nparticularly important as a treatment for breast and ovarian cancer.\n  Because tumor cells can be grown in much the way they are arranged in \nthe body, then a more authentic tumor specimen can be obtained to test \nthe responsiveness of these cells to new types of agents.\n  Finally, the models will be instrumental in studying alterations in \ncancer-associated genes that occurred during tumor progression. Breast \nand ovarian cancer studies being undertaken at the University of South \nFlorida demonstrate the type of biomedical research that is a direct \noffshoot of NASA's bioreactor technology. National tissue research has \ngiven the medical community a powerful new tool to study how these \ncancerous tissues form.\n  Mr. President, in particular, another example of this is cartilage \ndevelopment in NASA bioreactor. Cartilage is the material that makes up \nthe joints in the skeleton. The bioreactor reproducibly enables the \ngrowth of cartilage from a small type of cell, and this level of \nmaturity is rarely achieved by any other culture method. \n\n[[Page S 14191]]\n\n  Mature cartilage is shown as the red-stained material here. Research \nconducted with Dr. Lisa Freed at MIT addresses the use of reactor \ntechnology and microgravity to engineer cartilage for replacement and \ntransplantation.\n  In simpler terms cartilage grown in the bioreactor--in the middle \npicture here--resembles normal cartilage--in the top picture--much more \nclosely than cartilage grown by standard methods in the bottom picture.\n  The same with colon cancer. Colon cancer manifests with polyp-like \nstructures in the colon. The tumor-like structures are produced in the \nbioreactor by culturing normal fibroblast cells with colon cancer \ncells.\n  Standard culture techniques do not provide 3-D models of cancer. It \nmakes it very difficult. The bioreactor not only grows 3-D tumors, but \ninduces specialized structures called glands, akin to that in native \ntissue.\n  Dr. J.M. Jessup at Harvard University is molding human colon cancers \nfor research, and therapeutic testing is facilitated by culturing the \ncancer cells in the NASA bioreactor. The explanation is that the \nordinary culture on the far left is not developing a recognizable \ntumor-like structure. The two pictures on the right show the colon \ncancer cells in the NASA bioreactor do develop into tumor-like \nstructures.\n  Physiology on the space station: A new window on the human body. \nVirtually every system in the body--from bones and muscles to the \nimmune system--is tied to and affected by the force of gravity. When \nhuman and animal research subjects travel to the low-gravity \nenvironment of Earth orbit, each system is affected and can be studied \nunder conditions that are unique not only in the history of biomedical \nresearch but also in the history of life on Earth.\n  The unique value of orbital research in physiology and biotechnology \nhas led to a vigorous program of cooperation between NASA and the \nNational Institutes of Health that includes 18 cooperative agreements \nand a series of flight experiments.\n  Focus: Brain and nervous system research. Because of the profound \neffects that the lack of gravity has on the sense of balance and \norientation, basic neurosensory research conducted in space offers a \nunique opportunity for insights into the ways in which the brain and \nbody interact. This research has great potential for helping \nresearchers understand the basis of learning and memory.\n  Highlights of recent research: Space shuttle research on the body's \nbalance system has resulted in new discoveries of sensory pathways and \nthe nervous system's capacity to adapt. This fundamental advance in our \nunderstanding of the brain may aid in the development of improved \ntreatments for nervous system disorders.\n  NASA research has produced computer techniques for creating three-\ndimensional maps of neurons within gravity-sensing tissues. This work \nhas enormous potential both for advancing neuroscience and for \nenhancing rapid access to many other kinds of medical imaging data. \nDetailed information on the way neurons are organized in the nervous \nsystem (neural nets) may someday support the development of new \ncomputer architectures.\n  Focus: Musculoskeletal research. Osteoporosis affects some 25 million \nAmericans, and it is estimated that this disease leads to 1.3 million \nbone fractures annually. Unless new preventive measures and treatments \nare found, associated costs are expected to rise to $30-$60 billion per \nyear by the year 2020.\n  Exposure to low gravity causes otherwise healthy young astronauts to \nexperience rapid loss of bone mass--bone demineralization--comparable \nto osteoporosis but progressing at a much faster rate. By studying bone \nand muscle mass reduction in astronauts, space station research may \ncontribute to our understanding of the causes of osteoporosis and help \nresearchers develop preventative or rehabilitative regimes for \nbedridden or elderly patients.\n  Highlights of recent research: In cooperation with investigators at \nGenentech, Inc., NASA researchers have demonstrated that muscle atrophy \ncan be prevented using a combination of exercise and growth hormone. \nThis approach opens new therapeutic avenues for rehabilitation, as well \nas for preventing some of the changes that accompany aging.\n  Orbital research has demonstrated that changes in hormones do not \ncompletely explain the rapid loss of bone calcium that accompanies \nspaceflight. These findings may lead to new developments in diagnosing \nand treating skeletal disorders such as osteoporisis.\n  NASA researchers have developed a new theory of remodeling in bone. \nIn addition to stimulating new avenues of basic research, this new \nmodel has been applied by others to evaluate artificial joints, to \nstudy the influence of exercise on bone density, and to study age-\nassociated bone loss.\n  NASA and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and \nSkin Diseases [NIAMS] are cooperating to take full advantage of low \ngravity as a research tool. The NIAMS Osteoporosis Centers are \nexpanding their participation in research related to spaceflight, and \nproceedings of a joint workshop were recently published in the \nFederation of American Societies of Experimental Biology Journal.\n  The bone loss observed in space crews bears strong similarities to \nosteoporosis associated with aging. Astronauts lose the same percentage \nof their bone mass over a period of 8 months in space as the average \nhuman loses between the ages of 50 and 60. Spaceflight offers an \nopportunity to study the process of bone loss (bone demineralization) \nat an accelerated rate and to evaluate strategies for treatment and \nprevention of osteoporosis in months instead of years.\n  Materials science on the space station: The scientific foundation for \n21st century high-tech materials. The goal of materials science \nresearch is to study how materials form and how the forming process \ncontrols a material's properties. By carefully studying and controlling \nthe processes by which materials are formed, materials scientists can \ndesign new alloys, ceramics, glasses, and polymers to improve the \nperformance of products ranging from contact lenses to car engines.\n  The production process for most materials includes steps that are \nvery heavily influenced by the force of gravity. The chance to observe \nthese processes in low gravity promises to increase our fundamental \nunderstanding of production processes and of the materials produced. \nScientists will use these insights from space research to improve the \nproperties of materials ranging from glass and steel to semiconductors \nand plastics.\n  Highlights of recent research: The experiments of Dr. Martin \nGlicksman of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute flown aboard the \nspace shuttle have produced groundbreaking new insights into how the \nstructure of metal forms. Results of his experiment will aid in the \ndevelopment of stronger or more corrosion-resistant metal alloys.\n  Based on his orbital research, Dr. Julian Szekely of the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology developed new mathematical \ntechniques to model the behavior of molten metals. These techniques \nhave been used by the metals and semiconductor industries to design \nassignment and to improve predictions of the behavior of metals during \nprocessing.\n  Space shuttle experiments have demonstrated that when gravity's \neffects are substantially reduced, other forces (such as surface \ntension) can predominate. These experiments have shown that secondary \nforces are more significant than previously thought, affecting many \nground-based materials production techniques in unexpected ways. \nResults of this research open the door for further study and improved \nprocesses and materials for the future.\n  Combustion science on the space station: Fundamental research on the \nworld's predominant source of energy. Combustion (burning) has been a \nsubject of vigorous scientific research for over a century. By \nconducting research on the space station, scientists can study subtle \naspects of combustion normally masked by fluid flows caused by Earth's \ngravity.\n  Combustion accounts for approximately 85 percent of the world's \nenergy production--as well as a significant fraction of the world's \natmospheric pollution. Breakthroughs in combustion science will have \nfar-reaching effects for the economy and the environment. For example, \na 2-percent increase in \n\n[[Page S 14192]]\nburner efficiency would save the United States $8 billion per year.\n  Low-gravity research may also produce breakthroughs in combustion \nsynthesis, the process by which valuable materials are created as the \nproducts of fire. Examples include carbon fibers for high-strength, \nlightweight composite materials and fullerenes, a novel form of carbon.\n  Highlights of recent research: Combustion science researchers using \nNASA Lewis Research Center facilities have applied for a patent on a \ndevice that improves air quality by stabilizing fuel-lean flames and \nreducing NOX (oxides of nitrogen), a major source of air \npollution.\n  At the recent 25th International Symposium on Combustion, the most \nimportant meeting of combustion scientists in the world, nearly 10 \npercent of the papers presented involved low-gravity combustion \nresearch.\n  NASA investigators have used the space shuttle to obtain and analyze \nthe first data on Burke-Schumann gas jet diffusion flames (a classical \nflame configuration treated in virtually all combustion textbooks). \nThese data represent the first true verification of this theory \navailable since its original development in 1928.\n  The spherical shape of candle flames in low-gravity illustrates the \nnew perspective scientists will use to pursue research into subtle \naspects of combustion impossible to study accurately on Earth.\n  By studying combustion on the space station, scientists can observe \ncertain aspects of burning that are hidden by the effects of gravity on \nEarth and thus advance our fundamental understanding of this vitally \nimportant field. Combustion research could lead to enhanced energy \nefficiency, reduced pollution, and improved processes for producing \nhigh-technology materials such as carbon fibers.\n  Physics and biology on the space station: Fundamental research laying \nthe foundation for future applications.\n  Fluid physics and transport phenomena: One of the most significant \nforces affecting fluids--liquids, gases and mixtures--on Earth is \ngravity. In orbiting spacecraft, where gravity's effects are reduced \nmany times, scientists can observe aspects of fluid behavior that are \ndifficult or impossible to see in normal gravity.\n  A deeper understanding of fluid behavior has broad applicability. \nFluid flows play important roles in the production processes of our \nmost important industries. For example, the performance of a powerplant \ndepends on the flow characteristics of vapor-liquid mixtures, and oil \nrecovery from partially depleted reservoirs depends on how liquids flow \nthrough porous rocks.\n  Low-gravity research has already played a central role in stimulating \nnew understanding of the ways in which heat and materials are \ntransported in semiconductor crystal growth, metals processing, \nseparation of biological molecules, and protein crystal growth.\n  Microgravity physics: Research called microgravity physics uses the \nunique properties of space to test physics theories at levels of \naccuracy that are impossible on Earth. This fundamental research will \nadvance our understanding of theories relevant to everything from high-\ntemperature superconductivity to weather prediction. This research has \nthe potential for redefining our most basic assumptions about the \nuniverse.\n  In 1992, an orbital research experiment produced observations that \ntested renormalization group theory with a degree of precision five \ntimes greater than any experiment conducted on Earth. Renormalization \ngroup theory is a Nobel Prize-winning physics theory with broad \napplicability to particle physics and high-temperature \nsuperconductivity.\n  Gravitational biology: The low-gravity conditions of spaceflight \nprovide biologists with a unique research opportunity to answer \nfundamental questions about the basic functions of living organisms. \nGravitational biologists study gravity's influence on the development, \ngrowth, and internal machinery of life, including individual cells as \nwell as complete plants and animals. Expanding fundamental biological \nknowledge will provide broad long-term benefits in medicine, \nagriculture, and industry.\n  Under normal Earth gravity, the gas occupies the top of the pipe \nbecause it is lighter--less dense--than the liquid. When gravity is \nreduced, the gas forms a core down the middle of the pipe. Under low-\ngravity conditions, weight and density become less important and \nscientists can study other forces that dictate the behavior of the \nliquid-gas mixture.\n  Gravity exerts a strong influence on the properties and behavior of \nfluids--liquids and gases. Aboard the space station, researchers will \nstudy aspects of fluid behavior that are hidden by gravity on Earth. \nIncreased knowledge of fluid physics is broadly applicable to a variety \nof industrial processes.\n  Technology development on the space station: Paving the way for \nhumanity's future in space--and on Earth. The international space \nstation will both foster the development of advanced commercial \ntechnologies and provide a test bed for engineering research on orbit.\n  Electric power: Power generation and storage systems research will \nproduce long-term data on advanced materials, components, and \nelectrical power systems, including flexible thin-film solar arrays and \nadvanced power converters that will improve electrical systems on \nEarth.\n  Robotics and remote operations: Space station research will produce \nadvanced, reliable robotic systems and systems for remote operations. \nThese systems have enormous potential for improving productivity and \nsafety in industry and agriculture.\n  Advanced life support technology: Space station research will develop \nadvanced life-support technologies that combine physical, chemical, and \nbiological processes to create highly efficient recycling systems. \nThese technologies will have numerous applications to improving the \nquality of life on Earth, including: advanced waste processing and \nrecycling techniques to reduce pollution; crop growth research capable \nof improving the efficiency of Earth-based hydroponics and other \ncontrolled crop production systems; vastly improved air and water \nquality sensors and analyzers and air revitalization systems; and \nautomatic systems for identifying microbes to provide diagnostic \nsupport to detect a broad range of infectious diseases.\n  Telemedicine: Telemedicine is the ability to practice medicine \nthrough the exchange of data and images between geographically remote \nlocations using telecommunications technologies. NASA is a pioneer in \ntelemedicine techniques for maintaining the health of astronauts on \norbit and will continue to develop telemedicine systems through space \nstation development. Telemedicine has the potential to reduce health \ncare costs while improving the quality of care, especially for \nunderserved populations--such as rural America or inner-city areas--and \nthe victims of disaster.\n  NASA-NIH cooperation: Conducting the world's best biomedical \nresearch.\n  As the world's premier organization in life and biomedical sciences, \nthe National Institutes of Health [NIH] had access to the world's best \nbiomedical scientists, who need a variety of laboratory resources. \nNASA's biomedical research program maintains and develops a rich supply \nof unique and specialized resources, including laboratories and access \nto the weightless environment of space. Thus, cooperation between the \ntwo agencies strengthens the performance of each and helps ensure the \nhighest possible return on America's investment in biomedical research.\n  Cooperation between NASA and NIH has expanded rapidly as the research \ncommunity's understanding of the value of orbital research has grown. \nThis cooperation expands access to NASA facilities and resources to a \nbroader community of the world's finest research scientists. \nCooperation between these two premier Federal science agencies \nleverages NASA's unique facilities, including orbital facilities, to \nproduce the maximum return on America's investment in biomedical \nresearch.\n  NASA and NIH have executed 18 cooperative agreements to date, and \njoint activities have included scientific workshops; ground-based and \nflight research; and other specialized activities, such as a \n``Spaceline'' reference system developed with the National Library of \nMedicine.\n  Neurolab, NASA's next dedicated life sciences space shuttle mission, \nwill \n\n[[Page S 14193]]\ncarry investigations funded by five different institutes of NIH. NIH's \nDivision of Research Grants will manage the scientific peer review for \nall Neurolab proposals. Neurolab will be launched on the space shuttle \nin March 1998.\n  NASA looks forward to an expanding level of cooperation with NIH as \norbital research enters the space station era. NIH researchers are \nexpected to use the space station's next generation life sciences \nfacilities--including the Human Research Facility, the Gravitational \nBiology Facility, and the Centrifuge Facility--in pursuit of national \nbiomedical research goals.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a table printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n              NASA-NIH COOPERATION: COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS              \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      NIH       Date of \n              Field of cooperation                  partner    agreement\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBiomedical/Behavioral Studies...................

U.S. research facilities on the international space \nstation--the United States and our international space station partners \nwill equip the space station with state-of-the-art laboratory \nfacilities. The space station will allow for continuous operation of \nmultiple experiments. It will have highly advanced data down-link and \nup-link capabilities that will permit researchers to monitor and \noperate many aspects of space station experiments from terminals in \nlaboratories on the ground.\n  With the exception of the centrifuge, all laboratory facilities will \nbe designed to fit into standard payload racks. This modular approach \nwill allow facilities to be upgraded and modified as needed and will \nallow facilities developed by one partner to fit into rack space \nsupplied by another. The United States is developing six major \nfacilities.\n\n\n                     The six major U.S. facilities\n\n  Biotechnology facility: will fill one experiment rack and support \ninvestigations in protein crystal growth and cell culture research.\n  Fluids and combustion facility: consists of multiple modules: \nCombustion module: includes a combustion chamber to support hardware \ndesigned for specific investigations and several viewing ports for a \nvariety of imaging systems to record flame characteristics.\n  Fluids module: includes several experiment-specific test chambers \nsupplied with equipment such as laser optics, heaters, and etc.\n  Space station furnace facility: multiple module facility for \nmaterials science research comprising controls, diagnostics, and \nexperiment hardware designed for specific research areas.\n  Gravitational biology facility: two-rack facility composed of modular \nspecimen habitats for plants and animals, support systems, and \nequipment needed to conduct research in cell, and development biology.\n  Centrifuge facility: includes centrifuge rotor, gloveboxs, Habitat \nHolding Units (two racks--for plants and/or rodents), and a service \nrack; the centrifuge rotor will employ force from zero to twice the \nforce of gravity on Earth to support research in all life science \ndisciplines.\n  Human research facility: four-rack facility with equipment to assess \ncrew health, conduct research on how the human body responds and adapts \nto weightlessness, develop countermeasures, and conduct basic human \nresearch aimed at advancing knowledge in areas relevant to human \nhealth. This facility supports the following disciplines: \ncardiopulmonary physiology, neuroscience, musculoskeletal research, \nregulatory physiology, environmental health, and human factors.\n  Facts on Life and Microgravity Researchers--Statistics. There were \n654 total lead investigators in 1994. Investigators represent over 85 \ninstitutions of higher learning and 35 laboratories and other \ninstitutions in 40 States and the District of Columbia. More than 780 \ngraduate students were supported through NASA research (1994). There \nwere more than 820 journal articles (1994). There were more than 1,400 \nnew research proposals in 1993 and 1994.\n  Background--Life and microgravity science research is solicited \nthrough an open, highly competitive, peer-review process to ensure that \nthe most meritorious science gains access to orbit.\n  Historically, NASA's resources have allowed the agency to accept only \nabout the top fifth of proposals it receives for life and microgravity \nresearch. This level of selectivity is comparable to that of other \nmajor U.S. science funders, such as the National Institutes of Health \nand the National Science Foundation. Only 10-20 percent of these \naccepted proposals lead to flight experiments, so selection for flight \nis even more competitive.\n  Because of the great demand for limited orbital research \nopportunities, NASA selects research for flight opportunities only if \nit cannot be conducted on Earth. Flight research is selected from and \nsupported by a larger research effort on the ground.\n  NASA is fully committed to its close working relationship with the \nscientific community and to full access to NASA facilities for the most \nmeritorious scientific research. NASA works with the scientific \ncommunity through its advisory committees and subcommittees, the \nNational Research Council, and working groups of distinguished \nscientists.\n  Mr. President, that is only some of the advantages. I just hit the \nhighlights of some of these things today.\n  The experiments that can be run in the space station are a whole new \nwindow on the human body.\n  New work on the human body in some of the space research and the \nphysiology of it applies to the body's balance system. New discoveries \nof the sensory pathways; nervous system capacity to adapt would have \ndirect relationships here on Earth.\n  We have new windows on the human body muscular skeletal research. \nOsteoporosis affects 25 million Americans, and the disease leads to 1.3 \nmillion bone fractures annually. There is no place better to look into \nthis type of thing because on the space station the astronauts' bodies \nimmediately start adapting and throwing off calcium in the bones, which \nis basically what happens in osteoporosis.\n  In cooperation with investigators at Genentech, NASA research \ndemonstrated new investigative techniques along that line as well as \nworking with the National Institute of Arthritis and the \nmusculoskeletal and skin diseases groups. All of these are things \ncoming out of the space shuttle today and can be done better on the \nlong-term space station.\n  I have page after page of different experiments being done by \nRensselear Polytechnic Institute, MIT, and others in particular fields. \nI will not delay these into the evening here.\n  Another area being looked into that has an area of great interest is \nfundamental research on the world's predominant source of energy, \ncombustion science. Combustion science is a very special one, and, for \nexample, just a 2 percent increase in burner efficiency would save the \nUnited States some $8 billion a year. Very basic research has already \ntaken place on some of the shuttle flights, and we would be able to do \na lot more lengthy research on the space station.\n  I wanted to close with a remark about the future for the young people \nof our country. Traveling around this country as I do, I believe that \nthere is no program that has given more to the young people of our \ncountry in the way of excitement about the future and encouragement to \nstay in math and science technology courses than have our activities in \nspace. Space represents an exciting future for our young people.\n\n[[Page S 14194]]\n\n  Mr. President, a number of these things were said awhile ago here on \nthe floor about what some of the researchers and scientists are saying \nabout the international space station. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a listing of what other scientists and \nresearchers are saying in support of the station. People are supporting \nsome of these activities and are very major supporters of the space \nstation. It is a long list of people and scientific groups that do \nsupport the space station.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n What the Nation's Leading Researchers and Scientists Are Saying About \n                    the International Space Station\n\n       Several years ago, Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray and I (the \n     officers of The Planetary Society) . . . opposed the then-\n     space station plan as serving no national purpose. . .. The \n     present plan is serving national and international interests. \n     For Congress to cancel the space station now . . . would end \n     the rationale for America's manned space program, and with it \n     would die the spirit of a great nation bold enough to seek \n     great achievements.--Carl Sagan and Louis Friedman, The \n     Planetary Society.\n       The program of protein crystal growth experiments sponsored \n     by NASA has been one of the real success stories in \n     microgravity sciences and applications. Protein crystal \n     growth research has made much progress, but must now move to \n     the next phase . . . which requires prolonged access to a \n     microgravity environment with potential for human \n     intervention on a continuing basis. This new phase will \n     require an orbiting platform such as that provided by the \n     International Space Station.--Howard M. Einspahr, Bristol-\n     Myers-Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute.\n       The AMA supports the continuation of the NASA and other \n     programs for conducting medical research and other research \n     with potential health care benefits on manned space flights, \n     including the continued development and subsequent operation \n     of the international space station.--Policy Adopted by the \n     American Medical Association.\n       Through the NASA-NIH linkage, the Space Station has become \n     a vitally important and unique laboratory for biomedical \n     research. In addition to its central role in aerospace \n     engineering and space exploration, the Space Station is an \n     investment in the future of biomedical research.--John W. \n     Rowe, M.D., Mount Sinai Medical Center.\n       A commitment to conduct continuous research for longer \n     periods of time in space is also essential. Ultimately, our \n     hope is to be able to crystallize proteins in microgravity, \n     conduct all x-ray data collection experiments in Space and \n     transmit the data to earth for processing. This can only be \n     done in a Space Station.--T.L. Nagabhushan, Ph.D., Schering-\n     Plough Research Institute.\n       AMWA supports the continuation of funding for NASA's \n     International Space Station because it provides one of the \n     most promising new vistas for medical research on diseases \n     that strike women and have unknown causes or cures.--Dianna \n     L. Dell, M.D., American Medical Women's Association.\n       Space laboratories allow scientific experiments that simply \n     cannot be duplicated on Earth. The space station offers the \n     potential of long term studies that are expecially exciting \n     to the biomedical researchers seeking to understand how cells \n     grow, divide, and mutate to cause diseases such as cancer and \n     immune deficiencies.--William T. Butler, M.D., Baylor College \n     of Medicine.\n       My institute has worked closely with the Center for \n     Macromolecular Crystallography at the University of Alabama \n     at Birmingham to perform two space shuttle crystal growth \n     experiments on the protein recombinant human insulin. It is \n     clear that the additional capabilities that the Space Station \n     will offer, * * * this type of research will progress at a \n     much more rapid rate. It is also evident to me that the Space \n     Station will offer similar advantages for the many other \n     areas of science that have been proposed for this unique \n     facility.--Herbert A. Hauptman, Ph.D., Nobel Laureate, Pres., \n     Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute.\n       NASA's ``cool suit'' literally has changed the lives of \n     some of those suffering from MS. The MSAA is hopeful, as new \n     findings continue to emerge from space-based research and the \n     possibilities that the International Space Station holds. \n     This research could be essential to MS patients.--John G. \n     Hodson, Sr., Multiple Sclerosis Association of America.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. As I said, my good friend from Arkansas--Senator Bumpers \nand I are good friends. We disagree annually on this particular \nsubject.\n  Every year we see new and wonderful benefits derived from NASA \nresearch. The space station for the first time in the history of all \nmankind opens up our ability to truly make use of microgravity. For all \nthese tens upon tens of thousands of years people have looked up and \nwondered what was up there and what we could do if we were up there. In \nour day, in our time, we finally can go up there and use this new \nresearch facility for the benefit of people all over this Earth.\n  That is a very not-so-brief rundown on some of these things. When you \nget into the outcome of NASA research, I could go on literally for \nseveral hours here this evening and just touch the surface on all of \nthis.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, first, I want to thank my friend from Ohio \nfor his very informed and very compelling arguments. I have had the \npleasure of traveling abroad with the Senator from Ohio, as my ranking \nmember has. If there is one area where the exploits and the \naccomplishments of our colleague from Ohio is well known throughout \nthis world, they know what he has done. They know of his leadership in \nspace.\n  I think he makes a very, very compelling argument based on his \nfirsthand knowledge and experience, and his commitment is second to \nnone. We thank him for his very compelling arguments in favor of it.\n  I know the Senator from Texas, who also is an expert and has very \nstrong views on the space station, is waiting to speak. But I do want \nto ask my colleagues if they could accommodate us by letting the \nranking member or me know about any amendments that they have pending. \nThere are so many issues in this bill that people would like to \ndiscuss, yet we have a very short timeline on which to work.\n  I believe the majority leader and the Democratic leader were both \nvery clear. They want to complete action on three appropriations \nbills--the prior remaining appropriations bills--prior to the end of \nthe fiscal year. I think that is something that every Member in this \nbody can appreciate. We want at least to complete action in this body \nbefore the end of the fiscal year. They have suggested that we should \nfinish this bill by Tuesday. If we are looking at late Tuesday night, I \nhope it is not sometime early Wednesday morning. But in order to do \nthis, we need to have the amendments, and we hope to be able to \naccommodate the schedules of all Senators giving them some time but \nkeeping it in a regular procedure so that we can complete this in a \ntimely fashion. I hope they will come forward. For tomorrow, \nparticularly people who want to debate for 2 hours, I urge them to make \na compelling 5-minute argument and submit the rest of their statements \nfor the Record. Because I promise we will read them, particularly if \nthey do not give them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I just want to echo the comments made by \nthe chairman. We really need to know what amendments wish to be offered \non the bill. We know of seven. We also need to know who would be \navailable tomorrow morning to offer their amendments to the measure; \npeople who are going to offer the amendments from the Finance Committee \nand the Labor Committee.\n  So, please. If you have amendments, let us know. Be prepared to \ndebate them. We are ready to listen, and to move the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to say how much I appreciate \nthe distinguished chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member \nfor understanding the importance and the long-range importance of space \nresearch and NASA. They accompanied me to NASA in Houston. And we were \nable to sit in one of the modules. I am happy to say that we survived \nthe distinguished chairman piloting the space module.\n  It was a very important trip because we saw what is on the cutting \nedge of the space station research. We saw how you cannot do certain \nthings with gravity in the research that you can do if you are out in \nspace where you do not have the pull of gravity.\n  So I appreciate the time and effort that Senator Bond and Senator \nMikulski have put into understanding NASA, and the importance of this \nfor those of us on Earth who are very committed to keeping the new \ntechnologies and the growth that are provided.\n  This country's venture into space has represented America at its \nbest--forward-looking and inventive, committed to the advancement of \nmankind and of science, creator of technologies, applying them to \nproducts that to make life \n\n[[Page S 14195]]\nbetter, so much better that our grandparents and our great grandparents \ncould never have really dreamed of; the differences that we have now \nbecause of the space research that we have done in the past 10 or 15 \nyears.\n  The essence of what we are debating today when we take up funding for \nthe space station is whether we will summon the vision to continue this \nquest in cooperation with other nations, or will we instead clip the \nwings of civilization and hunker down right here on Earth.\n  Mr. President, let us come back to Earth for a minute. NASA and the \nspace station have not been exempt from budget cuts. It is not like \nthere is a massive spending program out there that has been unfettered.\n  The space station has in fact offered up more than its fair share of \nbudget reductions. In 1993, a reduction and redesign in the program \nresulted in the space station being $2 billion more cost efficient.\n  Unlike a number of other Government agencies, budget reduction has \nbeen addressed head on by NASA which recently put itself through a \nvigorous analysis called the zero-based review under which every \nmission, every element of its operation, was scrutinized for savings \nand efficiency.\n  I watched this process very closely and commend Dan Goldin for his \nbold approach. Every agency, including Congress, should benefit from \nthe same kind of scorched-Earth review of its own operations. NASA was \nable to achieve a 35-percent budget reduction--saving the taxpayers a \ntotal of $40 billion over the future of NASA, and the space station--\nand continue with its mission.\n  Another important item to remember in this debate is that Congress \nand the administration in their long-term balanced budget plans both \ninclude the space station. In fact, the committees in both Houses of \nCongress have reported measures fully funding the space station for \nfiscal year 1996.\n  In light of this, I can only conclude that opponents who are playing \nthe budget card are really just engaging in another attempt to derail \nthe space program--a program that, since the Kennedy administration, \nhas paid back an incalculable return on the American investor.\n  First among those returns are the advances in medicine that this \nprogram has brought right back here to Earth. As its predecessors did, \nthe space station has the potential to provide us with powerful weapons \nin our ongoing battle against diseases, especially breast cancer and \nosteoporosis where we can only do the research in the nongravity \nsituation.\n  A permanently manned space laboratory is critical to providing \nresearchers with more extensive facilities in a controlled, \nmicrogravity environment.\n  Most significantly, extended human space flights will allow \nscientists to modify their experiments in orbit and take advantage of \nthe unanticipated results. This is the kind of flexibility that has \nhistorically shown that we can get our greatest breakthroughs. The \nquestion we are asking today is, Are we going to pursue the knowledge?\n  The space station will allow us to continue to benefit from the \nmultiple economic benefits space exploration has provided us to date. \nAmerica and American jobs have grown because of space-based advances in \ntransportation, data processing, communications, and countless other \nhigh-technology advances that have made our standard of living the envy \nof the world.\n  Laser surgery--if you have had the ability to have laser surgery, you \nknow what a great benefit this has been in our medical development. \nOperations that used to take weeks to heal now are done in half a day \nin a doctor's office. That is because laser surgery has provided the \nopportunity to have safe, efficient surgery that heals almost \ninstantly.\n  If you have of used velcro--velcro closures, that came from space. If \nyou have had the opportunity to have a hearing aid put in your ear, and \nif you remember what our grandparents used to use for hearing aids, \nthey used to have big batteries in their pockets and wires that ran up \nto big ear plugs that you could see a mile away, and now you can put \nthat device in your ear. And most people do not even know that you have \na hearing aid.\n  That kind of technology was made possible by space research and our \ncommitment to space research. Not only is it a quality of life issue, \nbut think of all the jobs that have been created making the lasers that \ndo the surgery, making the hearing aids that fit into your ears, the \nvelcro lining, from coats to tennis shoes, to everything else that has \nmade life so much easier. It also has created jobs because people are \nmaking those products.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote with me to keep fueling this kind of \nresearch. It benefits everyone on Earth, and it continues to bring \nthose new technologies that create the new industries that keep our \neconomy vibrant, that keep it growing, that allow us to continue to \noffer the people coming into our system the new jobs.\n  While the specter of war hovers over Eastern Europe an other parts of \nthe globe, the space station is poised to serve as a catalyst for \nglobal cooperation on a scale previously unimagined.\n  As the largest most ambitious international scientific and \ntechnological development project ever undertaken, the space station \nbrings together resources and some of the best scientists from the \nUnited States, Russia, Japan, member nations of the European Space \nStation Agency, Canada, and Italy.\n  The Russians, who are old hands in space, have a wealth of experience \nand expertise to bring to the table in this cooperative endeavor. \nHaving the Russians on board will provide the United States and our \nother partners a very valuable asset.\n  As an indicator of the level of commitment that Russia has given the \nspace station, this year the Russian space agency was granted an \nincrease in its budget, including its science budget. This represents \nthe strong support that the space program receives from the Russian \nGovernment. And the Russian space program, like ours, has been a \nconstant source of pride to the Russian people. It enjoys the broadest \nspectrum of political support in Russia.\n  Our venture into space is teaching us important lessons in how to \nlive together through cooperation on Earth. However, our cooperative \nactivities with Russia--encouraging democracy, supporting a market \neconomy, nuclear arms dismantlement, scientific collaboration--also \nadvance our own national interests. During this critical period of \ntransformation in Russia, we should continue this cooperation, not \nundermine it.\n  Failure to fund the space station would break our partnership with \nEurope, Japan, and Canada. These countries have expended over half of \ntheir $9 billion commitment to the $15 billion space station program. \nIt would cause them to conclude that they can no longer count on a \nUnited States commitment to build, launch and operate the space \nstation.\n  Mr. President, it would be unthinkable for America to be a bad \nbusiness partner. We have given our word to these other countries. They \nhave invested based on our word. It is the word of Congress as well as \npast Presidents and the present President. We cannot walk away after \nthey have relied on that. We cannot do that.\n  Congress has voted in support of the space station more than 20 times \nsince 1987. This program is a reality. If we were to stop the program \nnow, the cost of terminating the station would take out all the savings \nthat would be projected in the 1996 budget. Our investment of $14.5 \nbillion in the overall program would be thrown out the window. That \nwould be a foolish thing for us to do.\n  None of us want to be in a Congress that is remembered for displaying \nthe failure of will--good will--that abandoning the space station \nproject would signify. Grounding the space station would be the moral \nequivalent of grounding the American dream.\n  The American people know and appreciate what the space station has \ndone for the past 40 years to enhance our lives. They know the \nsacrifices that have been made by the early pioneers. Our national \npride soared when our first manned spacecraft orbited the Earth. Who \nwill ever forget watching the first man step on the Moon and plant the \nAmerican flag in the Moon dust?\n  Mr. President, we have led this space race, but in the big picture we \nhave really only taken the first small step for man. The giant leap can \nonly come \n\n[[Page S 14196]]\nwith the commitment over time. The giant leap of mankind must be \npursued. We are the leaders, and we cannot let down our people who have \ninvested so much, our partners who have invested so much. It would be \nunthinkable.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the space station and NASA once \nagain, just as we have 20 times before. This is not the time to walk \naway from a commitment. I hope that we will do the right thing and \nhopefully we will put this issue to rest so that there will never be a \nquestion of our commitment to the future and the future jobs for our \ncountry.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Bumpers \namendment and in support of the space station program.\n  I am a longstanding supporter of NASA's space station program. \nUndertaking technological challenges like the space station in why we \nhave a NASA. I also believe the space station is the next logical step \nin our quest to extend human presence in our solar system. Space \nstation will provide invaluable information to scientists and engineers \non humans' ability to live and work in space. That information and \nexperience will be critical if we undertake any future missions to the \nMoon or Mars.\n  The space station's greatest benefit may be in the area of spinoffs. \nMany technologies we take for granted today--such as microcomputers, \npacemakers, artificial limbs, insulin pumps, and communications \nsatellites--are byproducts of past space missions. If NASA's past is \nany indication, the space station will usher in a new generation of \ninventions and technological breakthroughs we cannot yet imagine.\n  Earlier this year, I attended the Oshkosh Air Show with NASA \nAdministrator Dan Goldin. I was amazed at the number of NASA-related \nspinoffs on display. Many, if not most, of the advanced aircraft, \nengines, and other technologies we saw owed their development in some \nway to NASA's research. In fact, it has been estimated that for every \ndollar invested in the space program, the Nation gets a return of $2 in \nthe form of related spinoff benefits.\n  In 1993, our trade surplus in aerospace technology was $39 billion--\nour strongest export sector. Without question, that positive balance of \ntrade is due in large measure to the U.S. space program and the related \ntechnology transfer to U.S. industry. If this pattern continues, \ntaxpayers can expect enormous returns on their investment in the \ninternational space station program.\n  It would be a sad waste of the time, effort, and money spent so far \non the space station if we were to give up now. Since 1984, the United \nStates has spent $12 billion on the space station. Equally important, \n13,000 Americans in 38 States in space station-related jobs have been \nworking hard to make this great dream become a reality. Now NASA is \nready to go. Facilities have been built. Hardware has been constructed. \nPlans have been finalized. We are now only 2 years away from the launch \nof the first element of the station. It is time to finish what we \nstarted.\n  We also must not forget the United States is not the only investor in \nthe space station. Indeed, the station is not only an international \nproject, it is the largest international science project ever \nundertaken. Japan the European Space Agency are each developing a lab \nmodule for the space station and the Canadians are developing a robotic \narm. Our newest partner, Russia, also is playing a key role by \nproviding launches, a navigational system, and rescue vehicles. \nTogether, our foreign space station partners have spent $4 billion on \nthe project--with billions more budgeted. Increasingly, big science \nprojects are becoming far too expensive and complex for any one country \nto undertake alone. If we do not honor our commitments to our foreign \npartners, we cannot expect them to participate in any future \ninternational space and science missions.\n  Mr. President, these are some of the reasons I endorse the space \nstation program. In that connection, in July, as chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, I introduced \nauthorization legislation for NASA, which provides full funding for the \nspace station, as well as for Mission to Planet Earth and other \nimportant space and aeronautics activities.\n  Mr. President, while I support the space station, my support is not \nunqualified. I do have some serious reservations about the program. \nNone are so serious as to lead me to support killing the program. \nHowever, the Commerce Committee will be keeping a close eye on each.\n  First of all, I am concerned about the program's overreliance on the \nRussians. Until 1993, space station was largely a United States \nprogram, with substantial contributions by the European Space Agency, \nJapan, and Canada. However, late in 1993, the administration added \nRussia as a space station partner. Today, the program increasingly \nseems to be driven by the Russians, and not the United States. Under \nthe current plan, 44 of the launches to assemble and supply the station \nare Russian launches compared to only 27 shuttle launches. Furthermore, \nRussian spacecraft will be used for both the navigation system for the \nspace station and its crew rescue vehicles. If, for any reason, the \nRussians are forced to withdraw from the station, the program would be \nin peril.\n  Second, I am troubled by the sheer complexity of the space station \neffort. For instance, the assembly of the space station will require 77 \nlaunches over a 5-year period, each of which must occur within a tight \nwindow of time and in a proper sequence. Moreover, this assembly will \nrequire over 600 hours of space walking by astronaut crews. \nTraditionally, NASA has tried to minimize space walking because it \nplaces crews at risk, complicates the accomplishment of mission goals, \nand takes away from the astronauts' research time.\n  Finally, my biggest concern about the space station is its enormous \ncost. When it was first proposed in 1984, the space station was \nestimated to cost $8 billion. However, in a June 1995 report, the \nGeneral Accounting Office [GAO] estimated that the total cost of the \ndesign, launch, and operation of the space station will be $94 billion. \nThat is about seven times the entire annual budget for NASA. My fear is \nthat, if the space station suffers substantial cost overruns, its \nbudget may eventually crowd out every other NASA program and leave the \nspace station as NASA's only mission. This result is clearly not in the \npublic interest.\n  I am particularly concerned about the impact of space station funding \non Mission to Planet Earth. I believe Mission to Planet Earth to be \nNASA's most important and relevant program. Using the latest satellite \ntechnology, Mission to Planet Earth will help scientists understand and \npredict the global climate trends that affect our lives. As a Senator \nrepresenting a State whose economy is extremely dependent on \nagriculture, I have a keen interest in the program's potential to \nprovide detailed data on soil conditions, topography, crops, and other \ninformation critical to the farming and ranching communities. I also \ntake great pride in the important role the EROS Data Center in Sioux \nFalls, SD, will play in converting the huge volumes of satellite data \ninto useful information for the entire Nation.\n  Accordingly, as much as I appreciate the scientific and economic \nbenefits of the space station, I could not have supported it at the \nexpense of Mission to Planet Earth. I am pleased that the authors of \nthe underlying bill--H.R. 2099--did not place us in that dilemma, but \nmanaged to find a way in this tight budget climate to fund both space \nstation and Mission to Planet Earth. This could not have been easy and \nI commend the managers of the bill on their wisdom and good judgment in \naddressing this issue.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear. The space station is a monumentally \ncomplex and costly undertaking. Some say it is an impossible dream. \nHowever, NASA's heritage and history is about doing the impossible. I \nam confident that, under Dan Goldin's leadership, NASA will bravely \nmeet this challenge and finally build the orbital space laboratory we \nhave been planning for two decades. In a world where economic growth \nincreasingly depends on technological leadership, space station is the \nkind of bold step needed to increase our scientific knowledge and \nstrengthen U.S. competitiveness.\n\n[[Page S 14197]]\n\n  So, Mr. President, despite my questions and reservations about the \nspace station, I believe it is the Nation's interest to go forward and \ncomplete this important project. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to \nvote ``no'' on the Bumpers amendment and vote ``yes'' for space station \nand the future of our space program and the future of our Nation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to once again be an \noriginal co-sponsor of this effort to terminate funding for the space \nstation, and I commend the senior Senator from Arkansas, Senator \nBumpers, for his continuing efforts in this area.\n  Every year, Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas comes to the \nfloor with amendment after amendment to cut Federal spending and to \nhelp us with our uphill efforts to balance the Federal budget. We need \nto closely scrutinize every program in the Federal budget, and quite \nsimply, ask ourselves if, given our current financial constraints and \ngiven the immense sacrifices we have been asking Medicare recipients, \ncollege students, veterans, and many others to make, can we afford to \ncontinue this particular spending program?\n  This is the third consecutive year I have joined with the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, the Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner, and others in \nthis bipartisan effort to delete funding for the space station. Each \nyear, the Senator from Arkansas has presented a number of strong \narguments in support of terminating the space station. He has presented \ninformation about NASA's notorious cost-overruns. We have learned that \na large part of the scientific community, including the American \nPhysical Society and the American Cancer Society--two groups that have \nbeen alleged to potentially benefit from this space endeavor--actually \noppose continued funding of this space station.\n  We have learned about a recent General Accounting Office report that \nfound that the total amount of funding that will be required to build \nthis space station is $78 billion. And of course, that is $78 billion \nthat we are going to have to borrow and pay interest on for many years \nto come.\n  The construction of the space station is opposed by many of the \nleading groups supporting deficit reduction and a balanced budget, \nincluding the National Taxpayers Union, Citizens Against Government \nWaste, as well as Friends of the Earth.\n  Yet the Congress continues to write a $2 billion check to NASA every \nyear to continue the construction of a space station. Mr. President, I \nhave said before that I do not support shutting down our space program. \nClearly, many of our space programs have proven to justify their costs. \nAnd it is my hope that when our fiscal house is in order that we can \ncontinue and enhance our space exploration initiatives.\n  But it is also clear that we cannot and will not become a financially \nresponsible nation until every Federal program is put on the table, \nclosely scrutinized, and determined to be either justified or not \njustified given our current fiscal constraints. Mr. President, the \nspace station must be put on the table and we must have the political \nwill and fiscal discipline to once and for all discontinue funding for \nthis costly program.\n  Once again, I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Arkansas, \nSenator Bumpers, and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise this year in support of America's \nspace program and in opposition to the Bumpers amendment which would \nstrike funding for the space station.\n  I have said this before and I will say it again: This amendment is a \nchoice between the future and the past. What kind of nation will we be \nin the 21st century? Will we be the one that uses technology to help \npeople with their day-to-day lives and keep people employed in the \nfield of manufacturing, or are we going to let America's best days be \nbehind it? Will we use American ingenuity and know-how through the \nunique environment of space to tackle our understanding of disease or \ndevelopment of new technologies that can be used at home on the planet \nEarth? These are the questions that are at the heart of why America \nneeds a space station and why we should, once again, defeat the Bumpers \namendment.\n  Some will argue that science carried out on the space station can be \naccomplished more effectively on the planet Earth. This simply is not \ntrue. The science proposed for the station cannot be accomplished on \nEarth at any major price. Space station science requires sustained \naccess to very low levels of gravitational force. It is technologically \nimpossible to create a low-gravity environment for this type of \nresearch without going into orbit.\n  Some might say, ``Well, if that's so, why not do this type of science \non the space shuttle if you need to go into orbit?''\n  I bring this point to their attention: The shuttle can stay in orbit \nonly for 2 weeks. We do not limit cancer researchers to 2 weeks in the \nlab to find a cure for that devastating disease. Why should we limit \nspace science to only 2 weeks up in the air? Much of the proposed \nresearch will take months, if not years, to complete.\n  Another argument we hear every year is cost. Sure, the space station \ncosts money. So does anything else worthwhile. We have heard that the \nGAO estimated that the station would cost $94 billion to fund over a \nperiod of years. This number is misleading. When tabulating the total \ncost, the Government Accounting Office included a large portion of \nNASA's human space flight budget in its analysis. The fact is that $51 \nbillion of the $94 billion is for shuttle missions that were going to \nfly regardless of the fate of the space station.\n  The real cost of the station, which includes final development and \nconstruction and 10 years of operation is $26.2 billion. The remaining \n/balance of the erroneous $94 billion estimate is life science and \nmicrogravity research--life science and microgravity research--and that \nis the heart and soul of what is to be done on the space station--\nmicrogravity research and life science research.\n  We heard a few minutes ago a distinguished Senator and a former \nastronaut talk with eloquence in detail about the brilliant, needed \nresearch that is going on in the life science area and that it could \nonly be done in space.\n  I will not repeat the many examples there, but I can tell you as a \nwoman who fought to establish the Office of Women's Health at NIH, who \njoined with my colleagues to make sure we had funding for breast cancer \nand ovarian cancer research, it is important to me that we continue \nthis work. And it was through my efforts working with then Dr. \nBernadine Healy at the National Institutes of Health and Dr. Dan Goldin \nthat we forged this unique partnership between space and NIH to deal \nwith key life science issues and to coordinate all of that research.\n  This is what the U.S. Government is all about: Saving lives, saving \njobs, saving communities and that is what the space station is all \nabout. We go out there so that we can save lives, jobs in communities \nright here on the planet Earth.\n  What is the cost to America if we do not continue the space station? \nWell, the Federal Government has already invested $14.5 billion. If we \ndo not fund the space station, 15,000 highly skilled engineering and \nproduction contract jobs, along with about a thousand civil service \njobs, will be lost; the jobs of 35,000 contract workers and 5,000 civil \nservants who work on the shuttle will be at risk.\n  Long duration microgravity research in cell and developmental \nbiology, human physiology, biotech, fluid physics--and if you think it \nis hard to say fluid physics, you ought to be out there trying to do \nit--fluid physics, combustion science, material science, benchmark \nphysics, as well as the development of new pharmaceuticals and \nunderstanding of Earth-based diseases. We would lose that.\n  We would also lose our credibility with our international partners if \nwe shut down the space station. Russia, Japan, Europe, and Canada have \nalready invested more than $9 billion. Finally, the U.S. \ncompetitiveness could be maintained by continuing the long-term cutting \nedge high-risk R research that is integral to the space station \ndevelopment.\n  Japan, Europe, and Canada regard our agreement to pursue the space \nstation as a treaty. To break this violates treaty-level negotiations.\n  Finally, one of the benefits of the end of the cold war is that \nrather than \n\n[[Page S 14198]]\ncompeting with the Russians in space, duplicating projects in science, \nwe actually are working together to be best at what we each need in \nspace station activity.\n  Mr. President, we could argue these points all night, but I will not \nput my friends and colleagues through that. This bill is going to take \nlong enough to debate. When we vote on the Bumpers amendment, I am \ngoing to ask every Senator to think long and hard about what this \namendment means. This vote is not about money or cutting spending. \nSure, we all want to cut spending. But this is about investing in the \nfuture, it is about our kids and the kind of world we will live in and \nthe kind of jobs we have. It is about the American spirit of new \nfrontiers, the human exploration. The American character has always \nbeen about progress, moving ahead, using science and technology to \nadvance an American agenda, but a global one also.\n  That is what I want to support. I want to see a bright new future \nwith opportunities beyond our comprehension. I want to open doors that \nlead to new technologies and new challenges and new markets. This \namendment leaves us standing in front of these new doors too paralyzed \nby fear with a green eyeshade clouding our vision of the future.\n  So I hope my colleagues will join me in voting ``yes'' for the future \nand ``no'' on the Bumpers amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as usual, my colleague from Maryland is \nextremely eloquent as she states the case for the space station. She \nhas done it very well. She and the Senators from Texas and Ohio have \nmade the case.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record some explanations and \ncorrections for the committee report on this bill. Because of the time \npressure, we did not have the chance to make all the corrections on the \nreport. I ask they be printed in the Record for the information of \nthose who may have questions about this report. It does not amend the \nreport, but it will be in further explanation of the report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     VA-HUD, Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill (H.R. 2099)--\n                  Corrections to Senate Report 104-140\n\n       Page and Comment:\n       P. 42--Starting with the last full paragraph on page 42 and \n     replacing the text through the first full paragraph on page \n     44:\n       ``In addition, the Committee is recommending the creation \n     of a demonstration program for up to 30 PHAs to address the \n     problem of dependency in the public housing population by \n     encouraging employment and self-sufficiency for the very low \n     and extremely low-income families who now live in public \n     housing.\n       ``Up to 30 PHAs would be permitted to use funding for \n     Section 8 and public housing in a much more flexible way than \n     under current program rules. Funding streams could be \n     combined, so long as the PHA continued to assist essentially \n     the same number of total families as would have been served \n     had the funding streams for Section 8 and the two public \n     housing formula-based programs remained separate. The amount \n     of funding available to the PHA from public housing operating \n     subsidies, modernization grants, and Section 8 annual \n     contributions contracts would not be affected by \n     participation in the demonstration.\n       ``PHAs participating in the demonstration would have very \n     broad flexibility to set rents and conditions of occupancy in \n     ways that encourage work and upward mobility. These policies \n     could include exclusions of earned income for purposes of \n     determining rent, but they might also include more far-\n     reaching changes that redefine the role of Federal housing \n     activities to provide supplementary assistance to families on \n     a temporary basis.\n       ``In order to make sure that the models created by this \n     demonstration are tested and replicable and that their long-\n     term effect is well understood, HUD will provide training and \n     technical assistance for the design and implementation of the \n     programs of up to 10 PHAs, and will conduct detailed \n     evaluations of those programs. The demonstration includes a \n     set-aside for this purpose of $5,000,000 from amounts \n     appropriated for the public housing modernization program.''\n       P. 46--Second paragraph beginning with ``irrespective'' \n     should strike the parenthetical referring to the $10 billion \n     loss reserve, as this accounting figure is not related to the \n     budget estimate for claims discussed previously, and is not \n     ``in addition'' to them.\n       P. 48--The Report states that the funding for preservation \n     includes $550 million for preservation incentives and $74 \n     million for prepayment vouchers. It is clear that $74 million \n     is not sufficient to cover the prepayment voucher need. \n     Instead, as the Bill permits, the Department will have the \n     discretion to stop funding incentives where needed to ensure \n     that tenants will not be displaced by prepayment.\n       P. 49--The language recognizes that there is significantly \n     less credit subsidy available for F.Y. 1996 than in past \n     years, and that the deficiency will need to be offset. \n     However, the report only refers to underwriting changes as \n     the way to offset that deficiency. In addition, the report \n     does not acknowledge that FHA will be allowed to use negative \n     credit subsidy from its revenue producing products as well as \n     other potential sources.\n       Program Accounts:\n       P. 55--Public Housing Demolition etc.--The description \n     really is for the severely distressed program (HOPE VI) which \n     is not continued under the Committee's recommendation. The \n     Committee has proposed a successor program to the HOPE VI/URD \n     program which targets funding to the actual demolition and \n     replacement of failed housing developments in a manner which \n     streamlines and facilitates such remedial activities.\n       P. 56--Description of the Demo/Disp Committee \n     Recommendation should include use of the funds also for \n     tenant-based assistance under Section 8 at the end of the \n     first sentence. It should also say that this funding level is \n     the same as FY 1995 ``for the HOPE VI program''.\n       P. 56--Drug Elimination: The Committee recommendation needs \n     to include the following: 1) that the program can be \n     distributed on a formula basis; 2) that there is a 6.25 \n     percent setaside for drug elimination grants in connection \n     with assisted housing projects, and 3) that grants are \n     available to fight drug-related and other types of crime.\n       P. 61--Program Description of CDBG: In the second \n     paragraph, the second sentence should be reordered to read as \n     follows: ``After deducting designated amounts for special \n     purpose grants and Indian tribes, seventy percent of \n     appropriated funds are distributed to entitlement communities \n     and 30 percent are distributed through States to \n     nonentitlement communities.''\n       P. 62--Chart: Should reflect the Bill appropriation of $27 \n     million (not 22.5) for special purpose grants under section \n     107. Should add Ntl. Am. Indian Council and HAC funds. The \n     report does not note the setaside of $12 million for housing \n     counseling services from the $80 million supportive services \n     program.\n       P. 62--NAIHC should be written out as follows: ``National \n     American Indian Housing Council''. This should be added to \n     the Chart.\n       P. 62--CDBG Supportive Services Demo: The report does not \n     track the legislative language which includes Indian housing \n     agencies and other housing assistance entities to provide \n     services to serve the elderly and the disabled as well as \n     residents of public housing.\n       P. 63--CDBG setaside: There is no description of the \n     counseling program as a setaside (or earmark, as the report \n     describes Youthbuild) of the supportive services demo. The \n     Report should say that this is an earmark of $12 million from \n     the demo.\n       P. 66--Sec. 201(a)--Describes the Rescissions Act provision \n     rather, but does not note modifications. The Report states \n     that the fungibility does not extend to use of Op Subs; \n     however, there is a 10 percent fungibility provision.\n       P. 67--3d full paragraph--Second sentence describes an \n     amendment HUD proposed but was never accepted.\n       P. 68-69--Mandatory conversion: This does not reference the \n     portion of this section which allows the Secretary to \n     recapture and reuse unused mod, CIAP, or MROP Budget \n     Authority.\n       P. 69--Explains that the Secretary has powers to require \n     conversion only where a PHA has not expeditiously implemented \n     the plan. However, the Secretary's powers are triggered by \n     sheer ``inadequacy'' of plan or implementation, not just \n     untimeliness.\n       P. 69-70--Section 204(b) [nondiscrimination] is not in the \n     reported bill. The other subsections of 204 need to be \n     redesignated, accordingly.\n       P. 70--FMRs: Second paragraph refers to FY 1995, instead of \n     FY 1996.\n       P. 70--This section should read as follows: ``Section \n     205(d) would delay reissuance of vouchers and certificates \n     for 6 months (but not later than 10/1/96), with the exception \n     of any certificates assigned or committed to project based \n     assistance as permitted otherwise by the Act, accomplished \n     prior to the effective date of this Act.''\n       P. 71--Section 210: the last reference in this paragraph \n     should be to section 208, not 202.\n       P. 71--Section 211, First paragraph, 4th line, strike \n     ``housing assistance''. (contracts are both HAP and ACC \n     contracts). First paragraph, second to last sentence, \n     reference should be to project-based assistance. Third \n     paragraph, last sentence, strike ``tenants'' and insert \n     ``eligible families, including those''.\n       P. 72--First line, strike ``mortgage'' and insert \n     ``insurance contract''.\n       P. 76--In the first sentence of the explanation of section \n     218, the word ``pertaining'' should be deleted. The bill \n     ``prohibits the use of any funds by HUD for any activity \n     related to the enforcement of the Fair Housing Act for \n     property insurance.'' The House provision barred not just \n     enforcement but all spending related to property insurance, \n     including research. The Senate bill does not.\n       P. 76--Section 221, should be divided into 2 sentences. The \n     first should end with the \n\n[[Page S 14199]]\n     word ``formula''. The second should read as follows: ``Changes would \n     continue to be subject to applicable rulemaking procedures.''\n       P. 77--Heading should be ``Extension Period for Sharing \n     Utility Cost Savings with PHAs''. Sec. 224 should have a \n     separate heading.\n       Department of Justice:\n       The second paragraph of the Committee Recommendation says \n     it ``relocates all responsibilities for fair housing issues \n     currently housed in the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development''. This should be revised to ``relocates all \n     responsibilities of the Secretary under the Fair Housing \n     Act''. As written, the statement inaccurately describes the \n     bill. The bill only pertains to Title VIII (the Fair Housing \n     Act). The Secretary continues to have responsibility for fair \n     housing under Title VI, the Rehab Act, etc.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, in just a few minutes, I will be proposing a \nunanimous-consent request setting forth the time for debate on this \ntomorrow. We will have an opportunity to go through some of these \ndebates and expand upon them.\n  I am not going to take much time tonight other than to say the \nproponent of this amendment is very eloquent. He has raised quite a few \nconcerns that he has. I believe there are good answers for all of them. \nI was reminded, as he spoke, about all the things that could \npotentially go wrong, of a cartoon character many years ago who used to \nwalk around with a metal shield over his head so he would not be hit by \na meteorite if one came from space. Some of the arguments presented \nagainst the space station seem to have about as much likelihood of \noccurring as being struck by a meteorite.\n  I do want to point out that in this bill we do not, as the proponents \nsuggest, cut back on regulation to endanger the drinking water of this \ncountry. In fact, we believe that with restructuring and refocusing the \nactivities of the Environmental Protection Agency, we can continue to \nmake the progress that we have made in these fields.\n  But to address the particular terms of this amendment, the argument \nhas been made that we do not really need to go to a space shuttle, \nbecause everything we can do on a space shuttle can be accomplished \nmuch more effectively on Earth. But I say the facts are that the \nscience proposed for the station cannot be accomplished on Earth at any \nprice.\n  The space station science requires sustained access to very low \nlevels of gravitational force. It is not technically feasible to create \na low-gravity environment for research without going into orbit, and I \nbelieve the speakers opposing the amendment have made that point very \nwell.\n  The space shuttle program has produced a number of very important \nfindings and helped scientists to explore the possibilities of orbital \nresearch, but the space shuttle can only stay in orbit for 16 days at a \ntime. Dr. Michael DeBakey, chancellor and chairman of the department of \nsurgery at Baylor College of Medicine has said:\n\n       Present technology of the shuttle allows for stays in space \n     of only about 2 weeks. We do not limit medical researchers to \n     only a few hours in the laboratory and expect cures for \n     cancer. We need much longer missions in space, in months to \n     years to obtain research results that may lead to the \n     development of new knowledge and breakthroughs.\n\n  I might also add that the National Research Council, an arm of the \nNational Academy of Sciences just released a report on microresearch \nopportunities for 1990 which states:\n\n       The need for an extended duration orbiting platform has \n     been identified as critical in many microgravity research \n     experiments because of the time required for experimentation, \n     the wide parametric ranges and the need to demonstrate the \n     reproductability of results.\n\n  Another quote:\n\n       The duration of experiments, the regime of parameters \n     available to experimenters and the ability to demonstrate \n     reproductability of results in microgravity experiments \n     create the need for extended duration orbiting platforms.\n\n  There are many other authorities that we could cite for this \nproposition, but as my colleague from Maryland has said, this is a \nquestion of setting priorities. We have a tight budget, certainly, but \nwe ought to be in the position where we make investments that are \nimportant for the future. I believe it would be a tragedy, a tremendous \ntragedy, were we tomorrow to vote to kill the space station. The space \nstation is the most ambitious and exciting space program since the \nApollo program of over 25 years ago.\n  I think it is time that we called an end to the incessant attempts to \nkill the space station. Over the last 4 years, there have been 13 \nattempts in the House and Senate to kill the program.\n  And fortunately, because of the knowledge and what the space station \ncan and will do, these amendments have failed.\n  Last year, a resounding 64 Senators voted against this amendment. I \nwas proud to be among them. The arguments used by station opponents \nthis year are the same ones. We have seen the same charts. We have gone \nthrough the drill. These tired arguments have been used in the past. \nThe claims were not true then; they are not true now.\n  Let me tick off a very few. The space station is no longer a dream. \nIt is a reality. It is working. It is providing results.\n  Second, the space station is perfectly on schedule and on budget. As \na matter of fact, through the leadership of the administration, the \nWhite House and NASA, we are going through the entire space budget and \nwe have made significant savings. We can spend our scarce dollars on \nhigh-priority programs and that includes the space station.\n  Third, a streamlined management team is in place. NASA has reduced \nits in-house work force by 1,000, almost one half, and the program is \nbeing better managed than ever before. They made rescissions and \nreforms in having a prime contractor. The system is working.\n  Fourth, cooperation with Russia is working as planned. We are working \nwith our former adversary and developing some very usable scientific \ninformation, and breaking new ground working with Russia.\n  Fifth, the program is not a budget buster. It has been included in \nthe budget resolution that has been adopted because it is an \ninvestment.\n  Finally, the space station will not undermine the balance among NASA \nprograms in human space flight, science, technology, and aeronautics. \nThis is a program which deserves to stand on its own.\n  I think the amendment to terminate the space station threatens the \nexistence of the U.S. human space flight program, and I urge my \ncolleagues not support the amendment when it comes up for a vote \ntomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/25/senate-section/article/S14156-4", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, we have an extremely important measure \nthat is before the Senate at the present time where we have had \ndiscussion. I would like to take just a few moments to talk about \nanother extremely important measure that will be and is important to \nthe Senate tomorrow when the Labor and Human Resources Committee meets \nits obligations under the budget recommendations and addresses how we \nare going to reach the instructions by the Budget Committee. I wish to \ntake just a few moments of the Senate's time on this issue.\n  Mr. President, tomorrow, the Senate Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee will be asked to take $10 billion out of the student loan \naccounts to help pay for a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. That \npriority is wrong, and I oppose it.\n  Senator Kassebaum's reconciliation proposal strikes at the heart of \nthe Federal commitment to higher education. It adds to the debt burden \nof students, increases the costs for working families struggling to pay \nfor college, and penalizes colleges and universities for accepting \nneedy students.\n  Tomorrow's markup marks the third time in a week we have been asked \nto meet to consider student loan cuts, and the proposal has not \nimproved with time. Senator Kassebaum's proposal retains the \nunprecedented student loan tax on colleges and universities, it forces \nschools out of the direct lending program against their will, and it \ntriples the cut imposed directly on students.\n  More than two-thirds of the proposed cut--$7.6 billion--fall on \nstudents and \n\n[[Page S 14200]]\nworking families in the form of higher fees, increased interest rates, \nand an assault on the highly successful direct student loan program. \nMost surprising of all, this antitax Republican Congress is imposing an \nunprecedented new tax on Federal student loans.\n  If this student loan tax is enacted into law, colleges will be forced \nto pay the Federal Government nearly 1 percent of every dollar their \nstudents borrow for college--nearly $2 billion over the next 7 years. \nUniversities facing tight funding will have no choice but to pass the \ntax on to students and parents in the form of higher tuition and fees \nor reduced student aid.\n  This tax falls especially hard on the vast majority of colleges with \nsmall or no endowments and large numbers of students on financial aid. \nSmall liberal arts colleges, small religious colleges, many others, \nincluding Gordon College in Massachusetts, St. Mary's in Leavenworth, \nKS, Trinity College in Burlington, VT, Heritage College in Washington \nState, Ohio and Dominican College lack the resources to offset such \nblows to their budget.\n  At the University of Massachusetts, in Boston, a large urban \nuniversity, with a diverse student body, half the students receive \nfinancial aid. This new tax would force the college to pay $174,000 a \nyear to the Federal Government. If UMass-Boston wanted to shield its \nstudents from the cost, it would have no choice but to turn to the \nState for the money. Little wonder that the National Governors' \nAssociation has described this student loan tax as ``yet another \nunfunded mandate that is passed on to the States.''\n  I would point out that at the University of Massachusetts, in Boston, \nseveral years ago I had the opportunity to speak at the graduation. At \nthat time, their tuition fees were $1,000; 85 percent of the students' \nparents never went to college; 85 percent of the students that were \ngoing to the University of Massachusetts, in Boston, were working 25 \nhours a week or more.\n  And the year or two after that, they raised the tuition another $100 \nand they lost about 10 percent of the new applicants. Just the $100 \nmade a significant difference, the breaking point for many of these \nyoung men and women as well as those in their twenties and early \nthirties who were looking forward to going back to college to gain an \nexcellent college education.\n  So, Mr. President, the National Governors' Association has described \nthis student loan tax as yet another unfunded mandate that is passed on \nto the States.\n  We created the student loan program to make it easier for students \nfrom working families to attend college. If this provision stands, \ncolleges will be penalized for admitting needy students.\n  And that's not all. Under the proposed legislation parents who take \nout PLUS loans to ease the financial burden on their children will have \nto pay higher interest rates for those loans. PLUS loans pay for \ncollege expenses, including tuition, room, board, and other fees. This \nprovision falls hardest on the families who need the most help. PLUS \nloans are particularly crucial for working families who have not been \nable to save, or who do not own a home against which to take an equity \nloan.\n  The reconciliation package that Republicans unveiled at the beginning \nof the week cut back the interest-free grace period, during which \nstudents look for jobs after college, from 6 months to 4 months, \nimposing almost $1 billion in extra charges on students. This new \nproposal eliminates the grace period altogether, forcing students to \npay almost $3 billion in additional interest over the next 7 years. A \nstudent who borrows the maximum over 4 years of college will be charged \nan extra $700 for the grace period alone.\n  That is if they borrow the money for college. If they borrow it for \nthe graduate schools, it goes up to about $2,000 more.\n  Millions of students across the country will also lose the benefit of \nthe direct student loan program. This proposal begins the process of \ndismantling direct lending. Direct lending will be capped at 20 percent \nof total student loan volume. Half of the 1,300 schools now in direct \nlending will be forced out of the program or forced to cut back on \ntheir direct lending volume by maintaining dual loan programs. This \ndespite the fact that colleges in the program are overwhelming in their \npraise for direct lending, as we heard this spring at a hearing before \nthis committee. Furthermore, even opponents of direct lending \nacknowledge that the program has brought healthy competition, lower \ncosts, and better service to all students.\n  There is no justification for Congress to tilt the balance against \ndirect lending in order to prop up the guaranteed loan program that \nfattens the profits of banks at the expenses of colleges and students. \nIn addition, if honest accounting is used, it is clear that capping \ndirect lending adds to the deficit instead of achieving savings. If the \nRepublicans had inserted a fair scoring rule into the budget rather \nthan one that favors the guaranteed loan program, CBO would be telling \nus today that capping direct lending at 20 percent would cost $1.8 \nbillion over 7 years, instead of saving $600 million as Senator \nKassebaum claims.\n  Common sense tells us that it is cheaper to loan money to students \ndirectly from the U.S. Treasury than to force students to go through \nbanks as middlemen. In a letter to Senator Abraham last June, Lawrence \nLindsey, a Bush appointee to the Federal Reserve Board, said, ``As long \nas it is necessary to provide a profit to induce lenders to guarantee \nstudent loans, direct lending will be cheaper.''\n  We can meet our budget goals without cutting education, without \nburying college students under a higher mountain of debt. The \nRepublican Congress has no business picking the pockets of students and \nworking families to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy.\n  Mr. President, I will include in my statement an excellent letter \nthat was sent to me, Senator Kassebaum, Congressman Ford, and \nCongressman Goodling in May 1993. I ask unanimous consent that that and \nother material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 Charles Kolb,\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, May 25, 1993.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chair, Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senate \n         Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Kassebaum,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Senate Labor and Human Resources \n         Committee, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. William Ford,\n     Chair, House Education and Labor Committee, Rayburn House \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. William Goodling,\n     Ranking Minority Member, House Education and Labor Committee, \n         Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Members of Congress: As Republicans who served under \n     Presidents Ronald Reagan or George Bush, we believe that the \n     time has come to restructure the federal guaranteed student \n     loan (``GSL'') program--a program that has become overly \n     complex, lacks accountability, and wastes taxpayers' dollars \n     through needlessly high loan default rates.\n       We are writing to express our support for reforming the GSL \n     program by replacing the existing system with a new direct \n     loan program.\n       According to estimates prepared by the Department of \n     Education (under both Presidents Bush and Clinton), the \n     Congressional Budget Office, and the General Accounting \n     Office, the new direct loan program will also result in \n     significant annual budget savings that could be used for \n     deficit reduction. Direct borrowing by the federal government \n     to capitalize the direct loan program as a revolving fund \n     will save on the current interest and special allowance \n     subsidies now paid to banks and others while ensuring a more \n     streamlined, efficient, and workable program that meets the \n     needs of America's students. As such, a direct loan program \n     offers a more cost-effective delivery system for providing \n     student financial assistance.\n       Over the years, the guaranted student loan program has \n     developed a degree of regulatory and administrative \n     complexity that now undermines its fundamental integrity and \n     effectiveness. Replacing the GSL structure with a streamlined \n     structure will mean not only enhanced accountability and \n     budget savings, but also a more rational delivery system that \n     will particularly benefit students and educational \n     institutions. In particular, we believe direct loans will \n     also ensure greater responsibility and accountability by \n     participating educational institutions.\n       A direct loan program will mean replacing the role \n     currently played by many banks, guarantee agencies, and \n     secondary markets with a much more competitive approach. The \n     intent is not to harm these participants in the existing \n     program but rather to recognize that more competitive, \n     efficient, and \n\n[[Page S 14201]]\n\n     practical ways exist to provide student loans. We hope that \n     as the Congress considers direct loans it will look beyond \n     the misleading information that is being spread by \n     representatives of those entities who have a direct financial \n     stake in preserving the status quo.\n       We believe that the Clinton administration has taken the \n     correct position on this issue and urge the Congress to \n     consider this much-needed reform of the student loan program. \n     In fact, much of the initial work that led to the direct loan \n     program currently under consideration was undertaken during \n     the Bush administration. While a valuable direct loan pilot \n     program was authorized last year, we regret that this work \n     was not pursued more seriously and vigorously during last \n     year's reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. \n     Nonetheless, we hope that the Congress will act in a true \n     bipartisan fashion to approve direct loans in order to bring \n     sweeping and needed reform to the student aid delivery \n     system.\n       Should bipartisanship not be possible, we call upon our \n     fellow Republicans to unite behind the direct loan proposal \n     and to show leadership in this and other efforts to reform \n     government.

Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Spence: I appreciate your kind note and understand the \n     many conflicting and unexpected demands on your time. I hope \n     we will have a chance to talk again soon. In the meantime, it \n     was good to have an opportunity to meet with your staff.\n       I also wanted to take this opportunity to share with you my \n     personal views about direct lending, largely from the \n     perspective of an economist. First, the Bush Administration \n     made credit reform a high priority and the Clinton \n     Administration has since built upon that goal. Credit reform \n     was designed, at the outset, to enable policymakers to look \n     at the credit programs of the government in a defensible and \n     comprehensive way. No particular program was singled out for \n     special treatment. Embarking on policy changes that impact \n     one program and do not apply the same requirements for all \n     may not be consistent with sound public policy.\n       Second, a change in the credit reform treatment of student \n     loans was included in the budget resolution in response to \n     industry criticism regarding the calculation of \n     administrative costs for student loans. Making the change the \n     industry proposes without looking at other changes which \n     might be necessary it problematic. For example, the use of \n     the ten year treasury rate for estimating purposes when \n     program costs are based on short term rates creates obvious \n     inconsistencies. Further, the $2.3 billion in revenue loss \n     that occurs through the use of tax exempt student loan bonds \n     is not taken into account in estimating program costs.\n       To help clarify the effects of direct versus guaranteed \n     lending, a couple of comparisons may be in order. The \n     economic effect of both forms of loans is identical. They \n     both divert private capital to carry out a government \n     purpose. The aggregate amount of government borrowing is the \n     same since student terms and conditions are identical. \n     However, taxpayer cost is less for direct lending largely \n     because the government can obtain capital less expensively \n     through the sale of government securities than the market \n     rates it must pay to support a system of loan guarantees. As \n     long as it is necessary to provide a profit to induce lenders \n     to guarantee student loans, direct lending will be cheaper.\n       Finally, direct lending may be the best way to involve the \n     private sector in student loans. The loan capital for direct \n     loans comes from the private sector and the administration of \n     the program--servicing, computer support, etc.--is \n     accomplished through competitive contracts with the private \n     sector. This approach may be more accountable than the \n     guarantee system which is based on government entitlement \n     expenditures for guarantee agencies, secondary markets, and \n     lenders.\n       Spence, I hope you find this helpful. I'd be glad to talk \n     further with you about these issues. Good luck in the \n     challenging days ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n     Larry.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                               Washington, DC, September 19, 1995.\n     Hon. William F. Goodling,\n     Chairman,  House  Economic  and  Education Opportunities \n         Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Goodling: The President asked me to respond \n     to your September 12 letter, in which you objected to the way \n     he had characterized Republican plans to make savings in the \n     student loan programs. I am pleased to do so.\n       I believe that the President's statements were correct, \n     based on oral and written statements that were made by \n     Republican leaders, including yourself.\n       One of the savings proposed in your letter is to eliminate \n     the Direct Student Loan program to save $1.5 billion. We \n     strongly disagree with this policy. Direct lending works. \n     Some 1,3000 schools are already in the program and hundreds \n     more have already filed applications for the school year \n     beginning July 1, 1996. Students and school administrators in \n     the program are near-unanimous in their preference for direct \n     lending.\n       The Education Department estimates that at least $1 billion \n     of this $1.5 billion in savings that is attributable to \n     direct lending comes not from repeal, but from simultaneously \n     cutting funds available to monitor all student loan \n     programs--a move that would put students at considerable risk \n     in both loan programs. As the General Accounting Office has \n     repeatedly observed, there are significant problems in the \n     guaranteed loan program. This is due to its near-unmanageable \n     statutory structure. Constant Federal oversight is essential.\n       The remainder of the $1.5 billion occurs under the special \n     scoring rule for direct loans which the Budget Resolution \n     directs the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to use. This \n     directive addressed the way the Federal Credit Reform Act \n     (FCRA) requires the government to score the budgetary \n     consequences of credit programs. That Act, which predated the \n     enactment of direct lending, treats Federal administrative \n     costs differently from other costs. Most, but not all, \n     administrative costs in guaranteed lending are in the form of \n     mandatory payments to banks, guaranty agencies and secondary \n     markets. The FCRA includes these costs on a net present value \n     basis in the guaranteed loan program subsidy.\n       In contrast, direct lending administration is primarily by \n     Federal contract, so that taxpayers get the benefit of the \n     lowest cost possible each year. The FCRA scores these costs \n     outside of the direct lending subsidy. The combination of the \n     structure of the two programs and the workings of the FCRA \n     results in scoring direct lending as substantially less \n     expensive than guaranteed lending.\n       The Budget Resolution instructed CBO to move scoring toward \n     a more ``level playing field'' by scoring Federal \n     administration in a manner similar to mandatory payments for \n     administration in guaranteed lending. Unfortunately, the \n     directive stopped there, and did not apply the same treatment \n     to the remaining administrative costs of guaranteed lending. \n     This results in artificially lower costs for guaranteed \n     lending.\n       This Administration would be glad to join the Congress in a \n     scoring rule change to level the playing field for student \n     loan programs so that the administrative costs of both \n     programs are treated in the identical manner. By doing this, \n     we can take this technical scoring debate off the table, and \n     debate the real benefits and costs of the two approaches to \n     student loans.\n       When we look fairly at the two programs, we see that each \n     provides loan capital to students, but the Direct Loan \n     program does so with far greater ease of administration and \n     far less complexity, and with additional benefits to students \n     through flexible repayment options. Students get their funds \n     with less government red tape, schools get simple \n     administration and low administrative costs, students get \n     better ways to pay their loans, and thousands of \n     intermediaries and attendant complexities are eliminated. \n     Under direct lending, banks, guaranty agencies, and secondary \n     markets lose the billions they have been receiving from \n     Federal subsidies and from excessive charges to students. \n     Advances in technology have made direct lending the better \n     deal for the taxpayer, without regard to technical scoring \n     issues. That is what the public should hear in this debate.\n       In examining the remaining proposals you outlined, this \n     Administration welcomes your willingness to take billions of \n     dollars out of the excess profits of the guaranteed loan \n     programs, and will support your efforts to reduce these \n     federal costs. We further welcome your willingness to set \n     aside most of your earlier plans to eliminate in-school \n     interest subsidies for poor students. But we will oppose \n     proposals that will eliminate or cap direct lending, or \n     increase student costs.\n       With level playing field scoring, your proposals for \n     eliminating profits from the guaranteed loan industry and a \n     reasonable phase in path for direct lending, I can foresee \n     the basis of an agreement that will result in reasonable \n     levels of savings from the loan programs without hurting \n     students.\n       The Administration looks forward to working with you in the \n     weeks ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Alice M.

Let me just mention these few sentences. It is signed by \nRich Bond, who is the former chairman of the Republican National \nCommittee; Diana Culp Borx, who is the former deputy general counsel, \nDepartment of Education; James Pinkerton, the former Deputy Assistant \nto the President for Policy Planning--this is under the previous \nadministration-- Carolynn Reid-Wallace, former Assistant Secretary for \nPostsecondary Education, Department of Education; Nancy Mohr Kennedy, \nformer Assistant Secretary for Legislation and Congressional Affairs, \nDepartment of Education--that is under President Bush--Michael \nHorowitz, former general counsel, Office of Management and Budget, \nCharles Kolb, former Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic \nPolicy; George Pieler, former Acting Deputy Under Secretary for \nPlanning, Budget and Evaluation.\n  These are all leaders in the field of education in the Bush \nadministration. And this was their letter to us.\n\n       As such, a direct loan program offers a more cost-effective \n     delivery system for providing student financial assistance.\n       Replacing the [guaranteed student loan] structure with a \n     steamlined structure will mean not only enhanced \n     accountability but budget savings, but also a more rational \n     delivery system that will particularly benefit students and \n     educational institutions. In particular, we believe direct \n     loans will also ensure greater responsibility and \n     accountability by participating educational institutions.\n       A direct loan program will mean replacing the role \n     currently played by many banks, guarantee agencies, and \n     secondary markets with a much more competitive approach. The \n     intent is not to harm these participants in the existing \n     program but rather to recognize that more competitive, \n     efficient, and practical ways exist to provide student loans. \n     We hope that as the Congress considers direct loans it will \n     look beyond the misleading information that is being spread \n     by representatives of those entities who have a direct \n     financial stake in preserving the status quo.\n\n  I say amen to that.\n  It continues:\n\n       We believe that the Clinton administration has taken the \n     correct position on this issue and urge the Congress to \n     consider this much-needed reform of the student loan program. \n     In fact, much of the initial work that led to the direct loan \n     program currently under consideration was undertaken [by] the \n     Bush administration.\n\n  They are taking credit for the direct loan program.\n\n\n[[Page S 14203]]\n\n       While a valuable direct loan pilot program--\n\n  I point out that was bipartisan, Senator Simon, Senator Durenberger, \nSenator Bradley, I, and others were involved in that debate. But here \nwe have leaders in the education program and in the budget items in the \nprevious administration touting the direct loan program, and \nnonetheless we find our Republican friends in the Human Resource \nCommittee attempting to eliminate it under the Coats amendment last \nweek and severely reduce it even under the proposal by the majority of \nthe Republicans in the committee.\n  The letter continues:\n\n       While a valuable direct loan pilot program was authorized \n     last year, we regret that this work was not pursued more \n     seriously and vigorously during last year's reauthorization. \n     . . . Nonetheless, we hope that the Congress will act in a \n     true bipartisan fashion to approve direct loans in order to \n     bring sweeping and needed reform to the student aid delivery \n     system.\n\n  We say amen to that. That was a bipartisan effort.\n  Here were the leaders under President Bush who were supporting that \nconcept.\n\n       Should bipartisanship not be possible, we [will] call upon \n     our fellow Republicans to unite behind the direct loan \n     proposal and to show leadership in this and other efforts to \n     reform government. We favor reforms that will ensure real \n     value for the taxpayers' dollar, with government activity \n     targeted to ensure more effective efforts delivered in ways \n     that are accountable to the American people.\n\n  Mr. President, there is not a person on our committee on our side \nthat could say it any better than that. And that is something that we \nhope will be understood and recognized. Mr. President, we look forward \nto this debate.\n  I want to just mention, finally, it is our intention to recognize \nthere were 67 Members of this body, bipartisan, for the Simon-Snowe \namendment when we debated education on the budget that restored funding \nfor the higher education. And if that proposal had been accepted in the \nconference with the House--it was rejected out of hand, and we did not \nsee much really of the struggle by our friends and colleagues to try to \nhold onto that proposal--but if that had been held onto, then our \ninstruction would have been at $4.4 billion.\n  We will have a proposal tomorrow to address that $4.4 billion. It is \nour hope that, following the process and the budgetary consideration, \nthat if it comes out of our committee and without complying with the \nlarger instruction which will be devastating to the students and to \nstudent loans and to their parents, that it goes to the Budget \nCommittee, that it is wrapped together with the other recommendations, \nand it then is scored by CBO, and CBO then makes a judgment as to what \nexactly the savings will be.\n  If the savings reach the $245 billion, then instructions go to the \nFinance Committee to have a tax cut for that particular amount. If it \nis $235 billion, then the recommendation will go to the Finance \nCommittee for $235 billion. I think that is absolutely justified. But \nsince two-thirds of the Members of the Senate went on record, \nRepublicans and Democrats, saying it should only be $4.4 billion, we \nare going to recommend that we have $4.4 billion and that we will come \nback to the Senate when we have that opportunity and have a second vote \non the Snowe-Simon amendment, because we believe that truly reflects \nthe sentiment of this body with that overwhelming vote.\n  And that is the responsible way to go rather than to provide this \nvery, very dangerous, unfair, unjustified, unwarranted slashing of the \nstudent loan program in order that we provide the tax cuts for the \nwealthy individuals and corporations.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/25/senate-section/article/S14199-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following measure was read the second time by unanimous consent \nand placed on the calendar.\n\n       S. 1254.

A bill to exempt stored value cards from the Electronic Fund \nTransfer Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n            the exemption for stored value cards act of 1995\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to \naddress this assembly today.\n  We live in a time of great progress; a time when technology is \ngrowing exponentially. Just a few years ago, it would take an ordinary \ncitizen days to send a document from Utah to Washington; today, thanks \nto the fax machine and cyberspace, it takes a matter of seconds. Not \nthat long ago, in order to speak with constituents face to face, we \nwould have no choice but to travel back to our States; now, due to \nsatellite technology, we can participate in electronic town meetings \nand interact with voters 2,500 miles away.\n  Technology also necessitates changes in society in order to deep up \nand reach maximum efficiency. For example, often when using the \ntelephone today, you might run across an automated directory. If you \nare using a digital phone, there is no problem; you can conduct your \nbusiness easily. If, however, you are using an analog line, you \n\n[[Page S 14204]]\nmight meet with some difficulty in concluding your affairs.\n  So it is with Federal regulations. We find the need in today's world \nto guard society from potential abuses through the process of \nregulation. However, technology can make existing regulations obsolete, \nor at least uneconomical to enforce. As the world changes around us, we \nmust be willing and able to adapt.\n  The Electronic Fund Transfer Act, or EFTA, to which I am proposing \nchanges today, regulates the use of debit cards and other so-called \naccess devices to initiate electronic transfers to or from a consumer's \ndeposit or other asset account. The EFTA imposes significant burdens on \nfinancial institutions that hold such accounts. For example, financial \ninstitutions must provide extensive disclosures to consumers before \ninitial electronic fund transfers involving the account are made; they \nmust provide periodic statements to consumers each month which detail \nevery transfer made to or from an account; and they must provide \nreceipts at electronic terminals for electronic fund transfers made by \nconsumers.\n  The EFTA is an important act, but one that requires change due to \ntechnological advancements. Therefore, I propose that we amend the EFTA \nto reflect the progress of the industry. This bill, entitled \n``Exemption for Stored Value Cards,'' modifies the definitions of \n``accepted card or other means of access'' and ``account'' to clarify \nthat the regulatory burdens imposed under the EFTA do not apply to so-\ncalled stored value cards. A stored value card is a card which can be \nused to pay for transactions by use of value which is stored on the \ncard itself.\n  Good examples of stored value cards include the Washington, DC metro \nfare-cards or cards which contain value that can be used at such \ndevices as vending machines, parking meters, or bridge toll booths. \nWhen a stored value or prepaid card is used to pay for a transaction \nwith value stored on the card itself, it does not access the consumer's \naccount and typically does not utilize the systems which are used by \nfinancial institutions to generate receipt information, and other \ninformation needed to comply with the EFTA. As a result, it would be \ninappropriate to apply all of the EFTA regulatory requirements to such \nstored value cards. It is intended, however, that the EFTA would apply \nto such a card when the card is used to access the consumer's deposit, \nsavings, or similar asset account to load value onto the card for use \nat such vending and other machines.\n\n  In addition, application of the EFTA regulatory and procedural \nburdens to stored value cards would significantly impede the \ndevelopment of stored value programs, and in some instances may \nentirely preclude the development of such programs. Stored value card \nprograms typically involve frequent, small dollar transactions with \nunsophisticated vending machines, parking meters, and similar \nequipment. Given the small dollar amount of these transactions, stored \nvalue card programs must be operated at a very low cost in order to be \ncost efficient for merchants, consumers, and card issuers alike. \nApplying the requirements of the EFTA to stored value card programs \nwould significantly raise the cost of operating such programs and, in \nsome instances, would make such programs economically unfeasible. This \namendment also clarifies that the EFTA would not apply to value stored \non other devices such as computers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1270\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXEMPTION FOR STORED VALUE CARDS.\n\n       Section 903 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. \n     1693a) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)--\n       (A) by striking ``(1) the term `accepted card or other \n     means of access' means a card'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(1) the term `accepted card or other means of access' \n     means--\n       ``(A) a card'';\n       (B) by adding ``and'' after the semicolon at the end; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(B) does not include any card, device, or computer that \n     may be used by a person to pay for a transaction through the \n     use of value stored on, or assigned to, that card, device, or \n     computer;'' and\n       (2) in paragraph (2)--\n       (A) by striking ``(2) the term `account' means a demand'' \n     and inserting the following:\n       ``(2) the term `account' means--\n       ``(A) a demand'';\n       (B) by adding ``and'' after the semicolon at the end; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(B) does not include any value that--\n       ``(i) is stored on, or assigned to, a card, device, or \n     computer; and\n       ``(ii) enables a person to pay for a transaction through \n     the use of that value;''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. \n        Hollings, Mr. Kempthorne, and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 1271. A bill to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  the nuclear waste policy act of 1995\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I am joining with other Senators, and \nthe Presiding Officer in introducing legislation that will, I hope--\nafter many years of failure--finally provide for the timely storage and \ndisposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste from the \nNation's defense program and commercial nuclear power plants.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1995 creates an integrated system \nthat will ensure construction of an interim storage facility and \npermanent repository to manage the legacy of America's great defense \nforce, including spent fuel from the Navy's nuclear-powered fleet of \naircraft carriers and submarines, currently stored in my State of \nIdaho, as well as components from dismantled nuclear weapons and \ncommercial spent fuel from about 73 sites in more than 34 States.\n  Mr. President, transferring nuclear waste from the many defense and \ncommercial nuclear sites to a single Federal facility beginning in 1998 \nwas the intent of Congress when it passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nof 1982.\n  Unbelievably, we are only 3 years from the date when the Energy \nDepartment is obligated to begin accepting this radioactive waste, and \nthe DOE is still studying a site in Nevada to determine if it is a \nsuitable location for a deep geologic repository for high-level \nradioactive waste. Because of endless bureaucratic delays that have \nplunged the program into tremendous loss of time, the Federal \nGovernment now says it will not have a repository operating until 2010, \nat the earliest, and probably several years thereafter.\n  That is 12 years after the Federal Government is contractually \nobligated to take title to spent fuel from civilian power plants and \nmore than 10 years after the people of Idaho were first promised that \nhigh-level waste stored at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory \nwould be moved to a permanent repository.\n  Mr. President, you and I know INEL has now managed spent nuclear fuel \nfrom Navy warships for more than 30 years. More recently, it has also \nbecome the resting place for spent fuel and other radioactive \ncomponents from the Three Mile Island incident. Like many nuclear \nfacilities across the country, INEL has served the Federal Government \nand the citizens of America well. But now, the Federal Government must \naccept its responsibility under law to take nuclear waste to a facility \nlicensed by an independent regulator where it can be managed safely and \neconomically.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing with you authorizes \nconstruction of a federally-licensed facility on the Nevada test site \nnear Yucca Mountain to store spent Navy fuel from Idaho National \nEngineering Laboratory and other defense facilities and spent fuel \ncurrently stored at commercial nuclear power plants from Maine to \nCalifornia. The bill instructs the Federal Government to begin \noperation of an interim storage facility in 1998 so that high-level \nradioactive materials can be transferred to the test site, where it can \nbe more easily managed.\n  Transferring nuclear materials from sites around the country to a \nsingle facility holds several advantages over the current system. \nFirst, because the interim storage facility provided in my \n\n[[Page S 14205]]\nbill will be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ensuring \nsafe storage of all materials. Second, a single site will be far more \neconomical to maintain and keep secure. Finally, the storage site \ndesignated in my bill is close to Yucca Mountain, the likely site of a \npermanent repository for high-level waste.\n  Mr. President, though some will surely disagree with our approach, I \ndo not think it is unreasonable to assume that Yucca will eventually be \njudged as suitable for a permanent repository. Nor do I think that \nestablishing a storage site near the mountain compromises the integrity \nof the scientific studies currently ongoing.\n  It is important to recall that scientists and engineers at Yucca \nMountain have conducted the most thorough and comprehensive geological \nsurvey ever undertaken on any piece of earth. After $5 billion in \nexpenditures, the scientists have found no reason why the site would \nnot be suitable for a permanent. nuclear waste repository. Moreover, \nthe bill I am introducing today ensures that research at Yucca Mountain \nwill continue during construction and operation of an interim storage \nfacility.\n\n  Mr. President, the bill I introduce today is similar to legislation \n(H.R. 1020) that passed the House Commerce Committees 30-4 on August 2. \nMy bill includes the following provisions that reform the Federal \nGovernment's spent fuel management program in these critical areas:\n  The bill reaffirms the Federal Government's responsibility to begin \naccepting waste from defense and commercial nuclear facilities in 1998.\n  It authorizes construction of an interim storage facility in two \nphases with date-certain schedules. Phase one will allow acceptance of \nup to 20,000 metric tons of uranium, including defense program waste, \nand phase two permits up to 100,000 metric tons.\n  It authorizes the Energy Department to develop a transportation \nsystem to safely move spent fuel from America's defense and commercial \nnuclear facilities to this single storage site.\n  It authorizes continued development of a permanent repository program \naccording to DOE's 1994 program approach.\n  It requires the Energy Department to take title to spend nuclear fuel \nat plant sites and to operate a transportation system from a contract \nholder's designated site(s) to a Federal interim storage facility.\n  The Federal Department of Energy must purchase transportable storage \ncontainers, taking advantage of technologies available in the \nmarketplace. Defense spent fuel must be transferred to containers that \ncan be used at a storage facility licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission.\n  Funding priorities for the Energy Department's program should be: \nFirst, interim storage and a related transportation system; second, \nconstruction of a railroad spur in Nevada from existing rail lines to \nthe interim storage facility; and third, scientific study for a \nrepository location.\n  Mr. President, the principle difference between the House bill and my \nbill revolves around future funding for civilian spent fuel management. \nThe House committee voted to change current law which has resulted in \nthe Federal Government collecting more than $11 billion from utilities \nand their ratepayers over the last 13 years, while spending less than \nhalf of that amount for the purpose it was intended to be spent for; \nthat is, building a nuclear waste repository. The rest of the money, \nmore than $5 billion, has been used to finance our deficit spending \nhabit.\n  The House bill ensures that in future years appropriations in any \ngiven year will equal contributions from ratepayers. If Congress votes \nto reduce funding for the program, collections from utilities and \nratepayers will be similarly reduced.\n  My bill retains the current funding mechanism for the DOE program. I \nhope as we proceed in the Senate, however, that we will take a close \nlook at the House funding provision or something similar to help ensure \nthat Congress once and for all moves toward ending the practice of \ncollecting funds for specific purposes and then using them to help \nbalance our out of balance budget.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will solve an important issue for the \ncitizens of Idaho, and, frankly, for all Americans. The question of how \nbest to manage spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive materials has \nbeen considered for most of my lifetime, certainly all of my career \nhere in Washington. There is no question that centralized storage and \ndisposal in a remote location is better than leaving nuclear waste \nscattered across the United States at multiple of sites. It is time to \nimplement a centralized storage program and to develop the solution \nthat protects public health and safety and the environment and future \ngenerations.\n  A dozen years ago, the Federal Government signed contracts with \nutilities and agreed to take title to and dispose of used nuclear fuel \nby 1998. Now it is time for the Federal Government to live up to its \ncommitment to these consumers and to the residents of States like mine \nwho have played an essential role in managing the waste from the \nNation's nuclear defense program.\n  Mr. President, there is widespread support for these principles among \nState Governors, attorneys general, utility regulators and more than \n180 Members from both sides of the aisle in the House of \nRepresentatives, which is considering similar legislation. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation to manage the Nation's nuclear \nwaste in an integrated, sensible fashion and to demonstrate to the \nAmerican people that the Federal Government can honor its commitments.\n  The United States has benefited from the many uses of nuclear \nmaterials, whether as a deterrent to global conflict or nuclear fuel \nthat is used to generate electricity in the manners that were \nenvironmentally sound and did not create air pollution.\n  Our generation has benefited enormously from these diverse uses. We \nhave enjoyed peace, economic prosperity and a clearer environment. Now, \nour generation must finally take responsibility to properly manage \nspent fuel from the defense program and from more than 110 commercial \nnuclear powerplants.\n  I am pleased that Senators Faircloth, Hollings, Kempthorne,--as I \nalready mentioned--Kyl and Smith, are joining me as cosponsors. I will \nwork to assure this bill moves through Congress in a timely fashion.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 1272. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation and coastwise trade endorsement for the \nvessel Billy Buck, to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                     trading privileges legislation\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to direct \nthat the vessel Billy Buck, official No. 939064, be accorded coastwise \ntrading privileges and be issued a certificate of documentation under \nsection 12103 of title 46, United States Code.\n  The Billy Buck was constructed in Miami, FL, in 1980, and is a motor \nvessel presently used as a recreational vessel. It is 30.2 feet in \nlength, 10.8 feet in breadth, has a depth of 4.8 feet, and is self-\npropelled.\n  The vessel is owned by William E. Walpole of Wadmalaw Island, SC. Mr. \nWalpole would like to utilize his vessel, in the coastwise trade and \nfisheries of the United States. However, because the vessel was \npreviously owned by a foreign interest and because the owner could not \nfurnish a complete chain of title to the vessel, it did not meet the \nrequirements for coastwise license endorsement in the United States. \nSuch documentation is mandatory to enable the owner to use the vessel \nfor its intended purpose.\n  The owner of the Billy Buck is seeking a waiver of the existing law \nbecause he wishes to use the vessel for charters. His desired \nintentions for the vessel's use will not adversely affect the coastwise \ntrade in U.S. waters. If he is granted this waiver, it is his intention \nto comply fully with U.S. documentation and safety requirements. The \npurpose of the legislation I am introducing is to allow the Billy Buck \nto engage in the coatwise trade and the fisheries of the United States.\n\n

SCHWARTZ\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment today to \nremember Kenneth B. Schwartz of Brookline, MA. I first worked with Ken \nwhen I was Lieutenant Governor and he was general counsel to the \nexecutive office of human services. He had a brilliant analytical mind, \na keen sense of humor, and most important, he was one of the purely \nnicest human beings ever to walk the face of the Earth. He cared deeply \nabout the most vulnerable among us, the elderly, the poor, the mentally \nill.\n  Tragically, he was diagnosed last November with cancer. Despite \nhaving the best medical care available, Ken died September 10, at age \n40, leaving his wife, Ellen Cohen, and his 2-year-old son, Benjamin.\n  Despite pain, surgeries, the devastating effects of chemotherapy, and \nthe mental anguish that knowledge of his condition brought, Ken turned \nhis experience into something quite remarkable and enormously valuable \nfor both those afflicted with cancer and those who treat them.\n  The son and brother of doctors, Ken wrote an article for the Boston \nGlobe magazine on his experience as a patient, and his relationship \nwith the caregivers at the teaching hospital where he was treated. \nKen's article opened the eyes of the medical community in a way that \nrarely occurs even in the most sympathetic and responsive of hospitals. \nHis article came to the attention of the ``Good Morning America'' show, \nwhich featured him in one of its segments. During this all-too-brief \nperiod of time, he also helped establish the Kenneth B. Schwartz Center \nfor the Study of Caregiver-Patient Relationships at Massachusetts \nGeneral Hospital, so that the lessons he learned from his illness might \nbe studied and broadened to the benefit of future patients, their \ndoctors and other caregivers.\n  As was said of Sir Thomas More, Ken was:\n\n       A man of angel's wit and singular learning; I know not his \n     fellow. For where is the man of that gentleness, lowliness \n     and affability? And as time requireth, a man of marvelous \n     mirth and pastimes; and sometimes of as sad a gravity; a man \n     for all seasons.\n\n  I ask that his Boston Globe article be placed in the Congressional \nRecord at this point, and I commend it to all my colleagues in the \nCongress.\n  The article follows:\n\n            [From The Boston Globe Magazine, Jul. 16, 1995]\n\n                           A Patient's Story\n\n                        (By Kenneth B. Schwartz)\n\n       Until last fall, I had spent a considerable part of my \n     career as a health-care lawyer, first in state government and \n     then in the private sector. I came to know a lot about \n     health-care policy and management, government regulations and \n     contracts. But I knew little about the delivery of care. All \n     that changed on November 7, 1994, when at age 40 I was \n     diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. \n\n[[Page S 14207]]\n\n     In the months that followed, I was subjected to chemotherapy, \n     radiation, surgery, and news of all kinds, most of it bad. It \n     has been a harrowing experience for me and for my family. And \n     yet, the ordeal has been punctuated by moments of exquisite \n     compassion. I have been the recipient of an extraordinary \n     array of human and humane responses to my plight. These acts \n     of kindness--the simple human touch from my caregivers--have \n     made the unbearable bearable.\n       During September and October of 1994, I made several visits \n     to the outpatient clinic of a Boston teaching hospital for \n     treatment of a persistent cough, low-grade fever, malaise, \n     and weakness. The nurse practitioner diagnosed me as having \n     atypical pneumonia and prescribed an antibiotic. Despite \n     continued abnormal blood counts, she assured me that I had a \n     post-viral infection and didn't need an appointment with my \n     physician until mid-November, if then. By mid-October, I felt \n     so bad that I decided I could not wait until November 11 to \n     be seen. Disappointed with the inaccessibility of my \n     physician, I decided to seek care elsewhere, with the hope \n     that a new doctor might be more responsive.\n       My brother, a physician who had trained at Massachusetts \n     General Hospital, arranged for an immediate appointment with \n     Dr. Jose Vega, an experienced internist affiliated with MGH. \n     Dr. Vega spent an hour with me and ordered tests, including a \n     chest X-ray. He called within hours to say he was concerned \n     by the results, which showed a ``mass'' in my right lung, and \n     he ordered a computerized-topography scan for more detail. I \n     remember leaving my office for home, saying quickly to my \n     secretary, Sharyn Wallace, ``I think I may have a serious \n     medical problem.'' Indeed, the CT scan confirmed abnormal \n     developments in my right lung and chest nodes.\n       The next day, Dr. Vega, assuring me that he would continue \n     to be available to me whenever I needed him, referred me to \n     Dr. Thomas Lynch, 34-year-old MGH oncologist specializing in \n     lung cancer. Dr. Lynch, who seems driven by the ferocity of \n     the disease he sees every day, told me that I had lung \n     cancer, lymphoma, or some rare lung infection, although it \n     was most likely lung cancer.\n       My family and I were terrified. For the next several \n     months, my blood pressure, which used to be a normal 124 over \n     78, went to 150 over 100, and my heart rate, which used to be \n     a low 48, ran around 100.\n       Within 72 hours of seeing Dr. Lynch, I was scheduled for a \n     bronchoscopy and a mediastinoscopy, exploratory surgical \n     procedures to confirm whether I indeed had lung cancer. \n     Until this point, I had thought that I was at low risk for \n     cancer: I was relatively young, I did not smoke (although \n     I had smoked about a cigarette a day in college and in law \n     school and for several years after that), I worked out \n     every day, and I avoided fatty foods.\n       The day before surgery, I was scheduled to have a series of \n     tests. The presurgery area of the hospital was mobbed, and \n     the nurses seemed harried. Eventually, a nurse who was to \n     conduct a presurgical interview called my name. Already \n     apprehensive, I was breathing hard.\n       The nurse was cool and brusque, as if I were just another \n     faceless patient. But once the interview began, and I told \n     her that I had just learned that I probably had advanced lung \n     cancer, she softened, took my hand, and asked how I was \n     doing. We talked about my 2-year-old son, Ben, and she \n     mentioned that her nephew was named Ben. By the end of our \n     conversation, she was wiping tears from her eyes and saying \n     that while she normally was not on the surgical floor, she \n     would come see me before the surgery. Sure enough, the \n     following day, while I was waiting to be wheeled into \n     surgery, she came by, held my hand, and, with moist eyes, \n     wished me luck.\n       This small gesture was powerful; my apprehension gave way \n     to a much-needed moment of calm. Looking back, I realize that \n     in a high-volume setting, the high-pressure atmosphere tends \n     to stifle a caregiver's inherent compassion and humanity. But \n     the briefest pause in the frentic pace can bring out the best \n     in a caregiver and do much for a terrified patient.\n       The nurse left, and my apprehension mounted. An hour later, \n     I was wheeled to surgery for a biopsy of the chest nodes and \n     the mass in my lung. I was greeted by a resident in \n     anesthesiology, Dr. Debra Reich, who took my pulse and blood \n     pressure and said gently: ``You're pretty nervous, huh?'' She \n     medicated me with tranquilizers, but that did not stop me \n     from asking about where she lived, where she had trained, and \n     whether she was married. I jokingly asked her how come she \n     was the only Jewish doctor I had met during my time at MGH. \n     When it turned out that she lived down the street from me and \n     liked the sandwiches at the same corner shop, Virginia's, I \n     felt comforted. She squeezed my shoulder, wished me luck, and \n     wheeled my into surgery.\n       When I awoke, I was told that I had adenocarcinoma in my \n     right lung and in several chest nodes--in other words, \n     advanced lung cancer. I don't remember a lot about those \n     hours, but I remember Dr. Vega's face, with tears in his \n     eyes. I also remember feeling very sad and scared.\n       A few days later, I received a letter from Dr. Reich: \n     ``Remember me, your friendly anesthesiologist? I came by to \n     see you this afternoon as my professional duty but also to \n     express my sadness in hearing about your diagnosis. Your door \n     was closed and there seemed to be a lot of activity, so I \n     decided not to disturb you.\n       ``As I'm sure you know, we as physicians are taught not to \n     become emotionally involved in our patients because then we \n     would be continually devastated. But I guess because we had \n     such a nice interaction before your surgery and because your \n     life was one which I could relate to so well--being Jewish, \n     professional, renovating a house, sandwiches, at Virginia's, \n     etc.--your situation really struck a chord in me. (Hey, maybe \n     you can't even remember any of this because of the medicine I \n     gave you, but hopefully you do . . .)\n       ``I was very impressed that during the fear and anxiety you \n     were experiencing, you still maintained your composure, your \n     sense of humor, and even thought to ask me when I was \n     getting married.\n       ``So, anyway, as you told me, keeping your wife and son in \n     mind will make you fight strong, and I know this to be true! \n     I know that you have a very loving and supportive family who \n     will help you through this as well.\n       ``Best, wishes, and maybe I'll run into you sometime at \n     Virginia's.''\n       I had not forgotten Dr. Reich, nor will I ever forget her \n     willingness to cross the professional barrier, hold my hand, \n     and write those words.\n       It was clear that I would soon begin a new chapter in my \n     illness and undergo the classic treatment for such advanced \n     cancer, intensive chemotherapy and radiation, followed by \n     surgery to remove the tumors, nodes, and entire lung, if \n     necessary. Dr. Lynch told me that this option presented the \n     real possibility of a cure.\n       Over the next week, I had a series of additional radiologic \n     scans to determine if the cancer had spread beyond my chest. \n     These scans are incredibly scary: You are placed in a tube \n     resembling a sarcophagus, with only 6 inches between you and \n     the walls, and you may spend several hours inside, deafened \n     by the clanging machine. And the scans always raise fears \n     about whether more bad news in around the corner.\n       Dr. Vega or Dr. Lynch always made it a point, though, to \n     relay results within 24 hours so my family and I didn't have \n     to endure the anxiety of uncertainty any longer than \n     necessary.\n       The scans of my body, head, liver, bones, and back were \n     clear. I was relieved.\n       The doctors soon began an intensive regimen of chemotherapy \n     and radiation, with the goal of destroying the cancer and \n     preparing for surgery to remove my lung.\n       Before being admitted for my first five-day course of \n     chemotherapy. I had a radiation-simulation session. During \n     such session, therapists meticulously map their targets by \n     marking your skin where the radiation should be directed. I \n     was asked to lie on a table in a large, cold chamber. The \n     radiation therapist. Julie Sullivan, offered me a blanket \n     and, mentioning that the staff had a tape deck asked if I had \n     any request; I recalled my college days and asked for James \n     Taylor. Listening to ``Sweet Baby James'' and ``Fire and \n     Rain'' I though back to a time when the most serious problem \n     I faced was being jilted by a girlfriend, and tears ran down \n     my cheeks. As therapists came and went, Julie Sullivan held \n     my hand and asked me if I was OK. I thanked her for her \n     gentleness.\n       After having a Port-o-Cath implanted in my chest--a device \n     that allows chemotherapy to be administered without constant \n     needle sticks in the arm--I was admitted to MGH in mid-\n     November. During that and other hospitalizations, either my \n     mother or sister would stay overnight, often sleeping in \n     cramped chairs. When I awoke at night in an anxious sweat or \n     nauseated, I would see one of them and feel reassured.\n       While doctors managed my medical cure, my day-to-day \n     quality of life and comfort were in the hands of two or three \n     nurses. These nurses showed competence and pride in their \n     work, but they also took a personal interest in me. It gave \n     me an enormous boost, and while I do not believe that hope \n     and comfort alone can overcome cancer, it certainly made a \n     huge difference to me during my time in the hospital.\n       During the period between my two chemotherapies, when I \n     also received high-dose radiation twice a day, I came to know \n     a most exceptional caregiver, the outpatient oncology nurse \n     Mimi Batholomay. An eight-year veteran who had experienced \n     cancer in her own family, she was smart, upbeat, and \n     compassionate I had to receive fluids intravenously every day \n     at the clinic, and while there we talked regularly about \n     life, cancer, marriage, and children. She, too, was willing \n     to cross that professional Rubicon--to reach out and talk \n     about my fear of dying or, even worse, my fear of not living \n     out my life, of not biking through the hills of Concord and \n     Weston on summer weekends with my brother, of not seeing my \n     child grown up, of not holding my wife in my arms. And she \n     took the risk of talking about her own father's recent bout \n     with cancer. I cannot emphasize enough how meaningful it was \n     to me when caregivers revealed something about themselves \n     that made a personal connection to my plight. It made me feel \n     much less lonely. The rule books, I'm sure, frown on such \n     intimate engagement between caregiver and patient. But maybe \n     it's time to rewrite them.\n       After my second round of chemotherapy, I was ready for the \n     final stage of what we hoped would be a cure: surgery. Before \n     this could happen, Dr. Lynch repeated my radiologic scans, to \n     be sure that the cancer \n\n[[Page S 14208]]\n     had not spread. He assured me that the chance of any such metastasis \n     was remote--less than 5 percent--although it would be a \n     disaster if it occurred.\n       The scans were endless, scary; and lonely. While members of \n     my family stayed with me in the waiting rooms, they could not \n     accompany me to the scanning rooms; the experience again was \n     harrowing. But I felt my greatest fear while awaiting the \n     results. After a week of tests, I had one last scan of my \n     bones. I was concerned when the technologist asked to do a \n     special scan of my back that had not been done before.\n       The next day, I called Dr. Lynch's office and asked his \n     assistant, Mary Elen Rousell, when I could come in to find \n     out the results. She said, ``How about this afternoon?'' and \n     then added, ``You might want to bring someone.'' My heart \n     skipped. When my wife and I entered Dr. Lynch's office and \n     saw his face, our hearts sank. He was ashen. He said that \n     while all the other scans were clear, there appeared to be a \n     metastatic tumor in my spine. He explained that this meant \n     that lung surgery at this point would be futile, since other \n     metastases were likely to surface.\n       Dr. Lynch said that he could not be 100 percent certain \n     that this was a tumor and that, because so much was at stake, \n     we should do a biopsy. My wife and I wept openly--in part \n     because, looking at Dr. Lynch's face, we felt that he had \n     lost hope.\n       I could not help but ask what treatment options were \n     available, and he mentioned a drug called Taxol. Still being \n     the lawyer, I quizzed him:\n       Me: What is the percentage of people who benefit from \n     Taxol?\n       Dr. Lynch: Forty percent.\n       Me: How much do they benefit?\n       Dr. Lynch: They can get several years of life, although it \n     is not a cure. And the median survival for patients on Taxol \n     with your advanced state of disease is nine months.\n       Nine months! My wife and I cringed. I ended the session by \n     asking Dr. Lynch, ``How do you do this work?'' And he \n     answered, in genuine pain, ``By praying that I don't have \n     days like today.''\n       I began to have trouble sleeping, and when I awoke, I was \n     filled with dread and despair. I thought frequently of the \n     observation of Richard Block, the founder of H Block, who \n     had survived lung cancer after being told initially that he \n     had only months to live: ``I lived for five days without hope \n     and . . . my life during those five days . . . was far worse \n     than at any time during the `horrible' ordeal of tests or \n     treatments.''\n       And when I contemplated not living to see my son grow up or \n     not cherishing my wife for a lifetime, I thought of King \n     Lear, who, at a low point, wailed:\n     I am bound\n     Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears\n     Do scald like molten lead.\n       I desperately needed to regain hope, and I needed Dr. Lynch \n     to regain his sense of hope.\n       A few days later, I had the biopsy. Dr. Lynch met with my \n     family to report that, indeed, after considerable searching, \n     the pathologist had found small deposits of adenocarcinorea \n     in my vertebra. It was now confirmed that I had metestatic \n     lung cancer. Although my brother and my father, who is also a \n     physician, raised the possibility of radical surgery on my \n     back and lung to remove all the tumors, Dr. Lynch and the \n     surgeons rejected this option because further metestates were \n     likely to appear, and the surgery would be debilitating and \n     reduce my quality of life at a time when my life could well \n     be substantially shortened.\n       The clear treatment was more chemotherapy. Dr. Lynch again \n     recommended the use of Taxol, with the hope of slowing the \n     cancer's spread.\n       My wife and I were largely silent during the medical \n     discussion. I asked my father and brother to leave so my wife \n     and I could talk not facts and figures but matters of the \n     heart. When they had left, I said to Dr. Lynch, ``You told me \n     two things all along: One, that you were aiming for a total \n     cure, and if that were not feasible, you would tell me at \n     that time. And two, you would never, ever give up on me, \n     never stop trying to fight, to extend my life as long as \n     possible. Am I no longer on the cure route?''\n       He looked somberly at us and explained that there were no \n     known treatments to cure this stage of cancer.\n       ``And will you stick by me and fight to the end?'' I asked.\n       He nodded vigorously and then outlined a number of state-\n     of-the-art, experimental protocols from which I might benefit \n     after Taxol.\n       And, leaving statistics behind, he talked of several \n     patients who had defied the odds and lived for years beyond \n     expectations. He advised that my goal should be to be here \n     the same time next year, and then the year after, and the \n     year after--one day at a time, one month at a time, one year \n     at a time. He mentioned several breast-cancer patients who \n     had told him that they had relished their final years with \n     their children in a way that they had never known before. It \n     felt good to leave the medical talk and speak heart to heart, \n     and it felt to me that he had regained a sense of hope--not \n     for some magical cure but for the possibility of extending my \n     life.\n       It was critical to my wife and to me that he not give up \n     hope. I understood his surprise and disappointment at the \n     metastasis; in fact as one friend suggested, his distress in \n     that event was a sign of his caring about me and his \n     involvement with my case. But we desperately needed him to \n     give us a realistic basis for hope--and he had.\n       The next day, I began a new chapter in my fight. And once \n     again, Mimi Bartholomay was by my side, monitoring my \n     reaction and assuring me that most people tolerated Taxol \n     very well. I had no allergic reactions, and I felt good that \n     the battle was under way. I had hoped that maybe this would \n     buy me time. Time was now my best friend, since it could \n     allow medical research to advance and doctors to find new \n     strategies and maybe even a cure for advanced lung cancer.\n       During this period, with help from my father, who has had a \n     long and distinguished career in academic medicine, I began \n     to explore potential cutting-edge protocols that could \n     supplement or follow Taxol.\n       My father arranged a meeting for my wife and me with Dr. \n     Knot J. Isselbacher, a distinguished researcher and director \n     of the MGH Cancer Center. He is a small man with a large \n     presence and piercing blue eyes, and he was surrounded by \n     medical books, papers, and many pictures of his family. He \n     was upbeat, telling us of protocols under way that showed \n     promise in fighting metastatic tumors. Like several others, \n     be told me a personal story that cut to the bone: A close \n     family member, he said, had been diagnosed with advanced \n     cancer, which the attending oncologist had said was ``very, \n     very bad.'' The family member had said to him: ``Kurt you \n     have helped so many people in your lie, can you now help \n     me!'' He personally treated the family member in that \n     person's home with chemotherapy, and, 21 years later, that \n     person is thriving.\n       Dr. Isselbacher offered to serve as an advocate for me, to \n     work with my father and Dr. Lynch to find the most promising \n     protocols. I told him at the meeting that while I had no \n     illusions, I was deeply moved by his refusal to give up and \n     by his abiding hope; I was especially affected because such \n     hopefulness was not coming from a faith healer but a \n     distinguished researcher. He has strengthened our resolve to \n     fight.\n       As I grappled to maintain my hope in the face of the \n     advancing disease, I was referred to Dr. Ned Cassen, a senior \n     MGH psychiatrist who not only had had vast experience with \n     the seriously ill but was himself a Jesuit priest. I had met \n     with him once during my second hospitalization, and my memory \n     through the haze was that he was the first person with whom I \n     had discussed death. I remembered that when I had asked him \n     if, when, and how I should say goodbye to people, he said, \n     ``You know, you don't have to wait to say goodbye; you can \n     express you love and appreciation for people right now, every \n     day.''\n       After the devastating news of the metastasis, I felt the \n     urge to seek our Dr. Cassem again, in part to ask if there \n     was anything more I should be doing to help my son, Ben, cope \n     with my illness or the eventuality of my death. I mentioned \n     that several people had suggested I make a videotape for Ben \n     but that I thought I couldn't do that. Dr. Cassem replied \n     that every time we played or laughed together, we were \n     creating building blocks, precious memories that will be part \n     of him forever.\n       I also asked him if he thought I should be doing more to \n     prepare for the possibility of an early death. He looked \n     perplexed and asked, ``Have you prepared your will?'' I said \n     yes. ``Are your affairs otherwise in order'' I again said \n     yes. ``So it sounds like you are prepared. . . . Remember, \n     death is a minor matter. Living . . . that's the challenge.''\n       I then told him of the paradox that moments of great \n     pleasure--playing with my son, snuggling with my wife, \n     talking intensely with friends--also caused me great pain and \n     tears. Was I depressed? Was this something to worry about? He \n     looked at me thoughtfully and said: ``When you cry about your \n     son, it's because he has touched you deeply. It's an \n     affirmation of your love for him. When you weep about the joy \n     you experience with your wife or close friends that's an \n     acknowledgment of your love for them. That's not a bad thing. \n     . . . Maybe a day without tears has been a dull day.'' I \n     nodded and then could not help but ask: ``Do you believe in \n     the power of prayer'' Dr. Cassem nodded. ``Absolutely,'' he \n     said, ``and your name is on my prayer list.'' I felt warmed \n     in his presence, by his wisdom, his common sense, and his \n     spirituality.\n       In recent months, I have had several setbacks: a bone scan \n     that showed four to five additional tumors, and a CT scan \n     that showed significant progression of the cancer in both \n     lungs. The only good news was that it had not spread to my \n     head or liver. I am pained, but not surprised, at the \n     relentlessness of the disease, and I am straining to retain \n     hope that one of the experimental treatments may succeed \n     where chemotherapy has failed.\n       For the first time, I recently mentioned to Dr. Lynch the \n     idea of a hospice service and wondered how I might reduce \n     future pain as the cancer progresses. Dr. Lynch answered that \n     we were still a long way from that discussion, that we still \n     had many avenues to explore, and that he remained as \n     committed as ever to doing whatever he could to extend my \n     life in a quality way.\n       Around the time of the CT scan, when I was feeling \n     particularly dejected, I had an appointment with Mimi \n     Bartholomay for an injection. She was running late, and as \n     she approached me in the clinic waiting room, she looked \n     harried. But as she got closer, she could see how unhappy I \n     was, and she put her arm around me and directed me to a \n     private room. I began to cry, and she intuitively responded: \n     ``You know, scan days are the \n\n[[Page S 14209]]\n     worst. But whatever the results, we are not going to give up on you. \n     We're going to fight with you and for you all the way.'' I \n     hugged her and thanked her for hanging in there with me.\n       If I have learned anything, it is that we never know when, \n     how, or whom a serious illness will strike. If and when it \n     does, each one of us wants not simply the best possible care \n     for our body but for our whole being.\n       I still am bound upon Lear's wheel of fire, but the love \n     and devotion of my family and friends, and the deep caring \n     and engagement of my caregivers, have been a tonic for my \n     soul and have helped to take some of the sting from my \n     scalding tears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/25/senate-section/article/S14206-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO THE MISSOURI MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay a special tribute \nto the Missouri Merchants and Manufacturers Association. I am very \npleased to recognize this organization for its 15 years of superior \nservice to the Missouri business community.\n  The Missouri Merchants and Manufacturers Association was formed in \n1980. With hard work and untiring commitment, the MMMA has grown into a \nstrong, well respected voice in the legislative process representing \nover 5,000 small and mid-sized businesses across the State of Missouri. \nIt is actively involved in educating MMMA members and serving as an \nadvocate on State legislative issues impacting businesses.\n  While Governor of Missouri, I found that the MMMA's active \ninvolvement in State legislative issues provided a vital resource. As \nchairman of the Committee on Small Business, I highly value the \ninsights they have shared on numerous issues of great importance to \nAmerica's business.\n  The quality individuals that comprise the MMMA epitomize the kind of \ndedication, work ethic and ideals necessary to meet the ongoing \nchallenges and demands of the business community. Their leadership has \ninfluenced passage of important legislation and provided dependable \nresources in many court cases to benefit employers. The Missouri \nMerchants and Manufacturers Association will commemorate its 15th \nanniversary at an annual fall dinner on September 30, 1995. It is my \ngreat pleasure to congratulate the MMMA for this significant \naccomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/25/senate-section/article/S14209-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE AMERICORPS PROGRAM\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, over the last few months, there \nhave been a number of speeches in this Chamber and even more outside of \nit criticizing pointless partisanship. Although matters of philosophy \nand implementation do frequently divide Senators on this side of the \naisle from those on the other side, the country has a right to expect \nthat we will seize every chance to work together.\n  I would have thought that national service provided a perfect \nopportunity for that common ground. Republicans and Democrats alike \nhave called for greater personal responsibility, for increased \ninvolvement of citizens in our communities, for people pitching in to \ndo what needs to be done to make America as smart and safe and strong \nas we have dreamed it could be.\n  These are the very same goals of AmeriCorps, the new domestic Peace \nCorps established by Congress only 2 years ago. Just this past week, \nthe first 20,000 AmeriCorps members completed their service in my State \nof Connecticut and all across the country. I know how much they have \nachieved in Connecticut.\n  Forty percent of the 300 students tutored by the University of \nBridgeport AmeriCorps members have increased their levels of \nachievement in one or more areas. AmeriCorps members in the Leadership, \nEducation and Athletics in Partnership [LEAP] program trained 600 \nchildren to volunteer at the Special Olympics when they were held in \nNew Haven. Community Action for Greater Middlesex County was able to \nbring over 60 volunteers to Christmas in April, thanks to the presence \nof AmeriCorps members. They refurbished 15 bedrooms and 8 bathrooms at \nthe Eddy Shelter and rehabilitated the home of 90-year-old Alice \nTaylor, who, in her own lifetime has taken care of over 1,000 foster \nchildren, as well as raised her own 8 children.\n  AmeriCorps offers an opportunity for young people and Americans of \nall ages. It makes the dream of a college education a reality for \nfamilies who work hard and play by the rules--while meeting compelling \nhuman needs in our communities in a cost effective manner.\n  Independent analyses show just how cost-effective this initiative has \nbeen in its first year. The GAO said that the Corporation for National \nService's resources total about $17,600 per member, which is not only \nin line with the Corporation's estimate of $18,800 per member but in \nline with what Congress authorized.\n  Mr. President, the only formal cost-benefit analysis of AmeriCorps, \ndone by four conservative economists, estimated a return of $1.60 to \n$2.60 in direct benefits for every dollar AmeriCorps invests.\n  We need to build on this success, not walk away from it. The private \nsector poured $41 million in resources into local AmeriCorps programs \nthis last year, a tremendous feat when you consider that Congress had \ncalled for $32 million in matching funds from all sources. We've got an \nimpressive public/private partnership going here and we really need to \nnurture it.\n  We won't find common ground or reach higher ground if we turn \nnational service into a partisan political football. We owe those \n20,000 AmeriCorps members--and all Americans--better than that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/25/senate-section/article/S14209-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14209-S14210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JASON REESE\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to take the time today \nto commend a very special Tennessean who has shown tremendous strength \nof character and a will to succeed. Jason Reese is an 18-year-old from \nMorristown, TN, who has just been named the Boys & Girls Club of \nAmerica's 1995-96 National Youth of the Year for his commitment to \ncommunity service, scholastic achievement, and leadership skills.\n  Jason entered the competition for National Youth of the Year when he \nbecame the Morristown Boys & Girls Club's Youth of the Month and later \ntheir Youth of the Year. He was then chosen Youth of the Year by the \nState of Tennessee and the southeast regional representative for the \nnational competition. The finalists traveled to Washington, D.C. and \nwere judged on their activities in their local Boys & Girls Clubs, \ntheir values and integrity, their academic achievements, their service \nto their communities, and their commitment to their families.\n  As the National Youth of the Year, Jason will have the opportunity to \nmeet with youth from Boys & Girls Clubs throughout the country and \ndiscuss the impact the programs can have on one individual. For years, \nJason lived without a male role model. But through drive and \ndetermination, Jason Reese overcame those obstacles, and he has become \na role model for other youths.\n  Jason was abandoned by his father when he was a baby, and later his \nstepfather abandoned him and his two younger stepbrothers. Jason grew \nup quickly, holding a part-time job, working hard in school, and caring \nfor his brothers at home while his mother worked and attended school. \nHe also joined the Boys & Girls Club in Morristown, where he grew up in \nother ways. There, he served as a junior staff member, a member of the \nKeystone Leadership Club, and as a delegate to the club's board of \ndirectors. He took part in most of the club's programs, and he learned \nthe social and leadership skills that he says gave him the motivation \nand self-esteem he needed to succeed in his school, community, and \nfamily.\n  Outside of the Boys & Girls Club, Jason has volunteered in nursing \nhomes, helped refurbish a local park, and tutored younger children. \nThroughout that time, he maintained a 3.83 cumulative grade point \naverage in his advanced and college placement curriculum at Morristown-\nHamblen School West, and he took on enough responsibilities at home to \nallow his mother to work and graduate from college with a degree in \npsychology.\n  After 8 years in the Boys & Girls Club and a lifetime of his own \ndedication, Jason Reese has entered the University of Tennessee at \nKnoxville as a freshman honors student in engineering. In addition to \nbeing a National Merit Scholar and a UT Centennial Scholar, Jason will \nreceive a $10,000 scholarship \n\n[[Page S 14210]]\nfrom the Reader's Digest Association, which sponsored the National \nYouth of the Year Award. Those combined scholarships will cover the \ncosts of Jason's tuition, books, and room and board for the next 4 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, I had the pleasure to meet briefly with Jason at my \nconstituent coffee last week when he was in Washington, D.C., with the \nother four finalists. Jason has the commitment and the integrity to \nlead the Nation's youth. And I have great confidence that his year as \nthe National Youth will not only benefit him personally, but will have \na positive impact on the millions of kids in Boys & Girls Clubs \nthroughout the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/25/senate-section/article/S14209-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         COMMEMORATING 1995 HEALTHY CHOICE AMERICAN HEART WALK\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to \na wonderful opportunity for my colleagues and their staff to do \nsomething good for both themselves and for America; to participate in \nthe Healthy Choice American Heart Walk on September 28 at noon. \nAmerica's national campaign to fight heart disease will start in the \nNation's Capital with a walk on the National Mall involving thousands \nof our fellow Government and congressional leaders, celebrities, \nFederal workers, and others.\n  It is fitting to begin this event in our Nation's Capital because \nheart disease is a national problem. It is our Nation's No. 1 killer \nand disabler, and it exacts a devastating emotional and financial toll \neach year. Of the 10 leading causes of death in our country, heart \ndisease leads the list, and kills more of us each year than the next 9 \ncauses combined. And the financial impact of heart disease and stroke \naccounts for about one-seventh of our Nation's entire health care bill.\n  Local American Heart Association chapters have organized more than \n800 walks involving thousands of people in cities and towns from coast-\nto-coast in late September and early October. The steps that will be \ntaken on The Mall this Thursday begin a national round of Heart Walks \nin which over 400,000 Americans will participate. In the next few \nweeks, this army of walkers will cover more than 1.2 million miles and \nwill raise more than $13 million for the American Heart Association.\n  With the Heart Walk, we can all--quite literally--take meaningful \nsteps toward conquering this killer. We can also advance our cause in \ntwo critical ways--by taking steps toward a heart-smart lifestyle and \nhelping others by raising funds to support the ongoing education and \nresearch efforts of the American Heart Association.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to fit this into their schedules \nand to encourage their staff to participate as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/25/senate-section/article/S14210-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  NOTE\n\n  In the Record of Friday, September 22, 1995, during the consideration \nof the message from the House on S. 440, at page S14144, the text of \nthe House message was inadvertently omitted.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Highway Funding \n     Restoration Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) Federal infrastructure spending on highways is critical \n     to the efficient movement of goods and people in the United \n     States;\n       (2) section 1003(c) of the Intermodal Surface \n     Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 has been estimated to \n     result in fiscal year 1996 highway spending being reduced by \n     as much as $4,200,000,000;\n       (3) such section 1003(c) will cause every State to lose \n     critical funds from the Highway Trust Fund that can never be \n     recouped; and\n       (4) the funding reduction would have disastrous effects on \n     the national economy, impede interstate commerce, and \n     jeopardize the 40-year Federal investment in the Nation's \n     highway system.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to make the program categories in the current Federal-\n     aid highway program more flexible so that States may fund \n     current, high-priority projects in fiscal year 1996;\n       (2) to eliminate programs that are not critical during \n     fiscal year 1996 and to reallocate funds so that the States \n     will be able to continue their core transportation \n     infrastructure programs;\n       (3) to restore funding for exempt highway programs;\n       (4) to ensure the equitable distribution of funds to \n     urbanized areas with a population over 200,000 in a manner \n     consistent with the Intermodal Surface Transportation \n     Efficiency Act of 1991; and\n       (5) to suspend certain penalties that would be imposed on \n     the States in fiscal year 1996.\n\n     SEC. 203. STATE HIGH PRIORITY PROJECT RESTORATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--On October 1 of each of fiscal years 1996 \n     and 1997, or as soon as possible thereafter, the Secretary \n     shall
