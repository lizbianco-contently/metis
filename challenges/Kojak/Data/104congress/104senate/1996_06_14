Mr. President, this past Monday while I was on the \nSenate floor, I suggested that there should be a relevance between what \npublic policyholders say in the pursuit of seeking higher office and \nwhat they do if they are fortunate enough to achieve that.\n  In particular, I was alluding to the promise that this administration \nmade to middle America that it would significantly lower the tax burden \non the American middle class, the vast majority of our American \ncitizens, but, in fact, by August of the first year in office, they had \ntotally reversed that\n\n[[Page S6256]]\n\npromise and had, in fact, increased taxes at historical proportions, \nresulting in most American working families today having a higher tax \nburden, having less of their paychecks in their checking accounts than \nat any time in American history.\n  But the administration made another promise that it did try to keep, \nin all credit. They promised to revise the health care system in the \nUnited States. Indeed, when they came before the American people, their \nproposal was to totally federalize or take American medicine and have \nthe American Government take it over.\n  So what that meant was that the Federal Government would increase to \nunprecedented proportions, that a new entitlement would be created that \nwould be larger than any entitlement in American history, including \nSocial Security, that 17 percent of the American economy would be taken \nover by the Government, and for the first time, Mr. President, the \nGovernment would control over half the American economy.\n  I can remember saying at the time, as a kid, I never believed that it \nwould be possible for me to be in the U.S. Senate debating whether or \nnot the Government should control over half the American economy. But, \nindeed, that is what we were doing just 2 years ago.\n  It was a very elaborate system that controlled every aspect of \nmedicine. By the time the debate was over, Mr. President, the American \npeople had defeated President Clinton's health care proposals. By the \ntime the final cast was set, less than one-third of the American people \nsupported the idea. Over two-thirds opposed it, because they saw it for \nwhat it was, a massive explosion in the growth of our Government, a \nmassive incursion into the personal affairs of every American citizen \nand family and business and community, an enormous and explosive cost.\n  Mr. President, at the time we were debating this proposal, often \nthose of us, such as myself, were asked, ``Well, what would you do?'' \nWe talked about targeted reform. We talked about making benefits more \nportable so that they could move with the employee and we could put an \nend to this job lock where a person who developed a medical problem \ncould not move from one job to another because they would not have been \nable to keep their insurance.\n  We talked about making the insurance marketplace more friendly. We \ntalked about making it more possible for people to obtain insurance. We \ntalked about making it a guaranteed issue, all of these targeted \nreforms that we thought would modestly change the marketplace and make \nit easier for uninsured people to gain insurance.\n  Mr. President, this Senate and the House have both fulfilled that \npromise. They have done exactly that. They have passed health reform \nthat eliminates job lock. It allows an ambitious worker to leave a job \nand move to a better one without losing health coverage. It allows the \nself-employed to deduct on their taxes 80 percent of their health \ninsurance premium. This is an egregious--an egregious--error in the \nworkplace. If you work for a large company, your health premiums are \ndeductible, they are tax deductible. If you work for yourself, they are \nnot. This corrects it. It allows the small business with 50 or fewer \nemployees or the self-employed to have tax-free medical savings \naccounts.\n  We have been joined by Senator Gramm, the senior Senator from Texas, \nwho wants to speak on this subject. But let me just say that the \ndesigners of massive Government control of the health system are \nblocking this reform proposal through parliamentary means. They are \nrefusing to allow the conferees to be selected. It is because they do \nnot want the product of medical savings accounts, which allows the \nworker or the citizen to create a savings account to help them manage \nhealth costs, to lower health costs, to give them more freedom in the \nhealth care system. They do not like that. So they have systematically \nblocked these reforms that the Nation overwhelmingly supports.\n\n  I find it a bit unusual that the last vestige of those who want to \nmake the Government consume over half our economy, who want to run \nevery aspect of our personal lives by controlling medicine and every \ndoctor and every hospital, every cure that you may or may not want to \nuse, just cannot abide the idea of allowing citizens this product to \nmake choices on their own. I will come back to this subject in a bit. \nWe have been joined by the senior Senator from Texas. I yield up to 10 \nminutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bond). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me thank our dear colleague from \nGeorgia. I want to say a few words on another subject, but let me \naddress the subject at hand first. Let me say to our dear colleague \nfrom Georgia, I do not think he ought to be surprised.\n  I believe that the final battle for the rights of man, the final \ndetermination of whether freedom, both economic and political freedom, \nwill survive and prosper on this planet is not going to be determined \non the frozen tundra of Russia, it is not going to be determined by \ndebate in the Kremlin; it is going to be determined right here on the \nfloor of the United States Senate.\n  I try to make a distinction because I think Americans get confused \nabout what freedom is. Freedom is not just the right to get up and \ncriticize the Government. Freedom is not just the right to exercise \npolitical choices. Freedom is the right to exercise economic choices. \nFreedom is the right to buy the products you choose. Freedom is the \nright to spend your own money which you have earned by the sweat of \nyour own brow. That is what we are talking about here today.\n  I think probably most people are totally confused about what this \ndebate is. Our Democratic colleagues are hoping they are. Because what \nthis debate is all about is freedom. There are some Members of the U.S. \nSenate who are for it and there are some Members of the U.S. Senate \nwho, in its economic manifestation of the right of people to choose \nwhat kind of health insurance they want, are against it.\n  Senator Kennedy and the Democrats are saying, in holding up the \nconference on a health care bill that passed the Senate 100 to 0--100 \nto 0--he is saying that he is opposed to it because if we go to \nconference with the House to work out our differences, medical savings \naccounts could end up in the bill.\n  What are medical savings accounts? What we are talking about here is \nsimply the right of people to choose between buying a low-deductible \nhealth insurance policy, which for a family of four costs about $4,200 \na year, where the insurance company starts paying almost immediately if \nsomebody in your family gets sick. That is conventional health \ninsurance. It has one big problem, and that is, once you are sick, you \nare spending somebody else's money. You have no incentive to be \nconscientious. Costs are exploding.\n  Just imagine if you went to the grocery store, and you had a grocery \ninsurance policy. For everything you put in your basket, the grocery \ninsurance policy paid 95 percent of it. You would eat differently, and \nso would your dog. But what would happen is, grocery insurance would \nexplode in cost. That is exactly what has happened in health insurance.\n  What we are trying to do is to let people, especially young people \nwho do not have much money, buy a new kind of health insurance policy \nthat would have a higher deductible. You could buy a Blue Cross-Blue \nShield policy, with a $3,000 deductible, for about $2,200 a year rather \nthan the $4,200 a year you are paying for by buying the comprehensive \nlow-deductible policy.\n  Why $2,000 less? Because a lot of that is, for all practical \npurposes, prepaid medicine. What we are proposing is that people be \nable to take that $2,000 they save and put it into a tax-free savings \naccount and use it to pay deductibles. But the magic, almost magical \npower of it, is that if they do not use the money for medical purposes, \nthey get to keep it. So unless they get very sick, 92 percent of \nAmerican families would never spend beyond their medical savings \naccount in a year. So unless they get very sick, they have an incentive \nto be cost conscious because they are spending their own money.\n  Here is the point. We are not trying to make people buy medical \nsavings accounts. There is nothing in our proposal that makes anybody \nbuy it. What we are trying to do is to let them do it. This is about \nfreedom.\n  Senator Kennedy and the Democrats claim, ``Oh, this program only \nhelps\n\n[[Page S6257]]\n\nrich people.'' Have you ever noticed that everything Democrats are \nagainst supposedly helps rich people? They did not want to cut taxes on \nworking families, a $500 tax credit per child, because they say that \nhelps rich people. If they want to raise taxes, of course, they claim \nthey are taxing only rich people.\n  In any case, do rich people care about this? What difference does it \nmake to rich people whether they buy a low-deductible or high \ndeductible policy? By definition, if you are rich, you have a lot of \nmoney. It cannot make possibly any difference.\n  But let me tell you who it makes a difference to. I have a son who \njust turned 23 years old. He is off my insurance policy. For the first \ntime in his life, he is trying to decide how he is going to get health \ninsurance and how he is going to buy it. He is as healthy as most 23-\nyear-old males and females are. Why not allow him to buy a high-\ndeductible policy and take the savings, put them into a medical savings \naccount and build up a nest egg to go to graduate school, or to try to \nstart a business, or to buy a home when he gets married?\n\n  When we debated this subject before, I had quotes from two so-called \nrich people who use medical savings accounts. One of them was a united \nmine worker, because the United Mine Workers Union has medical savings \naccounts, but they do not get fair tax treatment on them. They have to \npay taxes on them. The other was a part-time bus driver. They were \narguing they ought to be treated fairly, and I agree with them and not \nwith the Senator from Massachusetts, who is objecting to letting us \nappoint conferees and bring this bill up.\n  The second argument is, well, look, this helps young people and \nhealthy people. Who does not have health insurance? Basically, young \nhealthy people are not buying health insurance because, A, they do not \nthink they need it right now and, B, they cannot afford it. Why not \nhave a policy available that may not be used by everybody, but that \nwill be used by young people so that they can buy basic coverage. The \nDemocrats' solution is to guarantee that they can buy insurance in the \nfuture once they get sick rather than now when they are young and \nhealthy, but at the cost of charging everybody else higher rates.\n  We need medical savings accounts, and this is about freedom. The \nDemocrats want the Clinton-type health care bill. That is what they \nwant. And they know medical savings accounts move us toward private \nfamily decisions. They want Government decisions. That is what this \ndebate is about, and if you believe in freedom, you are with us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6255-7", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6257-S6258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTERNATIONAL DEPARTURE TAX\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Now, I want to turn to another subject. The President has \nput out a new list of savings measures, and among the savings measures \nis an international departure tax increase--$2.3 billion of savings. \nNow, you might ask, what does a tax increase have to do with savings? \nThe answer is, nothing. We have, in this administration, a new language \nwhere everyday words are changed into new words and they have nothing \nto do with each other. But this is basically a proposal to raise taxes \non international travel by imposing a $10 per passenger tax on \neverybody buying a round-trip ticket in international travel, coming to \nthe United States and going back, or leaving the United States and \ncoming back. Now, if you have Americans traveling, some people assume \nthey must be rich. So you want to tax them. So I am not going to get \ninto that argument. I think it is absurd. We know that not everybody \nwho travels internationally is rich.\n  Let me talk about the 42,983,000 foreigners who come to the United \nStates. Well, you might say, why not tax them? They cannot vote here, \nso why not tax their money while we have them? What do they come here \nfor? Well, they come here to invest, to create jobs, and to be \ntourists. In fact, as tourists, they spent $76.485 billion last year. \nWhy, I ask, should we be trying to raise barriers against people who \nwant to come to Atlanta, or who want to come to Houston or who want to \ngo to San Antonio to see the Alamo? Why should we want to raise \nbarriers to people who want to come and see where great Americans come \nfrom, like South Carolina, and who came to the Alamo to defend \nfreedom--especially when they are spending $76.485 billion on the trip? \nTo save my life, I do not understand that.\n  We did a little check in asking just one hotel manager that we \nhappened to be having a conversation with, who works for Marriott \nHotels in Houston, what percentage of the people staying in his hotels, \non an average night, are foreign nationals. He estimated that 40 \npercent of the people staying in Marriott Hotels in Houston are foreign \nnationals. Now, why would we want to discourage all these people from \ncoming to America to spend money? Well, it is interesting that by a \nfairly conservative estimate, in international tourism alone, this tax \nwould cost us twice as much as the Government is claiming to collect. I \nknow some people will make an argument that these people who would make \nthis money from international tourism will squander it. They will spend \nit on their children, they might go to Disneyland, they might invest in \nsome private business; and that the Government, collecting half as much \nmoney from this tax as these private citizens would earn, will spend it \nwisely--on the National Endowment for the Arts or the Legal Services \nCorporation--but not getting into those arguments, I am opposed to this \ndeparture tax increase.\n\n  I want people to come to America. I want people from all over the \nworld to come here and see the Alamo and see the Capitol and get to \nknow our country and understand, personally, its greatness, get to know \nTexans and Americans, and bring that $76 billion a year with them and \nspend it here.\n  This is a poorly designed tax that will cost us jobs. It is a bad \nidea. I just want to remind people that taking the whole travel \nindustry in America, we have almost a million people employed--about \n960,000 people--because of international travelers. In fact, hundreds \nof thousands of people are going to come, for example, to Atlanta to \nthe Olympics. People are coming to many different places around our \ncountry. My view is, let them come, let them spend their money when \nthey get here. But the idea of erecting barriers to them coming, to \ncollect a tax, it seems to me, is foolhardy and should be rejected.\n  This is part of something bigger. The Securities and Exchange \nCommission now collects twice as much in their taxes on securities as \nit spends to run the SEC. None of this money the President calls \nsavings through this new tax would go to support the Federal Aviation \nAdministration--not one penny of it. It would go to fund Government \nprograms in general. We have fees on the transportation of hazardous \nmaterials that began as a relatively low figure. It is now $300. It was \ninitially applied to trucks, railroads, and barges hauling things like \ncrude petroleum. It is now being applied in Texas to 10,000 independent \noil producers, who do not even transport the crude oil themselves. The \nadministration has proposed to raise it to as much as $5,000 a year and \ncollect as much as $50 million out of my State just from independent \noil producers. Why? Because these increased fees could be used as taxes \nto fund Government in general. They would not be used for the purposes \nthey were set out for. Just like this gasoline tax we have been trying \nto repeal, which is not going to build roads, it is going to general \nrevenue.\n  My view is--and I will conclude on this--when you collect taxes on \ngasoline, motor fuel, it ought to go to roads. When you collect taxes \non airline tickets, it ought to go to the FAA to build airports, to \nsupport the infrastructure. What is happening in this administration is \nall these fees are being raised because they want to spend the money \nand they want to hide the tax. This departure tax increase on airline \ntickets is wrong. I wanted to come down today to say I am opposed to \nit, and I do not intend to see it become the law of the land.\n  I thank my colleague from Georgia. When all those millions of \ntourists coming through Atlanta and spend all that money, remember, I \ndid not want to erect the barrier.\n  (Mr. INHOFE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Missouri appears \nto be requesting up to 5 minutes. I yield up to 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Missouri.\n\n[[Page S6258]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleague from Georgia. I particularly commend \nmy good friend from Texas for pointing out what we in the Midwest, as \nwell as the Southwest, feel so strongly about, which is that when you \nraise fees on people who use highways, it is not pleasant. But when \nthey go to highways, we can understand what they are being used for. If \nyou raise fees on people who generate hazardous waste, if it goes to \nclean up hazardous waste, that is a reasonable argument. But when it \ngoes to the general revenue fund, permits spending and overspending in \nmany areas, it is a real problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6257-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FEDERAL RESERVE NOMINEES\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the reason I rise today, I want to address a \ncouple of related subjects, things that we are working on, and they \nhave to do with some of the debates that have been going on about the \nnominees for the Federal Reserve.\n  I have the pleasure of having as one of my constituents a fellow \nMissourian, Dr. Laurence Meyer, who has been nominated to the Federal \nReserve Board. When we get to the discussions of the Federal Reserve \nnominations next week, I want to make the case very strongly that Dr. \nMeyer has justly earned a reputation as a leading economist. He has \nplayed a key role in the development and expansion of the economics \ndepartment of Washington University. He has been recognized repeatedly \nby faculty, students, by the public at large, and by his own colleagues \nas a leader in these fields. His is an excellent nomination. I also say \nthat we are very fortunate that the President has proposed renomination \nand he has agreed to accept the current Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard, Chairman Alan Greenspan. During his 8-year tenure, economic \nperformance through administrations, Republican and Democrat, has been \noutstanding because inflation has been kept under control.\n\n  Again, I want to address more of Chairman Greenspan's accomplishments \nlater on. But I want to straighten out a couple of misconceptions that \nhave been raised by others on this floor yesterday in their debates \nabout the Federal Reserve. They seem to think that growth in this \ncountry is slow because of the Federal Reserve. Mr. President, the \nFederal Reserve job, as the chief monetary regulator, is to deal with \nmonetary policy. Monetary policy can be a brake or an accelerator, but \nit is not the essential engine that drives the economy of this country. \nThat is fiscal policy and the opportunity for this economy to grow. We \nhave had a major hit to the engine of our economy. It is a hit that has \nhappened over the years in terms of running up the deficit. This \ndeficit has been out of control. We have raised $5 trillion worth of \ndebt that sits on the backs of our children, our grandchildren, and \nfuture generations, and it serves as a great drag on the economy right \nnow.\n  In addition, in 1990 and 1993, we put heavy burdens of taxes on the \nproductive sector--taxes on savings and investment, taxes particularly \nthat hit the small businesses that I have the pleasure of serving on \nthe Small Business Committee.\n  Yesterday, you would have thought that taxes and deficits did not \nmatter, that slow growth was the only burden that was the legacy of the \nFederal Reserve Board. Well, that is not true. The Federal Reserve has \nkept inflation under control. We need to deal with the deficit. Then we \nneed to deal with taxes that discourage investment and savings.\n  That is why the third nominee for the Federal Reserve is important. \nDr. Rivlin is currently the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget. She has presented, on behalf of the President, a measure, the \nbudget of the President of the United States, so that when the \nCongressional Budget Office scores it and applies a trigger the \nCongressional Budget Office said is necessary to get to a balance in \n2002, they can claim that under the Congressional Budget Office scoring \nand applying the trigger that the budget will get to balance in 2002.\n  The problem is, as I have outlined on this floor before, I, in the \nrole as chairman of the appropriations subcommittee, have asked the \nagencies that would be forced to make those cuts in future years how \nthey plan to make them, and they have been advised by the Office of \nManagement and Budget that they are not serious about it.\n  Mr. President, as I have pointed out, we have addressed letters to \nDr. Rivlin, questions as to whether the administration is serious about \nbalancing the budget. Do they have a second set of books that has cuts \nin a lot of other agencies? The Veterans' Administration has told us \nthey are exempt; EPA, NASA, the agencies that I have spoken to have \nsaid the cuts are not going to fall on them. Where are they going to \nfall? Are we serious about the deficit?\n  We are waiting to hear whether the Office of Management and Budget \nhonestly believes it can implement and will begin planning for the \nreductions in spending necessary to balance the budget.\n  That, in my view, will depend upon how I vote, at least for one, on \nthe confirmation of the Budget Director to be a Member of the Federal \nReserve Board.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the \nPresiding Officer has some business before the Senate. I am going to \nsuggest the absence of a quorum so I might relieve the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have a couple of comments to make about \nthe comments that were made previously by the Senator from Texas. \nBefore that I have a little bit of business to take care of of a \ndifferent nature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6258-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6258-S6259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT EDUCATION ACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced legislation to \nreauthorize the National Environment Education Act. I am joined by most \nof the members of the Environment and Public Works Committee and will \nprobably have all of those Members as cosponsors of this legislation in \na very short time.\n  The reason I am doing this is that there has been a lot of criticism \nthat we are getting that there is too much emanating from Washington on \nour environmental laws and environmental education. People have said we \nare brainwashing our children. I feel that the better way to do this is \nto have this money going to the local level so that the curriculum can \nbe determined by the local level.\n  I can remember several scary stories about students coming home from \nschool in the Northwest who happened to be sons or daughters of people \nworking in the lumber industry saying that it is sinful to cut down any \ntree, and this type of thing. This is the type of thing that has to be \nstopped. I believe the only way we are going to be able to successfully \ndo this is to reauthorize this legislation so that the safeguards are \nbuilt in that anything that is used in the education of our young \npeople has to be based on scientific facts and not just the normal \nscare type of things that we have been getting. So I believe we will be \nable to control this program.\n  This, incidentally, was introduced at the same time by Congressman \nKlug in the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I introduced legislation to reauthorize the \nNational Environmental Education Act. I am joined by my colleagues \nSenators Chafee, Lieberman, Faircloth, Kempthorne, Moynihan, and Reid. \nAnd I am joined on the House side by my colleague, Congressman Scott \nKlug of Wisconsin, who introduced an identical bill in the House \nyesterday.\n  This bill will reauthorize the educational efforts at the National \nEnvironmental Education and Training Foundation and the EPA's Office of \nEnvironmental Education. These programs support environmental education \nat the local level. They provide grant money and seed money to \nencourage local primary and secondary schools and universities to \neducate children on environmental issues.\n  With the importance of the environment and the continuing debate on \nhow best to protect it, it is vital to educate\n\n[[Page S6259]]\n\nour children so that they truly understand how the environment \nfunctions.\n  Over the last few years environmental education has been criticized \nfor being one-sided and heavy-handed. People have accused environmental \nadvocates of trying to brainwash children and of pushing an \nenvironmental agenda that is not supported by the facts or by science. \nThey also accuse the Federal Government of setting one curriculum \nstandard and forcing all schools to subscribe to their views. This is \nnot how these two environmental education programs have worked, and I \nhave taken specific steps to ensure that they never work this way. In \nfact, this legislation will prevent this from happening.\n  The programs that this act reauthorizes have targeted the majority of \ntheir grants at the local level, allowing the teachers in our community \nschools to design their environmental programs to teach our children, \nand this is where the decisions should be made. In addition, the grants \nhave not been used for advocacy or to lobby the Government, as other \ngrant programs have been accused of doing.\n  This legislation accomplishes two important functions. First, it \ncleans up the current law to make the programs run more efficiently. \nAnd second, it places two very important safeguards in the program to \nensure its integrity in the future.\n  I have placed in this bill language to ensure that the EPA programs \nare balanced and scientifically sound. It is important that \nenvironmental education is presented in an unbiased and balanced \nmanner. The personal values and prejudices of the educators should not \nbe instilled in our children. Instead we must teach them to think for \nthemselves after they have been presented with all of the facts and \ninformation. Environmental ideas must be grounded in sound science and \nnot emotional bias. While these programs have not been guilty of this \nin the past, this is an important safeguard to protect the future of \nenvironmental education.\n  Second, I have included language which prohibits any of the funds to \nbe used for lobbying efforts. While these programs have not used the \ngrant process to lobby the Government, there are other programs which \nhave been accused of this and this language will ensure that this \nprogram never becomes a vehicle for the executive branch to lobby \nCongress.\n  This bill also makes a number of housekeeping changes to the programs \nwhich are supported by both the EPA and the Education Foundation which \nwill both streamline and programs and make them more efficient.\n  The grants that have been awarded under this program have gone to a \nnumber of local groups. In Oklahoma alone such organizations as the \nStillwater 4-H Foundation; Roosevelt Elementary School in Norman, OK; \nOklahoma State University; the Kaw Nation of Oklahoma; and the Osage \nCounty Oklahoma Conservation District have received grants for \nenvironmental education under these programs.\n  This is an important piece of legislation, and I hope both the Senate \nand the House can act quickly to reauthorize these programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6258-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think that the senior Senator from Texas \narticulated the MSA environment that we are in right now with the \nhealth bill in a very accurate way. But I believe that he overlooked \none thing. I agree with him that we have a system that has a built-in \ndisincentive to save or to get services, medical services and health \ncare services, that would be less expensive. I am not any different \nthan anyone else. I suggest that you are probably the same way, Mr. \nPresident. Once you pay your deductible and you are in the course of a \nyear, you are going to go out and get any kind of health services that \nyou need if it does not cost you anything. So you have something built \ninto the system.\n  I cannot think of any other service or product in America where you \nwould have a system built in that encourages you to pay more. I have \nheard some percentages of savings ranging between 40 and 60 percent if \nwe could have MSA's.\n  But the one thing the Senator from Texas did not mention was that it \nalso provides another benefit to those individuals because, if someone \nis between jobs or if someone gets fired from a job, this offers \nportability. It is a fund that can be drawn upon, or, if there is a \ncatastrophic illness, this can be used for that. It is just beyond me. \nI have not been able to think of one logical argument that the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, had against MSA's. I could see \nperhaps some doctors objecting to it because, obviously, people are \ngoing to be more cost conscious and are not going to be getting \nservices they do not need. Ironically, though, I am proud of the \nmedical community. I have yet to have one doctor tell me that he did \nnot want to have MSA's. They are not opposing it even though they are \nthe only group I could think of who possibly would lose some financial \nadvantage by a system going in place.\n  So I am hoping that we will be able to get this. I cannot believe \nthat our entire health program is being held hostage just because of \nthe medical savings account, something that benefits everyone--all \nAmericans, young, old, rich, poor--everyone equally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6259-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6259-S6260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TROOPS IN BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want to repeat something in perhaps a \nlittle bit of a different way that I mentioned yesterday because we \ntalked about a lot of things on this floor that are very significant, \nsuch as our health delivery system and such as the deficit. But our \nNation's defense perhaps is the most significant subject that we could \nhave to talk about.\n  I was so dismayed and shocked yesterday when I read what the \nPresident was saying through Secretary of Defense William Perry that we \nnow are going to leave our troops over in Bosnia for a period longer \nthan the 12 months that they agreed to.\n  I am on the Intelligence Committee and the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. I can tell you that at the time this happened, I could not \nbelieve that we were sending troops into a warring area with an exit \nstrategy that was geared to time, 12 months, as opposed to events. I do \nnot know of any time in history that this has been the case.\n  So during the October 17 Senate Armed Services Committee meeting and \nseveral other meetings, and on the floor, we talked about the fact that \nwe did not believe it was going to be a 12-month operation. I asked \nspecifically Secretary Perry, as well as other people asking him in the \nsame meeting--one was Senator Robb from Virginia and one was Senator \nBingaman from New Mexico--``Are you absolutely committed to bringing \nthe troops home in 12 months?'' The answer was always, ``Yes, we are \ncommitted.'' It was hard for me to believe that could be possible.\n  So I went over to the northeast sector of Bosnia where we were \nplanning at that time to send our troops. When I got there and went up \nto the northeast sector, finding out no other American had been up \nthere, I found out from General Haukland, from Norway, who was in \ncharge of the U.N. troops of that sector, that, in fact, it was \nlaughable.\n\n  I said, ``Are you aware that our troops are coming back in 12 \nmonths?'' He said, ``You mean in 12 years?'' That is when he drew this \nanalogy, when he said putting the troops in there is like putting your \nhand in water, and you leave it there for 12 months and take it out and \nnothing has changed; it is still there.\n  So we are making a longer term commitment than the President of the \nUnited States promised the American people. I can tell you right now, I \nstood right here on December 13 of last year when we had the resolution \nof disapproval that was authored by the junior Senator from Texas and \nmyself, Senator Hutchison and myself. We lacked four votes of passing a \nresolution of disapproval. Mr. President, we would have had those four \nvotes and many more if the American people had known, and if the \nSenators in this Chamber had known, that it was going to be a long-term \nproposition.\n  Right now it does look like it is open-ended. We could talk about the \ncost of it, we could talk about the mission, but the point is, they \ntold us something that they knew was not true on December 13, at the \ntime they passed the program to send American troops over into an area \nwe have no vital security interest in.\n\n[[Page S6260]]\n\n  I am not saying, ``I told you so.'' I am just saying, it was so \nobvious at the time and everyone is on record and the President is on \nrecord and John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nis on record and Secretary Perry is on record, all of them assuring it \nwas going to be 12 months, and now we know it is not going to be 12 \nmonths.\n  As I said yesterday, we have to serve notice on the administration \nthat when they try to extend that time, we in this Chamber will do \neverything we can to support our troops who are over there, but they \nare going to have a fight in keeping our troops over there for an \nundetermined period of time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6259-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, if I could have just a minute or so more, \nI want to mention the budget resolution that was passed yesterday. I \ndid not like it. I did not say anything about it at the time. I have to \nsay publicly, on the record, now, the only reason I did support it is I \nthink that is the only way we could have anything at all for defense.\n  There is a very distinguished House Member from Oklahoma, Congressman \nWatts. I think he feels the same way, that this is the only way we can \ndo it. It is not a lean enough budget. It is not one that is as good as \nI would like. But, nonetheless, we went ahead and passed it.\n  I think that brings up the other point, and that is our discussion \nlast week on the balanced budget amendment. I do not know how people \ncan have such a change of heart. I think there are six Democrat U.S. \nSenators who openly supported the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution in 1994, and they voted for it. This is the resolution \nthat they voted for in 1994, Senate Joint Resolution 41, and they \nturned right around and actively opposed the same exact language in a \nbalanced budget amendment that failed to pass by a couple of votes last \nweek. They tried to say it was different. They said this had the Nunn \namendment that addressed judicial review.\n  I would like to read something into the Record, just to make sure no \none tries to use that to make people think this is not the same \nresolution that they voted for 2 years ago and then voted against this \nlast week. This is right out of the Record, Senator Nunn speaking. He \nsaid:\n\n       Mr. President, as I noted last Thursday, adoption of the \n     balanced budget amendment to me is very important, but I also \n     noted that without a limitation on judicial review, a \n     limitation which was accepted during our 1994 debate, when \n     offered by Senator Danforth of Missouri, we could radically \n     alter the balance of powers among the three branches of \n     government that is fundamental to our democracy.\n\n  So those Senators that we actively debated with, those very honorable \nSenators from West Virginia and North Dakota and Kentucky--these are \nexactly the same thing. I think maybe it was a mistake that was made. A \nbetter way to approach this would be to come up and say, ``We did make \na mistake, I did not know it was the same thing,'' and perhaps we would \nhave a chance, still, of passing a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. Because until we do this, until it is in the Constitution \nso we do not have any choice, we are going to continue to play this \ngame where we are going to put all of our cuts in the outyears and we \nare not going to be able to pass a balanced budget.\n  A balanced budget amendment is the only other way, and I hope those \nsix Senators who voted for and supported a balanced budget amendment in \n1994 would reconsider. With those votes, we would be able to pass one \nand send it to the States for three-fourths of the States to ratify. I \nhave no doubt in my mind they would ratify it in a very short period of \ntime.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I commend the Senator from Oklahoma for bringing up \nthe issue of Bosnia creep. I am not going to talk about it, but I am \nsure we are going to hear a lot about that in the near term. Not only \nis the time in which the troops are there being expanded, but the \nmission is being expanded as well.\n  If you remember, during all the testimony when that decision was \nbeing made, it was a very narrow mission. Now we are talking about \nchasing down war criminals, expanding the mission significantly, as \nwell as the time.\n  I have to tell you that I never felt it possible that you could have \na 12-month commitment, moving a division like that into an area. It \nsounded like you would spend the first 6 months getting there and the \nsecond 6 months leaving. So I am not surprised by this dilemma that we \nfound ourselves in.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6260-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6260-S6261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to go back, if we might, to this \nissue we are confronted with on health care reform. The situation we \nare in is this. There are three motions that must be approved in order \nto get the conferees selected, and they are all debatable and can be \nfilibustered. The Senator from Massachusetts has suggested to us that \nthe filibuster would be put into play.\n  So, in a sense, he is blocking the ability for a conference to come \ntogether and deal with legitimate health care reform.\n  It has not been mentioned here this morning, but it needs to be \nmentioned that the administration has a hand in this, too. The \nadministration, for whatever reason--and the Senator from Oklahoma is \njust as baffled as I--does not like medical savings accounts.\n  We know that medical savings accounts will lead to an increase of \nthose insured among the young. As the Senator from Texas said, young \npeople sometimes feel immortal, and the cost of health insurance is \nvery high, taxes are high, savings are down and people look for things \nthey can do without. Young people feel, ``Well, this is something I can \ndo without.''\n  So by putting a product such as the medical savings account into the \nmarketplace, we know that what will happen is that many of these \nuninsured will take advantage of this opportunity, this unique product.\n  The other point I want to make about MSA's is for a large number of \npeople who use them, they will increase their disposable income, \nbecause those premiums that are not utilized for health purposes are in \nthe checking account of the person, not somewhere up here in the bowels \nof the Treasury or in an insurance company's coffers. It is in the \nfamily's checking account. So they have access and will have access to \nfinancial resources that they can use to pursue their own dreams.\n  Here we have a situation where the President and First Lady came \nforward with a massive takeover of medicine by the Government. It would \nhave created the largest entitlement in world history, which I have \nalways found puzzling, because it was right at the same time all of us, \nincluding the President, was being told that entitlements are out of \ncontrol. We have had a report that Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, \nFederal retirement, and the interest only on our debt will consume 100 \npercent of the U.S. Treasury within a decade. And their response to \nthat was to create a new entitlement, the largest one.\n  America took a look at that--new entitlement, massive Government \nspending, new taxes, more intrusion by the Government, more dominance \nover our lives on very personal matters--and they said, ``No, we don't \nwant that.'' And it went down in flames.\n  Frankly, there is a lot of conjecture about what the 1994 elections \nwere all about. I, frankly, think it was a referendum on that health \ntakeover by the Government. I think that had as much to do with the \nchange in the Congress. Americans said, ``Now, look, we're not for a \ngreater Federal Government. It is already too big.''\n  Then we come to the 104th Congress, and in response to that, \nrecognizing there are issues that need addressing in health care in our \ncountry, we put forward a new proposal.\n  We eliminated job lock to allow workers to move from one job to the\n\n[[Page S6261]]\n\nother without losing their insurance. We have addressed the absolutely \nincredulous situation where an employee who works for a company has \ntheir insurance premiums deducted, but if they happen to work for \nthemselves, they cannot. What kind of nonsense is that? So we corrected \nthat.\n  We created these medical savings accounts so more people would have \naccess to the marketplace of insurance, so that they could save money.\n  We allow tax deductions for long-term health care, and we fight fraud \nand abuse. It is a very, very sound proposal that accomplishes the fact \nof letting more people keep their insurance, more people get their \ninsurance, and we create a friendly workplace for insurance.\n\n  There comes the third point. The principal advocates for Government \nhealth insurance do not want this to become law, they do not want \nmedical savings accounts--the administration and the Senator from \nMassachusetts--something that 80 percent of the American public want, \nso they are going to filibuster it. They are going to block it. I guess \nthey are hoping that maybe fortunes will change and they will have \nanother opportunity to come back and foist that big-Government-health-\nrun program on America again.\n  These elections do have consequences. I think this proposal that is \nhung up by the opposition of Senator Kennedy and the White House is \nexactly what America is asking for. I think America will take note of \nblocking this opportunity.\n  I see, Mr. President, we have been joined by the Senator from \nArizona. I believe he has asked for up to 20 minutes. So I yield 20 \nminutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6260-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6261-S6263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE WASHINGTON TAX TRAP\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, I received a letter from \nJerry Harbin of Phoenix, AZ, one of my constituents. Mr. Harbin works \ntwo jobs, his wife works another job, and they earn a modest income \nbetween them. The Harbins, who are in their mid-fifties contacted me \nbecause they are worried, worried that because so much of their \nearnings are eaten up by taxes, they have been unable to save for \nretirement. They are two, among many people, who I hear from every day \ntelling me how difficult their lives are right now and how fearful they \nare about what the future has in store.\n  Why is it, Mr. President, that so many families, like the Harbins, \nare struggling just to keep their heads above water? Why is it that \nAmericans seem to be working harder and working longer, and yet they \nhave less to show for it? Why is it that more people have to take two \njobs just to make ends meet?\n  The answer, I think, can be summarized in three words: The tax trap. \nThe tax trap. It is really very simple to explain. The harder you work, \nthe more taxes Washington makes you pay; the more taxes you have to \npay, the longer and harder you have to work. Only Washington ends up \nwith more. As Jerry Harbin put it, people are working themselves into \nearly graves just to pay for Government programs that are not working.\n  Think about what the tax trap has done to society, to families, to \nworking parents. As another one of my constituents, Mike Barry, of \nScottsdale put it, and I quote from a letter:\n\n       We have the greatest nation in the world and probably the \n     highest standard of living, and yet because we don't have the \n     willpower and discipline to make the tough decisions to get \n     our ``checkbook'' in order, we are risking our future and the \n     future of our children.\n\n  Mr. President, Americans were once the most optimistic people on \nEarth, but that seems to be changing. In the America my parents knew, \nif you worked hard and you played by the rules, you had enough money \nleft over from your paycheck to put something away for the future and \nstill have enough for the little extras in life, and that is what the \nAmerican dream was all about. It was about making a decent life for \nourselves and securing a prospect for a better life for our children.\n\n  Why is it, then, for the first time in our Nation's history that an \nentire generation seems to be losing confidence in the future? It was \nnot that long ago that the largest investment most people ever thought \nabout making was buying a home. If they worked hard and saved, they \ncould buy a house, live the American dream.\n  But today that dream is out of reach for many families. Many people \nare now sending more to the tax collector than they spend on food, \nclothing, and shelter combined. Let me say that again. They are paying \nmore in taxes than they spend on food, shelter, and clothing. There is \nnothing left over to save for a new home. Some people, like Margaret \nBonghi of Phoenix, are really caught in the middle. They cannot afford \nto buy and they do not qualify for assistance of any kind, and yet they \ncannot afford to rent either. After taxes, there is nothing left over \nfor her to save.\n  Here are the figures, Mr. President. In 1948, Federal taxes took \nabout 3 percent of the average family's income. But today, almost half \nof what people earn goes to the Government in one form or another--\nhalf. The tax trap keeps families from buying their own homes. It hurts \nyoung people, like 18-year-old Jarrod Wilson in Phoenix, who is very \nmuch upset about how much of his earnings are taken by the Government \nand wasted. He is scared about how much of his paycheck he will be able \nto keep in years to come.\n  High taxes are a worry for working women who are trying to balance a \ncareer with family obligations. Children are put in day care because \nboth parents have to work just to have enough left over after taxes to \npay their bills.\n  For decades, now, Washington has assured people that it can solve \nevery problem with new spending or some kind of new program. It raised \ntaxes, promised more, but few problems were really solved. So it raised \ntaxes again, and the Government grew even bigger. We now have a \nbureaucracy that includes 160 different job training programs; 240 \ndifferent education programs; 300 economic development programs; and \n500 urban aid programs. Have all of these programs really made \nAmericans better off?\n  A recent audit of the Labor Department found that about $305,000 was \nspent for each participant placed in a training-related employment \nprogram in Puerto Rico for about 90 days. The beneficiaries of this \nprogram were hired to perform the menial tasks that they had wanted to \nescape from by participating in the training program in the first \nplace. So the program not only failed to train people for better jobs, \nit wasted millions in tax dollars that hard-working families could have \nspent on real needs.\n  Can Washington really afford all of these programs? It can if it \ncontinues to raise people's taxes. President Clinton was not in office \n100 days before he proposed the largest tax increase in the Nation's \nhistory, taking more of people's hard-earned incomes, again, to expand \nthe size and the scope of the Federal Government.\n  By comparison, Republicans spent the first 100 days last year trying \nto cut spending and cut taxes only to have President Clinton veto our \nbalanced budget and tax relief bill in the end.\n  Did you ever wonder why President Clinton and the Democrats in \nCongress have been asking people to sacrifice a little more so \nWashington could spend a little more? Why? Should we not demand that \nGovernment be more careful with people's money?\n  It should not surprise anyone that more and more families find it \ndifficult to make ends meet, that more and more people are forced to \nlive from paycheck to paycheck, and that too many Americans want to put \nsomething away for the future but cannot, that almost everyone feels \nthe squeeze from rising prices and higher taxes. Keep in mind that the \ncost of the Clinton administration's policies to the typical family is \n$2,600 a year in higher taxes and lower earnings.\n  What then is so wrong about asking Government to live within its \nmeans so that people can earn more, keep more and do more for \nthemselves and their families? What is wrong with fixing problems that \nare broken, dismantling programs that are unnecessary and giving the \nbenefit back to working Americans in the form of lower taxes?\n  I know there are some in Washington who say we cannot afford a tax \ncut if\n\n[[Page S6262]]\n\nwe are serious about balancing the budget. They seem to view the \neconomy as a zero-sum game. It is a line of reasoning that says no one \ncan ever do better unless someone else does worse. If you cut one \nperson's taxes, then they say you have to raise someone else's taxes. \nIt is like trying to divide a pie into ever more slices, satisfying no \none in the process.\n  Some of us think that we should try to make every American better \noff; that we want to grow the economy, in effect, to make a bigger pie \nso that all Americans can do better.\n  That is what happened during the years that Ronald Reagan was \nPresident, when income tax rates were cut 25 percent across the board \nfor everybody. Real median family income grew every year but one, \nbetween 1982 and 1989, rising $4,564, or 12.6 percent. That is real \nmedian family income. It rose over $4,500.\n  Inflation virtually disappeared by 1986 which, of course, protected \nall Americans, but particularly senior citizens on fixed incomes. \nBecause the economy was so much healthier, tax revenues to the Treasury \nincreased between $60 billion and $80 billion a year. So actually lower \ntax rates resulted in higher tax revenues to the Government.\n  How can that be? It is the same thing that happens when the manager \nof a local department store schedules a sale and he cuts the price of \nthe products that he sells. He does not do it to lose money, he does it \nto sell more goods. The store takes a smaller profit on each item, but \nthe increased volume of sales more than makes up for the lower prices \nwhen the store counts its receipts at the end of the day.\n  The same thing happens in taxes. President Reagan cut taxes 25 \npercent across the board, something that helped to spawn the longest \npeacetime expansion of our economy in the history of the country. By \nthe end of President Reagan's second term in office, real gross \nnational product had risen by more than 4 percent. Nearly 19 million \nnew jobs were created, over 85 percent of which were full-time jobs in \noccupations with average annual salaries of over $20,000 a year.\n  Interest rates fell, and as a result of the healthy and growing \neconomy, revenues to the Treasury increased, as I said, between $60 and \n$80 billion every year.\n  That kind of growth was not unique to the Reagan years. It was \ntypical of the economy's performance during other tax-cutting periods. \nFor example, President John Kennedy proposed even bigger proportionate \ntax rate reductions than President Reagan's. Income tax rates were \nreduced in the 1960's from a range of 20 to 91 percent to a range of 14 \nto 70 percent. Revenues to the Treasury rose 66 percent by 1969.\n  Under Gov. Pete duPont's administration in Delaware in 1979, the top \nState income tax rate was cut from 19.8 percent to 7.1 percent. By \n1993, State revenues had doubled, employment increased 36 percent, and \nwelfare caseloads fell by 40 percent.\n  The high-tax policies of the 1990's have had just the opposite \neffect. Real median family income has declined $2,108, or 5.2 percent. \nSince the beginning of 1995, the economy has only grown at an annual \nrate of about 1.6 percent. More than a third of the new jobs that have \nbeen created have gone not to people just entering the workplace or \njust getting off welfare, but to people who had to take an extra job \njust to make ends meet. Interest rates, which had declined during most \nof 1995, are now rising again after President Clinton vetoed the \nbalanced budget and the tax relief package that the Congress had sent \nhim.\n  In fact, until Congress forced President Clinton to get serious about \nlimiting Federal spending last year, deficits were forecast at $200 \nbillion a year in the foreseeable future, despite record-high taxes. \nWhat that proves is that a sluggish economy and overspending, not a \nlack of revenue, are the real causes of the Nation's deficit problem.\n  Mr. President, some economists have proposed yet another round of \nincome tax rate cuts to stimulate economic growth and to put more money \nback into people's pockets. Others have suggested that more limited \nrelief, like a $500-per-child tax credit or a tax credit for \neducational expenses, would do more good. As Grover Norquist, who is \nhead of Americans for Tax Reform, recently said, paraphrasing, I think, \nMae West, ``All tax cuts are good tax cuts, and even bad tax cuts are \ngood tax cuts.'' In other words, just about anything we do to leave \nmore money in people's pockets is a good thing.\n  But the benefit of an across-the-board tax cut, I think, is that it \nreaches out to all Americans. It treats everyone alike, and everyone \ntherefore would benefit. It says to the American people that we trust \nthem to spend their money in ways that is best for themselves and their \nfamilies. It would allow people to keep more of every dollar earned \nfrom their extra effort in the workplace no matter what kind of work \nthey do, or from their extra investment, no matter what kind of \ninvestment they may make.\n  The broad nature of such a tax cut applying to all forms of work and \ninvestment ensures that effort and capital are steered to the most \nproductive activities in the economy, instead of other activities that \nthe Government deems the most important, through targeted tax credits \nor deductions.\n  It also seems to me to provide the fairest kind of tax relief. \nEveryone would be treated the same. Tax rates would be cut 15 percent \nacross the board, boosting take-home pay and relieving a major source \nof anxiety among people in middle and low incomes.\n  Notably, a 15-percent tax rate would take revenues as a share of \ngross domestic product back to where they were before President Clinton \ntook office--to 19.2 percent from the current 20.4 percent--effectively \nrepealing the Clinton tax increase.\n  Mr. President, I want to conclude by suggesting that an across-the-\nboard tax cut is probably the best way to stimulate the economy, the \nbest way to boost take-home pay, the best way to create new jobs and, \nin turn, the best way to provide more revenue to the Treasury in order \nto balance the budget.\n  I hope that Bob Dole and President Clinton will bring this debate to \nthe American people during this upcoming campaign so that perhaps a \nconsensus can develop among the American people during the next several \nmonths, so that when the new President takes office, the new Congress \ncomes into office next January, we will feel some mandate to put the \nwill of the people into action, to provide for an across-the-board tax \ncut that can benefit us all, allow us all to keep more of our income to \nspend as we think best for our family, but also, as a result of the \nincrease in economic growth, to provide more revenues to the Treasury, \nto provide for the needs of the people through Government and provide \nfor a balanced budget.\n  That is the benefit of an across-the-board marginal income tax cut. I \nhope that both candidates and those in public policy positions will \nseriously consider this proposal as perhaps the best single thing that \nwe can do for the people that we represent, the people of America.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Arizona for \nhis very fine remarks. I think he is right on target. You know, it is \njust beyond comprehension that an American family today would work from \nJanuary 1 to July 3 for the Government.\n  I said to somebody the other day, and I say to the Senator from \nArizona, that July Fourth has taken on a new meaning. The irony of it \nis that it is the first day that a working citizen, a laborer, can keep \ntheir paycheck. All the rest of them they gave away to the policy wonks \nand the government bureaucrats and policymakers, from their own local \ncommunities to the Federal Government, the Federal Government being the \nbig bully on the block.\n  Imagine, Thomas Jefferson would be stunned that this situation is \nconfronting labor, that over half their wages are consumed by the \ngovernment. That means, in a sense, half their freedom has been----\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator said it just exactly right. Independence Day \ntakes on a new meaning. We are finally independent. We can keep the \nmoney we raise and spend it on our own families instead of funding \ngovernment programs.\n\n[[Page S6263]]\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator from Arizona is absolutely correct. The \nAmerican people know this is out of balance. They know it. You can ask \nany segment, and they will say that they ought to work from January 1 \nto about March 1, about 25 percent. So it is double what the American \npeople are paying, which is, of course, why the administration promised \nto lower it.\n  But the incredulous thing is, they did the exact reverse and gave us \nthe highest tax increase in American history and therefore have created \nthis enormous weight, this enormous economic burden on every working \nfamily, no matter their age or circumstance across our land.\n\n  I do commend the Senator from Arizona and notice we have been joined \nby the distinguished Senator from Tennessee. I yield up to 10 minutes \nto the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join my \ndistinguished colleague from Georgia, and having just heard the \nremarks, which are right on target, from my colleague from Arizona, \naddressing this issue of taxation, where the country is going and what \nwe can do about it.\n  Mr. President, America was once the most optimistic nation on the \nface of this planet, but that is not the case anymore. Today, thanks in \nlarge measure, I believe, to the incredible tax burden that is placed \non the backs of the American people, Americans have lost not only faith \nin Government, but they have lost all hope in the future and that the \nfuture will be better in some way than the past.\n  You know, when my parents were growing up, America was a place where, \nif you worked hard and you played by the rules, you could earn enough \nto support your family and still have a little something left over to \nput away for the future, and maybe even have a little bit to buy those \nlittle extra special things in life. That was what the American dream \nwas all about. But for most American families today, the American dream \nis becoming nothing but a nightmare.\n  When I was a child growing up, the largest single expense that family \nhad was their home. It is no longer the case. That largest single \nexpense is the tax bill. Today, Americans send more each year to the \ntax collector than they spend on food and on clothing and on shelter.\n  In 1950, it took just a fraction of our income to go towards our \ntaxes. Today, almost half of everything they earn, the American family \nearns, goes to the Government in some form or the other--almost half of \neverything they earn. No matter what they do, they cannot get ahead. \nThe harder they work, the more taxes Washington takes out of their \npockets. The more taxes they have to pay, the harder they work. That is \nwhat we mean when we say we are caught in a tax trap. Washington ends \nup with more, but American families end up with less.\n  Mr. President, the American dream was also about generational \nimprovement, about believing that our children would have more \nopportunities, more choices and a better life than their parents. And, \nindeed, in America, they should have. Why is it, then, that for the \nfirst time in our great country's history, an entire generation of \nAmericans have lost hope and lost confidence in the future? Why? How is \nit that we have lost that vision, that belief in unending dreams and in \nlimitless possibility? The answer is simple: Taxes.\n  Mr. President, for decades Washington has told America that \neverything is OK. But, at the same time, Washington has spent our \nchildren's inheritance and undermined their future. For decades, \nGovernment not only spent more than it took in, but spent that money \nunwisely. Just to pay for what? A growing Washington bureaucracy, a \nbureaucracy that has created and encouraged overlapping programs--over \n160 different job training programs, over 240 education programs, over \n300 economic development programs, over 500 urban aid programs.\n  How does Washington pay for all of these overlapping programs? By \nraising taxes through the roof. It should not surprise anyone that more \nand more American families find it harder and harder to make ends meet, \nthat more and more American families are forced to live from one \npaycheck to the next paycheck, that too many Americans want to put \nsomething away for the future, but they simply cannot, that almost \nevery single American feels squeezed by rising prices, higher taxes, \nand stagnant wages.\n  Yet, Mr. President, while in the first 100 days of the new Republican \nCongress we spent our time trying to cut taxes, to give tax relief to \nthat American family, Mr. Clinton spent his first 100 days in office \ntrying to take more of America's hard-earned dollars. Against unanimous \nRepublican opposition, President Clinton imposed the largest tax \nincrease in the history of this country--$265 billion, to be exact. \nYet, he still expects Americans to save more and to give more, in spite \nof this tax increase. No wonder most Americans have lost hope. It is \nthe Clinton crunch. It is stagnant wages and higher and higher taxes. \nThat is what the American taxpayer feels.\n  I repeat, the Clinton crunch is hurting America every day. The \nClinton crunch is hurting the American citizen every day. The price of \nMr. Clinton's tax trap is high. It not only costs the typical American \nfamily $2,600 in higher taxes and lower earnings, but we also pay the \nprice of less savings, less investment and a less certain future. That \nis why, as we travel around our various States from community to \ncommunity, we hear that the American people are afraid. They are afraid \nthat they are not going to be able to afford that interest on their \nchildren's college loan. They are afraid they are not going to be able \nto afford to buy that first home. Why? Because interest rates are too \nhigh. They are afraid they are not going to be able to pay off their \nown accumulating debt. They are afraid that they will have nothing \nsaved by the time they retire.\n  Well, it is time to end the tax trap, and we can end the tax trap. It \nis time we gave the American people some well-deserved tax relief. It \nis time we return their power, that we return their influence, that we \nreturn their own earnings over to them and their futures. And it is \ntime we, once again, encouraged economic growth, encouraged \nopportunity, encouraged wages, encouraged savings, and returned that \nhope and that optimism that is so characteristic of the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, Government and bureaucracies did not make America \ngreat. People made America great, people who worked hard, who saved for \nthe future, who saved and invested for their children, who made the \nworld a better place for that next generation, for their children, for \ntheir grandchildren. That is what made America great.\n  Our goal, the Republican goal, is to end the tax trap. Our goal is to \nhelp Americans not only earn more money but keep more of what they \nearn, so they can do more for themselves, do more for their families, \ndo more for their communities, so they can save more for their children \nand their future, and so they can give more to that collection box on \nSunday.\n  Yes, that is the legacy our parents and grandparents left to us. It \nis the legacy that all Americans inherited from our Founding Fathers. \nLet us not be the first generation who fails to pass that legacy on.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Tennessee. He is on target, as usual.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6261-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6263-S6264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, let me just say that, again, I want to \nclose by talking about the fact that this Congress, the 104th, the \nSenate and House, has done remarkable work in bringing to the country \nsome relief in the insurance marketplace for health insurance.\n  We heard, in the last Congress, about the large number of people who \nare disadvantaged in the insurance marketplace and that they lose their \ninsurance if they change jobs. The costs are too high. A lot of young \npeople do not have insurance, or somebody who has had a medical problem \nhas difficulty getting insurance. We oppose vehemently the idea of a \nnew massive Government takeover to run every aspect of everybody's \ndecisions --families and persons.\n\n[[Page S6264]]\n\n  Well, the principal advocates for a Government takeover of health \ncare are now telling us that it is simply unacceptable that they are \ngoing to use medical savings accounts, which is a new opportunity in \nthe marketplace. The President and the Senator from Massachusetts have \nkeyed in on that and said, no, that cannot be in the marketplace. They \nare so opposed to this concept that they are going to block everything, \nleave the uninsured uninsured, leave the person who cannot move from \none job to another unable to do that, let the person sitting out here \n--I met one of them just last week--who cannot get insurance because of \na preexisting condition. Too bad. Let the self-employed, who cannot \ndeduct their cost for insurance--they cannot deduct it like somebody \nwho works for a company--too bad, we do not like medical savings \naccounts, even though the vast number of Americans do. So we are going \nto block it all, we are going to filibuster this election of conferees \nto bring a reasonable health care solution to the country to the table. \nNo, America, you cannot have it because the new leadership and Senator \nDole on our side wants this new product called medical savings \naccounts. So if it cannot be their way, it will not be any way.\n  If you really want to get to the bottom line, I think that they would \nbe just as fine to let it go, not let this come into place, so we can \ncome back with a new match of Government proposal after the next \nelection.\n  Mr. President, what do folks think about these medical savings \naccounts? Here is a quote: ``Today I would like to appeal to President \nClinton to please support the MSA issue. Nearly 3 years ago, we went to \nan MSA plan, and it has been very helpful to us.''\n  Is this one of those rich people they talk about? No, it is Penny \nBlubaugh, secretary and part-time bus driver for the Danville, OH, \nlocal school district. She is asking the Senator from Massachusetts and \nthe President to let this go through, saying that it has been helpful \nto her. She would like others to take advantage of it.\n  Here is another one: ``An amendment to the health care package has \nbeen offered to add a medical savings account provision. The United \nMine Workers have a similar provision in our current contract that is \nanticipated to produce a significant savings to our previous \ninsurance.'' This is a quote from a letter to Paul Simon of Illinois \nfrom Dan Reitz, political director of United Mine Workers' State \nchapter in Illinois. That does not quite fit the picture of this so-\ncalled rich beneficiary.\n  ``Mr. President, we believe MSA's will be a huge benefit to the \nAmerican public. MSA's are not a partisan issue. Democrats supported \nMSA's in the 102d and 103d Congress, and we support them in this \nCongress because they are a good idea. That increases access, controls \ncosts, and offers options.'' That is in a letter to President Clinton \nfrom Democrat Congressmen Bob Torricelli and Andy Jacobs of New Jersey \nand Indiana.\n  Well, the list goes on and on, Mr. President. They have talked \nabout--the Senator from Massachusetts and the White House--that it only \nbenefits the wealthy and the healthy. But in truth, regarding the \nexperience of 2,000 companies with MSA's, a recent study by the Rand \nCorp. shows that MSA's appeal to those of all income levels and would \nattract those of all health conditions, including the chronically ill. \nIn fact, I was at a press conference and a press interview, and one of \nthe persons there supporting this had fought off what might have been a \nterminal illness. So it is just inappropriate to characterize this as \njust serving the wealthy and the healthy.\n  Mr. President, I see the hour of time which I control has expired. I \nwill just close by saying I hope that the White House will implore the \nSenator from Massachusetts to allow us to proceed with the health care \nreform that helps bring insurance to small businesses, to small \nfarmers, people looking for some relief, people who are looking for a \nfriendlier work environment in order to obtain health insurance. The \nSenator from Massachusetts has it all bottled up. The Senator from \nMassachusetts has it all bottled up, and that means millions of \nAmericans are bottled up. It is time to bring this to an end and let \nthese reforms became part of the American workplace.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wish the Chair a good morning, and my colleague from \nGeorgia. I enjoyed his reflection on health care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6263-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6264-S6267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT TIMBER CONTRACT EXTENSION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am going to speak on another subject \nbut it is equally important to my State, and that the introduction by \nmyself along with Senator Stevens and Congressman Young of a piece of \nlegislation known as the Environmental Improvement Timber Contract \nExtension Act of 1996. I introduced the bill late yesterday, and I did \nnot have an opportunity to speak on it.\n  This particular piece of legislation would provide for timber \ncontract extension. The bill would extend for 15 years the long-term \ntimber sale contract on the Tongass National Forest between the Forest \nService and the Ketchikan Pulp Corp. which is a subsidiary of Louisiana \nPacific. This extension would provide Ketchikan Pulp with a stable \ntimber supply over a sufficient length of time to amortize the cost of \na new environmentally improved pulp mill. Improvements and energy \nefficiency equipment would be installed at a cost of somewhere between \n$150 million and $200 million.\n  It is interesting to reflect that when this mill was first built back \nin the mid-fifties the total cost of the mill was somewhere in the area \nof $55 million. In any event, Ketchikan Pulp Corp.'s situation is \nextremely unique because all of its timber comes from the national \nforest. In my State of Alaska there is no State forest of any \nconsequence in southeastern Alaska, and the only private timber that is \navailable is owned by the Native regional corporations.\n  We also have a unique difference in that we have in the Tongass \npeople who live in the forest in the towns of Ketchikan, Juneau, \nWrangell, Petersburg, Sitka, Haines, Skagway are all in the forest, and \nwere in the forest before the forest was created. And the theory was \nwhen the Nation's largest national forest was created there would be \nsufficient timber set aside for the modest industry that was in \nexistence. We have seen some changes in that policy.\n  So I am introducing this bill as a result of, first, the important \nrole that Ketchikan Pulp plays in the social, economic, and \nenvironmental vitality of southeastern Alaska; two, the strong \nbipartisan support within our State for this action; three, the record \nfrom the two field hearings which I held last month in southeastern \nAlaska in Juneau and Ketchikan which overwhelmingly supports the \nintroduction of this legislation; fourth, the realization that the \nperformance of the Forest Service strongly indicates that without some \ncongressional intervention the Ketchikan Pulp mill will not survive \nwithout an adequate supply of timber.\n  Let me elaborate on each of these factors because they are important.\n  Let me describe the nature of the southeast forest in the Tongass. \nThirty percent of our timber is dead or dying. It is old growth, virgin \ntimber. But as with any living thing there is a process of growing, \nmaturing, and then the death of the trees begin. The theory of \nutilizing these trees which have reached their maturity and are in the \nprocess of dying is the forest process of evolution which is associated \nwith timber development. So what we have is a product that is only \nsuitable for wood fiber, and as a consequence there is a justification \nfor the pulp mill. Without the pulp mill, the lumber mill would be less \nprofitable and the pulp would have to be exported creating virtually no \njobs in my State.\n  So let me share with you what the forest told us about the evolution \nand the importance of the contract with southeastern Alaska as of May \n28 at the oversight hearing in Ketchikan:\n\n       The long-term contracts in Alaska which required the \n     construction and operation of manufacturing facilities such \n     as sawmills and pulp mills facilitated the establishment of a \n     timber industry in Southeast Alaska.\n       Prior to the 1950's, economic conditions in Southeast \n     Alaska were characterized as boom-bust. Federal government \n     employment, mining and salmon processing were\n\n[[Page S6265]]\n\n     the economic mainstays. After World War II, mining was \n     essentially gone, leaving a small local timber industry and \n     commercial fishing in the natural resources sector. Both the \n     timber and commercial fishing industries were subject to \n     market swings from year to year and were seasonal in terms of \n     employment. The United States favored the expansion of the \n     timber industry through several long-term timber sales on the \n     Tongass National Forest to stabilize employment in Southeast \n     Alaska.\n       Making the best use of the timber on the Tongass required \n     having suitable markets for both high and low quality timber \n     and species. The markets were largely export markets in the \n     Pacific Rim and were somewhat limited by the need to use most \n     of the timber for pulp. The Forest Service advocated the use \n     of long-term sales to establish a pulp industry that would \n     bring greater economic diversity to the region and more year-\n     round employment. If successful, more service and trade \n     establishments were expected to follow--creating greater tax \n     bases, which would provide opportunities for improved \n     services, such as schools, water, fire protection, and the \n     like. For all of this to come together, however, the Forest \n     Service had to guarantee a long-term, stable timber supply to \n     attract outside capital investment.\n\n  I found this testimony compelling, Mr. President. The Forest Service \nwitnesses recounted the decisions of their predecessors back at the \ntime right after the war in the late 1940's. Farsighted people \nrecognized the nature and the importance of the resource and planning \nfor an environmentally and economically secure future. The Forest \nService recognized that, as a sole owner of land and timber, it \ncontrolled the economic and environmental vitality of the region.\n  What is the situation today? Why has it changed? Today Ketchikan Pulp \nCorp.'s operations directly or indirectly provide about 25 percent of \nthe total annual employment wages in Ketchikan. Ketchikan Pulp Corp.'s \nmunicipal real estate and sales tax generated about $13.6 million in \nrevenues in 1992.\n  More broadly, the southeastern Alaska timber industry is the dominant \ncontributor to real estate development in Ketchikan. More than 25 \npercent of all the households are timber dependent, and the typical \ntimber employee can purchase more than 90 percent of the existing \nhousing units. Ketchikan Pulp comprises more than 50 percent of the \ntotal borough's industrial assessed valuation.\n  I might add, Mr. President, that this is the only year-round \nmanufacturing plant in our State of Alaska. So its importance cannot be \nunderstated.\n  We have tourism and fishing that are also important to the economy. \nBut we need all of our basic industries--timber, fishing, and tourism--\nin that part of the State to maintain the healthy economy in the \nregion. Quite simply, without some stability of timber supply, the \neconomies of the region generally, and Ketchikan specifically, are in \ntrouble.\n\n  Perhaps that is why the proposal to extend the KPC contract has \nreceived broad, bipartisan support from elected officials throughout \nthe State. Earlier this year, the Alaska Senate voted 18 to 1 to \nsupport a resolution urging the Congress to extend the contract. The \nAlaska House voted 34 to 3 to support the same measure. These are \nextraordinary margins of support.\n  I will submit the resolution for the Record at this time, and ask it \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Senate Joint Resolution No. 40 in the Legislature of the State of \n                                 Alaska\n\n       Whereas, for the last 40 years, the timber industry \n     operating on national forest land in Southeast Alaska has \n     been the largest private employer in Southeast Alaska; and\n       Whereas the United States Forest Service strategy for \n     creating permanent year-round employment through a timber \n     industry in Southeast Alaska has been to offer long-term \n     contracts to attract pulp mills to use, and add value to, \n     low-grade and by-product materials from timber harvesting; \n     these pulp mills serve as a market for pulp logs and chips \n     from the sawmills in Southeast Alaska; and\n       Whereas pulp mills assure full utilization and protect \n     forest health by using that significant portion of the \n     Tongass National Forest that consists of dead, dying, and \n     overmature timber; and\n       Whereas, since passage of the Tongass Timber Reform Act of \n     1990 (TTRA), a pulp mill and a major sawmill have closed, and \n     more than 40 percent of the timber industry has been lost \n     due, in part, to the failure of the United States Forest \n     Service to make available the approximately 420,000,000 board \n     feet per year needed to meet the jobs protection promises \n     made by those who sought passage of the TTRA, all of which \n     has created severe social and economic harm to the timber \n     industry, its workers, and timber-dependent communities in \n     Southeast Alaska; and\n       Whereas another of the reasons for the closure of the Sitka \n     pulp mill was the adverse economic impacts of unilateral \n     changes to its long-term contract made by the TTRA, those \n     unilateral changes also adversely impact the economics of the \n     Ketchikan Pulp Company (KPD) contract; and\n       Whereas KPC, which obtained a long-term contract to help \n     create year-round jobs in Southeast Alaska, is the sole \n     remaining pulp mill in Alaska, a major employer in Southeast \n     Alaska, and the market for pulp logs and chips from all the \n     other sawmills in Southeast Alaska; and\n       Whereas the loss of the KPC pulp mill would lead to the \n     loss of the entire industry now operating on the Tongass \n     National Forest with devastating social and economic effects \n     on families and communities throughout Southeast Alaska; and\n       Whereas KPC pulp mill faces an uncertain future, not of its \n     own making, as a result of the continuing log shortage \n     created by the failure of the United States Forest Service to \n     meet its volume and requirements under KPC's contract and the \n     TTRA, as a result of the adverse economic impacts to its \n     long-term contract caused by the unilateral TTRA changes, and \n     as a result of the requirement that more than $155,000,000 in \n     capital expenditures be made over the next few years to meet \n     new and ever changing federal environmental standards and \n     operating needs; and\n       Whereas, as a matter of economic common sense, KPC cannot \n     make all the necessary expenditures without the federal \n     government extending its contract for a sufficient period to \n     amortize those expenditures, without an adequate supply of \n     timber, and without modifying those portions of the \n     unilateral TTRA contract changes that have adversely impacted \n     the contract's economics; and\n       Whereas the legislature finds that an additional 15 years \n     is a minimum reasonable period to extend the KPC's timber \n     sale contract to allow such amortization and to provide \n     opportunities for value-added alternatives that maximize the \n     number of jobs and assures environmentally sound operations; \n     and\n       Whereas the legislature finds that sufficient timber must \n     be made available to maintain the KPC contract, to provide \n     100,000,000 board feet for the contracts to small business, \n     and to reopen the Wrangell facility and a by-product facility \n     in Stika; be it\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature respectfully \n     urges the Alaska delegation in Congress and the Governor to \n     take all steps necessary, this year, to extend the Ketchikan \n     Pulp Company long-term contract for an additional 15 years \n     and modify those portions of the contract which the TTRA \n     unilaterally impacted, because such an extension and \n     modification are critical to the environmental, social, and \n     economic well-being of the Tongass National Forest timber \n     workers, their families, and timber-dependent communities in \n     Southeast Alaska and because such an extension is in the \n     public interest of the State of Alaska; and be it further.\n       Resolved, That the Tongass National Forest should be \n     managed for a healthy and diversified economy for the benefit \n     of all users, including value-added forest products, \n     commercial and sport fishing, seafood processing, tourism, \n     subsistence, sport hunting, and local businesses that provide \n     goods and services; and be it further.\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature also \n     respectfully urges the Alaska Congressional Delegation, the \n     Governor, and the United States Forest Service to take action \n     this year to assure that sufficient timber be made available \n     as part of any revision of the Tongass Land-Use Management \n     Plan to maintain the Ketchikan Pulp Company contract, to \n     provide 100,000 board feet for small business contracts, and \n     to reopen the Wrangell facility and a by-product facility in \n     Sitka.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Bill Clinton, President of the United States; the Honorable \n     Daniel R. Glickman, Secretary of the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture; the Honorable Bruce Babbitt, Secretary of the \n     U.S. Department of the Interior; the Honorable Newt Gingrich, \n     Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives; the Honorable \n     Strom Thurmond, President Pro Tempore of the U.S. Senate; and \n     to the honorable Ted Stevens and the Honorable Frank \n     Murkowski, U.S. Senators and the Honorable Don Young, U.S. \n     Representative, members of the Alaska delegation in Congress.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Further, the Governor joined in, offering his support \nfor congressional action to extend the contract. In a May 23 letter to \nme, Gov. Tony Knowles informed me that the State of Alaska supports a \nKPC contract extension, contingent on KPC's agreement with the \nfollowing five principles: to protect the environment, Alaska jobs, and \nother forest users; and to utilize the Tongass Land Management Planning \n[TLMP] process and value-added processing techniques. I am pleased to \nsay that these conditions have been agreed to by KPC and are included \nin the compromise legislation I\n\n[[Page S6266]]\n\nhave introduced today. I will include the Governor's letter for the \nRecord.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record as well.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  State of Alaska,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: On behalf of Governor Tony Knowles, \n     I hereby submit, for the hearing record, the attached letter \n     from the Governor to Mr. Mark Suwyn, Chairman of Louisiana-\n     Pacific Corporation, concerning a possible contract extension \n     for the Ketchikan Pulp Company (KPC).\n       As the attached letter indicates, the State of Alaska \n     supports a KPC contract extension, contingent on KPC's \n     agreement with the following five principles: to protect with \n     environment, Alaska jobs, and other forest users; and to \n     utilize the Tongass land Management Planning (TLMP) process \n     and value-added processing techniques. The State's support \n     for a contract extension, however, leaves for the federal \n     public process to resolve the issues of volume, contract \n     duration, and pricing structure.\n       With respect to the TLMP process, which we understand you \n     are also having hearings on, the State continues to provide \n     information and comments to the United States Forest Service \n     in an effort to develop a management plan for the Tongass \n     that is based on sound science, prudent management, and \n     meaningful public participation.\n       In addition to this letter for the record, the State plans \n     to be represented at the hearings by Veronica Slajer, of the \n     Department of Commerce and Economic Development, who will be \n     in attendance to listen to the testimony of the witnesses. As \n     we informed your staff earlier, Ms. Slajer will not be \n     testifying at the hearings, but the State is interested in \n     learning about what others think about these issues so that \n     the State can incorporate these thoughts in the formulation \n     of State policy.\n       Thank you for considering the State's views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John W. Katz,\n                           Director of State/Federal Relations and\n                                  Special Counsel to the Governor.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. After receiving these views from the legislature and \nthe Governor, I scheduled two oversight hearings on May 28 and May 29 \nin Ketchikan and Juneau, respectively. What I heard at these hearings \nwas overwhelming support for the legislature's resolution, the \nGovernor's action, and the extension of the KPC contract. I heard from \ntourism interests, bankers, and fishermen who supported the contract \nextension. While not unanimous, the preponderance of testimony offered \nover the 2 days--and I might add there were demonstrators who marched \nin Ketchikan, as well as in Juneau. Most of them, I am pleased to say, \nwanted to extend the contract--a larger portion, of course, in \nKetchikan. These people recognize that there is no alternative source \nof timber available.\n  Last, I am introducing this legislation today because I have finally \nlost confidence in the ability of the Forest Service to provide a \nstable and sustainable supply of timber for southeast Alaska. Over the \npast few years, the agency has fallen further and further behind in \nkeeping a working timber sale pipeline. This problem has worsened \ndespite the efforts of Senator Stevens to provide the agency with \nadditional funding for timber sale preparation. Consequently, more than \nhalf of the operating mills in southeast Alaska have closed their doors \nduring the last few years during this administration's watch. KPC is \nthe last remaining pulp mill in the State. We only have the one.\n  This situation is absolutely critical. The Tongass is our Nation's \nlargest national forest. Yet the level of economic activity associated \nwith the production of forest products is very small, and sinking. We \nhave only one pulpmill and a few scattered sawmills left. Employment in \nthe industry has fallen 40 percent since 1990. New Yorkers burn more \nwood in their fireplaces and stoves than we harvest in southeast Alaska \neach year. Yet we have the largest of all our national forests.\n  In its May 28 testimony, the Forest Service acknowledged that the \ncontract with Ketchikan Pulp Co. [KPC] has played an important role in \nthe development of Alaska's resources in southeast. Given this \nadmission, one would think that the Forest Service would want to see \nthe mill stay. One would expect the Forest Service to weigh in in favor \nof a contract extension. But not so.\n  In very disappointing testimony, the agency maintained that the terms \nof the existing contract provide that all obligations and requirements \nof the long-term contract must be satisfied on or before June 30, 2004. \nIn response to questions about any future obligations past that date, \nthe agency insisted that it has none--none. This testimony was offered \neven though the preamble to the contract discusses a commitment to a \npermanent economic base.\n  On the question of whether Congress should extend the contract, the \nForest Service testified that a long-term commitment of resources \nthrough a timber contract could further affect the flexibility of \nmanagement on the Tongass--I do not know what that means, but I have an \nidea--and, further, that we are committed to completing the revision of \nthe Tongass land management plan before we begin any discussion of \nfuture long-term commitments to timber related industries in Southeast. \nYet in response to questions, the agency witnesses could not tell me: \nFirst, whether such commitments could be made within the latitude \nprovided by the range of alternatives in the draft TLMP; second, \nwhether additional National Environmental Policy Act analysis would be \nrequired; or third, whether such commitments would actually be \nprecluded by the selected alternative of the final plan. The testimony \nwas extremely unsettling. It convinced me that either the Forest \nService and/or the administration would like to see the KPC mill go \naway.\n  They have apparently no interest in seeing KPC invest $200 million to \npioneer chlorine-free manufacturing technology that could benefit \nenvironmental control efforts nationwide. I think this is also tragic.\n  Mr. President, the simple facts are that without the contract \nextension KPC will be unable to amortize the required capital \ninvestments for environmental improvements, and it will go away. The \ncompany's new CEO also testified on May 28. He was refreshingly, if not \nreassuringly, frank. He said:\n\n       In the very near future, we have to decide whether to \n     continue the large investments required to make KPC viable or \n     whether the losses currently being inflicted by the \n     inappropriate implementation of the contract can be carried \n     any longer. Now, we are going to make that decision \n     relatively soon. This is not an issue for the year 2003. This \n     is a 1996 issue and decision.\n       We will make that decision, first of all, based on just to \n     keep running today we must have the Forest Service meet the \n     intent of the long-term bilateral contract, including the \n     volume and pricing provisions. And, then, secondly, to \n     continue to invest at the rapid rate that we are right now, \n     millions of dollars per quarter, this revised version of the \n     long-term contract must be extended a minimum of 15 years at \n     an offering level of 192 million board feet per year.\n       The people of KPC and the thousands of people who have \n     worked with us have met its--their contractual obligations to \n     develop the economy and provide permanent, year-round \n     employment for Southeast Alaska. We want the government to \n     meet its contractual obligation to provide a sufficient \n     volume of economically viable timber in a timely fashion.\n\n  Some in southeast Alaska suggest that the region does not need the \nKPC pulpmill to have a successful and sustainable timber industry. What \nis needed, in their opinion, is to eliminate the monopoly contract and \ndevelop more small, value-added manufacturing facilities.\n  This is wishful thinking. The independent mill witnesses at our \nhearings indicated that the lack of a stable timber supply will \npreclude any additional investments in southeast Alaska. The \nmanufacture of pulp is a higher value added process than any of the \nalternatives suggested by opponents of the pulpmill. The loss of the \npulpmill will destabilize the industry and the infrastructure of the \nregion, and have a chilling effect on future industry investments. \nAvailable capital will migrate to other regions.\n  Mr. President, I cannot stand idly by and watch the town of Ketchikan \ndie. I will not. I have introduced and ask respectful consideration of, \nthe Environmental Improvement Timber Contract Extension Act. A copy of \nthe bill and a section-by-section analysis was included.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico, under a previous \norder, has a period of 15 minutes under his control.\n\n[[Page S6267]]\n\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6264-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6267-S6268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   USE THE DISASTER RESERVE OF GRAIN\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will try to talk for a few minutes \nhere to alert my colleague and anybody watching about the importance of \na Senate resolution which I submitted, along with Senators Daschle and \nDomenici and Pressler and Leahy. That is Senate Resolution 259. It was \nagreed to by unanimous consent. I call on the Secretary of Agriculture \nto give that resolution very serious consideration.\n  The resolution simply states that it is the sense of the Senate that \nthe Secretary of Agriculture should use the disaster reserve of grain, \nwhich is under his authority, to alleviate the distress of livestock \nproducers. This should be done in the most efficient manner \npracticable, including cash payments from the sale of commodities that \nare in the disaster reserve.\n  The disaster reserve currently has about 44 million bushels of grain. \nThe Secretary of Agriculture has two choices, essentially, as to how to \nproceed in compliance with the resolution. He can transport the grain \nfrom the Midwest, where it is currently stored, to the southwest, where \nthat grain is needed.\n  Of course, this kind of an option would be time consuming; it would \nbe inefficient. The other alternative, and that is what we urge in our \nresolution, is that he could sell the grain on the open market and use \nthe proceeds from the sale as cash payments to livestock producers who \nare in the most distress. This action would provide significant relief \nto ranchers in New Mexico and in many other States.\n  Mr. President, the resolution I have referred to represents one of \nseveral efforts that we have made to provide immediate assistance to \nlivestock producers. Those in the livestock industry cannot wait for \nthe normal period that it takes to pass legislation in this Congress.\n  Many people have had to sell their cattle because they could not \nafford to feed those cattle. To bring a calf to market today, to get it \nup to the weight where you can bring it to market, a rancher is \nrequired to spend about $350 on grain. Under the present circumstances, \nhe could be expected to sell that calf for $200 or less. That, of \ncourse, does not make sense. Many ranchers have had to sell their \nentire herds now, at this point, when the price of cattle is at a near \nall-time low.\n  A rancher from Quay County in my State on the east side of New Mexico \nreported that semis loaded with cattle have had to wait up to 18 hours \nto be unloaded at the slaughterhouse in Hereford, TX. The cattle that \nremain on the range are in poor health.\n  Twenty-two of the thirty-three New Mexico counties have been declared \ndisaster drought areas. Farmers in these counties, in many cases, have \nhad to plow their fields into large clods to keep the wind from blowing \nprecious topsoil away.\n  Without question, the current hardships affect the entire community. \nIn certain areas of New Mexico, banks are having to let ranchers and \nfarmers pay only interest on their loans.\n  This drought has also started an early fire season with very \ndevastating results in my State. As of May 5, fires had burned 162,000 \nacres of Federal land in the two States of Arizona and New Mexico. This \nfigure is twice the area burned in the entire year of 1995. As a \nresult, in our State, fireworks have been banned statewide.\n  Part of my State did receive rain in the last 2 days. However, as \nwelcome as that rain is, it is clearly not enough. We have talked to \nvarious extension offices around New Mexico, and the indications are \nthat the amount of rain received was very sparse and widely \ndistributed. In Chaves County, the extension office indicated that they \nreceived one-tenth of an inch of rain in areas that are usually farmed, \nand even less than that in grazing areas.\n  The normal rainfall from January until the present time is about 2 \ninches. In Eddy County, in the southeast part of our State, they \nreported they had a few drops of rain a few days ago. Roosevelt County, \non the east side of New Mexico, had one-half inch in the town of \nPortales, but less out in the county. Lincoln County indicated that \nthere was some rain in Carrizozo, none out in the rest of the county.\n  Mr. President, let me show a chart which I think makes the case much \nbetter than a description by me could make. This is the Palmer drought \nindex, which is the primary way in which people in the weather \npredicting business and weather analysis business determine the extent \nof the drought that is being experienced.\n  This is a map as of May 25 of this year. It is the most recent map. \nThough the map was made on June 4, it is valid for the period up \nthrough May 25.\n  This shows that the blue, or turquoise areas on the map are those \nwhich are considered moist, by normal standards.\n  The yellow areas--and you can see much of the Northeast is having a \nmoist season so far this year--the yellow areas are normal.\n  The tan areas are moderate.\n  The reddish areas are severe drought.\n  And then the purple areas are listed as extreme drought.\n  You can see the very large area throughout the Southwest that is \nlisted as experiencing extreme drought conditions under this map. Most \nof my State, most of Arizona, much of California, much of Nevada are \nlisted in extreme drought conditions. Mr. President, this is not a \nmodest problem; it is a very serious problem for the State.\n  We have seen some measures taken to deal with this hardship, but they \nare not enough. The President has announced some actions, but I believe \nwe must pursue all avenues available. For this reason, I continue to \nencourage the Senate to take up and to pass a bill that I introduced on \nMay 13, S. 1743, the Temporary Emergency Livestock Feed Assistance Act \nof 1996. We requested the Secretary of Agriculture to give us his \ncomments on that bill, and I have a letter from him, which I ask \nunanimous consent be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me read two or three sentences from \nthat. The Secretary of Agriculture, in this letter dated the 12th of \nJune, says:\n\n       The Department of Agriculture supports the concept and \n     intent of the proposed legislation as a means to provide some \n     form of assistance to livestock producers who cannot receive \n     assistance under either crop insurance or the Noninsured Crop \n     Disaster Assistance Program, as the administration proposed \n     in legislation submitted to Congress last year in formulating \n     the 1996 farm bill.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The extension proposed in S. 1743 could be operated through \n     the current LFP policy and procedure with very limited \n     changes. Therefore, if the legislation were enacted, it could \n     be implemented in a very short timeframe.\n\n  Under the bill, Mr. President, the producers who have suffered at \nleast a 40-percent loss of feed production would be able to apply for \nassistance through their local farm service agency. The livestock \neligible would be cattle, sheep and goats.\n  The old program was funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation. \nThis bill changes that funding mechanism. S. 1743 targets $18 million \nfrom the Cottonseed and Sunflower Seed Oil Export Assistance Program. \nIf market conditions remain the same, we are informed that these funds \nwill go unspent this year unless we use them for the purpose that we \nhave designated in S. 1743.\n  Mr. President, we now have 16 cosponsors for this legislation. It is \na very impressive bipartisan group of cosponsors: Senators Daschle, \nDomenici, Baucus, Gramm, Dorgan, Grassley, Exon, Hatch, Harkin, Inhofe, \nJohnston, Kyl, Feinstein, Pressler, Hutchison, and Kassebaum are all \ncosponsors of the legislation with me. I urge other Senators to join us \nin this legislation.\n  This bipartisan bill will give immediate relief to the livestock \nindustry. I know there are some in this body who hesitate to resurrect \na program that was eliminated in the recently enacted farm bill, but \nlet me point out that S. 1743 addresses many of the reasons that the \nprogram was eliminated and corrects the problems.\n  Several provisions have been placed into the bill to guard against \nsome of the abuses that had been pointed out in the program previously. \nFor example, a rancher must have owned or leased the livestock covered \nin our proposed legislation for at least 180 days. If the\n\n[[Page S6268]]\n\nrancher has not owned or leased the livestock for the required time, \nthere are certain exceptions that the Secretary would have to \napprove. This will ensure that additional livestock are not purchased \nfor the sole purpose of benefiting from this program.\n\n  Also there is language that allows the Secretary to determine the \nquantities of forage sufficient to maintain livestock based on the \nnormal carrying capacity of the land. The language is intended to \ndiscourage anyone from overstocking the land above the carrying \ncapacity and receiving assistance for that effort.\n  Further, S. 1743 would not revive the program indefinitely. This bill \nproposes to allow the program to exist only through 1996. That year, of \ncourse, is essentially half over. The practical effect of S. 1743 is \nthat it would provide short-term assistance for the livestock industry \nuntil adequate rain does come.\n  S. 1743 differs significantly from the livestock feed program in \nregard to how it is funded. We have identified $18 million that will go \nunspent this fiscal year. The old program was funded through the \nCommodity Credit Corporation. We do not upset any of the funding \nmechanisms created in the newly enacted farm bill. Instead we spend \nmoney that otherwise would be returned to the Treasury.\n  As I have stated, Mr. President, the livestock industry in my State \nand in much of the Southwest needs immediate relief. Until the \nlivestock industry receives some immediate assistance, I ask the Senate \nto continue moving ahead with Senate bill 1743. Given the choice of \nwhether this $18 million is to be used for drought emergency or \nreturned to the Treasury, I believe the choice is clear, given the \ncrisis that we face.\n  Mr. President, as I indicated a week or so ago speaking on the floor \non this same subject, we cannot legislate rain. But we can legislate \nsome measure of relief during this time of crisis. We should do so. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in doing so. Mr. President, I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                        Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 1996.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jeff: This is in response to your request for comments \n     regarding S. 1743, a bill ``To provide temporary emergency \n     livestock feed assistance for certain producers, and for \n     other purposes.''\n       S. 1743, basically mirrors the Livestock Feed Program (LFP) \n     that was suspended, for crop years 1996 through 2002, by the \n     Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, \n     signed on April 4, 1996, with two exceptions: (1) eligible \n     livestock, which the proposed legislation limits to cattle, \n     sheep, and goats; and (2) funding. Funds for the expired \n     program originated in the Commodity Credit Corporation, \n     whereas the proposed legislation specifies that the Secretary \n     of Agriculture shall use not more than $18 million that \n     otherwise would have been made available to carry out the \n     cottonseed oil and sunflowerseed oil export assistance \n     programs established under section 301(b) of the Disaster \n     Assistance Act of 1988.\n       The Department of Agriculture (USDA) supports the concept \n     and intent of the proposed legislation as a means to provide \n     some form of assistance to livestock producers who cannot \n     receive assistance under either crop insurance or the \n     Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), as the \n     Administration proposed in legislation submitted to Congress \n     last year in formulating the 1996 Farm Bill. The extension \n     proposed in S. 1743 could be operated through the current LFP \n     policy and procedure with very limited changes. Therefore, if \n     the legislation were enacted, it could be implemented in a \n     very short timeframe.\n       The long-term Palmer Index, as of May 11, 1996, indicates \n     that extreme drought currently is occurring in parts of \n     Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, and Utah. The \n     Palmer Index also shows that severe drought is occurring in \n     parts of Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, \n     Texas, and Utah.\n       USDA would support S. 1743 if it were modified so that \n     benefits under the proposed legislation would be made \n     available only to those producers who are not eligible to \n     receive assistance under NAP or crop insurance. If careful \n     consideration is not given to eligibility criteria, the $18 \n     million funding provided for the legislation will be \n     inadequate. NAP assistance on privately-owned land is \n     available for seeded forage and for native forage. On Federal \n     or State-owned lands, NAP assistance is available only for \n     seeded forage. Vegetation occurring naturally without seeding \n     is considered native forage. Seeded forage is defined as \n     acreage which is mechanically seeded with grasses or other \n     vegetation at regular intervals, at least every 7 years, in \n     accordance with good farming practices.\n       Because LFP benefits may fluctuate frequently during the \n     feeding period, it would be advisable to provide for a 30-day \n     sign-up period in order to make an early determination of \n     potential expenditures and to issue advance payments \n     accordingly.\n       The requirements in section 6, of the proposed bill, Report \n     on Use of Disaster Reserve for Livestock Assistance, are \n     extraneous, and need not be included. the Administration is \n     quickly developing a mechanism for distributing the Disaster \n     Reserve stocks and will announce it very soon.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the presentation of this report from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Dan Glickman,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the House and the Senate Republican \ncompromise on medical savings accounts is a capitulation to House \nRepublicans who are more interested in creating an issue and serving a \nspecial interest constituency than in passing a bill.\n  I listened with interest to speeches this morning that accused the \nDemocrats of blocking health reform by not agreeing to the appointment \nof conferees. This kind of claim cannot pass the truth-in-advertising \ntest. Let us look at the record. Medical savings accounts was defeated \nby the full Senate. The health insurance reform bill passed the Senate \nby 100 to 0 without medical savings accounts--100 to 0 without medical \nsavings accounts.\n  When the majority leader attempted to appoint conferees, he proposed \na stacked conference--a degree of tilting unprecedented in the last \nthree conferences. His only goal was to assure the bill that came out \nof the conference included this bill-killer provision. The Democrats \nwill not consent to this abuse of congressional procedures. And we will \ncontinue to fight to pass a bill the President can sign, a bill that \nwill improve health insurance, not ruin it.\n  We are ready to talk to the Republicans anywhere, any time. We do not \nneed a conference to work out this legislation, if the Republicans are \nwilling to compromise. But we will not agree to a conference that has \nthe sole goal of assuring the death of this bill by including in it an \nunacceptable provision rejected by the Senate.\n  Let us be clear about who is blocking health reform. Health reform \npassed the Senate 100 to 0. It was a clean, bipartisan bill. If it were \npassed by the House today it would be signed by the President tomorrow. \nThe American people are tired of partisan bickering. They want us to \npass the bill that passed the Senate with unanimous support. The \nAmerican people deserve to have insurance reform enacted. The House \nRepublicans should not be trying to kill it by insisting on an extreme \npartisan agenda.\n  Medical savings accounts have become the Trojan horse that could \ndestroy health insurance reform. This untried and dangerous proposal \ndoes not belong in the consensus insurance reform bill. It has already \nbeen rejected by the Senate. A bill containing it cannot be enacted \ninto law and signed by the President.\n  Democrats and the White House have offered a fair compromise which \nwould provide for a controlled and limited test of the MSA concept to \nsee if it should be expanded. But the House Republican leadership has \nsaid that it will be their way or no way. As Majority Leader Armey said \nyesterday, ``I will not give up [on] medical savings accounts,'' and he \ndared the President to veto the bill. The latest Republican proposal \nclearly reflects this partisan strategy.\n\n[[Page S6269]]\n\n  The Republican leadership pretends their proposal is a fair attempt \nto deal with concerns about medical savings accounts. But it is nothing \nof the kind.\n  Under their proposal, medical savings accounts could be sold to all \nsmall businesses and the self-employed immediately. This opens MSA's to \na massive market, consisting of more than 40 million workers, one-third \nof the Nation's entire labor force. This is hardly a controlled, \nlimited test.\n  Even more serious, experts agree that the small business sector of \nthe health insurance market is the most vulnerable to the disruption \nthat medical savings accounts would cause. The joint tax committee \nconcluded that the sales of medical savings accounts would be \nconcentrated in small and medium-sized firms.\n  The proposal would clearly go beyond the bounds of what is \nacceptable, even if it stopped there. But it does not. After 3 years in \nwhich medical savings accounts are sold in this vast market, the \naccounts would be expanded to everyone. Only if both the House and \nSenate voted to stop the expansion would it be prevented. Rather than \nevaluation by an impartial body, the evaluators would be chosen by the \nchairmen of the Finance and the Ways and Means Committees, both strong \nproponents of MSA's. This is not a test. It is a travesty.\n  There are other objectionable aspects of this compromise. It sets a \ndeductible that is $5,000 per individual and $7,500 per family, far \nbeyond the means of working families. Instead of capping the \nobligations to people who finally meet the deductible, it allows the \ninsurance company to subject them to further unlimited costs that the \ninsurer is not obligated to cover.\n  Do we understand that? We are talking about a $5,000 deductible. Then \nafter an individual reaches that $5,000 deductible, additional \ndeductibles or co-payments can be added on.\n  So, Mr. President, we have to ask ourselves, what working family is \ngoing to be able to afford that per year? What senior citizen? What \ngroup of Americans would be able to afford that? Only a very small \nnumber of Americans would be able to afford to pay those costs. And \nthey would be the wealthiest individuals and obviously the healthiest, \nthe ones that do not believe they would have any kind of health care \nneeds over the course of a year.\n  Beyond these problems, there is no guarantee under the Republican \nproposal that the company cannot cancel your policy, or cannot \nestablish a lifetime ceiling on benefits or a yearly limit. We had the \ndebate here on the floor, on the Jeffords' amendment which would have \nprohibited lifetime limits. The debate over this issue was brought to \neveryone's attention earlier this year when one of our leading film \nactors, Christopher Reeve, had that tragic horseback riding accident. \nAnd he had one of the best insurance policies available. And then he \nreached the limit on benefits under his insurance policy. And that \ncompany said, ``No more. We're not going to pay any more.''\n  If this proposal were enacted and tax benefits were provided, there \nis nothing to prohibit insurance companies from establishing a very low \nceiling on benefits. Nothing--no provision, no explanation. None of the \nproponents of MSA's has guaranteed that we will not have any kind of \nlimit or that MSA's will take care of all the catastrophic needs. That \nhas not been mentioned and has not been suggested, has not been \njustified. Not one Republican has stated that, ``Well, if we provide \nthis program, and we give the tax benefits, then insurance companies \nare not going to cancel your policy.'' Of course they are going to be \nable to cancel it. Of course they are going to be able to cancel it.\n  So, Mr. President, these are some of the points that need to be \nexamined before we give additional kinds of tax benefits for the \ndevelopment and marketing of MSA's.\n  It is no accident that the leading proponents of medical savings \naccounts are insurance companies, like the Golden Rule Insurance Co., \nwhich has been one of the worst abusers of the current system. They \ngive millions of dollars to political candidates to try to get this \nbusiness opportunity into law.\n  The Golden Rule's record is, in particular, so shameful that Consumer \nReports rank them near the bottom of all companies because of its \ninadequate coverage and frequent rate increases and readiness to cancel \npolicies. The Golden Rule Insurance Co. is the primary proponent of \nthis whole program of medical savings accounts. This is why Consumer \nReports has been so critical of this company--because of the inadequate \ncoverage, the frequent rate increases, and the cancellation of \npolicies. Golden Rule was effectively run out of the State of Vermont \nbecause of poor performance. It was run right out because of \nmisrepresentations.\n  When the Golden Rule Insurance Co. withdrew from Vermont because it \nwas unwilling to compete on a level playing field created by the \nState's insurance reform, Blue Cross and Blue Shield took over their \npolicies. They found that one in four policies included fine print \nladen with unfair provisions. Sometimes arms, backs, breasts, even skin \nwere written out of coverage.\n  Newborns were excluded unless they were born healthy. It is an \ninteresting fact that about 85 to 90 percent of all the medical \ncomplications to newborns happen in the first 10 days. Look at some of \nthe fly-by-night insurance companies and they will say, ``We provide \ncomprehensive coverage for newborns except for the first 10 days.''\n  How many expectant mothers, prior to the time they become pregnant \nand get up to speed in terms of this wonderful opportunity of giving \nbirth, understand that 80 percent of childhood abnormality comes within \nthat first 10 days? Very few. But the insurance company understands it. \nGolden Rule understood it. Remember, they are the primary sponsors of \nmedical savings accounts.\n  The strongest opponents of the medical savings accounts are \norganizations representing working families, senior citizens, \nconsumers, and the disabled, who have the most to lose if the current \nsystem of comprehensive insurance is destroyed. We know whose voices \nshould be heard when Congress decides this issue--not the voices of the \ngreedy special interests, but the voices of those who depend on \nadequate insurance to get the care they need at a price they can \nafford.\n  It is very interesting who is on which side during the course of this \ndebate. On the one side of medical savings accounts is Golden Rule, the \nprimary contributor to political candidates that support that concept. \nGolden Rule is also one of the worst abusers of the system that we are \ntrying to address in the underlying bill, dealing with pre-existing \nconditions and portability.\n  Who is on the other side? Working families, seniors, consumers, \nmiddle-income families. They have the most to lose with skyrocketing \nincreases in their insurance premiums. As the medical savings accounts \ndraw the healthiest and the wealthiest individuals out of the system, \nthe premiums of working families are going to continue to increase.\n  The great danger of medical savings accounts is that they are likely \nto raise the health insurance premiums through the roof and make \ninsurance unaffordable to large numbers of citizens. They will \ndiscourage preventive care and raise health care costs. They are a \nmultibillion dollar tax giveaway to the wealthy at the expense of \nworking families and the sick, and their costs could balloon the \ndeficit by tens of billions of dollars.\n  The Joint Tax Committee estimated there would be 1 million \nindividuals who would take advantage of medical savings accounts. It \nwould cost the Treasury $3 billion over 10 years for 1 million people. \nThe Republican proposal presented to us, allegedly as a compromise, \nwould make 43 million Americans eligible for it. If it is $3 billion \nfor 1 million people, it does not take a genius to figure out that we \nare risking adding tens of billions of dollars to the deficit with this \nuntested and untried program.\n\n  The most troubling aspect of the medical savings accounts is the risk \nthat they will destroy the insurance pool and price conventional \ninsurance out of sight for millions of Americans.\n  Leading newspapers all over America have editorialized strongly \nagainst medical savings accounts. I will read some excerpts from their \ncomments, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \nfull text of editorials at the conclusion of my remarks.\n\n[[Page S6270]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On May 8, Robert Samuelson of the Washington Post wrote:\n\n       MSAs are mostly an untested concept . . . If MSAs are as \n     good as claimed, let them prevail as a stand-alone measure \n     after a full debate . . . If Republicans let their \n     ideological fantasies obstruct their useful legislation, they \n     risk being attacked ruthlessly. And they will deserve it.\n\n  The point mentioned here, if MSA's are as good as they say they are, \nlet us pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill today, and then we can debate \nMSA's and medical malpractice later. We can do that and have a good \ndebate, and let the chips fall where they may. Why hold this bill \nhostage?\n  On June 6, 1996, a Los Angeles Times editorial states:\n\n       Large, national consumer groups . . . have argued \n     reasonably that the MSA provision being pushed primarily by \n     House Republicans with the backing of the American Medical \n     Association would encourage the wealthy, who could afford to \n     pay high deductibles, to opt out of low-deductible or \n     comprehensive plans, thus raising the costs for everyone \n     else, and could tempt the presumably healthy to avoid \n     wellness checkups that might save them money in the short \n     term but could raise their medical costs down the line . . .\n\n  The New York Times on Thursday, May 30, 1996 says:\n\n       Demonstration projects of an untested idea make sense.\n\n  The Dallas Morning News says:\n\n       Medical savings accounts represent special-interest \n     legislation activities at their worst. What this country \n     needs is major reform that guarantees full health care \n     coverage to everyone, not another junk insurance plan. \n     Medical savings accounts are a bad idea.\n\n  That was the Dallas Morning News.\n  The Baltimore Sun, April 25, writes:\n\n       Senator Dole would be well advised to drop this idea [of \n     medical savings accounts] which is in the House bill, rather \n     than make it a veto-bait amendment that would wreck prospects \n     for any health care reform this year.\n\n  The Washington Post on June 3 writes:\n\n       In fact, the effect [of medical savings accounts] would be \n     to fracture the insurance market; the healthy, for whom the \n     savings account would have greatest appeal, would no longer \n     be in the pool to help pay the bills of the sick, whose costs \n     would rise.\n\n  Mr. President, that is a sampling of editorials from around the \ncountry, North, South, East, West, all raising serious, serious \nproblems with regard to an untested and untried idea.\n  Now, the first rule of medicine is: Do no harm. We could say, why not \ngo ahead and take the bill that passed this body by 100 to 0, and pass \nit again rather than trying to add this poison pill--this idea that is \nrisky, untested, and has the potential to be so costly in terms of the \ndeficit and what it might do to the health insurance system. That is \nour position. It is a reasonable position. The American people are \ncoming to understand that.\n  To those who genuinely believe medical savings accounts offer an \nimprovement in the health care system, I say we should work together to \ndevise a fair test of the concept that will not put millions of \nAmerican families at risk. The American people's hopes for insurance \nreform should not be held hostage to a partisan special interest \nagenda.\n  Over time, we are very hopeful that given the importance of this \nlegislation, we can still pass it in the remaining weeks of this \nCongress. As I have stated many times, this legislation, crafted by \nSenator Kassebaum, represented the common ground that came out of the \ndebate in 1994 over a more comprehensive health program. It passed \nunanimously out of our committee. I think it was probably the only \nmajor piece of legislation that passed unanimously out of our committee \nand unanimously in the U.S. Senate.\n  The time is here for broad, broad support for health insurance reform \nthat will help Americans across this country. Why risk it with an \nuntested and untried idea? Why risk it? Why risk jeopardizing \nsuccessful completion of this health insurance reform that will make \nsuch a difference to the 25 million Americans who have some disability \nand to the tens of millions of Americans who are moving and changing \ntheir jobs? This bill provides portability.\n  Why risk a concept that Democrats and Republicans alike are strongly \ncommitted to? That is what the issue is before the Senate. I am very \nhopeful that common sense and the needs of the American people will be \nput first and we will still be able to pass this very good bill that \nhas been sponsored by our distinguished colleague, the Senator from \nKansas, Senator Kassebaum.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 8, 1996]\n\n              Dubious Crusade for Medical Savings Accounts\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       Just why some Republicans have chosen Medical Savings \n     Accounts (MSAs) for their latest crusade is a mystery known \n     only to them. Some issues assume symbolic meaning well beyond \n     their practical significance--the minimum wage, for example. \n     Its mainly liberal advocates wrongly portray it as an \n     important way of reducing poverty. Medical savings accounts \n     are a similar phenomenon. Their mainly conservative \n     supporters see them as a bold way to control health costs and \n     expand patient choice. All this is dubious.\n       Judgments must be hedged because, unlike the minimum wage--\n     where there's ample experience--MSAs are mostly an untested \n     concept. They would allow people to combine a catastrophic \n     health insurance policy with an annual tax-exempt \n     contribution (made either by employers or by individuals) \n     into an MSA. People would use their MSAs for normal health \n     expenses (checkups, colds, minor injuries) and rely on \n     insurance for crises. This, the theory holds, would inspire \n     cost consciousness. Americans would shop for doctors and \n     hospitals with the lowest prices and best care.\n       On their face, MSAs are not a nutty idea. If we were \n     starting a health insurance system, they might make sense. \n     One basic problem of the present system is that comprehensive \n     insurance made almost everyone indifferent to costs. Patients \n     wanted the best care. Doctors and hospitals benefited \n     financially by maximizing care. Arguably, the health cost \n     spiral might have slowed if insurance had covered only \n     expensive disasters.\n       But we aren't starting from scratch. Government policies \n     have created a different system. Tax subsidies encouraged \n     companies to provide workers comprehensive insurance. The \n     subsidy is the exclusion of the employer's insurance \n     contribution from taxes. Suppose a company buys $4,500 of \n     insurance for each worker; the workers don't pay taxes on \n     that $4,500. In 1995 these subsidies cost the Treasury $59 \n     billion. And of course, there's Medicare and Medicaid for \n     more than 65 million elderly and poor. As a result, most \n     Americans have broad insurance and like it.\n       This is why tax-free MSAs, if offered, might not attract \n     many takers. Congressional Republicans have twice tried to \n     create MSAs; first for Medicare recipients in legislation \n     vetoed by President Clinton; and now for the under-65 \n     population in the House version of the Kassebaum-Kennedy \n     bill, which would protect workers against insurance loss. The \n     Congressional Budget Office projected that 2 percent of \n     Medicare recipients would switch; for the under-65 \n     population, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation put \n     usage at about one percent.\n       If accurate, these estimates mean that MSAs wouldn't do \n     much to cut costs or expand choice. Moreover, the basic \n     theory may be flawed. Buying health care is not like buying \n     groceries. With their money at stake, people may not rush to \n     the doctor at the first sniffle; and competitive pressures \n     might trim prices for some routine services. But 70 percent \n     of health spending stems from 10 percent of seriously sick \n     Americans. These people have heart attacks, AIDS or \n     complicated pregnancies. Catastrophic insurance would \n     cover these costs; MSAs wouldn't matter.\n       The explosion of ``managed care'' has also undermined MSAs' \n     potential. Competition has already come to the health care \n     market in the form of massive groups of buyers and sellers--\n     companies, local governments, health maintenance \n     organizations--haggling over prices, coverage and quality. At \n     least temporarily, this has dramatically slowed health \n     spending. MSAs embody a different philosophy of cost control. \n     Individuals wouldn't have much clout in today's medical \n     market.\n       What's the fuss then? If MSAs wouldn't matter much, why not \n     authorize them and be done with it? The main reason for \n     caution is that all the predictions of modest usage could \n     prove wrong--and if MSAs became hugely popular, they could \n     radically change the health care system. Under today's \n     insurance system, the premiums of younger and healthier \n     workers subsidize the higher health spending of less healthy \n     middle-aged and older workers. MSAs would, in theory, enable \n     millions of younger workers to opt out of this invisible \n     subsidy.\n       They could take the cheaper catastrophic coverage and keep \n     the unused portion of their MSAs as tax-free saving to be \n     withdrawn at age 59\\1/2\\. A mass defection of younger workers \n     could have a devastating effect on the premiums of older \n     workers. A study by the Urban Institute estimates that if 20 \n     percent of workers switched to MSAs, premium costs for those \n     sticking with comprehensive insurance would rise almost 60 \n     percent. Just what would happen then is anyone's guess. \n     Businesses might abandon comprehensive insurance or lower \n     workers' salaries to pay for it.\n\n[[Page S6271]]\n\n       Cross subsidies and managed care (which many MSA advocates \n     dislike) are legitimate subjects of debate. But we should not \n     unleash a health care upheaval simply as an afterthought. If \n     MSAs are as good as claimed, let them prevail as a stand-\n     alone measure after a full debate. Right now, they're simply \n     hitchhiking on other health care legislation. (The same \n     objection also applies to a rider on the Senate-passed \n     Kassebaum-Kennedy bill: the requirement that mental health \n     benefits be included with insurance. No one knows the \n     consequences of this; it could be immensely expensive.)\n       The political puzzle is why so many Republicans are \n     obsessed with MSAs. There's no public clamor for them. \n     Portraying them as a truimph of individualism over government \n     control is a rhetorical delusion. MSAs are simply another \n     government health care subsidy in a system already swamped \n     with them. Like other subsidies, MSAs would channel and \n     constrict people's freedom. The funds in these accounts, for \n     example, could not easily be used to buy ``managed care'' \n     policies.\n       Yet again Republicans seem to be falling into a self-made \n     trap. The White House cited MSAs as one reason for rejecting \n     the congressional plan to curb Medicare spending. And now the \n     president has threatened to veto the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill \n     if it authorizes MSAs, even though the bill's main feature--\n     protecting workers with ``preexisting'' health conditions \n     against losing insurance--have wide support. If Republicans \n     let their ideological fantasies obstruct useful legislation, \n     they risk being attacked ruthlessly. And they will deserve \n     it.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, June 6, 1996]\n\n U.S. Deserves This Health Reform--Congress Should Find a Way To Save \n                            Key Legislation\n\n       That the Kennedy-Kassebaum health Insurance Reform Bill \n     passed 100 to 0 in the U.S. Senate on April 23 was no fluke. \n     Both Republicans and Democrats knew it incorporated the best \n     and most pragmatic elements of the ambitious Clinton health \n     reforms that crashed in 1994, reforms that would limit \n     exclusions still existing in more than half of all Americans' \n     health insurance policies and that would make health coverage \n     portable so workers would not lose their insurance if they \n     changed or left their jobs.\n       The bill enjoys the support of both President Clinton, who \n     applauded it in his State of the Union address in January, \n     and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, who as recently as \n     Tuesday said he would like a reasonable facsimile of it \n     passed before he retires from office next week.\n       Nevertheless, many on Capitol Hill say the bill is doomed \n     because of the failure of House and Senate members to nail \n     down a workable compromise. Progress has been made in recent \n     days on two key provisions, dubbed NEWAs and parity. House \n     members have informally agreed to drop their insistence on \n     exempting small insurance pools called NEWAs (multiple \n     employer welfare arrangements) from state regulation. This is \n     good news for consumers, because otherwise MEWAs would not \n     have to comply with state mandates that require plans to \n     offer such essential procedures as mammography screenings and \n     newborn infant care.\n       The other compromise has been on so-called parity, the \n     Senate bill's requirement that mental illnesses be covered as \n     fully as physical health conditions. The new language instead \n     simply calls for more study. Given the Senate bill's fuzzy \n     definition of what constitutes ``mental illness,'' there is \n     certainly a need to look at studies before drafting further \n     legislation.\n       The real stickler is medical savings accounts, or MSAs. \n     These would allow Americans covered by high-dedcutible \n     ``catastrophic'' insurance (a deductible of $1,500 for \n     individuals, $3,000 for families) to make tax-free \n     contributions to private accounts and either use that money \n     to pay medical expenses or roll it over into IRAs or pension \n     plans.\n       The basis idea behind the MSAs is sound: to encourage \n     ordinary citizens to assume some of the responsibility for \n     the country's spiraling health care costs (expected to reach \n     $1 trillion by the end of this year). But large, national \n     consumer groups like Citizen Action have argued reasonably \n     that the MSA provision, being pushed primarily by House \n     Republicans with the backing of the American Medical Assn., \n     would encourage the wealthy, who could afford to pay high \n     deductible, to opt out of low-deductible or comprehensive \n     plans, thus raising the costs for everyone else, and could \n     tempt the presumably healthy to avoid wellness checkups that \n     might save them money in the short term but could raise their \n     medical costs down the line.\n       The only politician on the Hill powerful enough to persuade \n     the Republicans to accept a compromise on MSAs--such as Sen. \n     Edward Kennedy's notion of testing them in key states--is \n     Dole. The presumptive Republican presidential candidate has \n     much to gain from marshaling his formidable negotiating \n     skills, for he insisted on a workable compromise when it \n     became clear that Clinton's health care bill was doomed. The \n     presdient stands to gain as well, for in his State of the \n     Union address he declared passage of a compromise health bill \n     a top priority. Both have much to lose if they don't get \n     behind this bill in the coming week, but given the bill's \n     indispensable provisions, the sorest loser may be the average \n     American.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 30, 1996]\n\n                      Mr. Dole's Health-Care Task\n\n       Bob Dole says he wants to pass health-care reform before he \n     steps down as majority leader and leaves the Senate next \n     month. The task will not be easy. Bills passed by the House \n     and Senate would perform a valuable service by requiring \n     insurers to offer coverage to workers who lost or quit their \n     jobs, a requirement known as portability, though nothing in \n     these modest bills guarantees that coverage would be \n     affordable for individual workers. But Congress is hung up \n     over three ideology-laden provisions added to one bill or the \n     other. Mr. Dole has yet to resolve the wrangling.\n       The House bill would enshrine a favorite conservative \n     remedy, the so-called medical savings accounts. The bill \n     would provide a tax break for money deposited into these \n     special accounts and the money would be used to pay routine \n     medical bills. The owners of these accounts would cover their \n     large medical bills by buying a high-deductible, or \n     catastrophic, policy.\n       Proponents say the accounts will discourage wasteful care \n     because individuals will be aware of each dollar they spend. \n     But the accounts will probably do little to discourage waste \n     because an overwhelming percentage of medical expenditures \n     are accounted for by the 15 percent or so of the population \n     that rack up huge bills and therefore are well beyond the \n     deductible of their catastrophic policies. Even worse, \n     medical savings accounts will siphon healthy patients out of \n     the market for traditional coverage, leaving a concentrated \n     pool of sick applicants who will be forced to pay sky-high \n     rates for ordinary coverage.\n       Mr. Dole knows he cannot push the savings accounts, which \n     conservatives love as a government-free solution to health \n     reform, past a Presidential veto. Some in his party are \n     willing to settle on a demonstration project. Demonstration \n     projects of an untested idea make sense. But President \n     Clinton ought to be wary. For a demonstration project to \n     provide a valid test, it would need to last at least six \n     years--enough time to watch how healthy people who own the \n     accounts react when they become sick. Will they junk \n     catastrophic coverage? will they save money after sick years \n     balance out healthy years? Will they forgo preventive care, \n     driving them to high-cost specialists? Shorter periods would \n     not suffice because more than 85 percent of the population \n     are healthy at any one time and would not need to dip far \n     into their tax-subsidized deposits.\n       Another obstacle to compromise concerns purchasing pools, a \n     sensible way for small employers to join to negotiate \n     discounts with hospitals and physicians. The Senate would \n     encourage such small-employer pools, but keep them under \n     strict state regulation. The House bill would unwisely create \n     loopholes through which small employers could escape \n     government oversight, even state monitoring of solvency and \n     grievance procedures.\n       The third obstacle is the Senate's well-meaning provision \n     to require insurers to cover mental illness on a par with \n     other conditions. Americans do need adequate coverage of \n     mental illness. But the hastily adopted provision would \n     create major economic problems that will probably doom the \n     measure to defeat. The provision is likely to boost insurance \n     costs by as much as 10 percent and drive employers to drop \n     coverage of 400,000 workers.\n       The Senate is right that health-care policies should \n     include adequate coverage of mental illness. But the proper \n     way to achieve that goal is for Congress to appoint a \n     commission to come up with a cost-effective package of \n     federally defined basic health benefits. Piecemeal mandates, \n     conceived in haste, are likely to produce unintended adverse \n     consequences.\n       The only bill that has a realistic chance of passing \n     Congress and getting past the White House is one that sticks \n     close to the Senate bill but forgoes mental-health parity \n     until another day. This is an obvious compromise for Mr. Dole \n     to seize.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                     [From the Dallas Morning News]\n\n    No Cure-All, Medical Savings Accounts Present a Flawed Solution\n\n                          (By Lisa McGiffert)\n\n       Two time-tested adages come to mind when I hear about \n     medical savings accounts:\n       If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\n       The devil is in the details.\n       Empowering people to make their own health care choices and \n     cutting wasteful spending are worthwhile goals. But medical \n     savings accounts are a misguided attempt at health care \n     reform.\n       Although the concept being proposed to lawmakers stands to \n     enrich the coffers of some major insurance companies, it has \n     the potential to limit access to health care for millions of \n     Americans and to cost taxpayers billions of dollars.\n       Medical savings accounts will provide little help to the \n     vast majority of families that are excluded from insurance \n     because of pre-existing conditions or modest means.\n       Nevertheless, the idea is being sold by insurance lobbyists \n     as a market-based solution for controlling health care costs. \n     It is attracting attention both among Texas lawmakers and in \n     Congress.\n\n[[Page S6272]]\n\n       In Texas, the state Senate Economic Development Committee \n     is studying the potential benefits and liabilities of medical \n     savings accounts. In Washington, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Houston, \n     is authoring legislation on medical savings accounts.\n       In a typical medical savings account, a person purchases an \n     individual catastrophic insurance policy (as opposed to a \n     group policy) with a high deductible of, say, $3,000. To pay \n     for health care expenses below that amount, the individual \n     sets up a tax-free medical savings account. After the \n     deductible is met, the catastrophic policy--which can have \n     struck limitations on coverage--becomes effective.\n       Medical savings accounts also can be offered by employers, \n     who fund the employee's account and pay for the catastrophic \n     coverage. If you are fortunate enough not to incur medical \n     expenses, you can roll over the year-end account balance, tax \n     free, into the new year. Or you can pocket it, pay taxes on \n     the money and use it for other purposes.\n       But medical savings accounts aren't the magic pills \n     envisioned by their promoters. Quite the contrary, they run \n     counter to good health insurance principles.\n       Good health policies should:\n       Be available and affordable. Medical savings accounts \n     target mostly young, healthy subscribers leaving other \n     health insurance plans with a pool of more expensive \n     subscribers. Some individuals and small employers in those \n     other plans could be forced to terminate their coverage \n     due to the resulting cost increases.\n       Even people who choose medical savings accounts run the \n     risk of higher costs. Individuals who gamble on being healthy \n     and guess wrong could face higher health costs after their \n     accounts are depleted and before the catastrophic coverage \n     kicks in or if they need services that are excluded by the \n     plan.\n       Offer full benefits with proper consumer protections. \n     Medical savings accounts will be exempt from all mandated \n     state benefits that guarantee protections to consumers, such \n     as requiring policies to include newborns during their first \n     31 days of life and to cover complications of pregnancy just \n     like any other illness.\n       Most medical savings account legislation hasn't specified \n     what the policies should cover, opening the door to stripped-\n     down, low-value plans. What's more, medical savings accounts \n     will move more people from group policies into individual \n     policies, leaving them with the least consumer-friendly of \n     insurance products.\n       Be easy to administer. Most medical savings accounts allow \n     administrative fees for managing the accounts, making them \n     incrative for insurers and bankers but a poor deal for \n     consumers. Under one proposal, consumers could be charged 10 \n     percent of the amount in their medical savings accounts.\n       Offer a good value for the premium dollar. The sellers of \n     catastrophe insurance plans are betting that medical savings \n     accounts will deliver healthy profits. That is a good bet, \n     considering that only about 12 percent of adults spend more \n     than $5,000 per year on health care. Most medical savings \n     account holders never will have the kind of ``catastrophic \n     illness'' their high deductible insurance plan covers.\n       Medical savings accounts represent special-interest \n     legislation at it worst. They have been subject of \n     extraordinary lobbying efforts in state legislatures and \n     Congress. That an idea as flawed as this has gone so far with \n     lawmakers is a tribute to the power of money and influence. \n     What this country needs is major reform that guarantees full \n     health care coverage to everyone, not another junk insurance \n     plan.\n       Medical savings accounts are a bad idea.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Apr. 25, 1996]\n\n                 Another Chance for Health Care Reform\n\n       Not since Dorothy skipped up the yellow brick road has \n     Kansas presented anyone quite as appealing as its junior \n     senator, Nancy Landon Kassebaum. As she moves toward the \n     close of a distinguished 18-year legislative career, Senator \n     Kassebaum is co-sponsor (along with Democrat Edward M. \n     Kennedy) of a sensible first-step reform of the nation's \n     health care system.\n       Senate passage of the Kassebaum-Kennedy measure by a rare \n     100-0 vote reflects strong popular backing. It would be \n     unforgivable if this measure were encrusted in conference \n     committee with amendments that would lead to its defeat or \n     veto. Mrs. Kassebaum set the right course when she voted \n     against additions she herself favors.\n       Americans should spurn complaints that her bill fails to \n     achieve the grandiose transformation proposed by the \n     administration in 1993. President Clinton now acknowledges he \n     ``set the Congress up for failure'' by seeking to do too much \n     too soon and by ``dissing'' Republican alternatives that \n     would have gone much further than the Kassebaum-Kennedy \n     measure.\n       Of more immediate concern, however, is whether Kansas' \n     senior senator, presidential hopeful Bob Dole, will also \n     overreach by not sticking with the Nancy Kassebaum approach. \n     He's on the conference committee; she is not.\n       The Senate bill is neither incremental nor inconsequential. \n     Some 25 million Americans are caught in ``job lock''--fearful \n     of quitting their jobs because they cannot take their health \n     insurance with them or because they have an existing medical \n     condition that could lead to the denial of a new policy. The \n     pending legislation would guarantee the ``portability'' of \n     such insurance coverage. It would also increase the tax \n     deduction for health insurance costs incurred by some 17 \n     million self-employed.\n       Against Mrs. Kassebaum's advice, the Senate tacked an \n     amendment to her legislation that would require health \n     insurance coverage of mental as well as physical ailments. \n     This is a laudable concept--one that will someday \n     materialize--but it has drawn fierce opposition from a cost-\n     conscious business community.\n       Far more partisan is a Republican proposal to allow tax \n     deductions for so-called medical savings accounts. Senator \n     Dole was humiliated last week when five GOP senators combined \n     with Senate Democrats to defeat his effort to add this to the \n     Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. Senator Dole would be well advised to \n     drop this idea, which is in the House bill, rather than make \n     it a veto-bait amendment that would wreck prospects for any \n     health care reform this year. He should, in short, skip along \n     on Nancy Kassebaum's road to realism.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 3, 1996]\n\n                     Senator Dole's Final Business\n\n       Bob Dole has only a few days left in the Senate. How will \n     he spend them? He said last month that he hoped before \n     stepping down to stage one more vote on a balanced budget \n     amendment to the Constitution, even though it's pretty clear \n     that the proposition would fail--as well it should. He has \n     also said that he would like to see to enactment of the so-\n     called Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance bill, meant to help \n     people keep their coverage when they fall ill or are between \n     jobs.\n       The latter surely is the better use of his remaining time. \n     The balanced budget amendment is show horse legislation--a \n     deceptive, destructive proposal whose likely effect would be \n     less to balance the budget than to weaken the structure of \n     government by entrenching minority over majority role. The \n     health insurance bill would allow Mr. Dole to leave the \n     Senate having, fittingly, as his last act, accomplished \n     something substantive instead. The bill is a modest step \n     only. It mainly would help the already insured, and not so \n     much with the crushing cost of insurance as by preserving \n     their eligibility for it. But that's a useful thing to do. \n     It's exactly the kind of constructive compromise with which \n     Mr. Dole should want to seal his congressional career.\n       To make it into law, however, the bill needs to be kept \n     clean. That means stripping out three provisions, two of \n     which would be downright harmful and one of which would \n     confer a benefit without sufficient examination of its costs.\n       The first is a House-passed proposal to subsidize so-called \n     medical savings accounts. Instead of buying conventional \n     health insurance, people would be allowed to accumulate cash \n     tax-free to pay their routine medical bills. The notion is \n     that the country would be better off if people were buying \n     health care more carefully with what they regarded as their \n     own money; the shift from insurance to savings accounts \n     would, according to this view, help to hold down costs. But \n     in fact the effect would be to fracture the insurance market; \n     the healthy, for whom the savings accounts would have \n     greatest appeal, would no longer be in the pool to help pay \n     the bills of the sick, whose costs would rise. Mr. Dole \n     supports the idea, a favorite of conservatives, but the \n     president has rightly said he would veto a bill that \n     contained it; it should be struck.\n       The second provision, also in the House bill, would allow \n     insurance pools created to help small businesses and others \n     cut their costs escape state regulation. The pools are a good \n     idea, but not the escape from scrutiny. Among much else, they \n     too should be kept from serving only the healthy and further \n     fragmenting the insurance market. Finally, the Senate bill \n     includes a requirement that insurance plans treat mental and \n     physical illnesses essentially the same; they could no longer \n     ``discriminate'' against the mentally ill by imposing tighter \n     limits on the one than on the other, as most do now. Even \n     health care economists who would like to confer the benefit \n     warn that the effect would be to add to both the cost of \n     insurance and the number of uninsured. The proposal is better \n     intentioned than it is thought through.\n       Maybe Mr. Dole can't broker a clean bill like this in the \n     time he has left, and perhaps he doesn't want to. But if he \n     doesn't, it isn't clear who later will. The reputation he has \n     always cherished is that, in the end, he gets things done. \n     Here's a last one well worth doing.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today as the chairman \nof the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs to discuss what \nin my view is the continuing deterioration of the democratic process in \nCambodia.\n  In October 1991, the signing of the Paris peace accords ended years \nof devastating civil war in Cambodia and started that country on the \nroad to instituting a democratic civil society. Cambodia's leaders \nagreed to support a democratic resolution of the country's longstanding \ncivil war, to protect and advance human and political rights and\n\n[[Page S6273]]\n\nfundamental freedoms for its citizens, and to begin the difficult task \nof rebuilding the economy and civil institutions. The U.N. transitional \nauthority in Cambodia [UNTAC], established to implement the accords, \nsupervised the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, \nrepatriated over 350,000 refugees, and oversaw the first free national \nelections in 1993. The constitution adopted in September 1993 \nestablished a multiparty democracy, committed the Government to hold \nnew elections by 1998, required that Cambodia recognize and respect \nhuman rights as defined in the U.N. Charter, the Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights, and other relevant international agreements and \ntreaties.\n  The transformation was not without its costs. The United States and \nother donor countries and the United Nations spent an estimated $2.8 \nbillion implementing the accords and subsequent elections. United \nStates assistance to Cambodia alone since the mid-1980's has totaled \nmore than $1 billion. Beginning in fiscal year 1994, the U.S. Agency \nfor International Development [AID] planned on providing about $111 \nmillion over 3 years. The AID mission in Phnom Penh planned to spend $8 \nmillion to help the Government plan for national elections, and has \nprograms in place to improve the functioning of the National Assembly \nand the legal system.\n  Yet despite all of this work by both the donor countries and the \npeople of Cambodia, I am still concerned that Cambodia's nascent \ndemocracy is showing some signs of being under attack. First, the \ncountry faces some serious obstacles to holding national elections by \n1998. As noted in a February 1996 GAO report on Cambodia, and I quote:\n\n       Cambodia's constitution requires that the government hold \n     national elections by 1998. However, the country currently \n     lacks the electoral framework (laws, regulations, an \n     independent commission) and resources (both human and \n     financial) needed to hold elections. Although U.S. and other \n     foreign officials estimate that creating such a framework \n     will take considerable time and involve many difficult \n     political decisions, little has been accomplished so far. In \n     late 1995, the Cambodian government began drafting an \n     electoral law. Discussion at a late October 1995 seminar, \n     sponsored partly by the U.S. Agency for International \n     Development (usaid), explored the relative advantages of \n     different types of electoral systems. By December 1995, the \n     government still had not completed a draft electoral law and \n     was falling behind a proposed timetable for holding elections \n     in mid-1998.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                 Event                               Timing             \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDraft national election law...........

The U.N. electoral assistance unit could help plan \n     and organize the elections, but this would require a \n     significant financial commitment from the international \n     community. Although some international assistance may be \n     provided, such as election monitors, some U.S. and other \n     foreign officials doubt that the international community will \n     support a costly, large-scale operation to help conduct the \n     elections.\n       The Cambodian government currently appoints local officials \n     but has proposed holding local elections in 1996 or 1997. \n     Some U.S., other foreign government, and Cambodian officials \n     support holding local elections because they would introduce \n     democratic practices at the local level. Other such officials \n     oppose holding local elections because they would divert \n     limited financial and human resources from the task of \n     holding national elections and/or because antidemocratic \n     government officials could use local elections as evidence of \n     democratic progress and then cancel national elections.\n\n  While preparations for the logistical framework to support the \nelections is lagging, there is also concern that even if the elections \nare held in 1998 it is doubtful that they would be free and fair. As \nthe GAO report notes:\n\n       The Interior Ministry is drafting the election law and may \n     be responsible for organizing the elections. Ministry \n     deliberations and work are not open to public oversight and \n     participation, and the Ministry played a role in the violence \n     and intimidation before the 1993 elections.\n       According to some U.S. and other foreign government \n     officials, nongovernmental organizations (NGO), and others, \n     the Cambodian government cannot ensure that parties could \n     campaign without violent intimidation and that voters would \n     feel free from retaliation. The United Nations Transitional \n     Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) was unable to control key \n     government ministries before the 1993 elections, and the \n     Cambodian People's Party (CPP) used some of them to sponsor \n     violence against its political opponents. Some foreign \n     officials and reports point out that CPP still controls the \n     Interior Ministry and its internal security forces, plus the \n     armed forces. Several NGOs report that fear of politically \n     motivated violence is a key issue for members of the National \n     United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and \n     Cooperative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC) and the Buddhist Liberal \n     Democratic Party (BLDP) but not for CPP members.\n       In commenting on a draft of this report, the Department of \n     State noted that Prime Minister Ranariddh has proposed \n     establishing an independent, neutral commission under the \n     King to control the police and armed forces during the \n     elections to prevent them from intervening in the elections. \n     However, we question the effectiveness of such a commission \n     in controlling the police and armed forces when UNTAC, with \n     over 20,000 personnel, was unable to control them before the \n     1993 elections.\n\n  Recently, the friction between the two main political parties--\nFUNCINPEC and the CPP--has come to the forefront. As my colleagues \nknow, in order to bring an end to the civil war these two parties \nentered into a power-sharing agreement whereby members of both parties \noccupy the most important political posts in the Government. Recently, \nthe First Prime Minister Prince Ranariddh--the head of FUNCINPEC--\ncomplained that Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and members of his party \nwere failing to abide by an earlier agreement that power should be \nshared at all levels of government. Ranariddh spoke of withdrawing his \nparty from the Government, in response to which Hun Sen threatened to \nuse military force to deter protests against the Government and any \ndissolution of the National Assembly. It seems clear that the term \n``political strength'' in Cambodia will continue to refer to the number \nof guns a particular party has.\n  Besides the obvious disruptive effects this interparty friction is \nhaving within Cambodia, it is also complicating its external affairs. \nTo illustrate, Cambodia's drive to join ASEAN is being held up because \nthe other member nations consider a key criterion for being admitted to \nthe regional grouping to be political stability--something of which the \nother countries presently consider Cambodia to be short.\n  The GAO report continues by noting that voters lack widely available \nresources of accurate information about the elections, particularly \nradio; and that political parties other than the CPP are weak and lack \na unified leadership:\n       UNTAC officials knew that providing Cambodian voters with \n     accurate information was essential for free and fair \n     elections. Consequently, guaranteeing fair access to the \n     media--especially radio, because most Cambodians are \n     illiterate and television stations have limited broadcast \n     areas--for all political parties was an essential element of \n     UNTAC's pre-election strategy. Several studies conclude that \n     the 1993 elections probably could not have taken place or \n     succeeded without the flow of information provided largely by \n     ``Radio UNTAC.'' Unfortunately, Cambodia currently lacks \n     widely-available media sources of accurate information. \n     Although more than 30 newspapers operate in Cambodia, they \n     have limited nationwide distribution and the quality of their \n     news reporting is unreliable. Also, the government tightly \n     controls broadcast media licenses, limiting opposition \n     parties' access to radio and television. For example, a BLDP \n     official told us that the government had turned down the \n     party's application for a radio station license. Moreover, as \n     discussed later, the government has grown increasingly \n     intolerant of dissenting opinions. USAID's strategy for \n     promoting democracy in Cambodia recognizes the media's \n     weaknesses; one of its objectives is to increase media access \n     and professionalism. In commenting on a draft of this report, \n     the Department of Defense said that, despite restricted \n     access to the media, outspoken government critics still may \n     be able to generate popular support and influence the \n     elections.\n       With the possible exception of CPP, Cambodian political \n     parties lack the leadership, organization, and financial \n     resources to conduct effective national campaigns, according \n     to U.S. and other foreign officials and reports and other \n     documents we reviewed. Over a decade of single-party rule has \n     given CPP the opportunity to build a solid party structure \n     (largely indistinguishable from the government bureaucracy) \n     at the provincial, district, communal, and village levels. \n     Meanwhile, U.S. officials and NGOs indicate that FUNCINPEC \n     and BLDP have weak party structures at these levels and are \n     further weakened by political infighting. Given their weak \n     party structure and disunity, several\n\n[[Page S6274]]\n\n     NGOs and others conclude that the parties will be unable to \n     compete effectively in future elections.\n       USAID plans to provide training to strengthen the \n     capabilities of all political parties to participate in the \n     election. However, several observers suggested that CPP, with \n     its generally better organization and structure, might \n     benefit disproportionately from such training. Several U.S., \n     other foreign government, and NGO officials questioned the \n     wisdom of providing training to strengthen any of the \n     existing parties because they are undemocratic and \n     authoritarian. USAID officials said that they plan to fund \n     training for grassroots civic organizations instead of \n     established political parties. The National Democratic \n     Institute suspended political party training in Cambodia in \n     1995 but plans to work with other NGOs to train election \n     monitors and educate voters.\n\n  The major political parties are already beginning to gear up for the \nrace. A recent report in the Cambodia Times noted that Second Prime \nMinister Hun Sen has made several tours of the countryside ``presenting \ngifts of rice, foodstuffs and krama [Cambodian scarves presented as \nwelcoming gifts] * * * the Cambodian People's Party [which Hun Sen \nheads] has also carried out many projects to build schools and \nirrigation canals and [has] dug numerous wells in the provinces.'' The \nFUNCINPEC Party led by Prince Ranariddh, in response to the surge in \nthe CPP's popularity, has begun to make similar moves. At the end of \nlast month, both parties complained that programs broadcast on \nTelevision Kampuchea slighted them in favor of their opponent. What \nworries me, Mr. President, is that without a strong framework in place, \nelectioneering in Cambodia may devolve back into the situation which \nexisted before 1991 where political strength depended on the number of \nguns a party had rather than the number of seats in the Assembly.\n  In addition, the report paints a pessimistic view of the development \nof the adherence to human rights:\n\n       Cambodia has ratified and agreed to abide by all major \n     international agreements guaranteeing human and political \n     rights, for example, the International Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights. Yet the current government has made limited \n     progress since late 1993 in meeting the basic international \n     human rights standards contained in these agreements. Indeed, \n     some U.S., other foreign governments, and Cambodian officials \n     and NGOs conclude that Cambodia's human rights situation \n     worsened during 1995.\n       According to human rights NGOs, the United Nations Center \n     for Human Rights (UNCHR) office in Phnom Penh, and USAID \n     documents, Cambodian military and police forces continued to \n     violate human rights frequently during the past 2 years. \n     These sources reported numerous cases of extortion, beatings, \n     robberies, and other violations by soldiers and police. USAID \n     and Cambodian officials and others noted that this problem \n     touches on the larger issue of desperately needed reforms of \n     the Cambodian bureaucracy, including the provision of \n     adequate pay for police, military, and other government \n     officials to reduce or eliminate low-level corruption, which \n     currently is endemic.\n       According to human rights NGOs, UNCHR, some U.S. and \n     Cambodian officials, and USAID documents (1) few Cambodians \n     had received due process or fair trials in the past 2 years; \n     (2) prosecutors and judges lacked basic training and skills \n     for properly investigating, preparing, presenting, and \n     deciding cases; and (3) trained public defenders remained \n     scarce. They also said that official corruption was \n     widespread and growing, undermining the rule of law, and that \n     the government had resisted some legislators' attempts to \n     introduce anti-corruption legislation in the National \n     Assembly.\n       Human rights NGOs and UNCHR told us that Cambodia's prisons \n     remain overcrowded and still fall short of meeting basic \n     international and humanitarian standards for the treatment of \n     prisoners. In late 1994, NGOs reported that they found a \n     secret government prison where prisoners were tortured and \n     denied basic human needs. According to the Department of \n     State, this prison was closed in 1994.\n\n  Finally, in the area of political rights, recent Government actions \nindicate increasing official intolerance for dissent from both inside \nand outside the Government. This intolerance has a predictable chilling \neffect on efforts to improve the Government's effectiveness and reduce \ncorruption. For example, as I noted on the floor on June 22, one \noutspoken member of the National Assembly--Sam Rangsi, a frequent \ncritic of the Central Government--was expelled after attacking \nGovernment corruption and several others have been threatened with \nexpulsion if they speak out.\n  Prince Norodom Sirivut, a member of the royal family and political \nopponent of Hun Sen, was charged and convicted in absentia in February \nof plotting to kill the latter. The trial was seen by legal and human \nrights observers as evidence that Cambodia's judiciary is controlled by \npolitics.\n  On May 2 of this year, the Government ordered all political parties \nexcept the four represented in the National Assembly. While aimed \nprimarily at Sam Rangsi's Khmer Nation Party, a party formed after Sam \nwas expelled from the FUNCINPEC because he disagreed with the party \nleadership, the order affects 16 parties that were legally registered \nfor the 1993 election but won no seats in the Assembly. Recent attempts \nby the KNP to open offices in outlying districts were met with armed \npolice forces which closed the offices down.\n  As I noted on September 5, the Government closed some newspapers and \nprosecuted several members of the press, enacted restrictions on press \nfreedoms, and tightly controlled broadcast licenses. Several members of \nthe press critical of the Government have been beaten or killed. Non \nChan, editor of the Samleng Yuveakchon Khmer, was gunned down in broad \ndaylight in Phnom Penh. Ek Mongkol was also shot and wounded in broad \ndaylight. At the end of May, unidentified assailants assassinated \nopposition newspaper editor Thun Bunli. Thun was editor of the \nnewspaper Oddamkeakte Khmer, a frequent critic of the CPP. Thun's \nfuneral procession, consisting of members of Sam Rangsi's KNP, was \nbroken up by hundreds of police armed with shock batons and assault \nrifles. The Government attempted to muzzle the press further by \ncriticizing an existing journalists' association and pressuring members \nto join a competing association formed and controlled by the \nGovernment.\n  In addition, the co-Prime Ministers attempted to close the UNHCR \noffice in Phnom Penh in response to its criticism of human rights \nabuses, but later backed down under international pressure. In May, the \nInterior Ministry also ordered provincial authorities to produce \nreports on the past and current activities of local and international \naid agencies, religious organizations, and associations.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate that we cannot expect the development of \na perfect democratic system in Cambodia overnight. I also do not want \nthe Cambodian Government to feel that I am somehow denigrating the \nstrides it has made. But the problems cropping up in Cambodia are not \nrelated to the more esoteric nuances of democracy, they are the basic \nbuilding blocks: a free press, an independent judiciary, and the like. \nStatements by some members of the Government--most notably Hun Sen--\nthat we have no business butting in or being concerned about their lack \nof progress overlook one important point: as one of the major financial \ndonors responsible for the continuing operation of the country, we do \nindeed have a role to play. I agree with the State Department; if \nCambodia continues its downward spiral, the United States and other \ndonor nations should reconsider the amount and extent of our financial \naid.\n  Mr. President, I also continue to be concerned about an issue that \nbrought me to the floor on July 21 last year: the trading in Cambodian \ntimber across the Thai-Cambodia border. Cambodia shares a lengthy and \nrelatively uninhabited border with Thailand. The entire region consists \nprimarily of heavily forested jungle; formerly, 76 percent of \nCambodia's 176,520 square kilometers of land area was covered by \nforest. That amount, however, has declined dramatically over the last \n15 years due to increased commercial harvesting of timber. The loss has \nbeen especially pronounced in western Cambodia, where a handful of \nforeign firms are responsible for a majority of the deforestation.\n\n  As I noted last year:\n\n       These companies purchase concessions from the Cambodian \n     government, and theoretically make payments to the government \n     based on the amount of cubic meters of timber felled. The \n     timber is then exported over the Thai border, either by boat \n     or overland on dirt roads built expressly for that purpose by \n     the companies, where they are collected at places called rest \n     areas before being sent further on into Thailand. According \n     to both Thai and Cambodian regulations, the logger/exporter \n     must secure a certificate of origin from the Cambodian \n     government, a permit from the Thai embassy in Cambodia, and \n     permission from the Thai Interior Ministry to import the logs \n     into Thailand.\n\n[[Page S6275]]\n\n       There is one more party, however, that plays a major role \n     in the logging: the Khmer Rouge. Led by the infamous Pol Pot, \n     the KR controlled the government of Cambodia from 1975 to \n     1979. During that time, it was directly responsible for the \n     genocide of more than one million Cambodians in the ``Killing \n     Fields.'' Since the 1991 UN peace agreement established a \n     democratic government in Cambodia, the KR has been relegated \n     to the role of a rebel guerilla force. Although the \n     government has made some inroads in combatting the KR, \n     including implementing a somewhat successful amnesty program, \n     the KR remains a strong force in the western khet of \n     Battambang, Pursat, Banteay Meanchey and Siem Reap. Despite \n     the campaign being mounted against them, though, they still \n     receive a steady flow of food, military supplies, and \n     currency sufficient to pay their 10,000 to 20,000 man \n     militia; and therein lies the connection to the timber trade \n     and the Thai military.\n       Over the past several years, the press has consistently \n     reported that the Thai military has been providing assistance \n     and support to the Khmer Rouge. The links between the two are \n     longstanding. Beginning in 1979, Thailand acted as a funnel \n     for Chinese-supplied arms being transshipped to the KR--\n     apparently in return for an end to Chinese support for rebel \n     Thai communists in northern Thailand. Since then, the \n     evidence suggests that the Thai have regularly supplied the \n     KR with logistical support and materiel. In return for this \n     support, Thai business interests and certain government \n     sectors have benefitted from access to timber and gem \n     resources within that part of Cambodia along the Thai border \n     controlled by the KR. Their interest is sizeable; in 1993, \n     the U.S. Embassy in Thailand estimated that Thai logging \n     companies had some $40 million invested in timber \n     concessions in KR-held areas.\n       It is from the sale of these resources that the KR acquires \n     funds sufficient to continue its reign of terror in Cambodia. \n     The process is actually quite simple. Foreign companies \n     interested in harvesting timber in western Cambodia purchase \n     official lumber concessions from the government in Phnom \n     Penh. Having dealt with the de jure government, however, the \n     companies must then deal with the de facto government in \n     western Cambodia: the KR. The companies pay the KR for the \n     right of safe passage into KR-held territory, to fell the \n     timber, and to transport it out to Thailand safely. The \n     present going rate of payment to the KR per cubic meter is \n     between 875 and 1000 baht, or between $35 and $40. It is \n     estimated that the weekly income [in 1995] to the KR from \n     timber carried across just two of the many border points \n     [was] around $270,000, with total monthly income to the KR \n     estimated at between $10 and $20 million.\n       Once felled and placed on the back of trucks, the logs are \n     driven across the Thai border. That crossing, however, is not \n     without its costs. The Thai military--the Marines, actually--\n     controls a 4-mile wide strip along the Thai side of the \n     border, and in order to negotiate it the logging trucks must \n     pass through guarded checkpoints where, it appears, payments \n     in the form of ``tolls'' or bribes are made to Thai concerns.\n       The Thai have consistently, albeit often disingenuously, \n     denied any ties to the KR or to the timber trade. Each round \n     of denials, however, is soon followed by press reports and \n     concrete evidence to the contrary. For example, in 1994 \n     Thailand officially ``closed'' its border with Cambodia \n     partly as a result of the murder of more than twenty Thai \n     timber workers by the KR and partly as a result of \n     international criticism. In a press statement made shortly \n     thereafter, Maj. Gen. Niphon Parayanit, the Thai commander in \n     the region, stated flatly that the border was closed, that \n     the military had severed all links with the KR, and that \n     ``there [was] no large-scale cross-border trade going on.'' \n     The official denials . . . continued . . . including one . . \n     . by Prime Minister Chuan noted in the May 26 [1995] edition \n     of the Bangkok Post.\n       Despite these denials though, and despite a Cambodian ban \n     on logging, credible eyewitness reports from members of the \n     London-based group Global Witness fully confirm[ed], in my \n     opinion, that the trucks are still rolling across the Thai \n     border. If--as the Thai military alleges--it is not involved \n     in the timber trade either directly or by turning a blind eye \n     to the shipments, I can think of no other explanation than \n     that the military personnel in the border zone are completely \n     incompetent. One of the more heavily travelled timber roads \n     in the border zone, one that according to my information is \n     in daily use even as I speak, is within sight of one of the \n     Thai Marine camps. Nor can the central Thai government claim \n     ignorance; Global Witness [in 1995] brought to light a timber \n     import permit signed by the Thai Interior Minister.\n\n  Mr. President, I stated that continuing Thai support for the KR--in \nthis or any manner--concerned me greatly for several reasons. First and \nforemost, the financial support the trade afforded to the KR continued \nto allow it to survive thereby seriously endangering the growth and \ncontinued vitality of the nascent Cambodian democracy. That system, as \nI have noted today, is having enough trouble getting off the ground and \nrunning smoothly without having to deal with the KR insurgency. Second, \nThailand's actions ran counter to its obligations under the 1991 peace \naccord and served to undermine it. Finally, the clandestine nature of \nthe timber extraction has removed it from the control of the Cambodian \nCentral Government. It was subsequently free to continue without regard \nto any regulations aimed at limiting the amount of timber taken, \npreventing serious ecological damage, ensuring sustained growth, or \nprotecting the lives and livelihoods of the local populace.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, since my statement last year the \nsituation has only gotten worse. Workers from Global Witness returned \nto Thailand in November and December 1995, and once again since then, \nhave furnished my staff with completely credible evidence that the \ntrade continues unabated. They have furnished me with photographs, \ndocumentary evidence, and the precise locations of several timber \nstaging areas on the Thai side of the border. They have even acquired \none of the passes issued by the KR to drivers of the logging trucks \nthat drive in from Thailand. The Phnom Penh Post, as recently as April, \nhas run a series of articles detailing the illicit timber trade. \nInstead of taking the time of the Senate by reciting the evidence in \ndetail, I would direct my colleagues to two Global Witness reports: \n``Corruption, War and Forest Policy: The Unsustainable Exploitation of \nCambodia's Forests'' issued in February 1996; and ``RGC Forest Policy \nand Practice: The Case for Positive Conditionality'' issued in May of \nthis year.\n  Mr. President, if a significant effort not made as promised by the \nThai Government to fully investigate and then stem the cross-border \ntrade and their dealings with the KR, then I would find myself placed \nin the position of calling on our Government to abide by that provision \nof Public Law No. 103-306 requiring that the President shall terminate \nassistance to any country or organization that he determines is \nassisting the KR either directly or indirectly through commercial \ninteraction. I intend to send the Secretary of State a copy of my \nstatement today, and ask him to respond in writing as to the \nadministration's position on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6272-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6275-S6276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NEW LEADERSHIP IS NEEDED AT THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, this fall, the United Nations will \nselect its chief executive, the Secretary General. Under U.N. rules, \nthe U.N. Security Council recommends a candidate who is subject to the \napproval of the entire General Assembly. As a member of the Security \nCouncil, the United States obviously has an important role in this \nprocess.\n  It is my understanding that the current Secretary General, Mr. \nBoutros Boutros-Ghali has indicated that he may seek reelection to \nanother 5-year term. With all due respect to the Secretary General, I \ndo not believe it is in our Nation's interest, nor the overall \ninterests of the United Nations, that Mr. Boutros-Ghali be given a \nsecond term. Indeed, the United States should make clear early on that \nit will not support Mr. Boutros-Ghali this fall. For the sake of the \nfuture credibility of the United Nations, it is in our Nation's best \ninterests for the United States to actively support a candidate for \nSecretary General who is committed to a major management overhaul of \nthe United Nations. Mr. Boutros-Ghali is not.\n  I often speak of the need for U.N. reform, but I must confess most of \nmy criticism has been of the Boutros-Ghali administration. Most would \nagree that U.S.-U.N. relations are at an all-time low. The American \npeople's confidence in the United Nations has declined.\n  This is unfortunate. I support the United Nations. I served twice as \na Senate delegate to the United Nations. I want to see the United \nNations work. The fact is, it doesn't work. The problems with the \nUnited Nations are many, but the first and primary solution is sound \nmanagement reform at the United Nations. I'm speaking of clear, \nconcise, honest budgeting; systems to root out waste, fraud, and abuse; \nadequate protections for whistleblowers; and more streamlined, \nefficient operations.\n  Instituting these reforms will require a major change in U.N. \nphilosophy. Since its founding, the United Nations has been run largely \nby career diplomats. Tough fiscal management is\n\n[[Page S6276]]\n\nnot their style. Diplomats train for the grand world of treaties and \nreceiving lines, not the grubby world of balance sheets and bottom \nlines.\n  Mr. Boutros-Ghali reflects that basic philosophy. He has demonstrated \nantipathy at best, hostility at worst, toward reform proposals. One \nneed only ask our former Attorney General, Richard Thornburgh, who \nserved as the United Nations Undersecretary General for Administration \nand Management in 1992. Mr. Thornburgh took his mission seriously. He \nsought to institute major management reforms at the United Nations. He \nencountered no support from the Secretary General. When Mr. Thornburgh \nsubmitted a scathing report on U.N. mismanagement, the Secretary \nGeneral refused to publish it and sought to have all known copies of it \nshredded.\n  Mr. Boutros-Ghali certainly has tried to take credit for a number of \nreform initiatives. For the first time, the U.N. has a so-called \ninspector general--the Office of Internal Oversight Services [OIOS]--\nwhich was established in 1994. He also may claim to have reduced \nunnecessary staff and produced the first no-growth budget in U.N. \nhistory. These are victories of mind, not of substance.\n  Let's give credit where credit is due. The mere existence of the OIOS \noffice and the attempts to achieve budget and management reforms were \ndue largely to a combination of the following: increased media scrutiny \nof U.N. waste and abuse, strong congressional pressure, and tough \nreform advocates within the U.S. mission and certain other member \nnations.\n  A close examination of the so-called reforms instituted at the United \nNations show that the Secretary General is engaging more in a public \nrelations embrace of reform, while keeping real reform at arm's length.\n  First, I urge my colleagues to look closely at the OIOS office--the \nso-called U.N. inspector general. It has no authority to rid waste, \nfraud, and abuse, which inspectors-general in Federal departments and \nagencies have. The fact is the OIOS office is weak in terms of \nauthority, and lacks the resources and the support needed from the \nSecretariat to do its job effectively. It cannot investigate all areas \nof U.N. operations. Member states do not have full access to IG reports \nand investigations. The IG can make recommendations for reform, but \nit's up to the U.N. Secretary General to act on the recommendations.\n\n  Second, the Secretary General has stated that he has reduced the \nnumber of Under Secretaries General and Assistant Secretaries General. \nHowever, he has increased the numbers of and the budget for equivalent-\nlevel special envoys. Chances are he's playing musical chairs with his \nsenior staff. He's changing the titles on the chairs, when he should be \nremoving the chairs and the people sitting in them.\n  Third, the Secretary-General's claim to have cut U.N. staff by 10 \npercent, or nearly 1,000 positions, also is smoke and mirrors. About \n750 of these slots currently are vacant and will go unfilled on a \nmonth-to-month basis. The Secretary General refuses to permanently \neliminate these positions. The roughly 200 other positions to be cut \nare clerical positions that the U.N. already planned to eliminate when \nit passed its budget last year. What the Secretary General did not \npoint out is that his budget adds 125 professional positions, which \ntypically cost 40 percent more than the clerical positions to be \neliminated.\n  Fourth, the United Nations much heralded 2-year, no-growth budget is \nnot living up to its billing. The goal was to cap budget spending at \n$2.608 billion over 2 years. Any new expenses not anticipated or \nbudgeted would require corresponding offsets in order to stay under the \n$2.608 cap. The Secretary General already is months behind in \nsubmitting a proposal of budget reductions needed to stay under the \ncap. Most important, the United Nations is not even halfway through its \nbudget cycle and already the Secretary General has indicated that the \nUnited Nations may not be able to stay under the budget cap. In fact, \nthe U.S. Representative for Reform and Management appeared before the \nUnited Nations Fifth Committee last month and stated the U.S. \ndelegation's concern with the Secretary General's latest budget report: \nit ``implies an inability to stay within the $2.608 billion budget \nlevel * * *''\n  Finally, I must take issue with statements made by the Secretary \nGeneral that the United Nations current financial problems are due to \nthe failure of the United States to make good on its U.N. payments. \nUnfortunately, the Secretary General is confusing the disease's \nsymptoms with its causes. Yes, the United Nations is in a financial \ncrisis. However, it's a crisis of the United Nations own making.\n  For more than a decade, beginning with the great work of the Senator \nfrom Kansas, Nancy Kassebaum, the U.S. Congress has made U.N. reform a \nhigh priority. U.N. leadership has fought this effort. That leaves \nCongress little choice but to use our leverage as the single largest \nU.N. contributor to achieve U.N. reform goals. It's a tough approach. \nIt's not the one I would prefer using, but it is the only means \ncurrently available to us, and it has had some success.\n  I want to see the United States make good on our current U.N. debts. \nThat can't happen without a clear, substantive reform agenda in place \nat the United Nations. It's worth the wait. Frankly, it's far better to \nhold a portion of our taxpayer dollars here in Washington until reforms \nare achieved, rather than send them down a black hole of waste, fraud \nand abuse. Yes, we in Congress have an obligation to support the U.N., \nbut our first obligation is to the American taxpayer. Our taxpayers \ndeserve to know that their money is being managed prudently and \neffectively by the U.N. leadership. That is not being done.\n  Mr. President, a fresh approach, a fresh perspective on U.N. \nleadership with an emphasis on responsible management practices is \nneeded. Real reform at the United Nations will not occur without an \noverall fundamental change in the management philosophy at the United \nNations. This fact was noted in the U.N. IG's first report, which noted \nthat ``while the need for * * *. structural reform is widely \nacknowledged, the energy to bring it about is in short supply.''\n  What that means is the United Nations needs tough, well-trained \nadministrators at all levels of management. That's particularly true in \npeacekeeping missions, where waste and abuse traditionally is high. I'm \nnot suggesting more U.N. bureaucracy. The United Nations either should \ntrain those currently within the United Nations who have the skills and \nthe desire to be tough administrators, or replace the less effective \nones with people with the experience to do the job.\n  In short, what is required is a complete management overhaul at the \nUnited Nations. Like any organization, the tone and direction in \nmanagement starts at the top. I hope the Clinton administration \nrecognizes this. The United States needs to make clear that we seek a \nreal, fundamental change in U.N. leadership. New leadership just may be \nthe sparkplug the United Nations needs to restore its credibility in \nthe eyes of Congress and the American people.\n  Again, I support the United Nations. If managed effectively, the \nUnited Nations can be a sound, cost-effective investment in the \nadvancement of global economic development, human rights, and world \npeace. I hope the intense criticism of management practices in recent \nyears will jar the United Nations members to realize that sound \nmanagement is vital to the United Nations long-term credibility. \nManagement reform cannot by itself ensure that the United Nations will \nbe both credible and successful, but without it, it does not stand a \nchance. New leadership is needed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6275-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6276-S6277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO COL. WILLIAM B. LOPER, U.S. ARMY, ON THE OCCASION OF HIS \n                               RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today, June 14, is the 221st birthday of \nthe U.S. Army, a military force that has distinguished itself \nrepeatedly throughout the history of this great Nation. Victories in \nbattles from our War for Independence to the Persian Gulf war were \nsuccessful only because of the stellar soldiers that serve selflessly \nand bravely in the Army of the United States. I rise today to pay \ntribute to a man who is a fine soldier and a friend to many of us in \nthis Chamber, Lt. Col. William B. Loper, as he prepares to bring his \nactive duty career to an end.\n\n[[Page S6277]]\n\n  Colonel Loper began his career more than 24 years ago when he pinned \non the gold bars of a second lieutenant and the crossed muskets of the \ninfantry. A product of Washington, DC's Georgetown University and the \nReserve Officer Training Corps, Bill Loper was well educated, prepared, \nand trained for his ensuing career as an Army officer. His tours of \nduty included stints as an adjutant and Chief of Records for the 25th \nInfantry Division; as a personnel adviser in Pennsylvania; as the \nSecretary of the General Staff for the 19th Support Command, located in \nKorea; and ultimately, back to the District of Columbia where he was an \nassignments officer at the Army Personnel Center, and executive officer \nin the Army Legislative Liaison Office, where most of us have come to \nknow him.\n  During his tenure in the Legislative Liaison Office, Colonel Loper \nhas worked hard to represent the interests of the Army to Members of \nCongress, as well as tirelessly working to assist Senators, \nRepresentatives, and their staffs, in dealing with defense matters as \nwell as constituent concerns and issues. I do not think any of my \ncolleagues would disagree with my assessment of Colonel Roper, he is an \nindividual who has always been prompt, responsive, and sensitive to the \nneeds and requests of Members of Congress, and he has presented a \npositive and impressive image of the Army during the course of his \nduties here.\n  Mr. President, service and dedication to duty have been two hallmarks \nof Colonel Loper's career. He has served our Nation and the Army well \nduring his years of service, and we are grateful for all his efforts \nand sacrifices in the defense of the United States. I am sure that \neveryone who has worked with Colonel Loper would want to join me in \nwishing him health, happiness, and success in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6276-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO THE U.S. ARMY ON THE OCCASION OF ITS 221ST BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the U.S. Army was born 221 years ago \ntoday on a village square in Cambridge, MA when a group of colonials \nmustered together to form an army under the authority of the \nContinental Congress. As this force went on to confront the Redcoats at \nLexington, and to ultimately defeat the British in 1783, it is no \nexaggeration to say that the birth of the Continental Army resulted in \nthe birth of our Nation. More than 2 centuries later, both the United \nStates and its Army are recognized throughout the world as being \nunequaled, and I rise today to salute the Army on its birthday.\n  The history of our Nation and our Army are intertwined, and the \nbattle streamers of that service stand not only as testament to the \ncourage, fortitude, and abilities of those who served in the Army, but \nchronicle the evolution of the United States. The Army was present when \nthe shot heard around the world was fired, and in Yorktown when the \nBritish surrendered, not only admitting defeat to the Americans, but \nvalidating that we were a free and separate nation. It was Lewis and \nClark, two Army officers, who explored the unknown west before that \nregion became territories and states. It was the Army that entered \nMexico City, and our victory in the war with Mexico helped to expand \nour southwestern borders. At Bull Run, Antietam, Gettysburg, and dozens \nof other blood stained battlefields, it was the soldiers of one \nAmerican army fighting the soldiers of another American army for the \nvery future of this Nation. In Havana and the Philippines, the American \nArmy fought Spanish imperialism, and at Verdun, Doughboys battled \nGerman imperialism. Army Air Corpsmen lost their lives on that Day of \nInfamy that began World War II, and dogfaced GI's battled the Nazis, \nthe Fascists, and the Imperial Japanese in North Africa, Sicily, \nNormandy, Arnhem, and throughout the Pacific. In the early days of the \ncold war, American soldiers dug in on the southern tip of Korea, \ncreating the Pusan perimeter and holding the line against the advancing \nNorth Koreans, and it was American soldiers who stormed the walls at \nInchon to turn the tide of the Korean conflict in favor of the United \nNations. In the Ia Drang Valley, and in countless firefights in \nnameless locations throughout the jungles, mountains, and rice paddies \nof Vietnam, American soldiers valiantly fought to help the fledgling \nnation of South Vietnam become a democracy; and in Grenada, Panama, and \nKuwait, the American Army deposed tyrants and brought terror-filled \nregimes of dictators to an end.\n\n  In its 221 years of history, the U.S. Army has distinguished itself \ntime and time again, and though many things have changed about the \nArmy, the quality and dedication of its soldiers has remained \nunwavering. The men and women who wear the Army green are individuals \nwho willingly bear many sacrifices so that their countrymen may remain \nsafe, secure, and free. Too few of us ever take the time to think of \nthe soldiers patrolling the demilitarized zone of the Korean Peninsula \nwhere there is always the chance that hostilities may break out; or of \nthe soldiers stationed on the Sinai, where they help to ensure the \npeace between Egypt and Israel remains strong; or of the young \nparatrooper at Fort Bragg who is ready to deploy to anyplace in the \nworld at a moment's notice. To these soldiers the phrase ``Duty, Honor, \nCountry'' is more than a collection of mere words, it is the creed by \nwhich they live their lives, and we are indeed fortunate for their \ndedication and selflessness.\n  For more than 30 years, it was American soldiers who faced down the \nSoviets across the Iron Curtain, and when democracy and individual \nrights ultimately triumphed over communism and collective subjugation, \nit was thanks in large part to the vigilance of the thousands of \nsoldiers who served on the front lines of the cold war. With the fall \nof the Communist bloc, the threats to the United States have changed, \nand the Army is redefining its mission. The Army must now be prepared \nto respond to regional crises, carry out humanitarian missions, and \npeacekeeping roles, as well as to be prepared to deal with terrorists \nand rogue nations. Rest assured, however, that with whatever task that \nthe Army of the United States of America is charged, it will complete \nits assignment successfully, and it will remain the best trained and \nbest equipped force in the world.\n  Mr. President, if the soldiers of the Continental Army could see \ntheir late 20th century brothers and sisters in arms, they would be \namazed at the differences between the Minuteman and the soldier of \nForce XXI. Rifled muskets have given way to selective fire, magazine-\nfed weapons systems that allow soldiers to see in the dark and fire a \nmultitude of munitions. The horse cavalry has been replaced by the \nBradley fighting vehicle, a weapons platform that has the firepower of \nthe divisions of old; and Army helicopters that comprise one of the \nlargest air forces in the world, now transport and support with \nsupplies and firepower the infantry. Combined, all these elements \nguarantee the success and superiority of the American Army and that \nwherever it goes, our soldiers will persevere over any foe. I am \npleased to have this opportunity to celebrate the history of the U.S. \nArmy, to thank those soldiers who have served in the past and who serve \ntoday, and to assure my colleagues that our Army will always stand \nready to defend our citizens and our Nation from all who threaten us, \njust as they have for the past 220 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6277-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the Advisory Committee on Agricultural \nConcentration has submitted its final report to Secretary of \nAgriculture Dan Glickman. The committee has been investigating the \nrelationship between concentration in the livestock processing and \npacking industry and the record low prices in the cattle market. It did \na tremendous job identifying the problems facing our Nation's livestock\n\n[[Page S6278]]\n\nproducers, and its recommendations have been widely praised within the \nagricultural community.\n  The success of the advisory committee was in no small measure \nattributable to its membership. The panel consisted of 21 individuals \nfrom across the country who represent a cross section of the livestock \nindustry. It included farmers, ranchers, meat packers, processors, \npoultry growers, retailers, and economists.\n  While all committee members should be commended for their \ndetermination to get to the bottom of the livestock concentration \nissue, I want to single out for special mention the two members from \nSouth Dakota: Herman Schumacher and Tyrone Moos.\n  Herman Schumacher, who served as vice-chair of the advisory \ncommittee, lives in Herried, SD. He owns and operates the Herried \nLivestock Auction, is past president of the South Dakota Livestock \nAuction Markets Association, and is part owner of a cattle feedlot.\n  Without question, Herman is one of the most tenacious and persuasive \nadvocates for cattle producers I have ever met. He understands American \nagriculture and never stops looking for ways to address problems facing \nfarmers and ranchers. Herman's expertise and leadership were \ninstrumental to the development of the committee's consensus findings \nand recommendations. In addition, he helped craft additional minority \nviews that are more prescriptive than the consensus views in outlining \nresponses to problems identified in the report.\n  Tyrone Moos is a grain and livestock producer from Philip, SD, who \nalso serves as director of the Harvest States Cooperative. Tyrone's \nexpertise in both grain and livestock issues were invaluable to the \ncommittee's deliberations.\n  One focus of the committee's review was the impact of concentration \nin the agricultural transportation industry. The century-old problem of \ninsufficient access to rail cars contributes to the determination of \nthe final price a producer receives for his or her commodities, and \nTyrone's experience helped shape the committee's findings in this area. \nAdditionally, Tyrone's influence was evident in the tone and substance \nof the final recommendations for both the consensus and minority views \nsections of the report.\n  When Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman called to solicit Herman's \nand Tyrone's service on this important committee, it would have been \neasy for them to decline the invitation. The commitment and sacrifice \nasked of them was significant.\n  The Department of Agriculture did not offer compensation, not even \nfor travel expenses. But it did ask for a significant commitment of \ntime. Herman, Tyrone and their colleagues served countless hours on the \npanel's work--time that could have been spent looking after their own \nbusiness interests or with their families.\n  The advisory committee's inquiry directed needed attention to the \nserious problem of stagnating cattle prices, provided insights on the \nnature of that problem and offered recommendations for what might be \ndone about it. Farmers and ranchers in South Dakota and elsewhere \nshould be thankful for that effort.\n  The work of the Advisory Committee on Agricultural Concentration is \ndone. It is now up to our Nation's policymakers to evaluate the panel's \nfindings and act on its recommendations. I look forward to taking the \nbaton passed on by Herman Schumacher and Tyrone Moos, and I thank them \nfor pointing the way to a solution to the problem of concentration in \nagriculture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6277-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ISRAELI ELECTION ABOUT DEFINITION OF PEACE\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the campaign for Israel's first directly \nelected Prime Minister not only brought a victory for Benjamin \nNetanyahu but a defeat for the mistaken idea that peace can only be \ndefined from a liberal perspective.\n  While two well-qualified candidates with different ideologies each \narticulated their vision for the country, many in the American media--\nthose who reported on the campaign and the experts journalists chose to \ninterview--hid behind stereotypes and missed the real point of the \nelection. At its very core, the campaign was not about whether there \nshould be peace but how to define it.\n  The American media told us the issue was simply this: Shimon Peres, \nthe liberal, wanted peace. Benjamin Netanyahu, the conservative, \ndidn't. Implied in this ridiculous statement is the wrong assumption \nthat only liberals understand peace.\n  In the days since the election, the American media aren't quite \ncertain how to characterize Mr. Netanyahu. When Mr. Netanyahu recently \nexpressed his desire for Israel to continue to seek peace with its Arab \nneighbors--a position he has advocated all along--a Washington Post \nstory identified him as ``kinder and gentler.''\n  The media's failure to understand Benjamin Netanyahu and his \nconservative principles of real peace--real security underscores the \ndifferences in how liberals and conservatives view foreign policy.\n  The left believes peace is simply the absence of conflict. To achieve \npeace, the left will do whatever is necessary and in many cases give up \nwhatever is necessary simply to maintain the peace.\n  Conservatives believe peace without freedom is false. Only through \nthe guiding principle that freedom is the core of all human progress \ncan a nation build a lasting peace. After all, what is peace without \nfreedom? What is peace if it means living in constant fear? In Cuba and \nChina today, there is peace, but certainly no freedom.\n  When any nation builds its foreign policy on a foundation of freedom, \ndemocracy, justice, and human rights, true peace and hope will \ninevitably prevail.\n  During the 1980's, the left and the media soundly criticized Ronald \nReagan and Margaret Thatcher when their policies boldly stated that \nnegotiations with the Soviet Union must be carried out from a position \nof strength and security . . . not appeasement.\n  History proved them right. Freedom won. The Berlin Wall--a symbol of \ntyranny and oppression--crumbled and communism was replaced by \ncapitalism.\n  Even if many in the American media apparently believe in the \nludicrous claim that appeasement leads to peace, Israeli Jews--a \nmajority of whom voted for Netanyahu--correctly understand that \nprotecting freedom is essential to preserving peace.\n  In his analysis of the election, A.M. Rosenthal of the New York Times \nsaid it best when he wrote: ``the majority was not voting against \npeace--the very idea is idiocy--but for the hope that Mr. Netanyahu and \na Likud-led coalition might create a peace they could trust while they \nslept, not just while they stood at arms.''\n  In a region where Israel's neighbors have vowed its destruction, \nwhere thousands of missiles in other countries are pointed at Israel's \ncities, where well-financed terrorists threaten to murder and frighten \nIsrael's citizens, appeasement through weakness will only invite more \nviolence, more bloodshed and inevitably a loss of freedom and peace.\n  We all want peace for Israel--a shining jewel of democracy in a \nregion where freedom is often unwelcome. Choosing the best road for \nachieving that peace is the task that awaits Benjamin Netanyahu. He \nunderstands--as well as the overwhelming majority of Israeli Jews who \nvoted for him--that only when Israel is secure, can Israel truly be \nfree and at peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6278-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6278-S6279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, at this time when the fiscal year 1997 \nappropriations level for the National Endowment for the Arts is being \ndetermined, I would like to illustrate the importance of the arts to \nthe education of our children and to the growth of the local economy \nthrough two examples from my home State of Rhode Island.\n  The May 23 issue of Nature describes the Starting With the Arts \n[SWAP] Program for 96 first-graders in four Pawtucket, RI, classrroms. \nThe program is based on the internationally recognized Kodaly \ncurriculum that emphasizes musical and visual arts skills. After 7 \nmonths, the SWAP children scored better in math than their counterparts \nwho had standard classes--and equally well in reading--even though \ntheir kindergarten scores indicated that they were behind. At the end \nof second grade, math comprehension and\n\n[[Page S6279]]\n\nproblem-solving skills were highest in students who received 2 years of \nthe special program, next best in those who had 1 year, and worst in \nthose who received the standard curriculum.\n  The findings of a nationwide survey on the attitudes of Americans \ntoward the arts, conducted by Louis Harris and released this month, \nfound that 9 in 10 Americans believed that when children get involved \nin the arts in school, they ``become more creative and imaginative,'' \n``develop skills that make them feel more accomplished,'' and ``learn \nto communicate well.'' Over 8 in 10 Americans also feel that exposure \nto the arts ``helps young people develop discipline and perseverance'' \nand helps them ``to learn skills that can be useful in a job.'' The \nPawtucket youngsters confirm these beliefs.\n  My second example stems from a 2-hour public forum organized as part \nof the 16th International Sculpture Conference in Providence last week. \nAt this meeting, numerous civic, cultural, and business leaders came \nforward to show how the arts have served to stimulate the economic \nrevival of downtown Providence. What is happening in Rhode Island is \nhappening nationally. Nonprofit arts organizations create nearly $37 \nbillion in economic activity in the United States every year, and \nsupport 1.3 million American jobs.\n  The arts are one of the best and the cheapest ways of improving the \neconomy. The arts stimulate business development, spur urban renewal, \nattract new businesses, and improve the overall quality of life in our \ncities and towns. Roger Mandle at the Rhode Island School of Design has \nrepeatedly demonstrated the importance of design to both the economy \nand greater ease in every day life. Existing and available cultural \nresources are frequently cited as one of the prime reasons businesses \nselect to move to a community. The arts can literally turn a community \nor neighborhood around.\n  One of the best illustrations of the impact of the arts on the \neconomy is tourism, and tourism is the fastest growing economic market \nin the United States today. In Providence, the Providence Performing \nArts Center and Trinity Square Repertory Company have brought countless \naudiences to their theaters, with many people spending money on \nrestaurants, shops, parking, and the like that would not do so \notherwise without the presence of the arts. Recent discussions among \nthe museums in the downtown area have led to the exciting concept of a \nMuseum Mile connecting these cultural institutions through a collective \neffort in marketing, fundraising, parking, transportation. The result \nwill attract visitors from all over the country to Providence. When the \narts is good, more people are employed, and more taxable income \ngenerates more revenue for our State and local municipalities.\n  There are more artists per square mile living in Providence than in \nany other city in the  United States, and this number is likely to \nincrease with the passage of proposed State legislation that would \nprovide State income and sales breaks to artists living or working in \nthe central business district. One bill would exempt these artists from \npaying sales tax on plays, books, musical compositions, paintings and \nsculpture. A second bill would provide these artists with a personal \ntax exempt. The Rhode Island House Finance Committee has voted its \napproval. In praising the effort, Mayor Vincent A. Cianci, Jr. states: \n``These bills, while supporting our artists and arts, promote economic \ndevelopment and tourism and will create a more dynamic synergy among \nthe Arts and Entertainment District, Capital Center and the Province \nPlace mall.''\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to consider these examples from \nRhode Island, to understand the far-reaching positive impact of the \narts on both education and economy, and to join together in a \nbipartisan effort to appropriate $136 million for the National \nEndowment for the Arts as requested by administration. It is important \nthat this agency is funded sufficiently to be able to continue its \nworthwhile and extremely effective endeavors to improve the quality of \nlife for all Americans.\n  The recent Harris Poll referenced above shows that Federal support \nfor the arts remains solid and strong. Surprisingly, Harris also found \nthat a 61 percent majority of Americans--to 37 percent saying ``no''--\nwould be willing to be taxed $5 more in order to pay for Federal \nfinancial support for the arts. Fully 86 percent of all American adults \nare exposed to the arts in the course of a year. These people believe \nthe arts to be important and would sorely missed them if they were not \nthere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6278-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SENATE PAGES--SPRING CLASS OF 1996\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I want to talk briefly about the tireless \nefforts being undertaken by a local nonprofit organization in South \nDakota to improve the severe economic conditions on the Pine Ridge \nIndian Reservation.\n  Over the years, numerous national press articles have documented the \nPine Ridge Indian Reservation as one of the most impoverished areas in \nthe country. The arid nature of the land lends little to farming and \nranching. Banks, department stores, paved roads, and even safe drinking \nwater are not to be taken for granted. Even amidst the stark majesty of \nits landscape, the vibrant tourism industry of western South Dakota \nremains a whisper of promise. Quite simply, on the Pine Ridge \nReservation, the basic economic infrastructure that we all take for \ngranted, struggles to exist.\n  Ten years ago, a group of Pine Ridge residents, dedicated to \nimproving their local economy, created a peer lending program called \nthe Lakota Fund. After forming partnerships with private foundations \nand Federal agencies for seed money, this unique program began \nprocessing loans for economic enterprise on the reservation. It \nmandated enrollment in financial and business training courses and \nrequired groups of loan recipients to cosign for each others' loans. \nThis unique lending approach, emphasizing trust over credit, created a \nstrong sense of teamwork in the area that has enabled many budding \nentrepreneurs to realize their dreams.\n  Before participating in the program, one young woman was unable to \nfulfill her dream of buying a house for her family. However, after \nsuccessfully starting her own business and repaying her loan to the \nLakota Fund, she was able to purchase a home, thanks to the \nestablishment of a good credit record.\n\n[[Page S6280]]\n\n  There are many more individual success stories, but the true success \nof the Lakota Fund has transcended the accomplishments of any one \nindividual. It has affected the entire community.\n  Over the years, the Lakota Fund has loaned nearly $1 million to over \n250 small business men and women. Of these loans, less than 10 percent \nhave failed.\n  When the Lakota Fund began 10 years ago, the town of Kyle had only \none grocery store and one convenience store. Today, with the Lakota \nFund's help, Kyle is home to a cafe, two video rental stores, a flower \nshop, a tire repair shop, and a multitude of other businesses. These \nongoing success stories are testament to the vision of the Lakota \nFund's creators and staff. They knew that as each new business would \nbring new jobs, so would each new job sustain and improve the hope for \nfinancial independence.\n  I have learned a great deal from the Lakota Fund's success. It has \nstrengthened my belief that economies are built through partnerships. \nIt has proven that Federal agencies such as the Economic Development \nAdministration and the Small Business Administration can work together \nwith community leaders to provide the financial support needed to make \nsound investments in local economies. And it has clearly demonstrated \nthe important roles that exist for private foundations in supporting \nnew business ventures.\n  But most importantly, these efforts are shining examples that \nsuccessful change can begin at the local level, that good things can be \ndone when people work together, and that dreams can be reached where \nhope is allowed to grow.\n  Mr. President, on June 20 of this year, the Lakota Fund will \ncelebrate the ribbon cutting of their new foundation headquarters. This \nbuilding, which was constructed through financial partnerships with the \nEconomic Development Administration, Norwest Bank, and other notable \nprivate organizations, will house the offices of the Lakota Fund and \nwill provide retail space for existing clients as well as training \nfacilities for new loan applicants.\n  This day will also celebrate the opening of the Tribal Business \nInformation Center, a joint Small Business Administration venture that \nwill work with the Lakota Fund to assist in the further development of \nthe local economy.\n  I would like to recognize the efforts of the Lakota Fund's staff for \nthe hard work and commitment that was necessary to see these two \nprojects through to fruition. In particular, I would like to personally \nhonor the hard work and dedication of Elsie Meeks. As the former \nexecutive director of the Lakota Fund, Elsie has long been an \nimpassioned voice for economic development in the Pine Ridge community. \nHer foresight and determination have made the Lakota Fund a national \nexample of how trust among people can affect positive economic change.\n  Still, I would be remiss if I did not emphasize that much more work \nneeds to be done. The success of the Lakota Fund and the creation of \nthe Tribal Business Information Center are but two small steps on a \nmuch longer journey to sustained economic growth on the Pine Ridge \nReservation.\n  Under the local guidance of organizations such as the Lakota Fund, I \nam confident we can continue to maximize our resources and forge \nstronger relationships between the public and private sector. And, with \nresponsible leadership in Congress, we can reward the priorities of \neconomic growth by emphasizing Federal programs that promote \npartnership and local control.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6279-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6280-S6281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FISCAL YEAR 1997 GOP BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to briefly discuss my \nopposition to the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution.\n  In voting against the balance budget amendment last week, I stated \nthat I did not believe Congress needed a mechanism in the Constitution \nto balance the budget and that I believed Congress had the will to \nreach a balanced budget on its own. If nothing else, I can say that at \nleast my colleagues across the aisle proved me right on that point.\n  However, I voted against this budget proposal because I am in \nconsiderable disagreement with the way they propose we achieve \nbudgetary balance.\n  Their budget resolution, passed yesterday on a party-line vote, calls \nfor discretionary spending cuts to programs vital to our Nation's \nfuture--like education and research--while offering a tax cut that \nforces larger and deeper cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. But more \nimportant, Mr. President, this budget does nothing--nothing--to \nfundamentally reform our entitlement programs which continue to consume \na bigger portion of the Federal budget each year. I also point out that \nthis resolution raises the deficit for the first time since the Clinton \nadministration took office.\n  Mr. President, I support the goal of a balanced budget and have \nfought, am fighting and will continue to fight to achieve it. Recently \nmy colleagues and I--Senators Simpson, Brown, Nunn,  and Robb--proposed \na provision that would have reformed long-term entitlements. Mind you, \nwe did not tinker around the edges, but instead took on some serious \nbudgetary dilemmas without using gimmickry or short-term measures as a \nsolution.\n  For our efforts we received 36 bipartisan votes--unprecedented \nsupport for this type of long-term entitlement reform. Our proposed \nchanges to current laws would have caused taxpayers very little concern \nin the short-term as these changes would be phased in and have no \neffect on anyone over the age of 50 and would save the Nation billions \nof dollars in the long term. As well, the Senate recently voted on the \ncentrist budget plan, which addressed a number of budgetary problems \nincluding long-term entitlement reform, and provided a balanced budget \nin seven years. This plan garnered 46 bipartisan votes--22 Democrats \nand 24 Republicans.\n\n  I only wish my colleagues on the other side of the aisle chose a \nsimilar path.\n  A balanced budget by 2002, which this resolution offers, is still of \nlittle solace because it ignores the most important fiscal challenge we \nface: the rapid growth in entitlement spending over the next 30 years.\n  I cannot stress enough the year on which we ought to be focused is \nnot 2002, but 2008, when the baby boomer generation begins to reach \neligibility age for retirement. This will place a severe strain on the \nFederal budget. Our biggest fiscal challenge is demographic, not \npolitical, and the budget before us does not address it.\n  Unfortunately, and conveniently, this demographic challenge is kept \nfrom our view by a budgeting process that discourages long-term \nplanning. A six-year span is completely inadequate when the most \ndifficult budget decisions we need to make deal with problems we will \nface 20, 25, and 30 years down the road, when the aging of our \npopulation propels entitlement spending out of control. The most \nimportant recommendation of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement \nand Tax Reform was that we begin to look at the impact of budgets over \n30 years rather than just 5 or 7. The reason is that our country looks \nvery different, and our current budgets look very different, viewed \nover that span.\n  We can see the trend even in the short term. Entitlement programs--\nwhich included Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Federal \nretirement--will consume 66 percent of the budget this year. By 2002, \nit will be 73 percent. By 2005, the number is 78 percent. Those numbers \nare straight from CBO, and if we project further, Mr. President, we see \nthat by 2021, mandatory spending and interest on the national debt will \nconsume every dollar we collect in taxes. By 2013, we will be forced to \nbegin dipping into the surplus in the Social Security Trust Fund to \ncover benefit payments, a practice that will go on for not more than 16 \nyears before the trust fund goes into the red.\n  These trends have to do with the simple fact that our population is \ngetting older while our work force gets smaller. My generation did not \nhave as many children as our parents expected, and, as a consequence, \nthe system under which each generation of workers supports the \npreceding generation of retirees simply will not hold up.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, long-term entitlement reform coupled with a \nreasonable reduction in spending would alone reduce interest rates and \nbring balance to the budget.\n\n[[Page S6281]]\n\n  The result is a question of fairness between generations. Today there \nare roughly five workers paying taxes to support the benefits of each \nretiree. When my generation retires there will be fewer than three. \nUnless we take action now, the choice we force upon our children will \nbe excruciating: Continue to fund benefits at current levels by \nradically raising taxes on the working population or slash benefits \ndramatically.\n\n  In 1981, Congress--backed by the Reagan administration--passed a tax-\ncut for the American people hailed as a boon to the national economy \nand a panacea for combating an overreaching Government. However, the \ntax cuts proposed and passed were coupled with unrivalled Government \nspending, which created the enormous deficits we now confront in this \nbody daily. Nobody believed in 1981 or 1982--save a small few--that \nwhat was happening was the creation of large, grave deficits the likes \nof which this country had never seen, even after the then Majority \nLeader Howard Baker at the time called this budgetary strategy a \n``river boat gamble.''\n  Mr. President, until Congress can agree on a budget that addresses \nthe unsustainable growth of entitlement programs and avoids gimmickry \nand short-term fixes, anything else is simply a river boat gamble.\n  I will continue to oppose resolutions such as the one we voted on \nyesterday because I do not wish to commit our Nation's fiscal integrity \nand the hopes of future generations to a gamble, no more than I would \ntry to balance my family's checkbook by heading to the slot machines \nwith a pocket full of quarters. This Nation and our children deserve \nbetter.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6280-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6281-S6284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM NOMINATION OF ALAN GREENSPAN TO BE CHAIRMAN OF \n                       THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the matter now \nbefore the Senate is the nomination of Alan Greenspan to the Federal \nReserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Alan Greenspan, of New York, to be Chairman of the Board of \n     Governors of the Federal Reserve System for a term of four \n     years.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I like my colleagues, take my responsibility \nvery seriously as to whether or not I support nominations made by the \nPresident. During the time that I have served in the Senate, most of \nthat time has been under Republican Presidents. I always took the fact \nthat they made the nomination something that I should, if I could, \nsupport. I felt that way for Republicans. I feel the same way for a \nDemocratic President.\n  As a result, my decision today, while it may not be earthshaking in \nnature, has been quite difficult. It was after great deliberation that \nI concluded I can not support the nomination of Alan Greenspan. He has \nrendered great service to the country. But I think the time has come \nfor new leadership. We need to look at what is taking place at the Fed \nnot only regarding its monetary policy but also internal management. I \nthink that we need to send a message to the American public that what \nis going on in the Federal Reserve Board is not good.\n  As a result of that, I have indicated I will not support the \nnomination of Alan Greenspan, a nomination that has been submitted to \nthe Senate of the United States by a Democrat, Bill Clinton.\n  Mr. President, many suggest that if the Federal Government operated \nmore like the private sector we would rid ourselves of waste and \ninefficiency. While that generalized statement is probably true--that \nwe would get rid of a lot of waste and inefficiency, if we operated \nmore like the private sector--that is not absolutely true. It has \nmerit. I subscribe to that belief, and I think that we should keep that \nstatement in mind when we consider the reappointment of Chairman \nGreenspan to the Fed.\n  For example, if the shareholders of a bank--and if the President of \nthat bank operated as a multimillion dollar enterprise--suddenly found \nin that banking operation that there was a fund, a slush fund, a rainy \nday fund, as the Fed looks to it, without anyone's knowledge, would the \nshareholders vote for reappointment of that President? The answer is \nobviously no. They would want probably an opportunity for the President \nof that bank to explain himself. Yet, those who are insisting on a vote \nin the affirmative for Chairman Greenspan are asking us to accept what \nthe Fed has done without any explanation. I personally cannot do that.\n  According to the General Accounting Office report that I requested, \nalong with Senator Dorgan, the Federal Reserve Board is operating with \na number of problems. But one is that the General Accounting Office \nfound that there is a $3.7 billion fund. Some refer to it as a rainy \nday fund, and others have referred to as a slush fund.\n  The purpose of it, they say, is to make sure that if there are ever \nany losses that they are covered.\n  Well, for 79 years the Fed has been in existence. They have never had \na loss. There has been no explanation why they have this fund \nmaintained. It is fair to assume that, when it comes to deficit \nreduction, the chairman's rhetoric is inconsistent with his actions.\n  The Government was literally shut down last year for a billion \ndollars here, a billion dollars there. For $3.7 billion we would not \nhave had a Government shutdown.\n  The report raises a number of legitimate questions about the fiscal \nmanagement within the Federal Reserve System. Important questions \nshould have been answered prior to now and certainly prior to voting \nfor confirmation of this Chairman. This study was requested because no \nclose examination of the Fed operations had ever been conducted.\n  I offered legislation on a number of occasions calling for the audit \nof the Federal Reserve System. These requests for legislation were \npromptly thrown in file 13. They never went anyplace. The Fed is \nuntouchable. Well, after this study I do not think they should be \nuntouchable, because some of the questions that people asked have been \nanswered in this report.\n  In fact, does the Federal Reserve System run its own shop with no \noversight by anyone? The answer is yes. As I said, there has never been \na close examination of the Fed's operations until this study was \nconducted. The General Accounting Office did a good job. The report is \nsizable in nature. This is a draft of the report. I understand that on \nMonday the 17th, they are going to submit their final report. This is \ndone the way the General Accounting Office always does their work. They \ndo a draft report and they show it to the people that requested the \nreport and then they submit it to the body that is being investigated. \nIt will be interesting to see how the Fed has responded to some of \nthese questions. I think, interestingly enough, their responses do not \nanswer all of the questions raised in the report.\n  Since they are a taxpayer-financed entity, I believe it was necessary \nto shed greater light on the Fed's operation and so I asked the General \nAccounting Office to do this. In today's constrained budget \nenvironment, Congress needs to be informed, and well informed, on all \nactivities that affect Government's finances. Certainly the national \nbanking system, the Federal Reserve System, is something we should have \na better handle on. That, in part, is why we requested this study of \nthe Fed.\n  Much of the study focuses on activities occurring under Mr. \nGreenspan's watch and the policies he oversaw. He has been there a long \ntime. He cannot blame what has gone on on someone else. He is the chief \nadministrative officer. He is the person we look to for guidance. He is \nthe person, when we have a problem with our national banking system, we \ncall in to Congress.\n\n[[Page S6282]]\n\n  It is my understanding that the General Accounting Office stands by \nall of its findings in the preliminary report, and I am sure that is \nthe case. Since this report was submitted there have been other \ninteresting things to develop. One of the most interesting, is a recent \nround of stories in the Los Angeles Times. They have done some very \ngood work on what is going on in part of the world of the Fed.\n  An executive at the San Francisco Fed confirms the fact that there \nare accounting practices at the bank in California that are in real \nquestion. For example, according not only to the LA Times, but the Wall \nStreet Journal--which certainly we cannot say is a foe or of the Fed. \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Federal Reserve \nBranch appears to have problems counting its money. This has been \nconfirmed by an executive at the San Francisco Fed. This executive \nasserts that employees were ``forcing balances that did not add up, so \nthat reports sent to the Fed board would appear normal.''\n  We are not talking here about how to do your weekly balancing of your \nchecking account. We are talking of almost $200 million. Apparently \nthis enormous management lapse that took place over a period of more \nthan a year has not been questioned by anyone in authority at the Fed. \nIt occurred in one of the most basic and critical functions that the \nFederal Reserve System has, and that is tracking the level of currency \nin circulation. The error was said at this point to be about $178 \nmillion. The Fed and the Chairman do not bear this loss, the taxpayers \nbear this loss.\n\n  The bottom line is we now have before us another story of Fed \nmismanagement, under the guidance and leadership of Alan Greenspan. It \nbegs us to question why this body is willing to reward such poor \noversight with, in effect, expeditious confirmation.\n  I have to say that I very much appreciate the initial action of the \nnew majority leader. Senator Lott has allowed 3 days to debate this. \nThat is very good. My only question would be whether we should have \ndone it before the final report of the General Accounting Office. But I \ncommend and applaud the new majority leader for allowing ample time to \ntalk about this issue. The fact we are talking about this, I think, \nwill lead to a better understanding of how the Fed acts.\n  There have been good discussions these past 2 days by the junior \nSenator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, and the junior Senator from North \nDakota, Senator Dorgan, about fiscal policy. I am not going to dwell a \nlot today on fiscal policy. Senators Harkin and Dorgan have done a good \njob on that. What I want to talk about, though, is where they spend 93 \npercent of their money.\n  You see, at the Fed, only about 7 percent of their money is spent on \nfiscal policy, setting policy. Ninety-three percent of it is running \nthis national bank we have. I believe we as a Congress have the \nresponsibility to look at that 93 percent and I believe appropriate \nthat money for that 93 percent. It is often said that Greenspan puts \nthe brakes on our economy. I think it might be time to put the brakes \non his nomination, slow it down, review all the facts that are being \nbrought to our attention, including the situation we have in the Los \nAngeles Fed.\n  There are some who say there is no need for an independent audit. An \nannual audit is fiscally sound policy.\n  Can you imagine a bank not having an annual audit? Can you imagine \nthe central banking system of the United States of America not having \nan annual independent audit? We do not have one. I believe it would \ninstill greater public confidence in our banking system and it would \nallow people to understand more what is going on.\n  Let us talk about increased cost. The Fed, while the rest of \nGovernment is cinching down and spending less, the Fed's operating \ncosts have increased steadily and substantially. In 1988, just a few \nyears ago, the cost of the Fed was $1.36 billion. In 1994, some 5 years \nlater, it was $2 billion. And it has gone up every year since then. We \ndo not have those final figures. Operating costs for the Federal \nReserve have grown at more than twice the rate of inflation. Fed \noperating costs jumped 50 percent between 1988 and 1994. It increased \nat a rate greater, of course, than overall Federal discretionary \nspending, which we are trying to rein in. Overall Federal discretionary \nspending increased during this period of time at a very minuscule rate. \nBut not the Fed, they jumped 50 percent. The greatest increases were \nbank supervision, personnel costs and data processing. The report makes \nit clear the Fed could do more to increase its own cost consciousness. \nThey could do a better job of holding back the cost of Government.\n  What is interesting is what the Fed did while its own costs were \nrapidly outpacing inflation. The Fed was urging fiscal restraint for \nthe rest of the country. I think it is interesting to talk about what \nhappened in the pre-Greenspan years with economic growth, and what \nhappened in the Greenspan years.\n  The green, the lower indicators on this graph, shows that the \nGreenspan years have not been good years. In spite of the tight \ncontrols we have had by the Fed, economic growth has not been good \nunder Chairman Greenspan.\n  Salary costs. The GAO clearly has pointed out that the Fed's salary \nhas been out of whack with the rest of society. The cost of salaries in \n1994 alone amounted to over $1 billion dollars. This constituted about \n79 percent of the Fed's personnel compensation cost. From 1988 to 1994, \nthe Fed salaries increased by 44 percent--44 percent. Salaries of some \nof the Reserve Bank presidents are even greater than the Chairman's \nsalary.\n  Mr. President, these salaries might attract more people to \nGovernment, but they certainly will not attract more people to good \nGovernment. Most taxpayers would find the fact that 120 top-level Fed \nofficials earned more in 1994 than the Chairman did a bit excessive. It \njust does not make sense. Why should bank executives make more than the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board?\n  From 1988 to 1994, the last numbers we have and what the General \nAccounting Office had to look at, the cost of Fed employee personnel \nbenefits increased by 89 percent--89 percent. The General Accounting \nOffice found the Fed's benefits were generous compared to those of \nGovernment agencies with similar responsibilities, and that is an \nunderstatement.\n  The GAO found the Fed provides additional benefits to some select \nofficials. For example, bodyguards, home security systems, chauffeured \nhome-to-office transportation.\n  Travel is really interesting. Although it constitutes a small portion \nof the Fed's operating expenses, these expenses have had the highest \ngrowth, 85 percent. Travel expenses increased significantly more, to \nsay the least, than Federal Government travel expenses.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, to try to get members of the \nadministration or Government agencies to come to our States is very \nhard because they do not have travel money. Very important issues in a \nState where they need to come and take a look, a lot of the agencies \nhave trouble doing it.\n  I asked the head of the Environmental Protection Agency to come to \nLas Vegas. I thought it was a very important meeting. She could not \ncome, even though she badly wanted to, because of travel restrictions, \nher budget is so tight. Part of this, of course, is grossly exaggerated \nwhen you recognize the Fed's travel expenses went up almost 100 \npercent.\n  The Fed's travel expenses, when you limit it strictly to their \ntraveling and nothing else, increased 66 percent. When Board members \ntravel, Mr. President, they travel in style. No uniform style, but they \ntravel in style. Some of the districts are allowed to be reimbursed on \na per diem basis. Others are reimbursed on actual-cost basis. There is \nno rhyme nor reason. It is according to what they want to do.\n  So what I am saying is, they have, in fact, an unlimited expense \naccount. I do not know where else in Government there is anything like \nthat. I do not think anyplace.\n  Because the policies vary from bank to bank, these costs could easily \nbe contained by a uniform, more taxpayer-friendly policy. The General \nAccounting Office points this out as well.\n  Also, we have a double standard, the General Accounting Office has \nfound, and this clear double standard is practiced by the Federal \nReserve System. At the Fed's encouragement, we have\n\n[[Page S6283]]\n\ntaken significant steps toward eliminating the deficit. In fact, I can \nremember Mr. Greenspan saying a year or so ago the most important thing \nwe can do is reduce the deficit, and at times, these steps have been \nextremely painful, often requiring downsizing, budget cuts, and \nelimination of various programs, programs that some of us believed in \nand liked a lot. We had to cut and whack those so we could meet our \nbudget reduction steps.\n  We have done a pretty good job. This will be the fourth year in a row \nwhere we have reduced the deficit. Four years in a row, the first time \nsince the Civil War we have done that. We have not reduced it, perhaps, \nenough, but 4 years in a row where we had a reduced deficit. That is \ngood.\n\n  While the rest of the Government underwent necessary belt tightening, \nthe Fed enjoyed a smorgasbord of growth. What is a smorgasbord of \ngrowth? I do not know if that is a word people know anymore. It is \nsomething they had in Nevada to get people to come to the casinos. They \nwould have this vast array of food that would cost not very much money. \nPeople could come and gorge themselves, if they wished, on different \nfoods.\n  That is, in effect, what we have had with the Fed. They have had a \nsmorgasbord of growth. They have had everything they wanted. They have \ngorged themselves. While the Federal Government's overall staffing \nlevel declined, the Fed's staffing level increased by some 4 percent.\n  The bulk of this growth occurred in largely the white-collar \nsupervision and regulation area. The largest decrease in staffing \noccurred in the area of services to financial institutions, a blue-\ncollar area where we need more help.\n  From 1988 to 1994, the Federal Reserve salary costs increased by 44 \npercent.\n  In the area of travel expenses, as I have already said, the Fed \nincreased by 66 percent. Again, this could easily be remedied by \nbringing the Fed under the same travel rules as the rest of the Federal \nGovernment. It appears to be a classic case of, ``Do as I say, don't do \nas I do.''\n  It is important to look beyond the comparison of Federal Government. \nDuring this same period, while many commercial banks were downsizing, \ndownsizing everything--their operations generally--the Fed's costs were \nsteadily increasing. All over the country we have had banks, in order \nto be competitive on an international basis, consolidating. There have \nbeen cutbacks.\n  I know and the Presiding Officer knows that in my State and his \nState, there have been banking employees who have lost their jobs \nbecause of downsizing. Not with the Fed. I say not only commercial \nbanks are downsizing, the Federal Government is downsizing. While all \nthis has been going on, the Fed has been upsizing.\n  But prior to this study, we did not know that. I think it is clear \nfrom the GAO report that poor internal management and questionable \nspending practices are the order of the day at the Fed.\n  Personnel benefits vary, travel reimbursement varies, procurement and \ncontracting practices are not always done on a competitive basis. \nIndeed, the report raises questions of favoritism and conflict of \ninterest.\n  Again, the bigger issue is whether the taxpayers are getting the most \ncost-effective use of their money. I think the answer is clearly no.\n  Again, there were rapidly increasing expenditures between 1988 and \n1994. Personnel compensation increased by some 54 percent. Equipment \nand software expenditures increased by 85 percent. Building \nexpenditures increased by 34 percent. Again, travel expenses increased \nby 66 percent. There is very little incentive to keep these \nexpenditures under control; in fact, in most places, none. The Fed is \nnot subject to the same cost reduction pressures that are affecting \nboth public agencies and private sector firms, and I believe they \nshould be.\n  I repeat, Mr. President, I am not here today to belabor fiscal policy \nset by the Fed. Others have done that. I want to talk about the 93 \npercent of the money that they spend that has nothing to do with \nsetting monetary policy. And that 93 percent we should have some \ncontrol over. There should be appropriated moneys for the 93 percent. \nThey should fund their operation and their expenses from current \nrevenue.\n\n  They are not subject to the same cost reduction pressures that affect \nboth public agencies and private-sector firms.\n  If there were ever an example of a Federal agency, an activity of the \nFederal Government--call this organization whatever it might be--that \nneeded some sunlight, this is an organization that needs some sunlight.\n  The Fed is not funded through congressional appropriations, so we \nreally have no idea how much they are spending, and on what. We only \nhave large categories. Also, unlike private firms, the Fed does not \nhave a profit incentive to lower costs and increase efficiency.\n  What about the $3.7 billion slush fund? The Fed is part Government \nagency, part private bank. Its primary mission is to support a stable \neconomy, not to make a profit. However, the profits generated by the \nsystem are to be returned to the taxpayers. Over the years the Fed has \npocketed away $3.7 billion in taxpayer money.\n  Mr. President, take for example--and I have come to this floor and \ncriticized the budget that the majority has pushed forward on a number \nof issues. But the one area I have talked about a lot is what is \nhappening to our National Park System. If we had $1 billion in our \ngreat national Treasury, we could take the gems that we have set up \naround the United States in the National Park System--we only have one \nin Nevada; but the State of Arizona has a number, the State of Utah has \na significant number, Western States have a number of parks--we could \nreplenish, refurbish those parks. We are closing certain parts of our \npark system to visitors because we cannot maintain them. We need more \nmoney. We could take part of this $3.7 billion and replenish our park \nsystems, refurbish them, modernize them.\n  That is only one example, out of scores we could use, where this \nmoney could be used, rather than there in a so-called rainy-day fund \nthat Mr. Greenspan and others have set up.\n  The Fed claims this quietly held fund is necessary to cover system \nlosses. But as I have said before, in 79 years the Fed has never \noperated at a loss. It cannot because that is how they operate. The \nsurplus increased 79 percent in the 1988-94 period. At the very least, \nthe taxpayers have a right to have this returned to the Treasury.\n  We continually hear encouragement from the financial markets to reach \na balanced budget agreement. And we should do that. If the budget \nnegotiators had this money, we could certainly make $3.7 billion \nprogress in that direction.\n  So I conclude, Mr. President, by saying that the Senate is endowed \nwith this tremendous responsibility that we have in the nomination \nprocess.\n  If the reports we are now receiving concerned activities at a cabinet \nagency, that they had a $3.7 billion slush fund, that their travel \nexpenses have increased 66 percent, that there were 120 people making \nmore money than the President of the United States, and on and on, with \nthe questions that I have raised today, we would be real upset at that \ncabinet officer.\n  We should be also upset with Chairman Greenspan because the reports \nwe are receiving now concerning activities at the Fed show that there \nis tremendous mismanagement taking place. There needs to be more \noversight.\n  What we are doing today is being asked to reappoint an individual \nwho, in my opinion, is under a cloud. I believe that the burden is on \nthe nominee to come forth, address these issues, address them squarely, \nand provide this body with a full and satisfactory response.\n  Again, I recognize the awesome responsibility we have. I understand \nthe importance of this position. I know the nomination has been sent \nforward by the President of my own party. But in good conscience, I \ncannot vote to confirm Alan Greenspan. I think there are too many \nproblems. I believe, Mr. President, that the Fed needs to be looked at \nwith a microscope.\n  We did not look at them with anything. They are running amok. They \nhave no guidance or supervision from the Congress. We should \nappropriate that 93 percent, the moneys they use every year to operate. \nThere is no reason they cannot be as fiscally sound in\n\n[[Page S6284]]\n\nmanagement policy as they are asking the rest of the country to be. Mr. \nPresident, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6281-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6284-S6294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                FLAG DAY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it was 219 years ago today that the \nContinental Congress formally designated June 14 as Flag Day. So, \ntoday, we recognize this anniversary of Flag Day, going back to the \ntime when, as I say, the Continental Congress formally designated the \nStars and Stripes as the flag of our country. We honor the symbol of \nthe Nation when we honor the flag.\n  In these days of new-fashioned values and new-fangled technology, we \nmost often forget the old-fashioned patriotism that made this country \ngreat.\n  We are a vast nation and we glibly speak of our form of government as \na democracy. It would be impossible for a government of a nation that \nis so sprawling as is the United States of America to be a democracy in \nthe raw and purest sense. This is a republic, a republic. We pride \nourselves on our democratic processes but we loosely, very loosely talk \nof ours as a democracy. It is a republic. And there is a difference.\n  We are a vast nation, becoming more and more diverse in population, \nlanguage and custom with each passing year, and we would do well to \nremember often and salute one of our greatest unifying standards, the \nStars and Stripes, the American flag.\n  I have not heard anyone speak of this as Flag Day on the floor today. \nThere may have been someone who has addressed the subject already. I \nwould be very pleased to find that to have been the case. I hope that \neveryone will display our flag throughout the weekend and remember all \nthat flag means, remember all that it has meant to generations of \nAmericans who have fought and bled and died so that the rest of us can \nenjoy freedom.\n  Freedom, unfortunately, cannot be entirely inherited by a nation or a \npeople, any more than children can fully inherit knowledge and courage \nfrom their parents. Each generation must learn to understand and to \nrededicate itself to the pursuit of freedom. That is one reason why \nFlag Day is so important--why all of our national holidays should be \nemphasized. We must, most certainly, halt in our confident strides \ntoward the future and take a long and serious look at the core of our \nbeliefs. When we show to our neighbors and our friends that we believe \nin America--that we are active citizens and proud of the fact that we \nhave been so blessed--we perpetuate our core principles and solidify \nour unity as a nation.\n  So, today I would hope that we would be a little old-fashioned, and \nrededicate ourselves to freedom and to the glorious red, white and blue \nthat, no matter how sophisticated we all may think we have become, \nshould always make our hearts pound and put that lump in our throats as \nthat flag goes by.\n  No, we have become too new-fashioned, sophisticated, forgetting that \nwhen we came into this world we came emptyhanded and when we leave this \nworld we will leave it emptyhanded.\n  Alexander conquered the then-known world, but he left it emptyhanded. \nThere is the story that he was buried in a coffin with his hands \nhanging outside the coffin to demonstrate that one leaves the world, no \nmatter how much of it he has conquered, how successful he has been, how \nprosperous he was blessed to become--when he leaves the world he leaves \nit emptyhanded.\n  So, with all of our thin veneer of sophistication, it might be well \nto pause and reflect upon the fact that when we leave this world we \nwill leave it emptyhanded. And it is good, sometimes, for Senators to \nremember that when they leave this Chamber for the last time they will \nbe remembered for about 10 days. I have been around here a long time. I \nhave seen men and women come and go, great in their prime, they \nthought--and others thought--but soon forgotten.\n  So I like to do things the old-fashioned way and I like to remember \nthe flag in the old-fashioned way. So let us, today, rededicate \nourselves to an appreciation for and a respect for the Stars and \nStripes.\n  When Americans look at their flag, if they stop and think, they see \nall that is dear to their hearts about America. They think of the \nheroes who shed their blood for our country. They think of Nathan Hale, \nwho was executed as a spy in the year 1776, who regretted that he had \nonly one life to give to his country.\n  They think of John Paul Jones; of James Lawrence, who said, ``Don't \ngive up the ship.''\n  They think of Francis Marion the ``Swamp Fox,'' Nathanael Greene, \nGeorge Washington at Valley Forge.\n  They think of all those men and women down through the array of \ndecades who gave everything, gave their lives, who sacrificed for our \ncountry. When they see that flag, oh, it is just a piece of cloth, a \nbunting, but it is far more. It represents the history of this \nRepublic. It is older than the Republic itself: Flag Day, dating back, \nas I say, to the year 1777, 10 years before the Constitution was \nwritten, which established this Republic.\n  They think of all that is good and noble and great about this country \nwhen they see that flag. They should think of it. It should remind us \nof this country's glorious history, of the good deeds that America has \nperformed, of how she has shared her wealth, her treasure, her blood \nthat others might have freedom.\n  And wherever they may travel, whatever ocean or sea they may cross, \nthe sight of that symbol--the red, the white, the blue--our flag, \nbrings to the heart the thoughts of home.\n  That flag is the symbol of all of the dreams that we have had and \nthat we may have about America. Let us remember it on this Flag Day--\nthe symbol of America the Beautiful.\n  Henry Van Dyke said it best in his poem: ``America for Me'':\n\n     'Tis fine to see the Old World, and travel up and down,\n     Among the famous palaces and cities of renown,\n     To admire the crumbly castles and the statues of the kings,--\n     But now I think I've had enough of antiquated things.\n\n     So it's home again, and home again, America for me!\n     My heart is turning home again, and there I long to be\n     In the land of youth and freedom beyond the ocean bars,\n     Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of \n           stars.\n\n     Oh, London is a man's town, there's power in the air;\n     And Paris is a woman's town, with flowers in her hair;\n     And it's sweet to dream in Venice, and it's great to study \n           Rome;\n     But when it comes to living, there is no place like home.\n\n     I like the German fir-woods, in green battalions drilled;\n     I like the gardens of Versailles with flashing fountains \n           filled;\n     But, oh, to take your hand, my dear, and ramble for a day\n     In the friendly western woodland where Nature has her way!\n\n     I know that Europe's wonderful, yet something seems to lack!\n     The Past is too much with her, and the people looking back.\n     But the glory of the Present is to make the Future free,--\n     We love our land for what she is and what she is to be.\n\n     Oh, it's home again, and home again, America for me!\n     I want a ship that's westward bound to plough the rolling \n           sea,\n     To the blessed land of Room Enough beyond the ocean bars,\n     Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of \n           stars.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6285]]\n\n\n\nNOMINATION OF ALAN GREENSPAN, OF NEW YORK, TO BE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD \n               OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the nomination.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me begin by commending my good friend, \nthe Senator from Nevada, Senator Reid, for his diligence and hard work \nin examining the Federal Reserve's operations. Senator Reid has worked \nwith the GAO to look into the Federal Reserve's business practices.\n  Some startling examinations have been uncovered because of the \nefforts of Senator Reid and Senator Dorgan. I must say the information \nthat they have uncovered is startling. I urge my colleagues to \ncarefully review all that the Senator from Nevada has said today, both \nregarding the nomination before us and the logic of considering future \nlegislation that might go to these questions.\n  Massive management lapses appear to be going on--accounting errors, \nexcessive costs of operation, a multibillion dollar slush fund and \nother oversights. There are many, many important questions that \nSenators Reid and Dorgan have uncovered, with the GAO's help. They are \nto be commended for asking the GAO for this investigation.\n  As I said the other day, Mr. President, the Federal Reserve is not a \nseparate branch of Government like the executive branch or the \njudiciary. But even so, we have the power of the purse strings. Even if \nthe executive branch squanders money, and things like that, we look at \nit. We have hearings. We look into that and we take action.\n  We should also do that with the Federal Reserve. I will not stand \nhere and say that all of the items uncovered by the GAO are something \nthat requires us to take a certain action right now. But certainly they \nwarrant further investigation. I hope that we will fulfill our \nobligations to follow through on those GAO reports. We will be having \nmore to say about that next week, to look at the operations of the \nFederal Reserve and perhaps make some changes in the law on how the \nFederal Reserve operates.\n  Again, I repeat, the Federal Reserve System is a creature of \nCongress. It exists only because Congress enacted a law to erect a \nFederal Reserve System. Obviously, Congress has the right, the power, \nthe duty and the obligation to change and alter that law to fit \ndifferent times and circumstances or to make the Federal Reserve, I \nbelieve, more accountable to the American people.\n  So I just want to commend Senator Reid for his diligent work in this \narea.\n  Mr. President, I rise on the second day of debate on the nomination \nof Alan Greenspan as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. As I have \nsaid many times, this is a critically important nomination that \ndeserves the Senate's full consideration. The Federal Reserve Chairman \nis widely recognized to be the single most important economic decision \nmaker in the country--let me repeat that--the single most important \ndecision maker, in terms of our economy, more important than the \nPresident, more important than 535 Members of Congress.\n  It is the obligation and the duty of this body to thoroughly review \nand debate the record and policies of any nominee to this vital post.\n  We started this 3-day debate yesterday. At that time, I outlined my \nconcerns about the record of Alan Greenspan, both as Chairman of the \nCouncil of Economic Advisers in the 1970's and as Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve from 1987 to the present time.\n  As I said yesterday, this is not about personalities. It is about \npolicies. It is about laying the facts on the table and taking an \nobjective view of the Greenspan record. This debate is not really about \none man; it is about a much larger issue that touches the lives of \nevery American family.\n  Yes, there are a lot of complicated economic terms and intricate \nstatistics and charts that we have talked about and that we will talk \nabout some more. But we should not get lost in the complexities.\n\n  Perhaps one of the reasons we do not debate more often than we do \neconomic policy and Federal Reserve policies and nominations that come \nto the Board, and their views, is because economics is, as they say, \nthe dismal science. Sometimes it is hard to cut through all of the data \nand charts and the statistics.\n  But, again, when you strip it all away, strip away the complexities, \nit boils down really to this. When you get to the heart of it, what we \nare really talking about is very simple, fundamental things. We are \ntalking about real people, individuals and their families, trying to \nmake a payment on their house, or trying to buy a house, trying to buy \na new car, families trying to work with their bank to get the funds to \nput in next year's crop, if they are farmers, or maybe to get a loan to \noperate their small business for next year.\n  That is what this debate is about. It is about wages, about how much \nwill our working people make in the next year? It is about families. \nThat is why we are having this debate. That is why I insisted on this \ndebate. This debate is about raising the living standards and real \nwages of hard-working Americans. That, I believe, stands as our primary \neconomic challenge.\n  But the policy of the Federal Reserve under Chairman Greenspan has \nstood in the way. Under current law, the Federal Reserve is obligated \nto conduct a balanced monetary policy so as to reconcile reasonable \nprice stability with full employment and strong, stable economic \ngrowth. But the Federal Reserve, led by Mr. Greenspan, job growth and \nthe living standards of average Americans have been sacrificed in the \nblind pursuit of inflation control. The Greenspan Fed has raised \ninterest rates, not when inflation was at the door, but when it did not \neven threaten. In 1994, in the midst of seven straight interest-rate \nincreases, Chairman Greenspan himself acknowledged there was little \nevidence of rising inflation.\n  Mr. President, the decisions of a Fed Chairman affect every \npocketbook and every family budget in America. The decisions of this \nChairman have cost American families lost income, lost opportunities.\n  The essential fundamental question I believe boils down to this: Why \nwill Alan Greenspan not give working families a raise? That is really \nwhat it boils down to. The Greenspan Fed has stifled economic growth \nand the incomes of average Americans. Interest rates have been kept \nartificially high and middle-class families and businesses have been \nforced to pay the price. It is time for the Federal Reserve to pursue a \nmore balanced policy based on raising economic growth and increasing \njobs, alongside continued vigilance against inflation.\n  America ought to have a forward-looking Fed Chairman who recognizes \nthe importance of expanding opportunities for our economy and our \npeople in today's global market. We need strong leadership, committed \nto higher growth and incomes, fuller employment, and lower, more stable \ninterest rates to improve the quality of life for average Americans.\n  We have not gotten that with Mr. Greenspan. There is what I call a \ncommon thread in the thinking and the actions and the policies of Mr. \nGreenspan over the years. It did not start yesterday. It will not end \ntomorrow or next week. Ripe from his days as chairman of the Counsel of \nEconomic Advisers up to today, Mr. Greenspan has consistently shown the \nsame two tendencies: First, he often misjudges the signs of an oncoming \nrecession; second, he does not act decisively enough to pull the \neconomy out of the recession because of his fear of inflation. The \nbottom line is that Chairman Greenspan has a long history of focusing \nsolely on inflation to such an extent that all focus on expanding our \neconomy has been lost.\n  The mindset today is that 2 percent growth is acceptable, the economy \ncannot grow any faster, maybe 2.5 percent at the maximum, but we cannot \nhave the 3 percent growth of the 1970's or the 4 percent growth of the \n1960's. That is the mindset. I ask, why? What is wrong with America? Is \nproductivity going up? Are people working harder than ever? We are \ngetting new products on the markets, the information revolution has hit \nus all over this country. We have all kinds of new inventions and \ndevices, labor saving devices, not to mention pharmaceuticals and drugs \nto help make our lives better. We have the information revolution, \ncomputers, even in education--all of this lending\n\n[[Page S6286]]\n\nitself to a robust America, ready to go. That is the America I see out \nthere, an America that wants to work, that wants to grow, that wants to \ngive families a better deal, that wants to raise the wages of our \nworking families, yes, that wants to reduce unemployment. That is the \nAmerica that is out there.\n  If this harness is kept on by the strict monetary policies of the \nFederal Reserve, that inherent ability of America to grow will be \nstifled. Thus, I say that what is happening at the Fed is a disservice \nto all of America, to us in our generation and certainly to the next \nand future generations who require our economy to grow for their \neducation, for their livelihood, and for their jobs in the next century \nand beyond.\n  Yesterday, I had an opportunity to explore in detail much of Mr. \nGreenspan's previous labor. I displayed a chart that showed Mr. \nGreenspan's record as Chairman as compared to others. It is dubious, at \nbest. I went back to the Fed Chairman Mr. McCabe from 1948 to 1951, \nWilliam McCheseny Martin, Mr. Burns, Mr. Miller, Mr. Volcker and now \nMr. Greenspan. I pointed out our real growth in the country during \ntheir terms. You see 6.1 percent, 3.6 percent, 3.3 percent, 4.5 \npercent; and it is lower under Volcker, 2.5 percent, and under \nGreenspan, 2.2 percent. Looking at Mr. Volcker, he came in facing a \n13.2 inflation rate before he started, and he cut it in half during his \nterm. In bringing that down, we had a low growth rate, but still, it \nwas 2.5 percent. Look at Mr. Greenspan, inflation before he came in was \n4.1 percent, lower than almost at any time in any of these previous \ntenures. He has only reduced inflation to 3.2 percent--about 25 \npercent. Mr. Volcker cut it in half. Look at Mr. Greenspan's growth \nrate--2.2 percent.\n  Using a comparison analysis, Mr. Greenspan's stewardship at the Fed \nis lacking, compared to those who came before him. That 2.2 percent \ngrowth rate is abysmal when you look at the growth rates under previous \nChairmen. If he had high inflation rate and then cut it in half, maybe \nyou could accept low growth. But I find it difficult to accept this low \nof a growth rate with minimal reductions in inflation--4.1 percent to \n3.2 percent. Look at how Greenspan compares to the past.\n\n  I said yesterday, people say, ``Well, our economy has matured. We \ncannot grow like we did in the 1950's or 1960's or 1970's. We cannot \ngrow at that rate anymore.'' The recent efforts of the Federal Reserve \nhave reminded me of the invention of the wheel. The people who invented \nthe wheel they probably said, ``We have the wheel. We do not need \nanything else.'' I bet they were happy with the wheel, and they thought \nthat was the best thing, and they thought they did not need anything \nelse.\n  Those who say that America's economy has matured and we cannot grow \nat this rate I believe are saying the same thing. It reminds me of the \nperson who once said, maybe the head of the Patent Office said, \n``Everything that can be invented has been invented. There will not be \nany new inventions.'' That was about 80 or 90 years ago. Well, our \neconomy can grow a lot faster. That is why we are having this debate. \nWe can bring more people into the labor force.\n  In addition, I also discussed yesterday Mr. Greenspan's misguided and \nill-advised policy recommendations to President Ford that deepened our \ncountry's recession in the mid-1970's. The record shows Mr. Greenspan \ncost jobs and further weakened our economy. I also discussed Mr. \nGreenspan's forecasting record as a private economist in the early \n1980's. As I pointed out yesterday, he was wrong on inflation. He was \nwrong on interest rates. He was wrong on bond issues. Then chairman of \nthe Banking Committee, Senator Riegle, pointed out in Mr. Greenspan's \n1987 confirmation hearings:\n\n       You had an opportunity to be a forecaster with Greenspan \n     and O'Neil. As you know, you put your forecast to a direct \n     test in the private sector. The fact is that the firm only \n     survived a few years.\n\n  And according to a Forbes article of April 20, 1987, in 1985, his \nfull first full year of business, O'Neil and Greenspan turned in one of \nthe least impressive records of all pension funds advisers.\n  In 1990, Mr. Greenspan was again way off in his economic forecasts, \nas I pointed that out yesterday. On October 2, 1990, at an Open Market \nCommittee hearing meeting, Mr. Greenspan had this to say is from the \nminutes of that meeting.\n\n       I still think we're in a situation in which there are \n     forecasts of thunderstorms, and everyone is saying, ``Well, \n     the thunder has occurred and the lightning has occurred and \n     it's raining,'' but nobody has stuck his hand out the window. \n     And the point is, it isn't raining. The point is, as best I \n     can judge, that the third quarter GNP figures in the green \n     book are not phony. I think they are relatively hard numbers. \n     They can get revised. They are put down more and more, but \n     the economy has not yet slipped into a recession.\n\n  Now, that was in October 1990.\n  I want to note that the recession began in July 1990--a month before \nIraq invaded Kuwait. Yet, in October, Mr. Greenspan was still saying it \nis not raining out. I want to note that Mr. Greenspan's forecast \nimproved after that. On December 18, 1990, Mr. Greenspan said \nconfidently, ``At some point, we are going to come out of this.'' So \nbetween October 2 and December 18, Mr. Greenspan found out it really \nwas raining, but it was much too late. He said, ``At some point, we are \ngoing to come out of this.'' He was right. The recession officially \nended in March 1991. So, Mr. President, that is the record. Those are \nthe facts.\n  Today, I want to focus on a few more important aspects of the \nGreenspan record. I will zero in on the Greenspan rate increases of \n1990 and 1994. First of all, I think I am going to refer to this now, \nand then I will come back to it later. Many times, I talk to people and \nsay, ``Do you know that, in 1 year, from February 1994 to February \n1995, Mr. Greenspan had seven rate increases in the Federal funds rate? \nHe raised those interest rates 100 percent.'' People look at me like I \ncame from another planet. They say, ``No, of course not, nobody raises \ninterest rates 100 percent.'' I said, ``Yes, he did.''\n  Mr. President, here are the figures. In February 1994, the Federal \nfunds rate was 3 percent; in February 1995, 6 percent. Well, that is \n100 percent. It is a doubling any way you look at it. That was in 1 \nyear, from February 1994 to February 1995. From February 1995 until \ntoday--we are talking about almost 16 months--what has happened? \nInterest rates have only come down three-quarters of a point, to 5.25. \nThat is still way higher than they were in February 1994. This is what \nis causing the stagnation in America and what is causing wages to be \nstagnant. This is what is causing the slow growth in our economy.\n  I want to spend a little more time, also, discussing unemployment, \nsomething called the nonaccelerating inflationary rate of unemployment, \nor NAIRU. Perhaps this is one of the reasons nobody wants to debate \neconomic policy. You get these kinds of terms--NAIRU.\n  Let us discuss NAIRU and see if we can strip away all the fancy talk \nand see what it is all about. Let us begin with the words of Robert \nEisner, a former president of the American Economics Association, when \nhe said, ``Neither the fiscal stimulus of structural budget deficits, \nnor the monetary stimulus directed at reducing unemployment in the \nUnited States have yet caused permanently accelerating inflation, or \nmuch inflation at all.''\n  I am going to repeat that. ``Neither the fiscal stimulus of \nstructural budget deficits, nor the monetary stimulus directed at \nreducing unemployment in the United States have yet caused permanently \naccelerating inflation, or much inflation at all. Most of the inflation \nof the postwar period has come from supply shocks--chiefly, the great \nrun-up of petroleum prices in the 1970's and early 1980's.''\n  Now, we talked about this nonaccelerating inflation rate of \nunemployment. That means that, well, if you bring unemployment down too \nfar, then employers will have to bid up the wages. By bidding up the \nwages, that will cause price increases because they have to pay higher \nwages, and that causes a round of inflation. Many economists simply do \nnot agree with that. That is what Mr. Eisner is saying. He is saying, \nnothing that monetary policy has done to reduce unemployment has \npermanently caused accelerating inflation. I believe Mr. Eisner is \nright. But that fear of inflation is the driving force of the Federal \nReserve today, and, particularly, Mr. Greenspan.\n\n[[Page S6287]]\n\n  He has become ``Mr. Chairman Slow Growth,'' ``Chairman Stagnant \nWages,'' and ``Chairman Unemployment Is Good for America.'' Mr. \nGreenspan has an economic philosophy that simply does not focus on the \nproblems of average people. We are seeing an interesting pattern at the \nmoment. The 30-year bond, and many other interest rates, have been \nrising for several weeks, and many bond market leaders have been \nwringing their hands about the possibility of rising inflation. But the \neconomy, at this moment, does not give much indication of accelerating \ninflation.\n\n  Our economy can be much more vibrant without the threat of inflation. \nIt can expand. Unlike Chairman Greenspan, I do not see that as a bad \nthing to be stopped. Our economy ought to expand and grow, and \nunemployment ought to come down and, yes, wages ought to go up.\n  Some people talk about a 4-percent growth for the quarter that we are \nin right now. Well, it initially came out that we had a 2.8 percent \ngrowth for the first quarter of this year. All the articles said that \nwas incredible, booming growth, 2.8-percent. It was later revised to \n2.3 percent. I do not think that is booming growth at all. I am told \nmost economists see growth in the second half of the year at a far \nslower pace.\n  I am going to paint with the same brush both the administration and \nthe Federal Reserve. I believe the administration is accepting too low \na growth rate, a bit over 2 percent. I believe that has been fostered \nand bolstered by the Federal Reserve, which also sees growth at around \n2 percent.\n  Here we are, Mr. President, 348,000 jobs were created last month when \nhalf a million started to look for work, showing that our work force \ncan indeed grow. As you said, we are straining. It is out there. People \nwant to work. Productivity is going up. We want to get out there and \nwork. But despite this kind of good economic news--that is, that more \npeople are looking for work and that our economy is going to grow a \nlittle bit--we continue to hear the drumbeat of gloom and doom from the \nFederal Reserve and from the barons of the bond market.\n  Now, again, I suppose that maybe Mr. Greenspan himself, and his \nsupporters, would say he does not have a choice. If the Federal Reserve \ndoes not raise interest rates, then the bond market will see that the \nFederal Reserve lacks the will to fight inflation, they will dump bonds \nand flee the market, and long-term interest rates will skyrocket. That \nis what they say. A lot of bond traders repeat that refrain. But I \npoint out that they repeat that refrain because of the actions taken by \nMr. Greenspan over the last several years.\n  Mr. President, I believe that a balanced Federal Reserve policy would \nnot see a long-term climb in bond rates--that is, if we had a balanced \npolicy. If that was reiterated and distinctly spelled out, I do not \nthink we would see a long-term climb in bond rates. You get the long-\nterm climb in bond rates because, if there is good news in the economy, \nthe bond traders rush in to dump the bonds because they believe that \nMr. Greenspan is going to slap on higher interest rates right away. \nThat is what they believe, so they react accordingly.\n  I know this may sound kind of confusing, but when you get right down \nto it, it is really, again, very simple. It has to do with whether or \nnot we will have a balanced policy of growth and low unemployment, \nalongside a policy of fighting inflation.\n  Let me read an article in the February 5 New York Times by Lewis \nUchitelli. He is talking about the Federal Reserve that voted to raise \ninterest rates when they did it for the seventh time in a year back in \n1995. In keeping interest rates high, he talked about how this speared \ninflation. He goes on to say,\n       In this ritualistic dialog between the Fed and the bond \n     market, which everyone pretends is not happening, the reason \n     for the Fed's existence is sometimes overlooked. Aside from \n     fighting inflation, the Fed's mission, specified by Congress, \n     is to keep the economy growing and Americans employed. That \n     goal can get lost in any dialog with the bond market, which \n     puts slowing the economy to fight inflation ahead of putting \n     the unemployed to work.\n\n  There you have it. You cannot say it any better than that. Yet, \nCongress has stipulated in law that the Federal Reserve is to also \nfight unemployment and to take that into account.\n  We have a bill in the Banking Committee that would take out of the \nlaw the provision that says the Fed should take into account \nunemployment in making its decisions and should only then look at \ninflation. Well, it is before committee, but I do not think it will get \npast the floor.\n  Mr. Greenspan has indicated support for that approach. He has \nindicated support for legislation that would take out of the law a \nrequirement that the Fed look at unemployment in making its decisions. \nWell, again, I talk about his mindset and his philosophy--his economic \nphilosophy. I do not believe anybody ought to be Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve who supports a policy of ignoring unemployment and only \nfocusing on inflation in setting their policy.\n  I would like to read a short statement again from the business sector \nof our country, a statement by the National Association of \nManufacturers. The first was on June 11, 1996. This is 5 days ago. This \nis from the National Association of Manufacturers:\n\n       The decline in producer prices, after several months of \n     rapid increases, confirms that inflation is not a threat. The \n     spike in wholesale prices during the first 5 months of 1996 \n     was caused mainly by the relative price of energy. Excluding \n     the volatile food and energy components, the core rate of \n     inflation was consistently lower.\n       Some energy prices, such as gasoline, are now leveling off \n     while others, such as heating oil, are declining. Energy \n     prices should decline even more later in the year as Iraqi \n     oil comes onto the market. This decline will put downward \n     pressure on both the producer and consumer price indexes in \n     coming months. For the year as a whole, producer prices \n     should rise only about 2.8 percent.\n       These favorable inflation numbers mean that the Federal \n     Reserve has no reason to raise interest rates at their July \n     meeting. The Federal Reserve should hold rates where they are \n     and reserve the option of lowering later in the year.\n\n  Yet, we have heard all kinds of hints and comments made by members of \nthe Federal Reserve that, indeed, rates will go up in July.\n  A group called the Business Council, a group of chief executives of \n100 of the largest corporations in our Nation, did a recent survey \nwhich is reported in the May 18 New York Times. Nearly half of them \nstated that it was harder to raise prices in their industry than it was \n6 months ago. Only 9 percent said it was easier. So over half of them \nsaid it was harder to raise prices.\n  Almost all of the respondents urged the Federal Reserve to stimulate \nthe economy by lowering rates. The article quoted John Walsh, the CEO \nof the General Electric Co., as saying: ``We do not see industrial \nprices or labor pressures driving inflation upward.''\n  Mr. Greenspan did not see the terrible recession and skyrocketing \nunemployment in late 1974 as he advocated fiscal restraint as President \nFord's chief economic adviser. Mr. Greenspan did not see the recession \nin 1990. And what did Mr. Greenspan see? He saw inflation in some tea \nleaves in 1994 when he doubled the interest rates from 3 percent to 6 \npercent in one year. From February 1994 to February 1995, he doubled \nthe interest rates. Low inflation. He so indicated that himself.\n  Is this the balanced kind of approach that we want from a Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve? I say no. We need someone who has more of a \nbalanced approach. We need someone who will give the economy a chance \nto grow, who will give Americans a chance to increase their incomes so \nas to have a better life.\n  If inflation starts to rise, then, yes, it is responsible to raise \nrates and do it in a timely and effective manner. But America does not \nneed a low growth Chairman of the Fed who slams his foot on the \neconomic brakes because of some mirage of inflation that may take place \nin the future.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to revisit the topic of Mr. Greenspan's \nactions concerning the 1990 recession. I spoke about that yesterday. I \nspoke about it earlier, when in October 1990, as the minutes now \nreveal, because--again, I want to point this out. By law, the minutes \nof the Federal Open Market Committee are kept sealed for 5 years. I \nhope we can revisit that at some time. I do not believe they should be \nsealed for 5 years--maybe a year, but certainly not 5 years. But now, \nin looking at the minutes of the 1990 meeting of the FOMC, we find in \nOctober Mr.\n\n[[Page S6288]]\n\nGreenspan saying that--well, to paraphrase it: ``We hear the thunder, \nwe hear the lightning. People say there is thunder and lighting, but we \nstuck our hand out the window and it is not raining,'' in response to \nwhether or not we are in a recession.\n  The fact is, the recession started in July 1990. This is October \n1990. Mr. Greenspan says we are not in a recession. It was not until \nDecember 1990 that Mr. Greenspan finally admitted, 6 months later, that \nwe were in a recession.\n\n  So we had the recession of 1990. Mr. Greenspan finally recognized it. \nHis response, ``Well, sometime we will come out of it.'' How does the \nrecovery from that recession compare to the other recessions that we \nhave had since the end of World War II? The Greenspan Fed was very late \nin moving to lower interest rates to create a more accommodating policy \nand lift us out of that recession, and that was harmful to the \nrecovery.\n  This is a pretty busy chart. Again, maybe this is one of the reasons \nwe do not engage in economic policy discussion around here more, \nbecause sometimes it does get confusing. But, again, it is really \nsimple when you strip it away. What this chart shows is the percent \ndecline in interest rates following the bottom of a recession. In other \nwords, you get into a recession, you cut interest rates to stimulate \nthe economy, and get out of the recession.\n  How fast do you cut the interest rates to get out of a recession? \nHere we see that, in the recessions of 1960, 1969, 1957, 1973, and \n1981, we see dramatic drops in interest rates to get us out of those \nrecessions. For example, in the 1957 recession interest rates declined \nby 50 percent in 5 months--5 months. Here is 1973. In 1960 there was a \n50 percent decline in about 12 months; the same in 1981. In all these \ntimes we came out of a recession in a fairly short period of time. Why? \nBecause the Fed Chairmen took action to stimulate the economy, get our \npeople back to work, reduce unemployment, and get us out of the \nrecession.\n  Let us look at the recession of 1990. That is this flat line over \nhere. We do not get a 50 percent cut in interest rates until almost 34 \nmonths, almost 3 years after the depth of that recession. So, again, I \nhave been comparing Mr. Greenspan's actions with those of other Fed \nChairmen since World War II. I compared earlier GDP growth. Now I am \ncomparing his actions recovering from a recession, compared to other \ntimes. It was too slow, too timid, too much of a struggle, to get out \nof that recession. It is too long a period of time. And what that means \nis that families are hurt, people are unemployed, and the economy \nstarts building in a slower rate of growth than what we otherwise need. \nI believe that is also what is affecting us even yet today. So, you can \nsee he was much too timid in reducing those interest rates.\n  Let me read an article by the Nobel laureate economist, Paul \nSamuelson, who is a professor at MIT. It appeared in the September 1993 \nissue of ``Challenge'' magazine. It is titled ``Leaning Against What \nInflationary Wind?''\n\n       The U.S. economy is not on the verge of overheating at \n     present. If and when the changes, it will be a good time to \n     pump gently on the brakes. That time is not now.\n\n  Mr. Samuelson goes on to say:\n\n       After a dozen years of structural budget deficits and low \n     private sector saving by U.S. families and corporations, \n     economic history and economic science concur in the diagnosis \n     that monetary policy rather than fiscal policy should be the \n     major macroeconomic weapon for assuring a healthy 1993-96 \n     recovery and for restoring the share of capital formation in \n     the American economy.\n\n  I will repeat that. What Mr. Samuelson is saying is that monetary \npolicy has to be the engine, rather than fiscal policy. Why? Because we \nhave these huge budget deficits. There is little we can do. And we have \nyears of low savings rates. We do not have that pool to draw on. So it \nhas to be monetary policy.\n  Mr. Samuelson goes on to say.\n\n       The last five years will go down in the textbooks of \n     economic history as a period of disappointing performances by \n     central banks. America's central bank, the Federal Reserve, \n     began the decade of the 1980s with a stellar report card. \n     Under Chairman Paul Volcker, from 1979 to 1982, remarkable \n     progress was made in wringing out of our economy the double-\n     digit stagflation that had built up in the 1970s. Then in \n     1982 and 1983, as I shall describe for its peculiar relevance \n     today, the Fed fires up the American locomotive in a prudent \n     way, leading the United States and the global economies into \n     a needed expansion.\n\n  What Mr. Samuelson is saying, basically, is that--he says--he talks \nabout the Bundesbank.\n\n       In particular, the revered Bundesbank has brought on \n     unified Germany a serious recession that it never expected to \n     occur. Outside of Germany, directly and indirectly, the bias \n     of the Bundesbank toward preoccupation with inflation to the \n     neglect of real growth and unemployment has led to a lasting \n     slump for Common Market and other European countries. In the \n     end, the dream of a Maastricht Treaty that would unify the \n     European economy was dashed by Bundesbank intransigence. \n     Unemployment rates in Spain, Italy, and Ireland soared. \n     Waiting upon the German credit expansion that never came, \n     Britain, Italy, and Spain were forced out of the European \n     Monetary Union. Countries like France that accommodated the \n     Bundesbank have been penalized by double-digit unemployment \n     rates. Sweden, with its interest rate forced temporarily up \n     to a 500 percent annual rate in order to have the Kroner look \n     the Mark in the eye, is a spectacle no sage ever expected to \n     see again in the modern world. . . .\n       Where an Italy or a Spain face genuine international \n     constraints, Japan's wounds have been self-inflicted and \n     gratuitous. And in wounding herself, Japan has also wounded \n     the U.S. bilateral imbalance with Japan, contributing \n     significantly to the puny 0.7 of 1 percent annual rate of \n     American real GDP growth in the 1993 first quarter. Where it \n     not for involuntary piling up of inventory accumulation, our \n     final real GDP would actually have been declining in 1993's \n     first quarter.\n\n  I did not mean to get bogged down in that, but really what he is \ntalking about is he is talking about what the Bundesbank did in Germany \nin terms of focusing only on inflation and ignoring what is happening \nwith unemployment and growth. Then he goes on to say:\n\n       Alas, the Federal Reserve has shared in this central bank \n     saga of acting too little and too late against macroweakness \n     on Main Street, U.S.A. It can be said, soberly and with \n     statistical significance, that the defeat of George Bush in \n     1992 and the Republican disappointments in the Senate and the \n     House are the direct result of Federal Reserve misdiagnosis \n     of the seriousness of the 1990-92 state of U.S. demand.\n\n  Again, Main Street, USA, has not, in town meetings, given the Federal \nReserve such a mandate to do what they have done. Nor has a committee \nof the two Houses, nor a majority vote in either of the Houses. This is \nMr. Samuelson:\n\n       I believe this to be important not as a matter of history \n     or of general philosophy. It is important because the money \n     market has every reason to believe--even without leaks to the \n     press after Open Market Committee meetings--that this Federal \n     Reserve (the only one we have) is only too prone to (1) \n     engineer higher short-term interest rates, or (2) countenance \n     such higher rates (a) at the first signs of a healthy real \n     recovery--say, a 3.25 percent (annual) growth rate for two \n     successive quarters, or (b) at the first signs of some \n     acceleration of price-level indexes.\n\n  Mr. Samuelson, I think I said it correctly. Basically it is \nimportant, not as a matter of history or philosophy, it is important to \nAmerica because the Federal Reserve is prone to, No. 1, engineer higher \ninterest rates, or, No. 2, countenance such high interest rates at the \nfirst sign of a healthy recovery, if we go anywhere above--he said up \nto 3.25 percent, but it looks as if we go over 2.5 percent they are \nready to slam on the brakes.\n  (Mr. MACK assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the minority staff of the Joint Economic \nCommittee prepared some charts that I think are illustrative of what \nhas been wrong with Mr. Greenspan's leadership at the Federal Reserve.\n  The first chart simply shows the speed by which the Federal Reserve \nlowered rates. I already went over that chart. I am going to put that \nback up because it goes with these other charts.\n  Again, this first chart shows the speed at which the Federal Reserve \nreduces interest rates to get us out of recession. Going all the way \nback to 1957, the Fed acted very strongly to reduce interest rates. But \nin 1990, coming out of that recession, Chairman Greenspan did not act \ndecisively and, thus, interest rates stayed abnormally high.\n  Here is another chart. Let's see how fast the economy recovered. This \nis sort of the flip side of that last chart. This shows the growth of \npayroll employment from the bottom of the recession compared to those \nprevious years going back to World War II.\n  So here is the bottom of the recession; here is coming out of it. In \nthe previous seven recessions, we see employment gaining rapidly. In \nfact, the\n\n[[Page S6289]]\n\naverage of the past seven, in the first 2 years after the depth of a \nrecession, we have employment gains of over 7-percent growth.\n  What happened after the 1990 recession? Here is Mr. Greenspan: We had \nno growth, no growth for almost 13, 14 months; negative growth. And \nthen, finally, we came out a little bit, and after 24 months, we had \nabout 1 percent growth in employment coming out of that recession. \nAgain, my point being that Mr. Greenspan, first, did not recognize we \nwere in a recession; second, when it became apparent we were in a \nrecession, he acts too timidly to bring us out of that recession.\n  On the other hand, if inflation is threatening, the brakes are \nslammed on at the first sign of a hint of inflation, not real \ninflation, but the threat of inflation. But when it is jobs and \nunemployment, well, we can linger for a while. The result is a very \ndismal record in getting employment back up after a recession. One year \nafter a recession--1 year after a recession--basically no jobs at all.\n  The third chart that I have shows another related fact, change in the \nunemployment rate. In the other seven recessions, we see considerable \nimprovement in lowering unemployment, the proportion of the work force \nwithout jobs. That, unfortunately, was not the case for the 1990 \nrecession.\n  On average, for the seven recessions prior to 1990, the unemployment \nrate dropped about 20 percent off the rate at the end of each \nrecession, and we see that here. There was a tremendous reduction in \nunemployment in the last seven previous recessions.\n  What happened after the 1990 recession? Instead of going down, we \nwent the wrong direction. Unemployment actually went up. It came down a \nlittle bit and leveled off after a couple of years, but still not back \nat even the rate at which unemployment was at the height, or I should \nsay the depth, of the recession.\n  So we were going the wrong way. We had very little recovery at all. \nAgain, we need to have a balanced policy that says, ``My gosh, if we \nare going to recover from a recession, we have to reduce \nunemployment.'' We did in all the previous seven, but not in the one in \n1990. Again, my point being that Mr. Greenspan acted too timidly and \nnot in the right direction to get that unemployment down.\n  So now I return to where I started today, and that is the 1994-95 \nperiod. We have a recession. Mr. Greenspan does not act decisively \nenough. We linger with high unemployment, we linger with low growth, no \nnew jobs added, and then we come in to 1993, 1994, 1995.\n  It has been almost axiomatically accepted around here and in America \nthat if we lower the budget deficit, interest rates will come down. \nThat is almost like a mantra that we all enunciate all the time: ``If \nwe can reach a balanced budget, interest rates will come down and that \nwill save the American people a lot of money.'' ``Reduce that budget \ndeficit and we'll get the interest rates down.'' Well, OK.\n\n  In 1993, the first year of the Clinton administration, bold action \nwas taken to reduce the deficit. Now, you can argue about whether it \nwas a tax increase and all that. We can get into that, and we can \ndebate that, too. The fact is that the deficit started coming down. It \nstarted coming down--actually, I will even give President Bush credit--\nactually, the deficit started coming down in late 1992 and early 1993. \nPart of that had to do some with Bush and his policies; some of it had \nto do with the fact when Clinton came in, the President and the \nCongress started talking about a budget that would begin cutting the \ndeficit. Based on that, we thought interest rates would come down.\n  The budget was passed that year and started to go into effect in \nOctober 1993. So in October 1993, the budget that we passed went into \neffect. The deficit started to accelerate down. In 2 years, the deficit \nwas cut by over 40 percent in 2 years. It is now down--well, right now \nI can say compared to when Mr. Clinton came into office, the budget \ndeficit is about 60 percent less. The budget deficit is coming down. \nYou would think if the deficit is coming down, surely interest rates \nmust come down, too. But after passing the budget of 1993, we kept our \ndeficit coming down. Mr. Greenspan, in February of 1994, started \nraising interest rates seven times in one year, from 3 to 6 percent. As \nour deficit was coming down, Mr. Greenspan was raising our interest \nrates.\n  My point is that it is not axiomatic, it is not absolutely certain \nthat if we reach a balanced budget we will have lower interest rates. \nWe will have lower interest rates if, and only if, we have a Federal \nReserve System, and a Chairman, that will respond to those actions and \nreduce those interest rates as the deficit comes down.\n  Obviously, there have to be other factors. When I say that even if we \nhave a balanced budget and we have inflation that they should not raise \ninterest rates--of course not, the Federal Reserve should respond to \nthat. If we have inflation threatening, if inflation is there, yes, \nthey have to put on the brakes.\n  I am just saying in this period of time, we had no inflation \nthreatening, we had high rates of unemployment, underemployed people in \nAmerica, low wage growth, wage stagnation, we had a reducing deficit \nand we had a Chairman of the Fed raising interest rates. Please, \nsomebody explain that to me. It defies logic. It can only happen if the \nphilosophy that Fed Chairman has is that if he sees a mirage in the \ndistance of the threat of inflation, he must raise interest rates.\n  I believe that does our country a disservice because we have the \ncapacity to grow in America. We have the capacity to grow. We have \npeople who want to work. As I said, 348,000 jobs were created last \nmonth; but 500,000 people went out and looked for a job. People want to \ngo to work. Businesses want to expand. Just read the article from the \nNational Association of Manufacturers. Businesses want to expand. They \nwant to grow. But the policies of the Federal Reserve System is keeping \nthat from happening.\n  To truly understand the Fed's 1994 seven consecutive rate increases, \nwe have go back to the summer of 1993. Mr. Greenspan announced that he \nwas abandoning the M2 indicator. I am not going to get into that. That \nis why we get into all these arcane economic terms. But he said he was \nabandoning the M2 indicator in favor of ``real interest rates.'' \nDespite the fact that this M2 indicator fell short of its midpoint \ntargets in 6 consecutive years, giving indications of a possible \nrecession, Mr. Greenspan instead feared that long-term rates were too \nlow in comparison to short-term interest rates.\n  As Mr. Greenspan noted in his September 1, 1993, testimony, short-\nterm rates were nearly zero, and long-term rates were much higher. \nAccording to Mr. Greenspan, ``This configuration indicates to market \nparticipants that short-term real rates will have to rise as the \nheadwinds diminish if substantial inflationary imbalances are to be \navoided.'' That was his testimony before the House Subcommittee on \nEconomic Growth and Credit Formation, September 1, 1993.\n  OK. So for 1993, the Fed predicted a GNP rise of 2.5 percent and 2.5 \nto 3.25 percent for 1994. Despite the low projected growth rates and \nthe fact that 8 million people were unemployed and another 4 million \nwere involuntarily employed part time, Mr. Greenspan feared \ninflationary pressures because of this discrepancy between short-term \nand long-term rates.\n  According to Prof. James Galbraith, this was the only justification \nfor rate increases in 1994 and 1995. According to Mr. Galbraith, three \npoints in Greenspan's February 22, 1994, Humphrey-Hawkins written \ntestimony, made 3 weeks after Mr. Greenspan initiated the first of \nseven rate increases, clearly show that the Fed could not have raised \nrates on inflation-fighting policy grounds alone.\n  No. 1, Mr. Greenspan said, ``On the inflation front, the \ndeterioration evident in some indicators in the first half of 1993 \nproved transitory.'' No. 2, there was no clear evidence that expansion \nin 1993 was excessive and was going to carry over to 1994. This is Mr. \nGreenspan's testimony. No. 3, inflation had been falling, as Mr. \nGreenspan himself even noted.\n  I am going into this because it has been said that this increase by \nMr. Greenspan in interest rates and keeping them high--it has only come \ndown a quarter of a point since February 1995 --is because of the \nthreat of inflation. But in Mr. Greenspan's own words and in his \nwritten testimony, he basically says there was not inflation.\n\n[[Page S6290]]\n\n  No. 1, Mr. Greenspan said, ``On the inflation front, the \ndeterioration evident in some indicators in the first half of 1993 \nproved transitory''--transitory, not long term.\n  But for the year as a whole, 1993, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.75 \npercent, the smallest increase since the big drop in oil prices, since \n1986. Broader inflation measures covering purchases by businesses as \nwell as consumers rose even less. Again, these were transitory, not \npermanent, developments.\n  The second point, there was no clear evidence that expansion in 1993 \nwas excessive and was going to carry over to 1994.\n  Again, Mr. Greenspan's own testimony: ``Nonetheless, markets appear \nto be concerned that a strengthening economy is sowing the seeds of an \nacceleration of prices later this year by rapidly eliminating the \nremaining slack in resource utilization.'' However, he went on to say, \n``But it is too early to judge the degree of the underlying economic \nstrength in the early months of 1994.''\n  Wait a minute. Mr. Greenspan, in his testimony, says, `` * * * \nmarkets appear to be concerned that a strengthening economy is sowing \nthe seeds of an acceleration of prices later this year.'' However, he \nsays, ``But it is too early to judge the degree of the underlying \neconomic strength in the early months of 1994.''\n\n  In February 1994, he starts raising interest rates, when he says ``it \nis too early'' to judge it. That is why I say, Mr. Greenspan raises \ninterest rates, slams on the economic brakes, not when inflation is \nthreatening, but when, in the distant horizon, he sees a mirage of \npossible inflation. That does a disservice to our country.\n  Many of the indicators at that time gave little evidence of rising \ninflation.\n  An editorial in the March 14, 1994 Business Week, made it clear that \nMr. Greenspan had gone too far in his rate increases.\n\n       Since Greenspan raised short-term interest rates by 25 \n     basis points . . .\n\n  That was the first of seven increases--\n\n       Long bonds rates have risen nearly twice as much, jumping \n     to about 6.8%. Instead of soothing the savage beasts at the \n     bond market, the Greenspan move appears to have induced a \n     frenzy.\n       What has gone wrong, and how can it be fixed? It's tempting \n     to say--\n\n  This is the article from Business Week I am quoting here--\n\n       It's tempting to say that Greenspan's preemptive strike \n     against inflationary expectations was wrong from the start.\n       Worse, Greenspan added to confusion in the markets by \n     admitting that the conventional monetary measures were no \n     longer reliable and that he was turning to more exotic \n     measures, including that ``arcane metal,'' gold.\n\n  What is going on here? Business Week says, ``Not so,'' in terms of \nhis preemptive strike against inflationary expectations, because they \nare saying there was not any inflation.\n\n       What really spooked the markets was his subsequent \n     confession that he believed monetary policy had been too \n     loose, too long.\n\n  Monetary policy had been too loose for too long.\n\n       The markets inferred that Greenspan's strike was only the \n     first in a series of attacks against inflation. Market \n     players around the world concluded that the Fed would push \n     interest rates much higher in the months ahead.\n\n  Business Week was right on the mark, because in the weeks and months \nahead, that is exactly what Mr. Greenspan did. This, again, is \naccording to Business Week. This is not my judgment. Business Week, in \ntheir editorial said, what spooked the markets was not really a \npreemptive strike against inflation since there was little threat of \ninflation.\n  Let us go back to these charts.\n  Mr. Greenspan, according to Business Week, says that he thought that \nmonetary policy had been too loose for too long.\n  This is 1993.\n  Here is the recession, as I pointed out, of 1990, which he did not \nsee until we were 6 months into it. Then, as Fed Chairman, he has a \nresponsibility to try to get us out of that recession by lowering \ninterest rates.\n  As I pointed out, this is what happened in the previous seven \nrecessions. In each of these instances, interest rates came down as \nmuch as 50 percent in 5 months, 50 percent in 12 months.\n  Mr. Greenspan did not reduce interest rates 50 percent until 30 \nmonths out--about 31 months out, to be correct about it. That takes us \nup to about 1993, I guess. Yet he says the monetary policy was ``too \nloose for too long,'' and thus starts tightening up and raising \ninterest rates.\n  ``Business Week'' was right, in March 1994. They expected him to keep \nraising it, and, quite frankly, he did.\n  ``Worse,'' they go on, ``Greenspan added to confusion in the markets \nby admitting that the conventional monetary measures were no longer \nreliable and that he was turning to more exotic measures,'' of the \neconomy, ``including that `arcane metal,' gold.''\n  Mr. President, last year in testimony before the Banking Committee in \nresponse to a question by Senator Sarbanes, Mr. Greenspan admitted \nthat, yes, he would be in favor of returning to the gold standard. Now, \nhe admitted that he would probably be the only vote on the Federal \nReserve to do that, but that was his philosophy.\n  Perhaps we ought to have debate about that. I wonder how many \nSenators here would like to have a vote on returning to the gold \nstandard. How many votes do you think that would get here on the Senate \nfloor? I do not know if we would get any. I do not know if anybody \nreally feels we ought to return to the gold standard. Maybe that was OK \nin the past, but we live in a different world. This is a global \neconomy. We have turned away from using the gold standard as a basis. I \nam just saying the Fed Chairman's philosophy is locked into that. He \nadmitted it as recently as 1 year ago.\n  There was little justification for the rate increases. The economy \nquickly reacted in a predictably negative way. Instead of nipping \ninflation to help the markets, the seven rate increases threw the \nmarket into a tailspin. Perhaps one of the most telling indicators was \nthat unemployment for years preceding 1994 was above the assumed NAIRU. \nHere we come again to the non accelerating inflation rate of \nunemployment that I talked about earlier, that the Fed seems to be \nlooking at. Prior to 1994, this was above the widely-assumed limit of 6 \npercent. In 1991 unemployment was 6.7 percent, in 1992 it was 7.4 \npercent, and in 1993 unemployment was 6.8 percent. Yet somehow he says \nwe have to raise interest rates.\n  The third and final point about why the 1994 rate increases were \nunnecessary was this: The threat of inflation had been falling. To say \nagain, the threat had actually been falling. Again, here is Mr. \nGreenspan in his February, 1995 Humphrey-Hawkins testimony:\n\n       Fiscal and monetary policy are important among those forces \n     and have contributed to the decline in inflation expectations \n     in recent years along with decreases in long-term interest \n     rates. The actions taken last year to reduce the Federal \n     budget deficit have been instrumental in this regard.\n\n  That was a very interesting statement by Mr. Greenspan last year.\n  There are two points that need to be made here. First, I do not \nnecessarily disagree with him about discarding M2 as an indicator in \nfavor of real interest rates. What we do have a concern about is M-2 \nshowed that the money supply was shrinking and the economy might be \nslowing. Instead of focusing on other indicators that might show a \nslowing of the economy, Mr. Greenspan grasped on to real interest \nrates. The discrepancy between short and long-term rates was evident \nand could be clearly used as a justification for raising rates. That is \nwhat he said.\n  Second, it should be clarified and reinforced that Mr. Greenspan and \nthe Fed labeled the rate increases as a preemptive strike and not a \nreaction to accelerating inflation that would have clearly justified an \nincrease in interest rates.\n  Let me read the July 10, 1995, article from ``U.S. News & World \nReport'' by Mortimer Zuckerman. In his July 10, 1995, editorial, he \nsays:\n\n       Ouch! The squeeze is back. In May 101,000 jobs disappeared. \n     The workweek for most Americans is falling while the number \n     of people filing claims for unemployment is rising. \n     Don't blame it on the business cycle: The current slump is \n     the handiwork of the Federal Reserve Board, an institution \n     that is signally failing the nation. The Fed raised short-\n     term interest rates seven times in roughly a year, \n     doubling their levels and whacking key rate-sensitive \n     industries such as housing and autos. Boom, the robust \n     expansion of '94 has turned into the stagnation of mid-\n     '95.\n       Why, you may ask, did the Fed do this? It surely was not \n     responding to inflation. Unit\n\n[[Page S6291]]\n\n     labor costs, the basic fuel of inflation, grew by less than 1 \n     percent last year (and actually fell by 2.3 percent in \n     manufacturing). Inflation at the retail level has been \n     running at 3 percent or less for three years, the best \n     performance in three decades--and the experts, including Fed \n     Chairman Alan Greenspan, believe even that is overstated by \n     as much as a full percentage point because of statistical \n     flaws.\n\n  Now, I'm reading from the U.S. News & World Report, July editorial, \nby Mortimer Zuckerman.\n\n       No, what the Fed had in mind was an attack on inflationary \n     expectations--the notion that, if left unchecked, the \n     economic buoyancy of late 1993 would surge into '94 and lead \n     to rapidly increasing prices rather than to rapidly \n     increasing jobs.\n\n  The economic buoyancy, this is the economic buoyancy that Mr. \nZuckerman is talking about, not an economic boom, but at least we are \ntalking about getting better. Too slow, but by 1993, 3 years out from \nthe recession, we were finally starting to get a little bit better.\n  Mr. Zuckerman goes on:\n\n       Overlooked or simply ignored were several mitigating \n     factors--that major corporations were still laying off tens \n     of thousands of employees . . .\n\n  As I mentioned, the unemployment rate for 1993 was 7.4 percent. That \nwas up from the year before. Again, another example of the Federal \nReserve not fighting unemployment by failing to reducing interest rates \nafter the last recession. Also overlooked was ``that real wages for \nmost Americans were declining, that a true world economy had radically \naltered the ways and means of production.''\n\n       Now, what was supposed to be a ``soft landing'' to slower \n     growth is fast turning into something else. Real retail \n     sales, the most important factor in our economy, dropped at \n     an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the first two months of the \n     second quarter. . . Consumer confidence plunged a dramatic 9 \n     percentage points in the past month. . . .\n       The latest Fed failure underlines its mismanagement of the \n     monetary side of the economy over the past five years.\n\n  These are not my words. These are the words of Mr. Zuckerman, editor \nof ``U.S. News & World Report.''\n\n       In the last decade of the 20th century, too little, too \n     late, seems to be engraved in its institutional seal. In \n     1989, it sowed the seeds for the recession of 1990-91, then \n     slowed the recovery by not easing up quickly enough.\n\n  Again, evidenced by that chart.\n  ``Is the Fed flying blind?'' Mr. Zuckerman asks.\n\n       You have to wonder. Its view is that the sustainable level \n     of economic growth is 2.5 percent. But the notion that any \n     growth rate above this level would cause an increase in the \n     rate of inflation through shortages of labor, materials and \n     manufacturing capacity, is questionable. The Fed \n     underestimates the actual rise in manufacturing capacity put \n     in place and overestimates the dangers of wage inflation \n     given the historic shift in the balance of bargaining power \n     between management and labor, the large number of people \n     working part time or on temporary jobs and the continued \n     corporate restructuring. Beyond that, economic \n     globalization has provided the United States with \n     additional capacity and cheap labor to expand production \n     without price increases.\n\n  Mr. Zuckerman says:\n\n       We can have growth higher than 2.5 percent and an \n     unemployment rate lower than 6 percent and still not have an \n     inflationary surge. In the 1960's, after all, we had an \n     unemployment rate of 4.8 percent with an average inflation of \n     only 2.3 percent. The Fed should review its performance in \n     the '60's and '80's. Five years into the expansion of the \n     '60's, when growth seemed to stall, the Fed moved rapidly and \n     cut interest rates by 2 full points, extending the expansion \n     to a record nine years. The 1980's expansion turned into the \n     second longest in postwar history, again because the Federal \n     Reserve cut rates when it first spotted signs of economic \n     weakness in 1984 and 1986.\n\n  That was under Chairman Volcker.\n  Mr. President, in sum, the rate increases in 1994 and 1995 can be \ninterpreted as another example of Mr. Greenspan searching for excuses \nto raise rates as a justification to eliminate inflation.\n  Again, I am going to refer to this chart as often as I can. The \nAmerican people ought to know this. In 1 year, February 1994 to \nFebruary 1995, he doubled interest rates. Since February 1995, to this \ndate--actually to June 1996--they have only come down 3 quarters of a \npoint, with no inflation threatening.\n  The Associated Press story reported November 12, 1994:\n\n       Economists representing interests from labor unions to big \n     corporations accused the U.S. Central Bank on Friday of \n     pursuing an ill-advised monetary policy by fighting a phantom \n     inflation threat to appease bond traders on Wall Street. \n     Lawrence Chimerine--I am sorry if I mispronounced the name--\n     the chief economist at the Economic Strategy Institute, a \n     business-backed think tank in Washington, DC, said that long-\n     term interest rates have risen faster since February of 1994 \n     when the Federal Reserve started its increases than at any \n     other time in U.S. history.\n       Any further ratcheting up of interest rates really runs the \n     risk of overkill and a recession.\n\n  That was said on November 12, 1994. I believe there were two other \nrate increases after that period of time.\n  It should be noted that the Fed raised rates--I am sorry, it was 3 \ndays after this story was written, and again in February 1995--two more \ntimes. In the aftermath of the rate increases, the Investors Business \nDaily had this to say about Mr. Greenspan's efforts. This is an \neditorial in Investors Business Daily, dated April 17, 1995:\n\n       If former Defense Secretary, Robert McNamara, can own up to \n     his horrendous errors on Vietnam, why can't Federal Reserve \n     Chairman Alan Greenspan end his misguided campaign against \n     inflation?\n       The McNamara memoir published last week . . . is a stunning \n     admission of failure. He confesses that his over-reliance on \n     numbers and failure to understand the human consequences of \n     his actions led to the tragedy we know today as Vietnam.\n       McNamara was one of the postwar ``whiz kids'' who thought \n     they'd elevated management to a science. The former President \n     of Ford Motor Company, he thought his number-crunching \n     expertise, statistics, and arcane mathematical formulae were \n     all he needed to ``manage'' a war.\n       Pride? Arrogance? Some failures can't be described with \n     mere words. The bottom line on that Vietnam ``strategy'' is \n     some 58,000 names on a black wall in Washington, DC, and \n     continued tyranny in Southeast Asia.\n       We were struck by McNamara's admission of error because his \n     fascination with data is shared by Fed Chairman Greenspan--\n     who is waging a long, costly and misguided war of his own. \n     Like McNamara, Greenspan is arrogantly using his numbers \n     expertise to fight the last war--the 1970's battle against \n     inflation.\n       And just as McNamara's antiseptic ``body counts'' seemed to \n     blind him to both the failure and the human costs of his plan \n     for winning the war, Greenspan seems to miss the costs to the \n     real economy--jobs, incomes, goods and services--of his \n     campaign against phantom inflation.\n       We've heard all the arguments for continuing the battle: \n     The U.S. is enjoying the best of all possible worlds, with \n     rapid growth and low inflation. The Fed appears to have \n     engineered a ``soft landing''--\n\n  How many times we have heard that phrase?\n\n     in which the economy drops gently onto a long, slow glidepath \n     of steady, noninflationary expansion.\n       We don't buy it.\n\n  I am still quoting from Investors Business Daily.\n\n       As the last recession showed, a soft landing can very \n     easily turn into a crash landing, or a victory into a rout.\n       After seven interest rate hikes in a little over a year, \n     the Fed is flirting with disaster. Businesses--as opposed to \n     coupon-clippers--are plainly worried.\n       Monetary policy in this country is controlled by bond \n     traders who live in high-rises and are completely out of \n     touch with reality.\n       The words of a radical? Hardly. Jerry Jasinowski, the \n     president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said \n     that six months ago, before the last two rate hikes. Others \n     in business echo his comments.\n       The signs of a slowdown are now widespread. Retail sales \n     are weak, auto sales are declining, durable goods orders have \n     rolled over, new-home sales have tanked, money supply is \n     headed south and the index of leading economic indicators is \n     signaling sluggish growth at best.\n       . . . As most economists know, it takes six months to two \n     years for the full effects of a Fed tightening to be felt. \n     The Fed's recent tightening binge--an unprecedented doubling \n     of rates in just 13 months--probably won't finish hitting \n     home until 1996.\n       Meanwhile, inflation remains nowhere to be seen--despite \n     the constant fears of bond market vigilantes who believe \n     jobs, prosperity and hyperinflation are somehow linked.\n\n  That was Investors Business Daily, and that was in 1995. Similar to \n1974, when the WIN--the whip inflation now--policy helped inflation \nalong by raising taxes on oil, the interest rate increases in 1994 may \nhave made it more difficult to actually fight inflation in the future \nbecause they raised the price of obtaining a car loan, home mortgage, \nor a student loan. The 1994 increase failed on all counts, including \neven Mr. Greenspan's. According to the University of Denver economist, \nRandall Wray, ``The Fed's policy shift after February 1994 was a \nresounding failure by Mr. Greenspan's own criteria. Long-term rates \nimmediately rose. The Fed's action led to a run out at the long end of \nthe market, causing an estimated $1 trillion loss.'' Thus, long-term \nrates\n\n[[Page S6292]]\n\nhave been high because the market quite correctly feared other rate \nincreases and not because of high expected inflation. Once these became \nreality, the bond market plummeted and stock prices experienced \nvolatility because additional rate hikes were feared.\n\n  He went on to note that real economic growth for 1994 turned out to \nbe less than the bottom of the Fed's predicted range. By the end of \n1995, the economy was growing at a rate less than 1 percent. As data \naccumulated that the economy was slowing, the Fed reversed course and \nlowered short-term rates by one-quarter of 1 percent three times. Thus, \nwe get down to 5.25 percent.\n  There is little evidence to suggest that small reductions would have \nany significant effect on the economy. However, the frequent \ninterventions were sufficient to keep the markets guessing.\n  In late February of this year, Greenspan sent shock waves through the \nmarkets when he suggested that policy might tighten, but he was forced \nto immediately clarify his position by indicating that policy was \nlikely to loosen. But there is more.\n  In a January 2, 1995, editorial in the Washington Post, Mr. Gerome \nWeinstein of Columbia University observed that six increases in \ninterest rates in less than a year suggest that Mr. Greenspan has \nforgotten that the economy does not change course quickly or easily. An \ninterest rate change can be expected to take about 18 months to work \nits way through the complexity of the economy before it has a lasting \neffect. Six increases in 11 months would suggest that Mr. Greenspan and \nthe Fed are impatient.\n  Mr. President, why do I go through all of this? Why have I cited all \nof these economists--Mr. Zuckerman of U.S. News & World Report, Mr. \nJasinowski of the National Association of Manufacturers, and a host of \nother writers? Why go into all of this? Because, as I have said many \ntimes, there is a common thread that ties Mr. Greenspan's actions \ntogether as we have seen again and again and again from his days as \nChairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to the present.\n  Mr. Greenspan has consistently shown the same two tendencies. First, \nhe misjudges the signs of an oncoming recession. Mr. Greenspan often \ncomes to the correct economic conclusions, but way, way too late.\n  Chief economist David Jones stated that Greenspan is so preoccupied \nwith arcane numbers, he tends to miss big trends. As a result, he often \nmakes the right moves but at the wrong time. Timing is not his strong \nsuit.\n  According to U.S. News & World Report editor Mortimer Zuckerman, Alan \nGreenspan and his board at the Federal Reserve make ladies who read tea \nleaves pretty hot. The Fed foresaw a dangerous boom in 1989, tightened \ninterest rates, and got a long recession instead.\n  The second aspect of the common thread throughout Mr. Greenspan's \nadult life is that he does not act decisively enough to pull the \neconomy out of recessions because of his inordinate fear of inflation.\n  Again, let us go back. Remember the 1974 whip inflation now plan, the \nWIN plan. As Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. \nGreenspan designed an economic plan that raised taxes, worked to limit \nconsumption, and resulted in an unemployment rate of 9 percent. \nAccording to Mr. Zuckerman, the same held true in 1991. I quote:\n\n       Having rushed to that wrong conclusion--\n\n  The dangerous boom of 1989.\n\n     they dithered for so long in correcting it that we did not \n     come out of the recession until 1991-1992. In 1994, when \n     recovery was really starting to happen, they went back to \n     their tea leaves and got in the ratchet reflection mode, \n     again battling a phantom inflation, an inflation they \n     admitted was not there. It was an expectation.\n\n  Editorial, August 7, 1995, U.S. News & World Report.\n  Again, what I talk about is the mirage on the horizon of possible \ninflation. In fact, Mr. Greenspan even seems to publicly ignore \nstatistics that might indicate that he does not need to raise rates to \nfight inflation. For example, in his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on \nFebruary 27, 1995, Greenspan did not read the most optimistic portion \nof his prepared remarks. I want to comment on that.\n  There were prepared remarks that Mr. Greenspan had. But in his \ntestimony of February 27, 1995, he kind of skipped over it. Here is \nwhat it said.\n\n       These developments do not suggest that the financial tender \n     needed to support the ongoing inflation process is in place.\n\n  An amazing statement by Mr. Greenspan, someone who has just raised \ninterest rates--doubled over a year, seven rate hikes. In February \n1995, at the end of the last rate hike, he says in his written \ntestimony that:\n\n       These developments do not suggest that the financial tender \n     needed to support the ongoing inflation process is in place.\n\n  What is going on here, Mr. President? Mr. Greenspan, in his written \ntestimony, says that it is not there, that the financial tender needed \nto support the ongoing inflation process is not there. We have high \ninterest rates.\n  Again, I am referring to the crucial 1995 Humphrey-Hawkins testimony \nand Greenspan's rejection of the idea that the economy's potential for \nthe sustained growth rate was much above the current level of about 2.5 \npercent.\n  Here again are Mr. Greenspan's own words.\n\n       But while most analysts have increased their estimates of \n     America's long-term productivity growth, it is still too soon \n     to judge whether that improvement is a few tenths of a \n     percentage point annually or even more, perhaps moving us \n     closer to the more vibrant pace that characterized the early \n     post-World War II period. It is fair to note, however, that \n     the fact that labor and factory utilization rates have risen \n     as much as they have in the past year or so does argue that \n     the rate of increase in potential is appreciably below the 4 \n     percent growth rate of 1994.\n\n  Again, that is his testimony before the Banking Committee of February \n22, 1995.\n  So, Mr. President, a common thread is misjudging what is happening \nand then mishandling how to pull us out of the recession because of his \nabsolute fear of inflation.\n  Mr. President, I think what we see here is a Fed Chairman whose \neconomic philosophy--again, I say this with all due respect. I hold no \npersonal animus at all toward Mr. Greenspan. People speak of him in \nhighly glowing terms. I have had, as far as I know, only one meeting \nwith him in my life in my office, when he was gracious enough to ask \nfor a meeting. He came down to my office. Several of us met in our \noffice with him, several Senators.\n  It was a fascinating discussion. We were just kind of getting into it \nwhen the bells rang and we had to go vote. But I believe our job as \nSenators is not to approve people, to put them into a position simply \nbecause they may be nice people or they have a lot of friends or they \nmove in acceptable social circles.\n  Our job, I believe, especially in this important position, Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve Board, is to look at the record of the person \nwho is nominated to fill that position. What has been that person's \neconomic record? How accurate have they been in the past? What is their \nphilosophy? And, especially, we must ask those questions if it is a \nperson who has been Chairman of the Fed and seeks to be renewed in that \nposition.\n  I think we, in this body, have been too prone to just rubberstamp \nthose nominees who have come to us for positions on the Federal Reserve \nBoard, and especially as Chairman.\n  I will admit, in all candor and frankness, that I voted for Mr. \nGreenspan, on one occasion, to be in the Fed. I will admit, in all \ncandor, I did not look at the record all that much either. But this \ntime, with what has happened in 1993, 1994, 1995, with the efforts of \nthis administration to reduce the deficit and the efforts of this \nCongress, and I speak of both Republicans and Democrats, in biting the \nbullet--oh, we may have our differences on where to trim and what to \ncut, but I think basically Members of this Congress have worked hard to \nreduce the deficit. And I believe the administration has, too. More \nneeds to be done.\n  The administration has acted courageously to reduce the size of the \nFederal Government. But if what we are rewarded with is the Chairman of \nthe Fed keeping interest rates unduly high, keeping the economy from \ngrowing, then perhaps our work will be in vain.\n  We have the potential to grow in this country. Everyone that I know \nsees it\n\n[[Page S6293]]\n\nout there. It does not take an economist to go out on Main Street, to \ngo in our businesses, to talk to working families, to know that that \npent-up energy is there, that ability is there.\n  You can use the figures, and they are there. They show this: Our \nmanufacturing sector is ready to go; small business is ready to move; \nour average working families are ready for a wage increase, which they \nneed and can use, and which need not be inflationary. The size of the \nlabor force can grow substantially in the future. But, I am sorry to \nsay, the Chairman of the Fed is not allowing that to happen.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I just have one more item I want to cover. \nIt should not take me more than maybe 10 minutes, I hope, and then I \nwill be finished with my statement for today. I know others wanted to \nknow about that. I understand there are some problems. I want to be as \naccommodating as possible.\n  I want to cover, however, just briefly, for the record, the issue of \nNAIRU. I said earlier today I was going to get into that, and I want to \ntalk about NAIRU, the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, \nand what it is and why it seems to have such a hold on us.\n  So what is NAIRU? Let me just read some comments, and I will get into \nNAIRU for a few minutes. Dana Mead, the chief executive of Tenneco and \nchairman of the National Association of Manufacturers, had it right \nwhen he said that ``NAIRU is to economics what the Nehru jacket is to \nfashion--outdated.''\n  Robert Eisner, professor emeritus at Northwest University, whom I \nquoted earlier today several times, argues that one can actually reduce \ninflation by keeping unemployment under its natural rate.\n  He developed this argument in an article entitled ``Our NAIRU \nLimit.'' That was in the American Prospect magazine, spring of 1995. I \nthought I would quote a little of it to talk about NAIRU and what it \nis.\n  First of all, Mr. Eisner says, starting his article:\n\n       We mustn't have it too good. Too much growth--too little \n     unemployment--is a bad thing. These are not the idle thoughts \n     of economic nail-biters; they are the economic policy of the \n     United States. After real growth of domestic product hit 4.5 \n     percent in the last quarter of 1994 and unemployment dipped \n     to 5.4 percent in December--\n\n  Guess what?\n\n     the Federal Reserve moved on February 1 to raise interest \n     rates for the seventh time in less than a year. Why? To slow \n     a too rapid rate of growth and stop or reverse the fall in \n     unemployment. Why do that? To fight inflation.\n       Ordinary people may wonder. . .\n       Hard nosed economic analysts and business leaders are also \n     raising questions. They point to technological advances and \n     downsizing in U.S. industry and suggest that productivity and \n     output potential may well be rising more rapidly than the 2.5 \n     percent long-term growth rate that Greenspan and others think \n     marks the outer limit for economic growth. Furthermore, as \n     people lose old, high-paying jobs and look desperately even \n     for lower-paying employment--\n\n  We know how true that is--\n\n     there is slack in the labor force. Perhaps most important, \n     increasing globalization and world competition may limit the \n     ability of American firms to raise prices and workers to push \n     for higher wages.\n       These heretical observations have so far failed to dent the \n     dominant dogma haunting economic policy. The central tenet of \n     that dogma is a concept familiarly known among economists as \n     the NAIRU--the ``nonaccelerating-inflation-rate of \n     unemployment.'' While unknown to the general public, the \n     NAIRU has become one of the most powerful influences on \n     economic policy this century. My recent work, however, shows \n     that even on the basis of a conventional model used to \n     estimate the NAIRU, there is no basis for the conclusion that \n     low unemployment rates threaten permanently accelerating \n     inflation. And, according to an alternative model more \n     consistent with the data, inflation might actually be lower \n     at lower unemployment levels than we are experiencing today.\n       The basic proposition of the NAIRU is simple: Policymakers \n     cannot use deficit spending or an increase in the money \n     supply to reduce unemployment below some ``equilibrium'' \n     rate, except at the cost of accelerating inflation.\n       The concept of the NAIRU, derived from Milton Friedman's \n     notion of a ``natural rate of unemployment,'' rejects the \n     assumed trade-off between unemployment and inflation \n     described by the Phillips curve, named after A.W. Phillips, \n     an innovative economist from New Zealand.\n\n  Thus, according to the NAIRU, fiscal or monetary policies aimed at \nreducing unemployment would leave us like a dog chasing its tail. If \npolicy were aimed at keeping total spending sufficiently high to keep \nunemployment below its ``natural rate,'' inflation would rise more and \nmore rapidly.\n  In this view, the only way to reduce unemployment, except possibly in \nthe short run, is to change conditions affecting the supply of labor--\nfor example, by cutting the minimum wage, reducing or eliminating \nunemployment benefits, or upgrading the skill of workers.\n  On the contrary, he says, that we ought to be trying to reduce \nunemployment, not only by supply-side measures, but by ensuring that \nthe economy is not starved for adequate aggregate demand or \nproductivity for increasing public investment.\n  NAIRU--Non-Accelerating Inflationary Rate of Unemployment, which we \nare shackled by it.\n  Later in his study, Eisner goes on to replicate CBO's August 1994 \neconomic and budget outlook and comes to a very important conclusion. \nAnd I quote:\n\n       It takes still higher unemployment to break the back of \n     inflation. But high enough unemployment does eventually turn \n     inflation negative. . .\n       The low-unemployment paths shown, however, offer quite a \n     different picture. At 5.8 percent unemployment, contrary to \n     Alan Greenspan's fears, there is no accelerating inflation. \n     By the end of the century, inflation settles at about 4.4 \n     percent. Strikingly, at lower unemployment rates, inflation \n     is no higher. At 4.8 percent unemployment, the simulation \n     shows inflation coming down to 3.6 percent. At 3.8 percent \n     unemployment, inflation comes down to 2.9 percent. At 2.8 \n     percent unemployment, inflation at the end of 1999 is down to \n     2.1 percent.\n\n  Eisner also argues the long-term rate of growth will increase with \nhigher employment levels.\n\n       Over a longer period we should be educating and investing \n     in human capital. . . . We should be bringing millions of \n     workers who are essentially out of the labor force into the \n     labor force. We can make them productive and get them off \n     welfare. There is a lot of production that can take place \n     because of that.\n\n  So, again, a completely contrary concept of what Mr. Greenspan is \nsaying. Mr. Eisner, and others, through models that they have developed \nand simulations, show an alternative analysis--that through lower rates \nof unemployment--higher rates of full employment, you might say--that \ninflation actually comes down. Again, I believe there is so much pent-\nup energy and ability in the American work force that we can grow \nfaster.\n  But regardless of future predictions of the effect of unemployment on \ninflation, it is clear, I believe, that the NAIRU is overestimated.\n  The 1996 economic report of the President stated that:\n\n       For over a year now the unemployment rate has fluctuated \n     narrowly around 5.6 percent, yet the core rate of inflation \n     has remained roughly stable rather than risen.\n\n  The economic report goes on to say:\n\n       This recent evidence strongly argues that the sustainable \n     rate of unemployment has fallen below 6 percent, perhaps to \n     the range of 5.5 to 5.7 percent. The Administration's \n     forecast falls on the conservative end of this range by \n     projecting the unemployment rate of 5.7 percent over the near \n     term.\n\n  This same paragraph also states:\n\n       Wage inflation, as measured by the employment cost index, \n     also remains stable.\n\n  It is entirely possible that the rate could be adjusted downward.\n  James Robinson, former CEO of American Express, echoes the words of \nDana Mead.\n\n       Like that Nehru jacket, the NAIRU concept is outdated. In \n     fact I would say that NAIRU is a jacket itself--it's like a \n     straitjacket on our economy.\n\n  This is what Mr. Robinson had to say:\n\n       That frame of reference for growth, called maximum \n     sustainable capacity by economists, was largely developed in \n     the 1950's, 1960's, and 1970's. Today, the parameters of \n     growth are substantially expanded. The deeper integration and \n     breadth of competition that has come to the global economy on \n     only the past decade have opened the way to more robust \n     growth even among the developed Nations. The Fed has been \n     cautious to\n\n[[Page S6294]]\n\n     a fault. It makes a tragic mistake by erring on the side of \n     slow growth, denying Americans a more dynamic economy, \n     diminishing living standards, and cutting off capital to \n     emerging markets.\n\n  Prof. James Galbraith builds on this point when he argues:\n\n       In fact NAIRUvians--\n\n  I like that word.\n\n     NAIRUvians have never successfully predicted where the \n     barrier would be hit.\n\n  That is a minimum level of unemployment.\n\n       The estimated NAIRU tracks actual unemployment.\n\n  Professor Galbraith says they do not know where that barrier is, that \nminimum level of unemployment. He says:\n\n       [Moreover] the estimated NAIRU tracks actual unemployment. \n     When unemployment increases, conservative economists raise \n     their NAIRU. When it decreases, they predict inflation, and \n     if inflation doesn't occur, they cut their estimated NAIRU. \n     There exists a long and not-very-reputable literature of such \n     estimates.\n\n  For example, notable NAIRU supporter Paul Krugman:\n\n       Places present estimates of the NAIRU from about 5 to about \n     6.3 percent, with most estimates clustered between 5.5 and 6 \n     percent.\n\n  Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from Florida wanted to \nget some housekeeping items done. I will yield to him whatever time he \nmay consume for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I inquire of the Senator from Iowa how long \nhe intends to go beyond this point. The reason I inquire is because I \ndo not want to inconvenience the Chair as well.\n  Mr. HARKIN. In the interest of comity--I understand that we have \nproblems after 3:45. I will cut my comments short. I just want to \nfinish one thing on NAIRU. It is now 3:40. I know that we have a \nproblem here. I want to be accommodating. So I will just wrap up my \nremarks very shortly. In like 60 seconds I will yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wanted to discuss NAIRU because I think \nit is very important, because I think it is acting as a straitjacket. I \nthink that Mr. Greenspan and the economists at the Fed are looking at \nNAIRU and abusing it. And in so doing, they are abusing what I believe \nto be the capacity of our economy to grow. I believe there is an equal \nbody of evidence and data to suggest that we can reduce unemployment \nand at the same time reduce inflation.\n  I believe it is worth the relatively small risk to go ahead and get \nthese interest rates down, stimulate the economy. Let us have some \ngrowth. Why is it that we have to accept growth of 2 to 2.5 percent? \nThat is like saying, ``America, a C-average is fine.'' I believe \nAmerica can do a B-plus, and A. We can do it without inflation. That is \nwhy I want to talk about NAIRU.\n  I will continue next Thursday on the Greenspan nomination. I will use \nmy time at that time to finish my comments on NAIRU. I thank the Chair \nand I thank the Senator from Florida. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair appreciates the courtesies of the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank you, Mr. President. I too want to thank the Senator \nfrom Iowa for his consideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6284-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES--H.R. 2977\n\n  Mr. MACK.

Mr. President, the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 \nprovide a useful updating of an important law enacted 12 years ago. The \noriginal Single Audit Act of 1984 created a procedure by which a State \nor local government receiving funds from several Federal assistance \nprograms would be subject only to one, comprehensive audit. A 1994 GAO \nreport on the intergovernmental experience under the act indicates that \nit has resulted in both improved accountability over Federal assistance \nand strengthened financial management in all covered entities. It has \ndone this while reducing the Federal audit burden on State and local \ngovernments.\n  The GAO report, however, also indicated that the process can be \nimproved. And here I want to acknowledge the fine work of my colleague, \nSenator Glenn, in having first requested the GAO study, and then having \nworked with GAO to develop these amendments to the act. I am pleased to \nhave joined with Senator Glenn in cosponsoring his bill. It further \nreduces the Federal audit burden on small governments, while improving \naudit coverage\n\n[[Page S6297]]\n\nand effectiveness by allowing auditors to focus on testing the riskiest \nprograms that a government operates.\n  At the hearing I held on S. 1579, there was strong support for this \nlegislation from the State auditors organization. The auditor from my \nown State of Alaska has indicated his own support, and I know this will \nbe a real benefit to the local governments there, too. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in moving this very useful legislation forward \ntoday.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support S. \n1579, the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996. This legislation amends \nthe Single Audit Act of 1984. It is a bipartisan good government bill \nthat will both improve financial management of Federal funds and reduce \npaperwork burdens on State and local governments, universities and \nother nonprofit organizations that receive Federal assistance. I am \nhappy that the chairman of the Government Affairs Committee, Senator \nStevens, joined with me in co-sponsoring the bill, as did Senators \nLevin, Cochran, Pryor, Cohen, Lieberman, Brown and Grassley. The \nlegislation was reported unanimously by the Government Affairs \nCommittee. And we have an identical bill moving through the House of \nRepresentatives--H.R. 3184, introduced by Representative Steve Horn.\n  Over the last several years we have made great strides in reforming \nthe sloppy and wasteful state of Federal financial management. The \nChief Financial Officers Act of 1990, which I strongly support, was a \nmajor accomplishment in this regard. Much more remains to be done, \nhowever, to achieve greater accountability for the hundreds of billions \nof dollars of Federal assistance that go to or through State and local \ngovernments and nonprofit organizations. Much more also remains to be \ndone to reduce the auditing and reporting burdens of the Federal \nassistance management process. The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 \ngoes a long way toward achieving these goals.\n  The Single Audit Act was enacted in 1984 to overcome serious gaps and \nduplications that existed in audit coverage over Federal funds provided \nto State and local governments, which now amount to about $250 billion \na year. Some governments rarely saw an auditor interested in examining \nFederal funds, others were swamped by auditors, each looking at a \nseparate grant award. The Single Audit Act remedied that problem by \nchanging the audit focus from compliance with individual Federal grant \nrequirements to a periodic single overall audit of the entity receiving \nFederal assistance. The act also set specific dollar thresholds to \nexempt recipients that receive relatively small amounts of Federal \nassistance from regular audit requirements. In passing the original \nlegislation, Congress considered the benefits and costs and developed \ncriteria that exposed the vast majority of Federal assistance to State \nand local governments to audit coverage. This structured approach of \nentity-wide audits simplified overlapping audit requirements and \nimproved grantee-organization administrative controls.\n  The Single Audit Act also served an important purpose of prompting \nState and local governments to improve their general financial \nmanagement practices. The act encouraged the governments to review and \nrevise their financial management practices, including instituting \nannual financial statement audits, installing new accounting systems, \nand implementing monitoring systems. The improvements represented long-\nneeded and long-lasting financial management reforms. Studies by the \nGeneral Accounting Office [GAO] confirmed these accomplishments. The \nsuccess of the act also prompted the Office of Management and Budget \n[OMB] in 1990 to apply single audit principles to educational \ninstitutions and other nonprofit organizations that receive or \npassthrough Federal funds--OMB Circular No. A-133, ``Audits of \nInstitutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit Organizations,'' \nissued in March 1990, revised in April 1996.\n\n  During my tenure as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I \nrequested that GAO study the implementation of the Single Audit Act and \nsuggest any needed changes. The resulting report, ``Single Audit: \nRefinements Can Improve Usefulness'' (GAO/AIMD-94-133, June 1994), \nreviewed the successes of the act, but also pointed out specific \nmodifications that could improve the act's usefulness. The legislation \nwe bring to the Senate today is based on GAO's findings as well as \nstudies by the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency and \nNational State Auditors Association. The bill was developed in \ncooperation with GAO and OMB. Moreover, OMB recently revised its \nCircular A-133 consistent with the purposes of this legislation. \nHowever, the circular continues to apply only to nonprofit \norganizations--State and local governments are not covered. With the \npassage of this legislation, OMB will be able to take the next step and \nconsolidate its grant audit requirements in one circular. Finally, the \nbill also reflects comments received from State, local, and private \nsector accounting and audit professionals, as well as program managers. \nAltogether, the legislation will strengthen the act, while \nsimultaneously reducing its burdens.\n  First, the legislation extends the act to cover nonprofit \norganizations that receive Federal assistance. Again, these \norganizations are currently subject to the single audit process under \nOMB Circular A-133. Broadening the act's coverage in this way ensures \nthat all non-Federal grantee organizations will be covered uniformly by \none single audit process.\n  Second, the bill reduces audit and related paperwork burdens by \nraising the single audit threshold from $100,000 to $300,000. This will \nexempt thousands of smaller State and local governments and nonprofit \norganizations that receive relatively small amounts of Federal \nassistance from Federal single audit requirements. It will still \nensure, however, that the vast majority of Federal funds will be \nsubject to audit testing. Needless to say, it will also reinforce the \nability of Federal agencies to audit or investigate grantees when \nneeded to safeguard Federal funds.\n  Third, the bill will improve audit effectiveness by establishing a \nrisk-based approach for selecting programs to be tested during single \naudits for adequacy of internal controls and compliance with Federal \nprogram requirements, such as eligibility of participants and \nallowability of costs. The Single Audit Act has required audit testing \nsolely on the basis of dollar criteria. Using a risk-based approach \nwill ensure coverage of programs that present the highest risk to the \nFederal Government.\n  Fourth, the legislation improves the contents and timeliness of \nsingle audit reporting to make the reports more useful. Currently, \nauditors often include many different documents in a single audit \nreport. These documents are designed to comply with auditing standards \nbut leave users confused. A summary document, written in plain \nlanguage, would greatly increase the usefulness of single audit \nreports. Report users would be able to quickly discern which entities \nare having problems administering Federal programs and consequently \nneed additional oversight.\n  Shortening the reporting time frame will also make the single audit \nreports more useful. The current practice of filing reports 13 months \nafter the end of the year that was audited significantly reduces their \nutility. An ideal period would be the Government Finance Officers \nAssociation's standard of 6 months for timely reporting by State and \nlocal governments. However, given the numerous audits that some State \nauditors have to perform, the legislation establishes a 9-month \nstandard. Moreover, the legislation establishes a 2-year transition \nperiod for entities to comply with the faster reporting and gives \nflexibility for extensions as needed. The overall goal, still, is to \nshorten the reporting time frame to make the single audit reports more \nuseful to assess the stewardship of organizations entrusted with \nFederal funds and to prompt any needed corrective actions.\n  Fifth, the legislation increases administrative flexibility. OMB is \nauthorized to issue rules to implement the act and may revise certain \naudit requirements, as needed, without seeking amendments to the act. \nFor example, OMB will be authorized to raise even higher the $300,000 \nthreshold. Auditors also will have greater flexibility to target \nprograms at risk.\n  In these and other ways, the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 will\n\n[[Page S6298]]\n\nstreamline the underlying Single Audit Act, update its requirements, \nreduce burdens, and provide for more flexibility. This legislation \nbuilds on the significant accomplishments of the 1984 act and I am \nconfident that my colleagues will agree that this legislation should be \nbroadly supported by the Senate.\n  In December 1995, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs held a \nhearing on the status of Federal financial management, including the \nSingle Audit Act. Charles Bowsher, the Comptroller General, and Kurt \nSjoberg, the California State Auditor who represented the National \nState Auditors Association, strongly supported the legislation and \nrecommended that it be enacted. Edward DeSeve, Office of Management and \nBudget Controller, also applauded the legislative effort.\n\n  The support of the Comptroller General and the State auditors is \nespecially important. The Comptroller General was instrumental in \nadvising the Congress when the original Single Audit Act was enacted. \nHe followed the subsequent implementation of the act and has made the \nrecommendations for improving the act that was the basis for the \ncurrent legislation. I give great weight to his recommendations for \namending the Single Audit Act. State auditors, for their part, are key \nplayers in the single audit process. They conduct or arrange for \nthousands of single audits each year. So, their views are also \ncritically important. Following the December hearing, the National \nState Auditors Association met to discuss the legislation and decided \nunanimously to support its enactment. The President's Council on \nIntegrity and Efficiency Audit Committee also submitted a letter in \nsupport of the legislation. I ask that their letters of support be \nincluded in the Record.\n  On April 18, 1996, the Committee on Government Affairs marked up S. \n1579 and voted unanimously to send the bill to the floor for a vote. \nAgain, this bi-partisanship also extends to the House of \nRepresentatives, where an identical bill (H.R. 3184) was introduced on \nMarch 28, 1996 by Representative Horn and four cosponsors. The House of \nRepresentatives Committee on Government Reform and Oversight voted the \nbill out of committee on April 25, 1996. With this bipartisan support, \nI am sure that this good Government legislation can soon become law.\n  In closing, let me just say that good Government legislation such as \nthe Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 is often overlooked and \ndiscounted. It is unimportant to many, boring to most. But it is just \nthis sort of nuts and bolts legislation that is needed to improve the \nefficiency and effectiveness of our Government. The end result of \nenactment of S.. 1579 will be a Government more accountable to its \npeople.\n  To reach this point, we have had the help of colleagues on each side \nof the aisle, as I have said. We have also had the assistance of, and \nneed to thank, the Comptroller General, Charles Bowsher, and his \nstaff--most especially, Jerry Skelly--we would not be here today \nwithout Jerry's tireless work. I'd also like to thank Kurt Sjoberg, the \nCalifornia State Auditor, Woody Jackson, OMB's Deputy Controller, John \nMercer with Senator Stevens, Anna Miller on Representative Horn's \nstaff, and David Plocher on my staff--all have contributed greatly to \nthis legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, again, I ask unanimous consent that letters of \nendorsement of S. 1579 from the National State Auditors Association and \nthe Audit Committee of the President's Council on Integrity and \nEfficiency, as well as a summary of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    National State\n\n\n                                         Auditors Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 29, 1996.\n     Hon. John Glenn,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Governmental Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Glenn: The National State Auditors Association \n     has voted unanimously to support the proposed bill to amend \n     the Single Audit Act of 1984. My state audit colleagues and I \n     believe that the proposed legislation is an excellent measure \n     that deserves to be passed into law as soon as possible.\n       The Single Audit Act amendments provide a unique \n     opportunity to address the needs of federal, state and local \n     government auditors and program managers. The original act is \n     over 10 years old and the amendments address many of the \n     changes that have occurred over the years in the auditing \n     profession and in government financial management. The bill \n     is the result of open and constructive dialog among the \n     stakeholders. Over the last several months, we have worked \n     closely with congressional staff as well as representatives \n     of the General Accounting Office and the Office of Management \n     and Budget. As currently drafted, the bill provides needed \n     improvements to financial accountability over federal grant \n     funds.\n       While there are several excellent provisions in the amended \n     act, two are particularly noteworthy. First, the minimum \n     threshold of receipts requiring an entity to have a single \n     audit performed is raised in the bill to $300,000. Similarly, \n     the thresholds for larger recipients are also adjusted. These \n     modifications will relieve many state and local governments \n     of unnecessary federal mandates and generate savings of audit \n     costs. Second, the amendments allow federal and state \n     governments to focus audit resources on ``high-risk'' grants \n     where the potential for savings is the greatest. It makes \n     good economic sense to concentrate audits where increased \n     corrective action and recoveries are likely to result.\n       In summary, the National State Auditors Association is \n     pleased to fully support the amendments to the Single Audit \n     Act of 1984 and assist you in any way possible to facilitate \n     its passage this year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Anthony Verdecchia,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            President's Council on\n\n\n                                     Integrity and Efficiency,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 1996.\n     Hon. John Glenn,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Governmental Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Glenn: The Audit Committee of the President's \n     Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) is pleased to \n     extend its support for Senate Bill S. 1579, ``Single Audit \n     Act Amendments of 1996.'' We believe that the improvements to \n     the Single Audit Act of 1984 contained in this bill will \n     result in significantly more effective and efficient auditing \n     of Federal program funds at State and local governments and \n     non-profit organizations and we urge that it be passed as \n     soon as possible.\n       The Single Audit Act of 1984 is over 11 years old. In 1993 \n     the PCIE issued a report entitled, Study on Improving the \n     Single Audit Process. In that report we concluded that while \n     the Act was successful in achieving its objectives, changes \n     were needed to further improve the auditing and financial \n     management of Federal program funds. The report contained a \n     number of specific recommendations for changes to the Single \n     Audit Act of 1984, related Office of Management and Budget \n     Circulars and other implementing guidance from the auditing \n     profession. We are pleased to see that all of our \n     recommendations that require legislative change have been \n     addressed in the proposed amendments.\n       Of the many improvements contained in the bill, we believe \n     the most far-reaching are the provisions for a ``risk-based'' \n     approach to determining audit coverage. These provisions will \n     allow auditors to concentrate their audits on the areas of \n     highest risk, rather than auditing the same programs every \n     year based solely on funding level, regardless of risk. We \n     believe that these provisions, along with other provisions \n     shortening the due dates for adults and providing additional \n     flexibilities, will result in much more effective audit \n     coverage and more useful audit reports for Federal and \n     grantee program managers.\n       In summary, the PCIE Audit Committee fully supports the \n     bill and recommends that it be passed as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Valerie Lau,\n     Chair, Audit Committee.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (S. 1579)\n\n       This bill amends the Single Audit Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-\n     502). The 1984 Act replaced multiple grant-by-grant audits \n     with an annual entity-wide audit process for State and local \n     governments that receive Federal assistance. The new bill \n     would broaden the scope of the Act to cover universities and \n     other nonprofit organizations, as well. It would also \n     streamline the process. Thus, the bill would improve \n     accountability for hundreds of billions of dollars of Federal \n     assistance, while also reducing auditing and paperwork \n     burdens on grant recipients.\n       The bill was developed following GAO review of \n     implementation of the Single Audit Act (``Single Audit: \n     Refinements Can Improve Usefulness,'' GAO/AIMD-94-133, June \n     21, 1994). Major stakeholders in the single audit process \n     were consulted during the drafting process. Support for the \n     bill was confirmed at a December 14, 1995, hearing of the \n     Senate Committee on Government Affairs. The bill was \n     introduced on February 27, 1996, by Senator Glenn, and co-\n     sponsored by Senators Stevens, Levin, Cochran, Pryor, Cohen, \n     Lieberman, Brown, and Grassley. The bill was reported out of \n     the Committee on Governmental Affairs on April 18, 1996. An\n\n[[Page S6299]]\n\n     identical bill (H.R. 3184) was under consideration at the \n     same time by the House of Representatives Committee on \n     Governmental Reform and Oversight.\n       Ten years' experience under the 1984 Act has been proven \n     that the single audit concept promotes accountability over \n     Federal assistance and prompts financial management \n     improvements. Study also showed, however, that the process \n     can be strengthened. This bill would (1) improve audit \n     coverage of Federal assistance, (2) reduce burdens on non-\n     Federal entities, (3) improve audit effectiveness, (4) \n     improve single audit reporting, and (5) increase \n     administrative flexibility.\n       Improve Audit Coverage--The bill would improve audit \n     coverage of Federal assistance by including in the single \n     audit process all State and local governments and nonprofit \n     organizations that receive Federal assistance. Currently, the \n     Act only applies to State and local governments. Nonprofit \n     organizations are subject administratively to single audits \n     under OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of Institutions of Higher \n     Education and Other Nonprofit Organizations.'' Including \n     nonprofit organizations under the Act would result in a \n     common set of single audit requirements for Federal \n     assistance.\n       Reduce Federal Burden--The bill would simultaneously reduce \n     Federal burdens on thousands of State and local governments \n     and nonprofits, and ensure audit coverage over the vast \n     majority of Federal assistance provided to those \n     organizations. It would do so by raising the dollar threshold \n     for requiring a single audit from $100,000 to $300,000. While \n     this would relieve many grantees of Federal single audit \n     mandates, GAO estimated that a $300,000 threshold would \n     cover, for example, 95% of direct Federal assistance to \n     local governments. This is commensurate with the coverage \n     provided at the $100,000 threshold when the Act was passed \n     in 1984. Thus, exempting thousands of entities from single \n     audits would reduce audit and paperwork burdens, but not \n     significantly diminish the percentage of Federal \n     assistance covered by single audits.\n       Improve Audit Effectiveness--The bill would improve audit \n     effectiveness by directing audit resources to the areas of \n     greatest risk. Now, auditors must perform audit testing on an \n     entity's largest--but not necessarily the riskiest--programs. \n     The bill would require auditors to assess the risk of the \n     programs an entity operates and select the riskiest programs \n     for testing. As the President of the National State Auditors \n     Association said, ``it makes good economic sense to \n     concentrate audits where increased corrective action and \n     recoveries are likely to result.''\n       Improve Single Audit Reporting--The bill would greatly \n     improve the usefulness of single audit reports by requiring \n     auditors to provide a summary of audit results. The reports \n     would also be due sooner--9 months after the year-end rather \n     than the current 13 months. Interpretations of current rules \n     lead auditors to include 7 or more separate reports in each \n     single audit report. Such a large number of reports tends to \n     confuse rather than inform users. A summary of the audit \n     results would highlight important information and thus enable \n     users to quickly discern the overall results of an audit. \n     Federal managers surveyed by GAO overwhelmingly support the \n     summary reporting and faster submission of reports.\n       Increase Administrative Flexibility--The bill would enable \n     the single audit process to evolve with changing \n     circumstances. For example, rather than lock specific dollar \n     amount audit thresholds into law, OMB would have the \n     authority to periodically revise the audit threshold above \n     the new $300,000 threshold. OMB also could revise criteria \n     for selecting programs for audit testing. By giving OMB such \n     authority, specific requirements within the single audit \n     process could be revised administratively to reflect changing \n     circumstances that affect accountability for Federal \n     financial assistance.\n       The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (S. 1579) is ``Good \n     Government'' legislation. Based on GAO studies and endorsed \n     by the National State Auditors Association, the bill \n     represents consensus reform legislation that will improve \n     accountability over Federal funds and reduce burdens on State \n     and local governments and nonprofit organizations.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the Single Audit Act \namendments, I am pleased that the Senate is considering this \nlegislation today. S. 1579 would improve accountability over Federal \nassistance provided to State and local governments.\n  The Single Audit Act of 1984 created a uniform requirement for \nFederal audits of individual State and local programs which received \nFederal assistance. It also provided a comprehensive, organizationwide \napproach to single audits. While the act has been a key factor in the \nimprovement of government financial management practices, we have \nlearned alot since the enactment of the act and the passage of time has \nrevealed the need for changes.\n  This bill amends the 1984 act to further reduce unnecessary audit \nburdens on State and local governments and nonprofit organizations \nwhile ensuring accountability and oversight of the use of Federal \nfunds.\n  The bill would place State and local governments, colleges and \nuniversities, and other nonprofit grantees under the same single audit \nprocess. This would allow the Office of Management and Budget to \ndevelop uniform guidelines and auditing requirements.\n  Second, the bill increases the dollar threshold that triggers the \nrequirement for a single audit, from $100,000 to $300,000. This change \nwould reduce audit costs while only minimally reducing audit coverage \nof Federal program expenditures. We would be able to still achieve the \ngoal of 95 percent audit coverage, which was originally included in the \n1984 act.\n  Third, the bill establishes a risk-based approach to determine which \nFederal programs should be audited to allow the Federal, State, and \nlocal auditors the discretion of focusing audit resources where the \npotential for return is the greatest.\n  Fourth, the bill improved the contents and timeliness of single audit \nreports by requiring a summary of audit findings and results and by \nreducing the report due-date from 13 to 9 months to improve the \ntimeliness of report submission. A report prepared closer to the end of \nthe reporting period together with the shorter reporting requirement to \nsubmit a summary of audit findings and results will increase the \nutility of the audit to senior management and Federal program \nofficials.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget to expand and revise audit requirements to ensure continued \neffectiveness of the audit process. This change would allow the Office \nof Management and Budget to adjust auditing thresholds for future \ninflation, and also allow auditors to assess program and management \nperformance.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Glenn for his leadership \non this issue and my colleagues for their support and cooperation in \ngetting this bill to the floor. I would also like to thank the National \nState Auditors Association, the President's Council on Integrity and \nEfficiency, and the General Accounting Office for conducting the \nindependent survey to assess the 1984 act and to determine how it could \nbe improved. Their study results were instrumental in developing this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendments be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be deemed read three \ntimes, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nthat any statements relating thereto appear at an appropriate place in \nthe Record as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1579), as amended, was deemed read the third time and \npassed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1579\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                 ``Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 265\n\n       ``Whereas, an excellent highway network is vitally \n     important to Michigan's economic well-being. All of the \n     components of the State's economy are closely tied to the \n     quality of the roadways used in transporting goods, services, \n     and people throughout Michigan; and\n       ``Whereas, Michigan's ability to maintain our \n     transportation infrastructure is seriously impaired by the \n     current policies of the federal government with regard to the \n     federal gas tax each individual and business pays with every \n     gallon of gasoline purchased. This unfair system costs the \n     state hundreds of millions of dollars each year. The result \n     is an increasing problem with the conditions of our roads and \n     bridges; and\n       ``Whereas, the largest element of the overall gas tax is \n     the federal gas tax, which represents 18.4 cents of each \n     dollar of gasoline sold. Of all of the states required to \n     forward taxes to the federal government each year, Michigan \n     ranks among the lowest in the ratio of gas tax revenues being \n     returned to the citizens who paid the tax. In 1993, for \n     example, $733.7 million was paid to the Federal Highway Trust \n     Fund, and only $520.1 million was returned, a loss of $213.6 \n     million, a loss that sets Michigan at a distinct disadvantage \n     when making road improvements. Considering the inequitable \n     manner in which this money is reallocated to the states of \n     the union, it is clear that Michigan is bearing an oppressive \n     burden through this taxation, a development of the tax \n     structure that must be changed; and\n       ``Whereas, adding to Michigan's tremendous burden, during \n     the years 1990-1995, our state contributed $1.168 billion to \n     federal deficit reduction, dollars that were initially \n     collected to improve transportation routes in Michigan. This \n     amount comprises approximately 20 percent of the total amount \n     levied on Michigan citizens for the years 1990-1995. In \n     addition, by 1999 Michigan's total contributions to deficit \n     reduction are expected to total $2.099 billion, an amount \n     that would certainly enable us to better maintain our roads \n     and highways; and\n       ``Whereas, clearly, Michigan is at a great disadvantage \n     with states that receive far higher returns on their gas tax \n     dollars marked for road improvements. In effect, we are \n     subsidizing transportation maintenance and projects elsewhere \n     when improvements are so desperately needed in our own state; \n     and\n       ``Whereas, with the new approaches to budgetary matters in \n     Washington and a renewed willingness to examine the true \n     costs of all spending policies, the time is right to remedy \n     this unjust situation; now, therefore, be it\n       ``Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That we urgently and respectfully request the \n     Congress of the United States to return to Michigan all of \n     the revenue from the federal gas tax collected in Michigan; \n     and be it further\n       ``Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted \n     to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, and to each \n     member of the Michigan congressional delegation with the \n     Request that each member review this issue and offer a formal \n     response to this body, the Michigan State Senate.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 ``Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 266\n\n       ``Whereas, the quality of Michigan roadways has a great \n     deal to do with the state's competitiveness in attracting and \n     retaining jobs for our citizens. Every individual and every \n     business in Michigan is affected when Michigan roads suffer \n     from insufficient maintenance. Finding the means to meet this \n     financial challenge is of the utmost importance to both state \n     and local policymakers as we prepare for the twenty-first \n     century; and\n       ``Whereas, the difficult task of providing excellence in \n     transportation in Michigan is made far worse by some of the \n     current practices of the federal government with regard to \n     the allocation of money raised by the federal gas tax; and\n       ``Whereas, the current practices of the federal government \n     with regards to the allocation of dollars raised by the \n     federal tax make it difficult for Michigan to improve and \n     expand its transportation system.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to correct \nthe treatment of tax-exempt financing of professional sports \nfacilities; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              THE STOP TAX-EXEMPT ARENA DEBT ISSUANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two tax bills. \nThe first, the section 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Organizations Tax-Exempt \nBond Reform Act of 1996, has been introduced several times previously \nby this Senator, with several of my distinguished colleagues as \ncosponsors. It would undo what ought never have been done: the \nclassification of bonds of private nonprofit higher education \ninstitutions and other nonprofit organizations as those of a private \nactivity. I reintroduce this legislation today because of its critical \nimportance, and because we have found a particularly appropriate \noffset: The Stop Tax-Exempt Arena Debt Issuance Act, which I introduce \ntoday for the first time.\n  The Stop Tax-Exempt Arena Debt Issuance Act would close a gaping \nloophole. Recently, a spate of tax-exempt bonds have been issued to \nfinance professional sports facilities, even though Congress acted to \nproscribe this practice in 1986. The bill would eliminate this tax-\nsubsidized financing of professional sports facilities.\n  Taken together, these two bills correct a serious misallocation of \nour limited resources under present law: a tax subsidy that inures \nlargely to the benefit of wealthy sports franchise owners would be \nreplaced with increased funding for educational and research facilities \nat private colleges and universities.\n  Let me briefly describe the two measures:\n\n\n the section 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations tax-exempt bond reform \n                              act of 1996\n\n  The first bill would remove the ``private activity'' label from the \ntax-exempt bonds of private, nonprofit higher education institutions \nand other organizations, and thereby eliminate the arbitrary $150 \nmillion cap on the amount of tax-exempt bonds that such an institution \nmay have outstanding.\n  The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposed the ``private activity'' label on \nbonds issued on behalf of nonprofit institutions, collectively known as \nsection 501(c)(3) organizations, obscuring the longstanding recognition \nin the Internal Revenue Code of the public purposes served by these \nprivate institutions. Prior to that time, the tax law historically had \ntreated private nonprofit colleges and universities essentially the \nsame as governmental entities. Governmental units and section 501(c)(3) \norganizations were both classified as ``exempt persons,'' and were \nafforded the benefits of tax-exempt bonds on the same basis. This was \nan explicit recognition in the Tax Code of the public purposes served \nby private nonprofit institutions of higher learning.\n  The 1986 act's elimination of the ``exempt person'' category and the \nclassification of section 501(c)(3) organizations' bonds as ``private \nactivity'' bonds was a serious error. It has relegated private higher \neducation institutions to a diminished, restricted status. Most \nsignificant among the restrictions imposed in the 1986 act was the $150 \nmillion limitation on the amount of bonds that any nonprofit \ninstitution--other than a hospital--may have outstanding. We were \nsuccessful in 1986 in keeping other ``private activity'' bond \nstrictures from being imposed on nonprofits--the minimum tax and \nstatewide volume caps, for example.\n  Now we must rectify our error, remove the ``private activity'' label, \nand restore equal access to tax-exempt financing. If we do not act \nsoon, the vitality of our private institutions in higher education and \nresearch will be at risk. A distinguishing feature of American society \nis the singular degree to which we maintain an independent sector--\n``private universit[ies] in the public service,'' to paraphrase the \nmotto of New York University. This is no longer so in most of the \ndemocratic world; it never was so in the rest. It is a treasure and a \nphenomenon that has clearly produced excellence--indeed, the envy of \nthe world. We must insure the strength of the independent sector by \nrestoring parity of treatment for tax-exempt finance. Otherwise, in 20 \nyears, we will look up and find we have lost a unique feature of \nAmerican democracy of inestimable value.\n  The sciences are now capital intensive undertakings. The need for \ncapital for university research facilities is\n\n[[Page S6306]]\n\nacute and critical. In 1990, the National Science Foundation estimated \nthat for every $1 spent for maintenance of university research \nfacilities, an additional $4.25 was deferred. As for new construction, \nthe Foundation reports that for every $1 spent, another $3.11 in needed \nnew construction was deferred in 1990.\n  The practical effect of the $150 million cap is to deny tax-exempt \nfinancing to large, private, research-oriented educational institutions \nmost in need of capital to carry out their research mission. This will \nhave a predictable, inevitable impact over a generation: the \ndistribution of major research among the leading institutions in this \ncountry will profoundly change. If I may use an example from \nCalifornia: with this kind of differential in capital costs, we could \nlook up one day and find Stanford to be still an institution of the \ngreatest quality as an undergraduate teaching facility--with a fine law \nschool and excellent liberal arts degree program--but with all the big \nscience projects at Berkeley, the State institution.\n\n  This is not hyperbole. Already, 31-private colleges and universities \nare at or near the $150 million cap, and foreclosed from using tax-\nexempt debt. A few years ago, as the $150 million cap was beginning to \ntake effect, 19 of the universities that ranked in the top 50 in \nresearch undertaking were private institutions. Now, only 14 of those \n19 private institutions remain in the top 50, and all but 1 are \nforeclosed from tax-exempt financing as a result of the $150 million \nper institution limit.\n  This legislation will restore the status of private nonprofit \ninstitutions of higher learning, making their access to tax-exempt \nfinancing equal to that of their public counterparts. The legislation \nalso reestablishes recognition in the Tax Code of the essential public \npurposes served by private nonprofit institutions.\n  Mr. President, the capital needs of private universities merit the \nvery serious attention of this body. The cost of these changes is \nmodest, given their importance. The staff of the Joint Committee on \nTaxation has estimated the revenue loss previously at $308 million over \n5 years. The Senate has twice passed legislation to reverse the $150 \nmillion bond cap mistake--in the Family Tax Fairness, Economic Growth, \nand Health Care Access Act of 1992 (H.R. 4210) and the Revenue Act of \n1992 (H.R. 11)--only to have both bills vetoed by President Bush. We \nshould correct this error before it is too late. If we do not, we will \nsoon not recognize the higher education sector.\n\n\n  The Stop Tax-exempt Arena Debt Issuance Act--A Bill to Correct the \n  Treatment of Tax-exempt Financing of Professional Sports Facilities\n\n  Mr. President, the second bill is an especially appropriate offset \nfor the first bill and is an important piece of legislation in its own \nright.\n  This legislation will close a big loophole, a loophole that \nultimately injures State and local governments and other issuers of tax \nexempt bonds, that provides an unintended Federal subsidy (in fact, \ncontravenes congressional intent), and that contributes to the \nenrichment of persons who need no Federal assistance whatsoever.\n  I refer to the large number of professional sports facilities \nsubsidized in recent years through the issuance of tax-exempt bonds. It \nseems that nearly every day, another professional sports franchise \nowner demands a new stadium, one subsidized by Federal, State and local \ntaxpayers.\n  Why do owners want new stadiums? Our existing stock of stadiums is \nnot functionally obsolete. Many stadiums are new, and our older ones \ngenerally can and will continue to serve, and serve well, for the \nexhibition of professional sports for years to come. In fact many \nolder, historic stadiums are beloved by fans. The reason for new \nstadiums is economics--the team owners' bottom line. The owner can \ngenerate more revenues with a new stadium replete with luxury skyboxes \nand other amenities.\n  Building new professional sports facilities is fine by me. Let the \nnew stadiums be built. But, please, do not ask the American taxpayer to \npay for them.\n  Prior to 1984, professional sports stadiums could be completely \nfinanced with tax-exempt, ``private activity'' bonds (or industrial \ndevelopment bonds as they were formerly known). In the Deficit \nReduction Act of 1984, Congress stipulated that tax-exempt bond \nproceeds could not be used to finance the construction of luxury \nskyboxes. And in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, we fundamentally \nrestructured the tax-exempt bond provisions of the Internal Revenue \nCode. As part of that effort, we repealed the ``private activity'' bond \ncategory for stadium bonds, intending to eliminate tax-exempt financing \nof professional sports facilities altogether.\n\n  Unfortunately, Congress did not address the issue of whether stadium \nbonds could be issued as governmental bonds because that possibility \nwas too remote to have occurred to us. And in our silence, a loophole \nwas born. Innovative bond counsel have devised aggressive schemes to \nfinance stadiums with tax-exempt, governmental purpose bonds. So this \nlegislation is corrective. It will put an end to a practice we thought \nwe had stopped in 1986.\n  The history of the changes made by the 1986 act reveals why the use \nof tax-exempt financing for professional sports facilities is a \nloophole that should be closed. In May 1985, President Reagan issued a \nreport recommending that tax-exempt bonds be limited to traditional \ngovernmental purposes. In December 1985, the House largely adopted the \nReagan administration's recommendations for tax-exempt bond reform. The \nSenate was of course not inclined to go as far as the House. The 1986 \nact, as it emerged from conference, reflected a compromise between the \nHouse and Senate. We allowed States and local governments to continue \nto issue tax-exempt bonds for traditional governmental purposes, such \nas schools, roads, bridges. At the same time, we limited the issuance \nof tax-exempt bonds for private activities to a short list of projects \nwith significant public benefits, even though carried out with private \nownership. And we subjected private activity bonds to other significant \nlimitations, chief among them being a unified, statewide volume \nlimitation.\n  Why did Congress make these changes? Why did the Reagan \nadministration propose curtailing the use of tax-exempt bonds? We were \nall concerned with the large and increasing volume of tax-exempt bonds, \nincluding an increasing percentage of industrial development bonds that \nwere being issued at that time to subsidize private business \nactivities.\n  The increasing proliferation of tax-exempt bonds led to a number of \nproblems. First, it drove up interest costs. Larger interest costs \ndrove up the cost of financing roads, bridges, and other items \ntraditionally financed with tax-exempt bonds, and meant that State and \nlocal governments had to increase taxes or reduce services in order to \npay for these improvements--or forego improvements.\n  Second, the proliferation of tax-exempt bonds led to mounting revenue \nlosses to the U.S. Treasury. The Congressional Research Service \nrecently reported that from 1980 to 1985, the annual amount of foregone \ntax revenue from tax exempt bonds had risen 236 percent to $18.2 \nbillion.\n  Third, the use of taxpayer-subsidized financing for a rapidly growing \nnumber of private business activities resulted in an inefficient \nallocation of capital. Investment decisions were being made on the \nbasis of which projects qualified for tax-exempt financing, rather than \non the economic viability of the underlying project.\n  Fourth, taxpayers were able to shield a growing amount of their \ninvestment income from income tax by purchasing tax-exempt bonds. We \nhad become very concerned with a number of tax sheltering activities \nduring the 1980's and the undermining effect such activities had on our \ntax system.\n  So in 1986, we fundamentally restructured the tax exempt bond rules. \nAnd one of the things we did was prohibit the issuance of tax-exempt \nbonds to finance sports stadiums. Or so we thought.\n  Once again, under a loophole in the law, professional sports team \nowners are financing newer and more luxurious stadiums with tax-exempt \nstadium bonds. Cities are promising new stadiums, with dozens of luxury \nskyboxes, to entice professional sports teams to relocate. Should the \ntaxpayers in the team's current home town be forced to pay for the \nteam's new stadium in a new city? The answer is unmistakably no.\n\n[[Page S6307]]\n\n  Mr. President, this is extraordinary. Particularly when compared to \nthe limitations we place on private activity bonds, and these stadium \nbonds assuredly are private activity bonds in fact if not in name. Most \nStates cannot issue more than $150 million of private activity bonds \nper year. However, no limit is imposed on the amount of bond financing \nthat can be used to finance a professional sports facility. Where is \nthe private activity bond prohibition against building luxury skyboxes \nwith tax-exempt bond proceeds? Where is the private activity bond \nprovision that subjects the interest on stadium bonds to the \nalternative minimum tax? Where are all of the other limitations on \nprivate activity bonds that we have judged are necessary? They \napparently do not apply to these new stadium bonds.\n  And the situation is also unfair when compared to the restrictions we \nimpose on the ability of our private, nonprofit educational \ninstitutions to issue tax-exempt debt. New York University can only \nissue $150 million in tax-exempt debt to finance its facilities in \nManhattan. Stanford, Boston College, University of Miami, Northwestern \nUniversity, Emory, Georgetown, University of Pennsylvania--these are a \nfew of the institutions that can no longer issue tax-exempt debt to \nfinance their laboratories, classrooms, and other facilities that are \nessential to our private institutions of higher education.\n  The Congressional Research Service issued a critical report late last \nmonth on the new stadium bonds, and concluded that the federal tax \nsubsidy inherent in tax-exempt bond financing is not justified:\n\n       Proponents argue that these stadium's economic benefits \n     justify the subsidies. Economic analysis suggests this is not \n     the case. One study found that a new stadium had no \n     discernible impact on economic development in 27 of 30 \n     metropolitan areas, and had a negative impact in the other \n     three areas. The reason for this can be illustrated with the \n     Baltimore football stadium proposal. Economic benefits were \n     overstated by 236%, primarily because the reduced spending on \n     other activities that enables people to attend stadium events \n     was not netted against stadium spending. And no account was \n     taken of losses incurred by foregoing more productive \n     investments. The state's $177 million stadium investment is \n     estimated to create 1,394 jobs at a cost of $127,000 per job. \n     The cost per job generated by the state's Sunny Day Fund \n     economic development program is estimated to be $6,250. The \n     economic case against federal subsidy of stadiums is \n     stronger. Almost all stadium spending is spending that would \n     have been made on other activities within the United States, \n     which means benefits to the Nation as a whole are near zero.\n\n  The report continues by citing several problems caused by the change \nin treatment of tax-exempt bonds for stadiums made by the Tax Reform \nAct of 1986:\n\n       It continues stadium financing as an open-ended matching \n     grant for which the magnitude of the federal subsidy in any \n     given year is determined without the input of federal \n     officials and federal taxpayers; it virtually requires state-\n     local governments to offer more favorable lease terms to its \n     professional tenants; and it requires state-local governments \n     to finance their subsidy with general revenue sources rather \n     than benefit-type payments such as stadium-related user \n     charges and rents.\n\n  Finally, what makes the new spate of stadium bonds all the more \negregious is the price that we paid to end this practice in the first \nplace. The realities of the legislative process in 1986 required that \nwe provide extraordinarily generous transition relief to those persons \nplanning to build such facilities at that time. We wrote special rules \nthat allowed the tax-exempt financing of ``virtually every stadium in \nthe planning or gleam-in-the-eye stages,'' as described in the \naforementioned Congressional Research Service report. First, we allowed \nall proposed sports stadiums with binding commitments to issue tax-\nexempt bonds, as they had planned. In addition, additional transitional \nrelief was provided to allow the issuance of up to $2.7 billion in tax-\nexempt bonds for the construction and repair of 25 specifically \ndescribed sports facilities that were too preliminary in their \ndevelopment to satisfy the transition rules.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing will do what we \nintended to do, and thought we did, in 1986. This legislation makes \nclear that professional sports facilities may not be financed with tax-\nexempt bonds.\n  There are a few technical issues on which I would like to solicit \ncomments. First, the proposed effective date would be today. Perhaps it \nshould be made effective on October 22, 1986, the day President Reagan \nsigned the Tax Reform Act of 1986 into law and we prohibited the \nissuance of stadium bonds in the first place. After all, this bill is, \nin a sense, a ``technical correction.'' Nevertheless, I would like to \nconsider the need for equitable relief for stadiums already in the \nplanning stages.\n  Second, a number of sports facilities that are not built for a \nprofessional sports franchise will be used for the occasional \ncharitable or isolated sporting event. Thus, charitable or de minimis \nuse exceptions to this legislation may be appropriate.\n  Mr. President, these two bills, taken together, would correct a \nserious misallocation of our limited resources. Should we subsidize \nprofessional sports franchises and underwrite bidding wars among cities \nseeking (or fighting to keep) professional sports franchises, or should \nwe act to prevent a significant decline in the ability of our \nnonprofit, private research universities to attract capital for \nclassrooms and research facilities? To my mind, this is not a difficult \nchoice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two bills be printed \nin the Record, along with explanatory statements.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1879\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

   ____\n\n\nSection 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Organization Tax-Exempt Bond Reform Act of \n                                  1996\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Interest on State and local governmental bonds generally is \n     excluded from income if the bonds are issued to finance \n     direct activities of these governments (sec. 103). Interest \n     on bonds issued by these governments to finance activities of \n     other persons, e.g., private activity bonds, is taxable \n     unless a specific exception is included in the Code. One such \n     exception is for private activity bonds issued to finance \n     activities of private, charitable organizations described in \n     Code section 501(c)(3) (``section 501(c)(3) organizations'') \n     when the activities do not constitute an unrelated trade or \n     business (sec. 141(e)(1)(G)).\n\n   Classification of section 501(c)(3) organization bonds as private \n                             activity bonds\n\n       Before enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, States and \n     local governments and section 501(c)(3) organizations were \n     defined as ``exempt persons,'' under the Code bond \n     provisions. As exempt persons, section 501(c)(3) \n     organizations were not treated as ``private'' persons, and \n     their bonds were not ``industrial development bonds'' or \n     ``private loan bonds'' (the predecessor categories to current \n     private activity bonds). Under present law, a bond is a \n     private activity bond if its proceeds are used in a manner \n     violating either (a) a private business test or (b) a private \n     loan test. The private business test is a conjunctive two-\n     pronged test. First, the test limits private business use of \n     governmental bonds to no more than 10 percent of the \n     proceeds.\\1\\ Second, no more than 10 percent of the debt \n     service on the bonds may be secured by or derived from \n     private business users of the proceeds. The private loan test \n     limits to the lesser of 5 percent or $5 million the amount of \n     governmental bond proceeds that may be used to finance loans \n     to persons other than governmental units.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ No more than 5 percent of bond proceeds may be used in a \n     private business use that is unrelated to the governmental \n     purpose of the bond issue. The 10-percent debt service test, \n     described below, likewise is reduced to 5 percent in the case \n     of such ``disproportionate'' private business use.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      Special restrictions on tax-exemption for section 501(c)(3) \n                           organization bonds\n\n       Present law treats section 501(c)(3) organizations as \n     private persons; thus, bonds for their use may only be issued \n     as private activity ``qualified 501(c)(3) bonds,'' subject to \n     the restrictions of Code section 145. The most significant of \n     these restrictions limits the amount of outstanding bonds \n     from which a section 501(c)(3) organization may benefit to \n     $150 million. In applying this ``$150 million limit,'' all \n     section 501(c)(3) organizations under common management or \n     control are treated as a single organization. The limit does \n     not apply to bonds for hospital facilities, defined to \n     include only acute care, primarily inpatient, organizations. \n     A second restriction limits to no more than five percent the \n     amount of the net proceeds of a bond issue that may be used \n     to finance any activities (including all costs of issuing the \n     bonds) other than the exempt purposes of the section \n     501(c)(3) organization.\n       Legislation enacted in 1988 imposed low-income tenant \n     occupancy restrictions on existing residential rental \n     property that is acquired by section 501(c)(3) organizations \n     in tax-exempt-bond-financed transactions. These restrictions \n     require that a minimum number of the housing units comprising \n     the property be continuously occupied by tenants having \n     family incomes of 50 percent (60 percent in certain cases) of \n     area median income for periods of up to 15 years. These same \n     low-income tenant occupancy requirements apply to for-profit \n     developers receiving tax-exempt private activity bond \n     financing.\n\n                           Other restrictions\n\n       Several restrictions are imposed on private activity bonds \n     generally that do not apply to bonds used to finance State \n     and local government activities. Many of these restrictions \n     also apply to qualified 501(c)(3) bonds. No more than two \n     percent of the proceeds of a bond issue may be used to \n     finance the costs of issuing the bonds, and these monies are \n     not counted in determining whether the bonds satisfy the \n     requirement that at least 95 percent of the net proceeds of \n     each bond issue be used for the exempt activities qualifying \n     the bonds for tax-exemption.\n       The weighted average maturity of a bond issue may not \n     exceed 120 percent of the average economic life of the \n     property financed with the proceeds. A public hearing must be \n     held and an elected public official must approve the bonds \n     before they are issued (or the bonds must be approved by \n     voter referendum).\n       If property financed with private activity bonds is \n     converted to a use not qualifying for tax-exempt financing, \n     certain loan interest penalties are imposed.\n       Both governmental and private activity bonds are subject to \n     numerous other Code restrictions, including the following:\n       1. The amount of arbitrage profits that may be earned on \n     tax-exempt bonds is strictly limited, and most such profits \n     must be rebated to the Federal Government;\n       2. Banks may not deduct interest they pay to the extent of \n     their investments in most tax-exempt bonds; and\n       3. Interest on private activity bonds, other than qualified \n     501(c)(3) bonds, is a preference item in calculating the \n     alternative minimum tax.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       A distinguishing feature of American society is the \n     singular degree to which the United States maintains a \n     private, non-profit sector of private higher education, \n     health care, and other charitable institutions in the public \n     service. It is important to assist these private institutions \n     in their advancement of the public good. The restrictions of \n     present law place these section 501(c)(3) organizations at a \n     financial disadvantage relative to substantially identical \n     governmental institutions, and are particularly \n     inappropriate. For example, private, non-profit research \n     universities are subject to the $150 million limitation on \n     outstanding bonds, whereas State-sponsored universities \n     competing for the same research projects do not operate \n     under a comparable restriction. A public hospital \n     generally has unlimited access to tax-exempt bond \n     financing, while a private, non-profit hospital is subject \n     to a $150 million limitation on outstanding bonds to the \n     extent the bonds finance health care facilities that do \n     not qualify under the present-law definition of hospital. \n     These and other restrictions inhibit the ability of \n     America's private, non-profit institutions to modernize \n     their health care facilities and to build state-of-the-art \n     research facilities for the advancement of science, \n     medicine, and other educational endeavors.\n       Inhibiting the access of private, non-profit research \n     institutions to sources of capital financing, in relation to \n     their public counterparts, distorts the distribution of major \n     research among the leading institutions, and over time will \n     lead to the decline of research undertakings by private, non-\n     profit universities. The tax-exempt bond rules should reduce \n     these distortions by treating more equally State and local \n     governments and those private organizations which are engaged \n     in similar actions advancing the public good.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill amends the tax-exempt bond provisions of the Code \n     to conform generally the treatment of bonds for section \n     501(c)(3) organizations to that provided for bonds issued to \n     finance direct State or local government activities, \n     including construction of public hospitals and university \n     facilities. Certain restrictions, described below, that have \n     been imposed on qualified 501(c)(3) bonds (but not on \n     governmental bonds) since 1986, and that address specialized \n     policy concerns, are retained.\n\n Repeal of private activity bond classification for bonds for section \n                        501(c)(3) organizations\n\n       The concept of an ``exempt person'' that existed under the \n     Code bond provisions before 1986, is reenacted. An exempt \n     person is defined as (a) a State or local governmental unit \n     or (b) a section 501(c)(3) organization, when carrying out \n     its exempt activities under Code section 501(a). Thus, bonds \n     for section 501(c)(3) organizations are generally no longer \n     classified as private activity bonds. Financing for unrelated \n     business activities of such organizations continue to be \n     treated as a private activity for which tax-exempt financing \n     is not authorized.\n       As exempt persons, section 501(c)(3) organizations are \n     subject to the same limits as States and local governments on \n     using their bond proceeds to finance private business \n     activities or to make private loans. Thus, generally no more \n     than 10 percent of the bond proceeds \\2\\ can be used in a \n     business use of a person other than an exempt person if the \n     Code private payment test is satisfied, and no more than 5 \n     percent ($5 million if less) can be used to make loans to \n     such ``nonexempt'' persons.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ This limit would be reduced to 5 percent in the case of \n     disproportionate private use as under the present-law \n     governmental bond disproportionate private use limit.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Repeal of most additional special restrictions on section 501(c)(3) \n                           organization bonds\n\n       Present Code section 145, which establishes additional \n     restrictions on qualified 501(c)(3) bonds, is repealed, along \n     with the restriction on bond-financed costs of issuance for \n     section 501(c)(3) organization bonds (sec. 147(h)). This \n     eliminates the $150 million limit on non-hospital bonds for \n     section 501(c)(3) organizations.\n\n  Retention of certain specialized requirements for section 501(c)(3) \n                           organization bonds\n\n       The bill retains certain specialized restrictions on bonds \n     for section 501(c)(3) organizations. First, the bill retains \n     the requirement that existing residential rental property \n     acquired by a section 501(c)(3) organization in a tax-exempt-\n     bond-financed transaction satisfy the same low-income tenant \n     requirements as similar housing financing for for-\n\n[[Page S6310]]\n\n     profit developers. Second, the bill retains the present-law \n     maturity limitations applicable to bonds for section \n     501(c)(3) organizations, and the public approval requirements \n     applicable generally to private activity bonds. Third, the \n     bill continues to apply the penalties on changes in use of \n     tax-exempt-bond-financed section 501(c)(3) organization \n     property to a use not qualified for such financing.\n       Finally, the bill makes no amendments, other than technical \n     conforming amendments, to the tax-exempt arbitrage \n     restrictions, the alternative minimum tax tax-exempt bond \n     preference, or the provisions generally disallowing interest \n     paid by banks on monies used to acquire or carry tax-exempt \n     bonds.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is generally effective with respect to bonds \n     issued and to capital expenditures made after the date of \n     enactment. The provision does not apply to bonds issued prior \n     to January 1, 1997 for the purposes of applying the rebate \n     requirements under Section 148(f)(4)(D).\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                                S. 1880\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Tax-Exempt Arena Debt \n     Issuance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TREATMENT OF TAX-EXEMPT FINANCING OF PROFESSIONAL \n                   SPORTS FACILITIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 141 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (defining private activity bond and qualified bond) \n     is amended by redesignating subsection (e) as subsection (f) \n     and by inserting after subsection (d) the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(e) Certain Issues Used for Professional Sports \n     Facilities Treated as Private Activity Bonds.--\n       ``(1) In general.--For purposes of this title, the term \n     `private activity bond' includes any bond issued as part of \n     an issue if the amount of the proceeds of the issue which are \n     to be used (directly or indirectly) to provide professional \n     sports facilities exceeds the lesser of--\n       ``(A) 5 percent of such proceeds, or\n       ``(B) $5,000,000.\n       ``(2) Bond not treated as a qualified bond.--For purposes \n     of this title, any bond described in paragraph (1) shall not \n     be a qualified bond.\n       ``(3) Professional sports facilities.--For purposes of this \n     subsection--\n       ``(A) In general.--The term `professional sports \n     facilities' means real property or related improvements used \n     for professional sports exhibitions, games, or training, \n     regardless if the admission of the public or press is allowed \n     or paid.\n       ``(B) Use for professional sports.--Any use of facilities \n     which generates a direct or indirect monetary benefit (other \n     than reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses) for a person \n     who uses such facilities for professional sports exhibitions, \n     games, or training shall be treated as a use described in \n     subparagraph (A).\n       ``(4) Anti-abuse regulations.--The Secretary shall \n     prescribe such regulations as may be appropriate to carry out \n     the purposes of this subsection, including such regulations \n     as may be appropriate to prevent avoidance of such purposes \n     through related persons, use of related facilities or \n     multiuse complexes, or otherwise.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to bonds issued on or after June 14, 1996.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              The Stop Tax-exempt Arena Debt Issuance Act\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Interest on State and local governmental bonds generally is \n     excluded from income if the bonds are issued to finance \n     direct activities of these governments (sec. 103). Interest \n     on bonds issued by these governments to finance activities of \n     other persons, e.g., private activity bonds, is taxable \n     unless the bonds satisfy certain requirements. Private \n     activity bonds must be within certain statewide volume \n     limitations, must not violate the arbitrage and other \n     applicable restrictions, and must finance activities within \n     one of the categories specified in the Code. The Tax Reform \n     Act of 1986 repealed the private activity bond category for \n     sports facilities; therefore no private activity bonds may be \n     issued for this purpose.\n       Bonds issued by State and local governments are considered \n     to be government use bonds, unless the bonds are classified \n     as private activity bonds. Bonds are deemed to be private \n     activity bonds if both the (i) private business use test and \n     (ii) private security or payment test are met. The private \n     business use test is met if more than 10 percent of the bond \n     proceeds, including facilities financed with the bond \n     proceeds, is used in a non-governmental trade or business. \n     The private security or payment test is met if more than 10 \n     percent of the bond repayments is secured by privately used \n     property, or is derived from the payments of private business \n     users. Additionally, bonds are deemed to be private activity \n     bonds if more than 5 percent of the bond proceeds or $5 \n     million are used to finance loans to persons other than \n     governmental units.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       The use of tax-exempt financing for professional sports \n     facilities provides an indirect and inefficient federal tax \n     subsidy. Congress intended to eliminate this subsidy for \n     professional sports facilities in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, \n     by repealing the private activity bond category for sports \n     facilities. The use of government bonds to finance the \n     identical underlying private business use is an unintended \n     and improper use of a federal subsidy, and an abuse of the \n     government bond rules. In addition, the use of tax-exempt \n     bonds to finance professional sports facilities is \n     particularly inappropriate where the facilities to be built \n     are used to entice professional sports franchises to \n     relocate.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill would provide that bonds issued to finance \n     professional sports facilities are private activity bonds, \n     and that such bonds are not qualified bonds. Therefore, \n     professional sports facilities will not qualify for tax-\n     exempt bond financing.\n       A professional sports facility is defined to include real \n     property and related improvements which are used for \n     professional sports exhibitions, games, or training, whether \n     or not admission of the public or press is allowed or paid. \n     In addition, a facility that is used for purpose other than \n     professional sports will nevertheless be treated as being \n     used for professional sports if the facility generates a \n     direct or indirect monetary benefit (other than reimbursement \n     for out-of-pocket expenses) for a person who uses the \n     facility for professional sports. These benefits are intended \n     to include an interest in revenues from parking fees, food \n     and beverage sales, advertising and sports facility naming \n     rights, television rights, ticket sales, private suites and \n     club seats, and concessions.\n       The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to issue anti-\n     abuse regulations to prevent transactions intended to \n     improperly divert the indirect Federal subsidy for \n     traditional governmental uses inherent in tax-exempt bonds \n     for the benefit of professional sports facilities or \n     professional sports teams. It is intended that no tax-exempt \n     bond proceeds may finance a ball park used for professional \n     sports exhibitions, even if the ball park is made a part of a \n     larger multi-use complex used 365 days a year for other \n     purposes. In addition, it is intended that reciprocal usage \n     of sports facilities by professional sports franchises that \n     divide their usage among several facilities in order to avoid \n     the 5 percent use test be aggregated for purposes of this \n     provision.\n       No inference is intended regarding the rules under present \n     law regarding the issuance or holding of, or interest paid or \n     accrued on, any bonds issued prior to the effective date of \n     this bill to finance sports facilities.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective with respect to bonds issued on \n     or after June 14, 1996.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6305-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6310-S6311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                S. 1460\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Boxer, the name of the Senator from Maryland \n[Mr. Sarbanes] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1460, a bill to amend the \nMarine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to support the International \nDolphin Conservation Program in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1627\n\n  At the request of Mr. Johnston, the names of the Senator from \nLouisiana [Mr. Breaux], and the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 1627, a bill to designate the visitor center \nat Jean Lafitte National Historical Park in New Orleans, Louisiana as \nthe ``Laura C.

As an original cosponsor of S. \n1276, the Landmine Moratorium Extension Act, and having long supported \nmeasures to prevent the proliferation of landmines, I regret that the \nPresident did not take a stronger stance on banning the use of \nlandmines, but instead equivocated, and again put off the ultimate U.S. \ngoal of eliminating landmines. These weapons effect mainly innocent \ncivilians, and in the case of so-called dumb mines, remain dangerous \nand threaten civilian populations indefinitely, often long after \nhostilities in an area have stopped. Such weapons make agriculture \ndangers, and hence hinder economic reconstruction and development.\n  For the United States to play the role the President professes to \nseek, that of leading the world to negotiating an end to the use of \nlandmines, the United States needs to match its rhetoric with actions. \nIt is my hope that the U.S. Government will soon take action to do just \nthat, and move quickly and concretely to rid the world of the scourge \nof landmines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/14/senate-section/article/S6311-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JUNE 18, 1996\n\n  Mr. MACK.
