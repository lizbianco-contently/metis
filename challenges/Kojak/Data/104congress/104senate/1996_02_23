Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the relationship \nbetween the United States and China.\n  Last summer the Aspen Strategy Group--cochaired by Ken Dam and \nmyself--under Director Michael Armacost and Associate Director Bruce \nBerkowitz met in Aspen, CO, for 4 days. We had an intensive and \nproductive discussion with a number of China experts participating, \nincluding Michel Okensberg, Chas. Freeman, and Stapleton Roy. The views \nof all three of these American China experts and my subsequent \ndiscussions with Michel Oksenberg, Charles Freeman, and others have \nbeen very helpful in my own analysis of United States-China relations.\n  I also made a recent trip to Asia that included a stimulating and \ninformative forum in Malaysia sponsored by the Asia Policy Group under \nthe leadership of Doug Paal and hosted by the Deputy Prime Minister of \nMalaysia, Anwar Ibrahim. during this conference--attended by Senator \nKit Bond, Senator Bill Cohen, and myself from the Congress--we had \nbroad and stimulating \n\n[[Page S1286]]\ndiscussions with government and business leaders from the ASEAN \ncountries and the entire Pacific region. Some of those discussions \nincluded China, but the agenda was much broader than just China.\n  I have greatly benefited from these meetings and discussions with \nDeputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and the other leaders from \nthroughout the region and with Doug Paal, who led our group. During my \ntrip to Asia, I joined Senator Dianne Feinstein and Senator John Glenn \nin China for a series of meetings with top Chinese leadership.\n  Mr. President, the growing importance of China in world affairs \ndemands a purposeful, coherent, and consistent American policy toward \nChina. History is littered with the uninformed and ineffective \nresponses of an established power toward a rising power. often the \nrising power suffered from its own ambitions seeking to accelerate its \nrise through military means. In modern history, we need only recall the \npre-World War II rise of Germany and Japan and the former Soviet Union \nand the opportunities and mistakes our country and the free world made \nin coping with their rise.\n  History should teach us that established powers must provide \nconsistent and credible signals about their expectations and set forth \nreasonable terms on which they are willing to incorporate the rising \npower into the international system.\n  We are now watching the rise of China--a development of at least \nequal historical significance and implication as the rise of Russia, \nGermany, and Japan. This is occurring with the important background of \nthe rapid industrialization of Asia. Within 25 to 50 years, Mr. \nPresident, the lives of 3.5 billion people who live in the arc from \nKorea to India to Pakistan are being transformed. This development is \nas significant for humanity and for the citizens of our country as the \nRenaissance or the Industrial Revolution which transformed our people \ninto the most productive, wealthy, and free people on Earth. At the \ncenter of Asia's rise is China, a nuclear power with the largest \nmilitary forces in terms of manpower, in the world, and a permanent \nmember of the U.N. Security Council. China is a nation with 1.2 billion \npeople, an economy growing at nearly 10 percent a year for over the \nlast decade, and as we too often forget--a distinctive civilization of \ngreat antiquity.\n\n  China is in the midst of four major transitions:\n  First, from a planned economy to a state-guided market economy.\n  Second, from rule by the Long March revolutionaries who established \nthe Communist regime to a rule by bureaucrats, technocrats, and \nmilitary professionals.\n  Third, from a rural agricultural society to an urban, industrial \nsociety.\n  Fourth, from a largely self-sufficient, largely isolated economy to \none that is moving into the international economy and is increasingly \ndependent upon it.\n  Each of these alone is an enormous transformation. These transitions \nare occurring at varying speeds and with a scope unprecedented in \nhistory.\n  The process and outcome of China's transformations are unknown. Much \nabout the Chinese future is unknown. What will the nature of the \npolitical system be a decade or a generation hence? Will the succession \nto Deng Xiaoping continue to be an orderly one? Will there be \nwidespread social disorder? What about China's military? What will be \nits force structure a decade hence? How is its military doctrine likely \nto evolve as it acquires new weaponry? What are and will be China's \nforeign policy proclivities? Will the Communist Party remain in power? \nWhat are the chances for democratization in China? Can the Central \nGovernment remain in control or will China fragment or break apart, as \nwe saw with the former Soviet Union? What would happen to its nuclear \narsenal under such a situation? There is no consensus on the answers to \nthese questions among the experts, either in or outside the Government.\n  The uncertainty about the Chinese future has several important \nimplications. In light of China's growing importance, it is imperative \nthat our country make a maximum effort to understand it. This entails \nensuring that our Government has sufficient means to collect and \nanalyze information about China, including extensive contact with \nChinese leaders and bureaucrats at the national and provincial levels, \nand certainly people-to-people programs with the Chinese people \nthemselves. President, our Nation must prepare itself intellectually \nfor China's more extensive involvement in world affairs. This is \nabsolutely essential.\n\n  It is difficult to conceive of the international community \neffectively addressing a number of pressing issues such as the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of \ndelivery, international terrorism, and narcotrafficking, environmental \nchallenges, and the regulation of trade, without China's participation.\n  Because of the profound Chinese transition, American engagement is \nessential. We are not likely to significantly affect events over the \nshort run, but--by engaging in dialog about our mutual interests and \nour grievances, by speaking in clear terms in this dialog; by \nparticipating in China's development; by greater military transparency \nbetween our countries; by helping to educate China's next generation of \nintellectuals, which we are doing by assisting it in alleviating some \nof its economic and institutional problems--its evolution is more \nlikely to be in directions favorable to peace and stability in the \nPacific as well as to American interests.\n  China's transition is likely to be protracted. The experts do agree \non one point: Uncertainty is a permanent quality of modern China. Even \nwere China to embark a process that we would call democratization, the \ndevelopment would be a lengthy one. History shows it takes a long time \nto create a legal system, guarantees for private property, a \nparliamentary system, a vigorous and free press, and the political \nculture that can sustain a pluralistic and tolerant civil society. As \nthe American and British experience demonstrates and as we can now see \nin the former Soviet Union, that process takes decades. Not only must \nour expectations be realistic, but we cannot wait to engage extensively \nwith China until it has become more like us or until it has settled \ndown and its future is more certain.\n  Realistically, we must engage with China and its current leaders now \nrather than remaining aloof from this vast, complex, ancient, and proud \ncivilization until it becomes to our liking. In short, China's \ntransition and its potential impels America, insofar as possible, to be \nactors on the scene.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, I visited China last month \nwith Senators Dianne Feinstein and John Glenn. We had an opportunity to \nmeet with President Jiang Zemin, Executive Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, \nMinister of National Defense General Chi Haotian, Vice Foreign Minister \nLi Zhaoxing, and others within China's leadership. We had cordial, \ninformative and frank discussions on a number of issues relating to the \nrelationship between our two countries and stability in the entire \nregion. Our discussions were greatly facilitated by Senator Feinstein's \nlongstanding friendship with President Jiang Zemin, a friendship that \ngrew out of their being mayors of sister cities--San Francisco and \nShanghai at the same time. They had many visits during that period.\n\n  In recent weeks, China has stepped up its military exercises in areas \nclose to Taiwan. It has mobilized a large number of forces on the \nmainland across from Taiwan. There have been credible reports that \nChina has provided nuclear technology to Pakistan in contravention of \nthe Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and its solemn treaty obligations \nto over 150 state parties to the treaty. If those reports are verified, \nsanctions would be triggered automatically under U.S. law, unless they \nare waived by the President.\n  In recent months, China's behavior has raised concerns in Asia and in \nthe United States. The concerns which have been expressed not only in \nthis country, but also in Asia include:\n  China's military expenditures continue to rise along with its \neconomy. It continues to test nuclear weapons despite the protests of \nits neighbors. It has made territorial claims far into the South China \nSea. It has adopted an unyielding posture toward Hong Kong and has \nrepeatedly threatened Taiwan. Its record on missile sales to Pakistan \nis troubling and in probable violation \n\n[[Page S1287]]\nof its assurances to both the Bush and Clinton administrations that it \nwould respect the missile technology control regime [MTCR] even though \nit is not a member. Its human rights record, including the sentencing \nof Wei Jingsheng, raises basic human rights concerns, affronting \nAmerican sense of fairplay as well. And its inability to crack down on \nviolations of trade agreements, including intellectual property \nviolations, raise serious trade concerns. It is certainly possible that \nthese developments which are troubling, are also harbingers of \ndifficult relations between our Nation and China in the months to come.\n  But there are also developments on the other side of the ledger that \nare too often ignored. China has not obstructed U.N. and NATO \npeacekeeping operations and sanctions even though it openly doubted \ntheir appropriateness or efficiency. It has made important \ncontributions to maintaining stability in Korea and in settling the \nCambodian civil war. It continues to expand economic and cultural \nrelations with Taiwan and, until 1995, it was regularly expanding \npeople to people ties to Taiwan and reducing military tensions in the \nstrait. It is in the process of opening itself to foreign direct \ninvestment and to wide-spread consumption of U.S. consumer goods in \nways that go well beyond the opportunities many other Asian countries \nallow. It has announced the reduction of tariffs by 34 percent and \nplans further reductions to the average of developing countries in the \nregion.\n\n  It has modified its social and cultural control over its people, so \nthat its authoritarian government, while still harsh, has moved far \nfrom the reign of terror of the cultural revolution days. While far \nfrom acceptable by our present standards, by every conceivable measure, \nChina's treatment of its own people in 1996 is far better than at the \ntime of President Nixon's opening in 1972 and President Carter's \nnormalization in 1979. In the last 10 years, an enormous number of \nChinese people have moved from poverty to a decent standard of living. \nI will have more to say on the subject of human rights in China in the \nweeks ahead.\n  Mr. President, China has pledged to cease nuclear testing, but not \nbefore the negotiation and entry into effect of a comprehensive test \nban treaty. It has played a quiet but positive role in assisting our \nquest--a very important quest--for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. In \nthe Middle East, the Chinese have now developed ties with the moderate \nstates, including Israel.\n  This combination of welcome and troublesome developments requires a \nUnited States policy that is carefully managed. Unfortunately, the U.S. \nGovernment, the executive branch, as well as Congress, currently have \nnot developed such a policy toward the most populous and the most \nrapidly developing country on Earth. To allow this vacuum to continue \nwould be both irresponsible and dangerous.\n  As we begin to think about a China policy, perhaps we should begin, \nnot just with our litany of concerns about China, but also with some \nunderstanding of their concerns about us. China has its own list of \ngrievances about the United States. Although I believe that most of \nthese complaints are due to misperceptions and misunderstandings, we \nmust be aware that if China's leaders conclude rightly or wrongly that \nthe United States looks upon them as adversaries, they will respond in \nkind. We have a right to demand that the Chinese keep their \nagreements--we must also keep ours.\n  America is seen by many in China as attempting to isolate, divide, \nencircle, and contain China. They cite, among others, the following \nlist of grievances:\n  First, delay on China's application for membership in the World Trade \nOrganization which they believe is a violation of our 1992 bilateral \nagreement on market access.\n  Second, refusing to grant China permanent, unconditional, most \nfavored nation treatment.\n  Third, constant U.S. criticism on human rights.\n  Fourth, preventing China from hosting the 2000 Summer Olympics.\n  Fifth, 1992 sale of F-16's to Taiwan.\n  Sixth, visits to Taipei of U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills in \nthe Bush administration and Transportation Secretary Pena in the \nClinton administration.\n\n  Seventh, visit of Taiwan's head of state to the United States, after \nbeing assured by top U.S. officials that the visit would not occur.\n  Beyond these frequently cited grievances, the leaders of China have \nseveral broader concerns about the United States. They are concerned \nthat the United States wishes permanently to separate Taiwan from the \nmainland and perhaps to foster an independent Taiwan. They question \nwhether the United States wishes them to be a full participant in the \nestablishment of the post-cold-war order. They cite Washington's \nreluctance to see them as a member of the World Trade Organization or \nto invite them to join other groupings that formulate policy for the \ninternational community.\n  Perhaps most important, though these words are seldom spoken \ndirectly, with communism dead as an ideology and with no real \ndemocratic process conveying power and legitimacy, the Chinese \nleadership is vulnerable to nationalistic sentiment at home if they \nyield to what is seen as American pressure and demands. As a result, \nChina is reluctant to undertake the responsibilities that the United \nStates expects her to fulfill as an emerging great power.\n  We should not, however, underestimate American strength in Chinese \neyes--economically, militarily, and ideologically. They understand and \nrespect our military strength. They understand the importance of \nChina's access to the American market. They admire our technology, and \nassuming a positive relationship, I believe the Chinese prefer buying \nfrom Americans over both Japanese and Europeans. I think we need to \ntake that sentiment into account in our own trade posture and our own \nexport posture.\n  Thoughtful Chinese know the United States is not seeking to contain \nChina--I want to underscore that--but there are many in China who do \nnot see it that way. We have welcomed over 40,000 Chinese students now \nenrolled in our universities. We are one of China's principal export \nmarkets. American businesses have invested $9.45 billion in China since \n1978. We have welcomed Chinese participation in the World Bank, the \nInternational Monetary Fund, and regional multilateral organizations. \nWith our Government's encouragement hundreds of American foundations, \nphilanthropic organizations, and education and research institutes now \nhave wide-ranging exchanges with counterpart Chinese institutions. This \nis the record of a partner, not an adversary, in world affairs.\n  China would like to build a stronger military-to-military \nrelationship, and though it does not say so openly, it understands the \nstability that the United States military force presence brings to \nNortheast Asia. I believe that with some notable exceptions, including \nTaiwan, the Chinese military is more open to warmer United States-China \nties than some other elements of the Chinese leadership and these \ninclinations have been strengthened by the visit and the leadership of \nSecretary of Defense Bill Perry. Thus, America has many strengths in \ndealing with China, yet there are serious limits on our ability fully \nto utilize these strengths. We need to also understand that.\n  First, China is embedded in Asia, politically and economically, and \nthe United States cannot pursue a successful policy toward China in \nisolation from the rest of the region. Our allies in Asia would not be \nprepared or willing to follow America's lead if we decided to isolate \nChina nor are they willing to employ economic sanctions. Our friends in \nEurope and Japan will be most delighted to fill any Chinese need which \ndevelops if the United States employs economic sanctions.\n  America is still viewed in China and in Asia as a land of wealth and \nopportunity. But, in China and elsewhere in Asia, among even United \nStates friends, many believe and privately say, that we are a declining \npower economically and culturally. The attraction of American society \nhas eroded not only in China, but elsewhere in Asia, primarily, in my \nview, as a result of our own social ills, which are publicized all over \nthe world. In Asia, as elsewhere, perceptions matter.\n  The Chinese see much that is attractive in the Asian model of \ndevelopment pursued by Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore. \n\n[[Page S1288]]\n\n  The United States had a relationship with China that expanded and \nprospered from 1972 to 1989. We worked together in areas of common \ninterest, exchanged views, tried to harmonize our views whenever we \ncould, sought common policies, and sought to narrow and contain \ndifferences. Since 1989, we have been deferring discussion of common \ninterests and emphasizing differences. To continue down this path is a \nprescription for posturing, animosity, brinkmanship, and danger.\n\n  Mr. President, our Nation must develop a purposeful, coherent and \nconsistent American policy toward China and a strategy to implement our \npolicy. We must also explain in clear terms to both our own citizens \nand to the Chinese the underlying rationale for our policy and our \nactions.\n  In the absence of a clear policy, it is inevitable that we in the \nCongress will chase off in separate directions with different \npriorities, while the executive branch lurches from one transitory \nissue to the next, addressing each problem in an ad hoc fashion. In the \nabsence of an overall policy framework, policy becomes fragmented, the \ncaptive of single issue constituencies.\n  Those in the executive branch bear the primary responsibility for \nenunciating our policy, but as we see from Taiwan's President Li's \nvisit to the United States, the actions of Congress often influence \nU.S. policy, for better or worse. United States policy towards China \nmust be developed in close consultation with the congressional \nleadership of both parties.\n  In the immediate future, we should begin a dialog between China and \nthe United States at all levels, including the highest levels--to \ndiscuss and where appropriate to act in unison in addressing these \nareas. Both the United States and China must get away from the current \npractice of diatribe and criticism. This dialog should not be portrayed \nas resolving our differences but rather beginning to find common ground \nand to reserving our different views for those issues that cannot be \nimmediately resolved. Similarly, established channels for dialogue \nbetween Washington and Taipei must be utilized and strengthened so that \nthere is a clear understanding of our respective views.\n  And may I remind my colleagues that 7 years have passed since an \nAmerican President or Vice President has journeyed to Beijing or the \nPresident or Premier of China has been in Washington. During that time, \nthe leaders of China have been to every major capital in the world, and \nthe leaders of other major countries have visited Beijing on many \noccasions. Misunderstandings and misperceptions are bound to flourish \nin the absence of dialog. Meetings do not guarantee agreement. But they \nreduce the chance of conflict through miscalculation.\n  It would be irresponsible and dangerous for the United States \nand China to continue on our present course. It is time to end the \nperiod of estrangement between the United States and China. President \nClinton's meeting in New York with President Jiang Zemin was a \nbeginning down that road, and I hope we can greatly intensify those \nvisits to the top level and, indeed, the working level.\n\n  This dialog can inspire mutual confidence and understanding, but only \nif we display an unambiguous willingness to be firm when China's \nleaders do not meet their responsibilities and commitments, as well as \na meticulous management of our China policy to ensure that we adhere to \nour commitments.\n  Mr. President, I do not pretend today to offer a comprehensive China \npolicy, but I do offer a few observations and suggestions.\n  First, the Clinton administration should develop a broader policy \nframework regarding United States-China relations and stability in \nNortheast Asia and a strategy to advance that policy.\n  Regarding this framework, I believe some of its components--and I am \nnot pretending to name them all this morning--are clearly visible: a \ncontinued and robust American military presence in Asia is fundamental \nto the stability of Northeast Asia and peace in the region; and we \nshould approach China in close coordination with Japan, Korea, and our \nAsian partners. We cannot pursue a successful China policy unless that \npolicy is supported in the region. We must make clear that the \ncooperation we seek from our traditional allies and friends is not for \nthe purpose of confronting or containing China, but for involving China \nmore extensively and constructively in regional affairs. We should \nstrengthen the linkages between China, the United States, and the rest \nof Asia so that China becomes firmly integrated with the United States \nin the emerging Pacific community. We must reverse a widespread \nperception that America's role in the region is in decline.\n  Second, we should make it clear that we are prepared to facilitate \nChina's participation in the international economy and international \nsecurity arrangements in the expectation that China will abide by the \nnorms of those international regimes. The incorporation of China in the \nworld community will entail some mutual adjustments, but China cannot \nexpect to derive the benefits without bearing the burdens of its newly \nacquired status. China's admission to the various international \ninstitutions will be facilitated and accelerated if they are able to \ndemonstrate a solid record of compliance with their international \ncommitments, including trade agreements, the Nuclear Nonproliferation \nTreaty and the guidelines of the Missile Technology Control Regime, \nwhich they were not part of formulating, but they have agreed to the \nbasic principles of it. In the nonproliferation arena, China should be \ninvolved in formulating the policies we expect them to abide by. Our \nstrategy should be to welcome and incorporate China in the world \ncommunity at a relatively early stage in its rise, with the explicit \nChinese commitment to abide by international standards and to develop \nthe domestic institutional capacity to do so.\n  This approach should serve not only America and international \ninterests, but China's interests. Our strategy should be intended to \nelicit Chinese cooperation rather than to compel Chinese behavior.\n  Third, a framework with China must be based upon mutual dignity and \nmutual respect. We must seek to identify our important mutual interests \nand make progress in these areas while striving to ensure that our \npoints of disagreement do not dominate every agenda. If we proceed in \nthis fashion, the areas of disagreement are likely to be put into a \nbroader perspective where progress can be made toward resolution over \ntime. In spite of our recent disagreements, there are clearly crucial \nareas of strong mutual interests between the United States and China, \nincluding avoiding an arms race in Northeast Asia; avoiding \nconfrontation on the Korean Peninsula and preventing a nuclear weapons \nbuildup by either North or South Korea.\n  Also, avoiding the introduction of nuclear weapons in the Persian \nGulf area; avoiding the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and their means of delivery; easing tensions in South Asia \nbetween India and Pakistan; maintaining stability in Northeast Asia and \nthe general area of the Pacific; maintaining stability in Southeast \nAsia, including the emergence of a peaceful Vietnam and ending and \nhealing the conflict in Cambodia.\n\n  Also, enhancing the efforts of the U.N. Security Council to maintain \ninternational peace and security; keeping sea lanes open for commerce; \naddressing transnational problems, such as illegal narcotics and \nterrorism; protecting the environment, including the seas; enhancing \nthe rule of law in China; and, finally, maintaining the prosperity of \nHong Kong and Taiwan. This is clearly in the interests of China, as \nwell as the United States.\n  Our two nations will not always agree on how to address these \ninterests, but we have enough mutuality to find significant areas of \ncommon approach and cooperation. Without this framework for the \ndiscussion of mutual interests, little progress is likely to be made on \nthe issues where we differ. With this framework, I believe that \nprogress can be made even in difficult areas of disagreement.\n  Finally, Congress should pass no laws or concurrent resolutions on \nChina or Taiwan at least until after the elections in Taiwan which take \nplace on March 23--in just a few weeks. I believe that Members of \nCongress should speak their views on these issues frankly and candidly, \nbut in the present tense atmosphere congressional legislation or \nresolutions are likely to create more \n\n[[Page S1289]]\nheat than light. I also hope that our China policy will not become a \npartisan political issue during the United States Presidential election \ncampaign. Each time that has happened in past Presidential campaigns, \nour China policy has been the victim rather than the beneficiary of \nthat kind of partisanship.\n  Mr. President, we have a number of important differences and \nmisunderstandings with China which must be discussed firmly and frankly \nwithin our overall strategic framework. These issues include arms \nproliferation, trade disputes, and human rights concerns, which I will \ndiscuss in the coming weeks.\n  The most dangerous of these differences is the issue of Taiwan.\n  The Chinese leaders by their words and by their actions make it \nabundantly clear that any attempt by Taiwan to establish its \nindependence from the mainland will result in a confrontation with the \nmainland. It is clear that the Chinese do not desire a military clash, \nbut it is also clear that they believe that their national sovereignty \nand national pride are at stake on the question of Taiwan's future. \nNeither America nor Taiwan should take lightly this Chinese position. \nBeijing has drawn a firm line on this question.\n  It is essential that America also should make our policy and our \nintentions clear. The framework for American policy on Taiwan already \nexists in the three joint communiques under President Nixon in 1972, \nPresident Carter in 1979, and President Reagan in 1982 and the Taiwan \nRelations Act of 1979. The joint communiques establish that the \nGovernment of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal \ngovernment of China, that there is but one China, that the United \nStates acknowledges China's claim that Taiwan is part of China, and \nthat the resolution of the Taiwan issue is a matter to be worked out \npeacefully by the two sides themselves. This is America's solemn \nagreement with China entered into by Presidents Nixon, Carter, and \nReagan and followed as United States policy by Presidents Ford, Bush, \nand Clinton.\n  President Reagan stated our policy very clearly in his letters of \nApril 5, 1982, to Vice Chairman Deng Xiaoping and Premier Zhao Ziyang. \nIn his letter to Vice Chairman Deng Xiaoping, President Reagan stated \n``There is only one China. We will not permit the unofficial relations \nbetween the American people and the people of Taiwan to weaken our \ncommitment to this principle.'' In his letter to Premier Zhao Ziyang, \nPresident Reagan stated, ``The differences between us are rooted in the \nlong-standing friendship between the American people and the Chinese \npeople who live on Taiwan. We will welcome and support any peaceful \nresolution to the Taiwan question.''\n  The Chinese should understand that the Taiwan Relations Act is the \nlaw of our land. This act, passed in 1979, underscores that America's \nrelations with the People's Republic of China rest upon the expectation \nthat the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means; that we \nwould consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other \nthan peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to \npeace and security of the Western Pacific and of grave concern to the \nUnited States. This act also declared it to be our policy to provide \nTaiwan with arms of a defensive character; and to maintain the \ncapability of the United States to resist any resort to force or other \nforms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or \neconomic system, of the people of Taiwan.\n  This framework of the three communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act \nhas served both sides of the Taiwan Strait as well as the United States \nand the Pacific region well for almost 17 years. For example, it made \npossible the relaxation of tensions in the strait which allowed trade \nand interaction of the two sides to take place.\n\n  It encouraged Taiwan to abolish martial law and become a prosperous \ndemocracy.\n  It made available to the Chinese on the mainland the talents and \ncapital of the people on Taiwan.\n  It played a major role in the success of China's drive for \nmodernization.\n  It produced a sense of security that allowed the emergence of \ncritical conditions in which both Taiwan and the mainland could \nprosper.\n  Americans have applauded the building of economic and people-to-\npeople ties across the strait. These ties have not just been between \nindividuals and families but also between businesses and academic \ninstitutions. We have applauded the efforts of both sides to build on \nthose ties toward an expanded relationship. Such an expanded \nrelationship advances the realization of longstanding American hopes \nfor the peaceful settlement of the dispute between the people on both \nsides of the Taiwan Strait.\n  A military confrontation between China and Taiwan would harm both \nChina and Taiwan. It would have long-term consequences for Northeast \nAsia and the Pacific and would likely set off a serious arms race in \nAsia as Charles Freeman pointed out in his op-ed piece in the New York \nTimes last week, a war in the Taiwan Strait ``would not only threaten \nTaiwan's democracy but also finish any hopes of America's building a \nconstructive relationship with China.'' And, in commenting upon a \nUnited States decision to either intervene or not do anything in the \ncase of a war, he stated that ``the results in either case would \nprobably be Japanese rearmament, military rivalry between Tokyo and \nBeijing, a loss of confidence between Tokyo and Washington and alarm \nthroughout Asia.'' And as Michel Oksenberg points out, while war is not \nthe primary danger at this point, a protracted military confrontation \ncould produce many of these same results. It would also disrupt the \neconomies of China and Taiwan and would result in a tragic loss of life \nand property. Surely we all wish to avoid a repeat of Quemoy-Matsu \ntension, which lasted for a long time, to the detriment of the people \non both the mainland and Taiwan.\n  Americans feel very close to the people of Taiwan. We are very proud \nof their accomplishments. The people of Taiwan have made enormous \nstrides economically as well as politically. There are an example to \nmuch of the developing world.\n  It is important for the United States, as a friend, to be clear with \nthe Taiwanese that they must not misjudge China on the question of \nTaiwan independence.\n  It is important that the people of Taiwan understand that a \nunilateral declaration of Taiwan's independence would be inconsistent \nwith United States foreign policy as set forth and followed by \nPresident Nixon, President Ford, President Carter, President Reagan, \nPresident Bush, and President Clinton.\n  It is also important for the Chinese to understand that the United \nStates values its friendship and its relationship with the people on \nTaiwan. It is crucial that the Chinese understand that if China uses \nforce to resolve the Taiwan issue, the United States will not stand \nidly by but will surely respond.\n  For our part, the United States should make it very clear that we \nwill oppose either side's attempt to change the status quo either by \nthe use of force by Beijing or by unilateral declaration of \nindependence by Taiwan. The United States position should be clear that \nwe are prepared to live with any outcome negotiated in good faith \nbetween China and Taiwan. The future of Taiwan must be settled by \nmutual agreement between the parties, not by the unilateral actions of \neither. For that to happen, Taipei must stop its political provocations \nand Beijing must stop its military provocations.\n  The people of China and the people of Taiwan should resume a high-\nlevel dialog to foster clear understandings and increased cooperation. \nEnormous progress has been made in economic cooperation and people-to-\npeople contacts as well as visits on both sides of the strait. While \neconomic development and people-to-people cooperation are emphasized, \npolitical questions are complicated and emotional and their resolution \nwill require a long-term effort. This will involve a trait for which \nthe Chinese people are famous--patience.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine).

Mr. President, I take this time to comment on legislation \nthat has been reported out of the Senate Commerce Committee \nreauthorizing the Amtrak rail system in this country and also \ninstituting not just a reauthorization but as well an effort to try to \nbring about major reforms to the Amtrak passenger rail system in this \ncountry.\n  Let me say that the committee worked long and hard. The distinguished \nPresiding Officer is a member of the Senate Commerce Committee that \nworked on that legislation. It is apparent that I have expressed some \npublic concerns about bringing this piece of legislation to the floor \nof the Senate under a unanimous consent arrangement to be handled in \nthe Senate without the possibility of any amendments--indeed, without \nany discussion, just bring it up under a unanimous-consent procedure \nand then pass it and send it on to the other body, over to the House \nside. I have objected to that procedure because I think this, indeed, \nis a subject that needs to be discussed and debated in this Chamber.\n  Let me start by first saying that I very strongly support the concept \nof and the need for Amtrak reauthorization. The passenger rail system \nprovides incredible economic assistance and transportation to \nindustries and individuals in this country. Indeed, our entire rail \nsystem in this country is second to no other country. We can be proud \nof what Amtrak has brought in terms of passenger service to this \ncountry, as well as the freight and private carriers, and the good \neconomic possibilities that they make happen every day by having this \nnational transportation system of railroads in our country. All our \nindustries and our businesses and our individual lives are touched \nevery day by having such a fine rail system. I think by and large the \nvarious private companies do an outstanding job in maintaining their \nlevel of providing these services as well as doing their best to \nprovide quality services in a safe manner so that everybody who uses \nthe rail system can be assured of their safety.\n  The concern that I have--a concern we need to have this Senate body \ndebate and discuss--is making sure that we do not do anything in this \nlegislation to lessen the requirements of these private companies and, \nindeed, our public Amtrak system in the standards of safety that they \nmust provide to the American public.\n  We all have witnessed this month a set of accidents around this \ncountry that I think are very disturbing, to say the least. Look at the \nheadlines that have appeared in newspapers just in the month of \nFebruary. February 2, 1996: ``Two Killed, 20 Hurt in California Train \nDerailment.'' On February 10, this year: ``Three Die in New Jersey \nTransit Commuter Train Wreck.'' February 16, again, this month, the \nthird such incident: ``Brake Failure Causes Yet Another Train Wreck--9 \nWorkers Injured, FBI Called In To Probe.'' And, of course, one that we \nare very familiar with in this area, on February 17: ``MARC-Amtrak \nTrains Collide Killing 12.'' And then the fifth such accident, on \nFebruary 22: ``Colorado Train Derails, 2 Killed, Acid Spills.''\n\n  Mr. President, I say to all of our colleague who may be listening and \nto the American public that these five major train accidents that \noccurred in a 1-month period are disturbing to me, disturbing to my \ncolleagues and, I think, indeed disturbing to the American public. They \nwant to know that the trains they ride on, the trains that carry the \ngoods and services of this Nation are safe, they can be counted on and \nthat they are dependable.\n  Again, I will point out that I have a great deal of respect for all \nof these private companies. They are attempting to do a good job. The \nconcern I have right now and the reason I objected to bringing the \nAmtrak reauthorization legislation to this body without the ability of \nany discussion, under a unanimous consent agreement that prevents any \nability to offer amendments to that legislation, is because I think \nthere is a real possibility that some would like to further restrict \nindividuals' rights to be compensated when rail accidents occur. When \nyou have five in 1 month, Mr. President, I think we need to look at how \nthese railroads are operating, how we can help them do a better job, \nand, yes, at the same time make sure that people who are injured by \naccidents where negligence was the cause of that accident are \nadequately compensated, and, yes, even to the point of providing \npunitive damages when gross negligence occurs and is the proven cause \nof that particular accident.\n  Now, the reason I bring up these concerns to the Senate today is \nbecause of the provisions that are in the bill that has already passed \nthe House of Representatives and what they attempt to do to the \nAmerican public in the area of safety and the ability to be \ncompensated. Two things leap out that I am very concerned about, and \nsome of these features are in the Senate bill.\n  First, there is a cap on punitive damages in the House-passed bill. \nIn other words, if a railroad is found to be grossly negligent, almost \nto the point of saying: ``We don't care what happens. If you get hit, \nwe will pay the damages; we don't care.'' And I am not saying anybody \nfits in that category. It is very rare that punitive damages are \nawarded. But when they are awarded, it is to say to the defendant who \nhas been grossly negligent, ``We are going to penalize you so you don't \ndo it again. Do not think it is easier to pay the damages than to fix \nthe problem.''\n  The House bill puts a cap on the punitive damages that can be awarded \ninstead of letting a jury or a judge determine, after seeing the facts, \nwhat it should be. The Senate bill has a similar provision that puts a \ncap on punitive damages as well; in other words, restricting how much \nsomeone can be penalized by a judge and a jury for causing an accident \nwhere gross negligence has been proven beyond a doubt.\n  That I think is simply wrong. We should not be moving in that \ndirection. We should allow punitive damages to be assessed on those \nrare occasions when they need to be, as a form of saying to a \ncorporation or an individual, ``Do not do that again. If you do, you \nare going to be severely penalized.'' That is an incentive to do a \nbetter job. That is an incentive to make things safer. That is an \nincentive to do more inspections and to make sure things work the way \nthe American public has come to depend on their working.\n  The second thing I am concerned about is that there is a cap in the \nHouse-passed bill on the Amtrak reauthorization on limiting how much a \nperson can recover for pain and suffering in an injury from a rail \naccident. How do we in Congress, sitting in Washington, DC, where we \nhave not been out to interview a family or not heard testimony of those \nwho have lost a member of their family or been disfigured or lost the \nability to have any income in the future because of the injuries, how \ndo we in Washington pick a number and say this is the maximum amount \nthey can receive for pain and suffering as a result of the negligence \nof someone that has injured them?\n  How can we in Washington, who have never seen the injured people, \nnever heard their testimony in a trial, never viewed that testimony \nfirsthand, pick a number and say this is a fair number in every case \nthat ever happens in America? How many of us in this body or the other \nbody have interviewed any of the people injured in five train wrecks \nall over the country just this month?\n  How can we say that x amount of money is a cap that can never be \nexceeded? That is not a function of the U.S. Senate. Those numbers and \nthose amounts for pain and suffering, when someone is severely injured, \ncan best be decided, I think, by juries and by courts and by judges \nwho, in a public forum, have listened to the witnesses, seen their \ninjuries, heard expert testimony about how bad they are injured. Maybe \nfor the rest of their lives they are going to suffer those same \ninjuries. Let them decide what is an adequate amount for compensation.\n  The third concern that I have, which is probably the biggest concern, \nis something that I just do not understand and, quite frankly, I think \nwas a terrible mistake on the part of the other body when they passed \nthis legislation. It is called indemnification. I will just read it and \nthen I will attempt to try to explain it, because we write \n\n[[Page S1291]]\nlaws sometimes that nobody can ever understand unless they put it in \nEnglish. Sometimes I think we write in foreign languages.\n  The House bill says:\n\n       Indemnification Obligations--\n\n  This is in title IV of the House-passed bill. It says:\n\n     Obligations of any party, however arising, including \n     obligations arising under leases or contracts or pursuant to \n     orders of an administrative agency, to indemnify against \n     damages or liability for personal injury, death, or damage to \n     property described in subsection (a), incurred after the date \n     of the enactment of Amtrak Reform and Privatization Act of \n     1995, shall be enforceable, notwithstanding any other \n     statutory or common law or public policy, or the nature of \n     the conduct giving rise to the damages or liability.\n\n  If you read that the first time, your eyes glaze over. Certainly mine \ndo. And I say, ``What did he say?'' It sounds convoluted and like it \nwas written by a lawyer. Yes, it probably was.\n  What that section that is in the House-passed bill simply says--and \none of my biggest fears is that the Senate may agree to it in a \nconference--it says as simply as I can put it, if a private railroad \nthat owns the track and owns the signals and has not kept them up, has \ncompletely ignored conditions or put in the wrong signals or has their \nown train that is running on their own tracks, when the engineer is \ngrossly negligent, who is maybe intoxicated or under the influence of \ndrugs, is running their train, that if all those things occur, and it \nruns into an Amtrak train and, heaven forbid, kills passengers on that \nAmtrak train, that this section specifically says that the private \nrailroads can have an indemnification agreement that absolves them of \nany responsibility, absolves them of any liability no matter how \nnegligent they were, and they can shift that liability to Amtrak and \nsay that the American taxpayer, who happens to fund Amtrak, is going to \nhave to pay for the damages, pay for pain and suffering, pay for the \ndamages to the community, the damages that are caused by that wreck, \neven though it was completely and totally the fault of the private \nrailroad.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that it is not good public policy to allow \na private industry to shift the responsibility and the liability for \ntheir negligence, no matter how bad it is, their gross negligence, to \nshift that responsibility to somebody else--in this case the American \ntaxpayer--that it is not right. It is not good public policy. In fact, \nit is very bad public policy.\n  Under that section of the House-passed bill, when we go to \nconference, if it were somehow to be incorporated into the final \npackage and passed into law, every private railroad would say, ``Look, \nI have much less of an incentive to do the right thing because if we \nhave an accident that involves an Amtrak train,'' which many of these \nthat I just cited have, ``I'm not going to be responsible.''\n  I just think it makes no sense whatsoever from the standpoint of any \nstandard of public policy to say that we should allow indemnification \nagreements to allow someone to shift their responsibility, even when \nthey are grossly negligent, to some other party and say, ``You take it. \nYou take my responsibility. You take my responsibility for the pain, \nfor the damages that my negligence caused,'' and particularly in this \ncase when it is the Federal taxpayer, because we in this authorization \nare funding Amtrak.\n  When we fund Amtrak, the taxpayers are paying for Amtrak. So why \nshould the taxpayer be paying for the gross negligence of some private \nindustry when it is their fault that the accident occurred? I think we \nhave to look at this very carefully. We have to reject it if it comes \nback. It is not part of the Senate bill, but it is part of the House-\npassed bill, along with the caps on punitive damages, along with the \ncaps on pain and suffering.\n  If there ever was a time when we should be more careful about \nprotecting the rights of injured people and more careful about ensuring \nmechanisms in our laws that provide incentives and inducements for both \npublic bodies and public railroads and private railroads to do a better \njob, now is the time.\n  I cannot imagine someone standing up on the floor at this critical \ntime and suggesting that what we ought to do is make it harder and more \ndifficult for people who are injured in rail accidents to be justly \ncompensated. I cannot imagine anybody at this critical time coming to \nthe floor of the House or the Senate and suggesting that private \nrailroads should be able to shirk their legal responsibility for gross \nnegligence, if and when it occurs, onto the backs of the American \ntaxpayer instead of standing up and saying, ``Yes, we were responsible. \nYes, we have to pay. Yes, we are going to correct this problem.''\n  That is the issue, as simply as I can possibly state it, that we are \ngoing to be facing when this legislation comes to the floor. That is \nthe reason that I have said time and again, do not bring this to the \nfloor under a unanimous-consent agreement. Do not tie the hands of \nMembers of Congress in our ability to talk about this. Do not prevent \nus from being able to offer amendments to correct these problems so \nthat we do not make a very serious mistake with this legislation when \nit comes to the floor.\n  We should have the opportunity to improve it, to correct it, to amend \nit. And if we can work out that type of structure, I am looking forward \nto the debate with my colleagues in the Senate and, ultimately, \nhopefully, in a conference with the House.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is an old axiom in politics, when your adversaries \nare having a healthy feud, never walk across the street and get \ninvolved in it. I will not do that this morning. I am tempted to. \nHowever, I wanted to discuss, at least a bit, the issue of populism. I \nwill not discuss so much the details of the feud that is going on in \nthe Republican Party and in the primaries, but I do want to talk about \nthe issue of populism.\n  What propelled me to do that today was Time magazine. There is a \npicture of Pat Buchanan in a hard hat and work shirt, and Lamar \nAlexander peeking over his shoulder in his plaid shirt, and then Bob \nDole and Steve Forbes behind them.\n  It says, ``Grand Old Populists.'' So I am presuming, I guess, that \nGOP means ``Grand Old Populists.'' I wanted to talk a little about this \nissue of populism. It is a fascinating concept to see these, as one of \nmy colleagues in the Senate calls them, Grey Poupon-eating-, Jacuzzi-, \ncountry-club folks, wearing hard hats and work shirts and calling \nthemselves populists.\n  Let us put all this in perspective. About 80 or 90 million years ago, \nthe brontosaurus and triceratops and tyrannosaurus rex were running \nacross southwestern North Dakota. They are digging some of them up, by \nthe way. Then we skipped and fast forwarded, and it was about 5,000 \nyears ago that we discovered there were people around, and about 2,000 \nyears ago Jesus was alive. About 500 years ago Columbus was relatively \nlost and stumbled onto the southern part of this continent, and despite \nthe fact that the folks who were living here greeted his boat, he was \ncredited with discovering something or another.\n  And 200 years ago our country was born. Then 100 years ago we created \nplanes, trains, and automobiles, roughly speaking. And 75 and 50 years \nago it was the radio, then television. And 25 years ago we put a man on \nthe Moon. Then 10 years ago the computer became something that you \ncould have in your home and then later carry on your lap as you \ntraveled. And now in the Republican Party ``GOP'' means ``Grand Old \nPopulists.'' And it is causing quite a stir, actually.\n  I noticed in this morning's paper one of the strategists, William \nKristol, who speaks more often than most on politics from the \nconservative side, spoke of this issue.\n  He is speaking now about the turmoil that is going on in the \nRepublican primaries. ``William Kristol,'' according to the story this \nmorning as a result of something he wrote recently--I guess this week--\n``sees no need for the Republican Establishment to succumb, in Pat \nBuchanan's phrase, to `terminal panic.' A junior member of that \nEstablishment, Kristol doesn't cower when \n\n[[Page S1292]]\nthe high-riding presidential contender thunders about the terrified \nknights and barons of the GOP,'' et cetera, et cetera.\n\n       ``Someone needs to stand up and defend the Establishment,'' \n     says Kristol, a sometime strategist, party ideologist and \n     editor of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine. ``In the \n     last couple of weeks, there's been too much pseudo-populism, \n     almost too much concern and attention for, quote, the \n     people--that is, the people's will, their prejudices and \n     their foolish opinions. And in a certain sense, we're all \n     paying the price for that now . . . After all, we \n     conservatives are on the side of the lords and the barons.''\n\n  He says there is ``almost too much concern and attention for the \npeople * * * we are on the side of the lords and barons.''\n  Well, what to make of this: The grand old populist with the hard hat \nand the honest conservative who says, ``Wait a second, there's too much \nattention being paid to the people here, the people and their foolish \nopinions,'' Mr. Kristol says. ``We are on the side of the lords and the \nbarons.''\n  God bless the lords and the barons. They are a good group of folks, \nbut it is the people who run this country. It is the people for whom \nelections are held, because the Constitution gives the people in this \ncountry the right to grab the steering wheel and decide in Montana or \nNorth Dakota or Nevada or New York or Texas in which direction they \nwant America to move. They nudge that steering wheel by collectively \nvoting. It is the people, not the lords and barons, the people who grab \nthe American steering wheel every even-numbered year. That is part of \nthe miracle of the American Constitution. It is a miracle guaranteed \nevery even-numbered year to the people in this country.\n  What of this issue of populism? It is interesting to me, coming from \na State where populism had its roots. In North Dakota, in the early \n1900's, nineteen teens, there was a legislator named Treadwill \nTwitchell who stood up in the chamber of the State legislature and told \nthe farmers to ``go home and slop your hogs with great arrogance.'' He \nwas someone who represented one of the big cities in our State. ``Go \nhome and slop your hogs,'' he said.\n  They went home all right, and 2 years later, they organized section \nline by section line all across North Dakota. They came back and took \nover in North Dakota in the 19 teens. They were populists. There is a \nbook written about it called ``Prairie Fire,'' in which the people took \nhold and said, ``This is our destiny.''\n  They built themselves in North Dakota a bank saying, ``We're tired of \nhaving public money put in private cronies' banks. We will have our own \nbank which belongs to people.'' My State is the only State in America \nthat still has a Bank of North Dakota, and all public money goes into \nthat bank used for the public good. It is not a case in our State where \nsome of the State's money goes into some crony's bank someplace. It \ngoes into the bank the populists created in the 19 teens.\n  They built a mill and elevator because they were sick and tired of \nthe big mills in the East taking advantage of our farmers. They said, \n``We are going to build a mill and elevator.'' They passed a farmers \nbill where they said, ``We want farmers, not corporations; we want yard \nlights where families live on the farm.''\n  The populist legacy in our State is a legacy about people having \npower. Part of what I find heartening these days is the discussion in \nthe political system, especially in the Republican primaries, but also \nin our party, the Democratic Party, a discussion about what kind of \neconomic system does this country have. For whose benefit does it \noperate? Who reaps the rewards of this economic system?\n  There are some things I have heard and seen in recent weeks that \ntrouble me greatly, and I am sure that is true of many in this Chamber: \nTop advisers to campaigners out there who give speeches to white \nsupremacist groups and use code words. Those kinds of things really \nbother me a lot, because there is a dark tinge to some of this \ndiscussion, and that ought to be rejected, and rejected quickly, by the \nAmerican people.\n  But there is also, in my judgment, an arrow headed straight to the \ncenter of what ought to be the economic debate in this country, and the \ncenter of the economic debate is how are American families doing? Are \nthey advancing? Is their standard of living improving? When they sit \ndown for dinner with the family to talk about their circumstance, are \nthey able to say, ``Our jobs are secure; we have good jobs with good \nincomes; we have decent health care at affordable prices; we go to good \nschools''? Are they able to say that? Or do they say, ``Too often these \ndays, we're not so sure about our job security. We worked for the same \ncompany for 22 years, but the company just reported record profits, the \nCEO makes $4 million, just got a $2 million raise and laid off 8,000 \npeople, because they call that progress.''\n  So, too many families now sit down at dinner and understand the \ncompanies they have worked for for 20 years see them like they see a \nwrench or a punch press: As a tool, perfectly expendable and completely \nexpendable once the company has decided it is in their interest to \ndecide to get rid of them now and hire another tool or another worker.\n  All too often in China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, \nsomewhere where they can hire someone without the restrictions on age--\nyou can hire a kid if you wish--without the nettlesome restrictions \nthat you have to pay a living wage--you can pay 14 cents an hour to \nsomeone who makes tennis shoes in Malaysia--without the restriction \nthat you have to have a safe workplace, without the restriction that \nyou cannot dump chemicals into the air or dump chemicals into the \nwater.\n\n  So people now understand that they are expendable, and that is the \nsadness of the lack of security in the job place in America. Not only \ndo they see they have less security, they also see that they make less \nmoney; they work harder, but they make less money. If one adjusts their \nwage for inflation and goes back 20 years and measures it, what has \nhappened is they are working harder and 20 years later they are making \nless money and have less purchasing power than they had 20 years ago.\n  Is there any reason that the American people have some anxiety about \nthat? We can talk forever that the GDP numbers are up, America is on \nthe move, our economy is growing, and it does not matter if the \nstandard of living for American families is not advancing.\n  I have spoken on the floor previously about this--I know it is \nrepetitive--but it is important to say you do not and cannot measure \nAmerica's economic health and its future promise by what it consumes. I \nam just flat sick and tired of hearing the news reports that the \nCommerce Department said this, the Federal Reserve Board this or that, \ncar sales are up, home sales are up, shoes sales are up. At issue is \nnot how much we bought, how much we consumed.\n  The issue is what did we produce in this country? It is production \nthat gives you good jobs. Good jobs come from our productive sector \nand, as our manufacturing jobs are moving, we are losing manufacturing \njobs. They are being moved by international economic enterprises who do \nnot say the Pledge of Allegiance and they do not sing the national \nanthem. They are interested in international profits. They do not care \nwhether they produce in Pittsburgh or Malaysia. They will produce where \nit is the most profitable to produce, and manufacturing jobs are \nleaving America in droves. Witness the trade deficit we have.\n  Last year, the trade deficit was larger than our budget deficit. \nThere is nobody saying much about it, and it is almost a conspiracy of \nsilence. The trade deficit means we buy from abroad more than we sell \nabroad. What that means is jobs that would have been here are instead \nsomewhere else in another country.\n  Corporations that are producing are producing elsewhere, and the \nAmerican people have some role in this as well. It is not unusual to \nfind somebody wearing a Chinese shirt, slacks from Taiwan, shoes from \nItaly, shorts from Mexico, driving a Japanese car, and then saying, \n``Where on Earth have American jobs gone?'' You are wearing where it \nhas gone. So there is enough responsibility to go around.\n  But the center of the economic debate in this country has to come to \nthis issue about what is fair trade and how do we construct a \ncircumstance in which we have a healthy, vibrant growing manufacturing \nbase in our country.\n  To those out on the campaign trail these days wearing hard hats and \n\n[[Page S1293]]\n  preaching populism, I say to them, ``Come here and help us.''\n  I offered an amendment in the U.S. Senate, and it was as simple as \ncould be. No one could misunderstand it and no one could even, in my \njudgment, mistakenly vote wrong on it. I lost on a partisan vote.\n  The amendment very simply was to say: Let us stop providing tax \nbreaks so that companies can close their American plants and open up \nplants overseas. Let us stop providing tax breaks so that American \ncorporations can move their jobs to foreign countries. Let us put an \nend to the insidious giveaway in our Tax Code that allows companies to \ndo that: Fire American workers, hire foreign workers, become more \nprofitable, and destroy job security in our country.\n  I could not even get that adopted in the Senate. Mr. President, to \nall of those who voted and voted wrong, they are going to get a chance \n6, 8, 10, 12 more times, if I have my way, this year to rectify that, \nbecause this country should not and cannot continue to have economic \nincentives in its tax laws to say ``it is our aim to encourage you to \nmove your jobs overseas.''\n  It is my aim to encourage American companies to invest here, to \nproduce here, and to hire here in this country.\n  There are twin responsibilities that we have. The American worker has \na responsibility, but productivity is on the rise. Workers are working \nharder. Workers do have a responsibility to be motivated, educated, \ndedicated, and to be good workers. But companies then have the \nresponsibility, as well, to care about the people who make up that \ncompany, to care about the people who make the products that the \ncompany sells with that company's name on it.\n  About a month or so ago, I read a piece in the Minneapolis Tribune as \nI was going through the airport. I came to the floor of the Senate and \ntold, briefly, about what I had read because it was so foreign to \neverything that is going on in this country. It was about a fellow who \nhad owned the company that make inline skates called Rollerblades. He \nand his wife had purchased this company and built it into something \nsubstantial, an enormously successful company, making inline skates. \nRollerblades is the name of the company. And then this fellow, named \nBob, sold the company some months ago. He had made a substantial amount \nof money because the company was enormously successful. Of course, all \nof us understand what has happened with inline skates. At \nChristmastime, some of the workers at this company began getting in the \nmail a letter from the fellow who had owned this company. They began to \nopen their Christmas greeting from this fellow and his wife, and it \nturned out that he had sent them money. He no longer owned the company, \nbut he sent all of the employees--I think something like 270 employees \nwho worked for that company in the factory lines, custodial, the \npainters, and everything--if memory is correct, he sent them $160 for \nevery month they worked for the company.\n  In some cases, those folks on the factory lines, who had been there \nall the time he had the company, got up to a $20,000 check from this \nfellow and his wife. Do you know what else he did? He prepaid the taxes \non it. So he said to them, ``This gift is for you. You owe no taxes on \nit. I have prepaid the taxes.''\n  I called him and said, ``This is remarkable, at a time when we hear \nabout all of the selfishness and layoffs and moving jobs overseas. I \nwant to tell you how remarkable it is to hear about what you did.'' \nWhat he said to me was perfectly understandable. He said, ``I made \nmoney with that company because all of those folks helped make that \ncompany work. They worked on the factory lines. They are the ones who \nmade the company, it was not just me, it was them as well, and I wanted \nto share something with them. I wanted to tell them that they \ncontributed something significant in the success of that company.''\n  I thought, ``What a hero.'' He did not have to do that. We do not \nhear many stories like that--stories that are unselfish, where the CEO \nsays, ``You people really make this company work. When we put our \ncompany name on the product, we are proud because you helped make the \nproduct.'' That is almost unheard of these days. Nowadays it is, \n``Well, you worked for us, but tomorrow you are like a used wrench. You \nmight be out of here with no security, no health care, and maybe no \npension. We might be hiring your replacement 6,000 or 8,000 miles \naway.''\n  Well, would it not be nice to hear more people do what that man did, \nand recognize that part of this country's success is to have a vibrant, \nexpanding, growing manufacturing base, and to recognize the workers out \nthere on the line producing products, doing good work, working hard, \nand are also part of the success and part of the competitive team?\n\n  I just think that we have kind of gone in a different direction in \nthis country, in which we have had economists, CEO's, and others \ndevelop an economic model that says that it is fine if we produce \nelsewhere and sell here as long as we are buying cheap. That is not \nfine. Major jobs are gone, and a major future is gone with it. That \nneeds to be the center of the economic debate. How could we create \nconditions in which manufacturing in this country expands again, in \nwhich there is fair international competition, in which we reduce the \ntrade deficit, bring jobs back to this country, and rev up the American \neconomy to a reasonable economic growth.\n  On a related but slightly different issue, yesterday, the President \nreappointed Alan Greenspan to head the Federal Reserve Board for \nanother term. He is going to submit his name to us. Certainly, the \nCongress will accept that. I am terribly disappointed by that. I have \ngreat respect for Mr. Greenspan, but I have profound disagreements with \nhim, as well. I agree with Jack Kemp on the issue of economic growth. \nThe Federal Reserve Board sees itself as a set of human brake pads. \nThat is their mission in life. They say America cannot have an \nunemployment limit below 6 percent because it is inflationary, or \neconomic growth above 2.5 or 3 percent because it is inflationary. But \nwages are going down, not up, so that is nonsense.\n  When you consign our economy to a meager growth rate of 2.5 percent, \nyou consign an economy to an anemic future that is far less than what \nit should be for all Americans. It means fewer jobs and less \nopportunity. I am very disappointed the President has seen fit--not \nthat Mr. Greenspan is a bad person, I have great respect for him. But I \nwould have much preferred new leadership at the Fed--not leadership \nthat says inflation is not important because, of course, it is. We have \nseen stable prices and a growing economy. Inflation has been going \ndown--under 3 percent for 4 years in a row. Yet, the Fed has its foot \non the brakes with higher interest rates than the producers in this \ncountry should be paying.\n  Mr. President, I notice my friend from Nevada on the floor. He has \nsome things to say today. So let me finish with a couple of other brief \ncomments. This issue of populism, or the power that people have in this \ncountry to affect their lives and to force this political system to \ndebate what it ought to debate, is a very important concept. We just \nfinished debating a farm bill in the U.S. Senate. A fellow named Robert \nGreene, an Associated Press writer--somebody who I think does an \nexcellent job of synthesizing what we do with foreign policy in the \nCongress. He wrote a piece that is probably the best piece I know of \ndescribing what we did on the farm policy. We passed the so-called \nfreedom-to-farm bill, which I fought against and voted against because \nI think it is a terrible piece of legislation. Here is what he said \nabout it:\n\n       With a mix of luck, work and unusual organization, the \n     lobby for the big grain companies, railroads, meat companies, \n     millers and shippers scored a big win in the Senate-passed \n     overhaul of farm programs.\n\n  The freedom-to-farm bill is a serious act of mislabeling. It is \neverything that big railroads wanted, that big grain trading farms \nwanted, that all the millers wanted, that all the food processors \nwanted. Guess what it means to the family with the yard light on at \nnight trying to figure out how to operate the family farm? These large \ninterests want lower grain prices. Talk about economic populism, about \nputting jam on the lower shelf so everybody can reach it. This sort of \nnonsense, the freedom-to-farm bill, which gives everything they want to \nthe big grain trading firms, and shortchanges family farmers is the \nwrong way, not the right way, to address the issue of \n\n[[Page S1294]]\nwhether we should have family farmers in our future. If it becomes law, \nwe will have large agrifactories from coast to coast, and you will see \nprecious few yard lights on because family farmers will not be able to \nmake a living.\n\n  I was going to talk about other economic issues that relate to the \nsame thing--who gets, who gives, who has the power, and who does not. \nAs Mr. Kristol says, ``Who are the lords and barons, and what do they \nget?'' I will end where I began with not so much surprise at the \nmessage, but at the candor in the article this morning where Mr. \nKristol says, ``Someone needs to stand up and defend the establishment. \nIn the last couple of weeks there has been too much pseudo-populism, \nalmost too much concern and attention for `the people.' ''\n  Mr. Kristol has not served in the House or the Senate, but the people \ncontrol the House and the Senate. This is their Chamber; it is their \nbody. They, by their election, determine who serves here. I guess maybe \nsome people, who have not run for county sheriff or Congress, for that \nmatter, probably sometimes dismiss the interests of the people.\n  There is a desk here that I was assigned to the first day I came to \nthe Senate, and I have since been reassigned. It was temporary. I \nopened the drawer and, as is the custom, deep in the drawers, in the \nhistory of the Senate, everyone carves their names in the desk. That is \nnot a practice we recommend to schoolchildren, but the history is that \nwe do that. The desk that I was assigned to the first day I was here \nindicates that Harry Truman carved his name in the desk. A desk I was \nassigned to later says that Warren Harding sat in that desk. He later \nbecame President. Below his name is the name of one of the great \npopulists in this country, Robert La Follette from Wisconsin. He \nunderstood about economic power. He understood about the people, and he \nwould understand when I express enormous surprise that there is anyone \nwho comments on, is interested in, or is involved in politics, who \nbelieves that there is too much concern and attention being paid to the \npeople in our political campaigns.\n  Frankly, there is not enough concern and attention being paid to the \ncenter issues that affect people, who, every day, are trying to figure \nout how do we get a good education, how do we afford decent health \ncare, how do we find a good job that pays well, how do we find a \ncompany to work for that will value and trust us and keep us and \nappreciate our work? Those are the center concerns of a lot of people \nin this country, who believe that over two centuries of growth, through \ninnovation and through hard work, America has succeeded beyond the \ndreams of most when you look at two centuries; but who also believe \nthat the best days in this country are still ahead of us, if its best \ndays are consigned to the interests of the people in this country, who \nstill have the opportunity to control its direction and still have the \nopportunity to tell us what they think is important and what they think \nwill make America a better country in which to live.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/23/senate-section/article/S1291-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1294-S1295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ACCENTUATING THE POSITIVE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when I first came to the Senate, President \nReagan surprised everybody in his State of the Union Message when he \nreferred quite often to Presidents Roosevelt and Kennedy, using them as \nexamples of good Government. President Bush followed. In his State of \nthe Union Messages he constantly referred to the Democratic Presidents \nincluding, of course, Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy.\n\n  Mr. President, it appears in the primary battles that are going on in \nthe Republican Party at this time to pick their nominee for the \nPresident of the United States they have been studying the Democrats \nprobably a little too literally. It seems they have studied so hard \nthat their primaries are now being conducted like ours used to be \nconducted. They are going to wind up, it appears, with their nominee \nchopped and beaten, I guess comparable to a McGovern or a Mondale.\n  Mr. President, the primary process that we have heard debated and \nwatched debated has been one where there has been nothing but \nnegativism. It is not what they can do. It is how much they can berate \neach other generally and the Government.\n  I think we should talk about how good things are rather than how bad \nthings are, because I truly believe we are doing very well as a \ncountry. Now, when we say ``doing well,'' that does not mean we do not \nhave a long way to go; we have a long way to go to become better, but \nwe are doing extremely well.\n  We need to improve, of course, on our immigration policies. There is \na lot of improvement that can be made there. And the trade policy.\n  As an example, I did not vote for NAFTA; I did not vote for GATT, but \nI hope they work. I do not come in the Chamber and berate what is going \non as a result of NAFTA and GATT. I hope they work. Even though I do \nnot think it was right to pass NAFTA, I do not think it benefits me or \nmy country to continually stand up and say how bad things are and it is \nall a direct result of NAFTA. I do not believe that is the case. I \nbelieve we have some problems with our trade. They are not all related \nto NAFTA and GATT.\n  We need to do better with crime fighting, especially, Mr. President, \nwith juvenile crime.\n  Let us talk about how well we are doing. Last year was the third year \nin a row where we had a declining deficit. It did not decline enough \neach year, but it declined. For the first time in 40 years we had 3 \nyears in a row with a declining deficit. We should talk about that. \nThat is good. That does not take away from the fact that we should have \na balanced budget. We can do that. But let us talk about what we have \naccomplished that has been positive.\n  New jobs, about 8 million new jobs in the last 3 years. That is good. \nLet us talk about it. That is important. Lowest inflation, lowest \nunemployment in well over 30 years. Economic growth has not been so \nhigh since the days of Kennedy and Johnson. Corporate profits have \nnever been higher. A couple times in the history of this country they \nhave been as high but never any higher.\n\n  We have heard speeches for years about how big Government is, but it \nwas not until this administration that something was done about it. We \nnow have 200,000 fewer civilian employees than we had 3 years ago. That \nis important, and that is good. We should talk about it. Government is \nsmaller than it used to be. It is now at about the same level it was \nduring the days of John Kennedy, even though the country has grown \nsignificantly. Consumer prices rose 2.5 percent last year, the second \nsmallest increase in three decades. That is good. We should talk about \nit. It is important. Stock prices benefiting from strong corporate \nearnings growth and low long-term interest rates have risen almost 75 \npercent during the last 3 years. Good does not mean good enough, but \nlet us talk. It is still good.\n  During the last 3 years, over 16,000 pages of obsolete regulations \nhave been eliminated, part of Vice President Gore's reinventing \nGovernment, and also as a result of Vice President Gore's reinventing \nGovernment we have 200,000 fewer Government jobs than we had when he \nbecame Vice President. We have more new small businesses. A record \nnumber of new small businesses have been created since the start of \nthis administration. Home ownership is at its highest level in 15 \nyears. And also even though we can do better with trade, the United \nStates beat Japan and every other county in the world in the last 2 \nyears in the production of automobiles, the first time that has \nhappened since the 1970's. That is good and we should talk about it.\n  Education. Fewer students are dropping out of high school. In fact, \nsince 1991, the dropout rate has fallen by 16 percent. That is \nstaggeringly good. Welfare rolls are down since March 1994 by 8 \npercent--not down enough. We still need welfare reform. It is broken \nand needs fixing, but let us talk about some of the good things that \nare happening in our country as we speak.\n  The misery index. The combined rate of unemployment and inflation is \nat its lowest levels since the 1960's. It sounds pretty good to me. And \nI wish those Presidential candidates would talk about that, would talk \nabout how good things are in America today. \n\n[[Page S1295]]\n\n  What the people running for President should be talking about, for \nexample, is health care. Thousands and thousands of new people each \nmonth are saying, ``I have no health insurance.'' Businesses more and \nmore each day are saying, ``We do not supply our employees health \ninsurance.'' Health care costs are still skyrocketing. Health care \ncosts this year alone will go up $1 billion. We need to have candidates \ntalking about health care reform.\n\n  Minimum wage. We need to talk about raising the minimum wage. It is \nnot a bunch of people, the stereotypical teenagers flipping hamburgers \nat McDonald's. The fact is that 60 percent of the people who receive \nthe minimum wage are women. For 40 percent of those people, that is the \nonly money they get for them and their family. The minimum wage needs \nto be increased. If it was good when we adopted it in the Depression \nyears, it is good today and we should do what we can as a Congress to \nmake sure it maintains its rate in keeping with inflation.\n  The environment. I have not heard a single candidate on the \nRepublican ticket running for President talk about the environment. \nThey are in that beautiful area of New Hampshire. I have never been to \nNew Hampshire but the pictures are beautiful. I would love to go there \nand see that State. On television, you think of the pristine \nenvironment. We need to be talking about the environment. The only \nthing we have seen especially from the other body this past year is to \nroll back the environmental laws--22 riders on 1 appropriations bill to \nroll back environmental regulations. People in that body want to wipe \nout the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, wipe out the endangered \nspecies law. They should be talking in a positive sense about what we \ncan do to improve the environment.\n  I repeat. What I have talked about has been good. It does not mean it \nis good enough, but it means it is good. Let us give our constituents, \nlet us give the people of America the positive spin. We are doing fine. \nLet us have these candidates talk about senior citizens and Medicare \nand not hear the nonsense that we are not cutting Medicare; we are only \ncutting the rate of increase, without leveling with the American people \nand saying, of course, we have to maintain an increase in funding for \nMedicare because thousands of new people are coming on the rolls every \nday. Medical costs are rising out of the roof. Of course, we have to \nincrease spending for Medicare. It does not mean we do not need to do \nsome work to make it a better system, but we need not decimate it. We \ndo not need to have it wither on the vine as the leader in the other \nbody says that it should.\n  Education, let us talk about education in a positive sense instead of \nwhat we are seeing happen this past year. We are seeing programs that I \nbelieve are good programs like School-to-Work--only 25 percent of the \nkids who graduate from high school graduate from college. What do we do \nabout the other 75 percent? We have one way of helping. That is our \nSchool-To-Work Program which is a fine program that deals with that 75 \npercent and involves local businesses. In the State of Nevada, we have \na wonderful School-to-Work Program. But what are they doing in the \nother body? They want to wipe it out, and in fact that is what we have. \nIt has been wiped out.\n\n  What about our Goals 2000? In Nevada, we have set our Goals 2000. \nThey are led by the First Lady of Nevada, Sandy Miller. About a month \nago in Nevada they published their goals for the year 2000, good goals \ndealing with literacy, math education, reading, but it is being wiped \nout by this Congress. That is unfortunate. It is unfair to kids.\n  Crime. Crime is staggeringly bad in this country, but let us talk \neven there about the fact that the crime rate is declining with the \nnumber of murders reported dropping by 12 percent, robberies down 10 \npercent, car theft down 5 percent. As a result of the Brady bill, more \nthan 45,000 fugitives and felons have been blocked from buying \nhandguns. We have more cops on the street, about 30,000 across the \ncountry, over 150 in the State of Nevada. It has helped. Now, where we \nare failing--I have no problem discussing this--is with juvenile crime. \nIt is becoming more violent, more vicious, and more random. We need to \ndo something about that. But let us even talk on a positive note there \nabout the President's State of the Union message where he said he was \ngoing to ask the head of the FBI to focus on juvenile crime, on gangs. \nThat is important.\n  There is where the discussions should come. Let us talk positively. \nLet us talk about how well we are doing and how much better we can do.\n  Mr. President, there was an article recently by Daniel Gross that I \nassume ran in a number of different newspapers around the country. One \nof the things he said, and I quote, was:\n\n       The wealthy would be well served to also recall that the \n     three most dramatic investment events of this century--the \n     panic of 1907 and the crashes of 1929 and 1987--all took \n     place in the watch of Republican Chief Executives.\n       The two worst Presidencies for stocks were those of \n     Republicans Herbert Hoover, under whom the Dow fell an \n     appalling 75 percent, and Richard Nixon. Between November \n     1968 and August 1974 the market fell 18 percent. Factor in \n     the high inflation of the early 1970s, and the loss \n     becomes a 6.9 percent annual rout.\n\n  Mr. President, I close by saying I think it is extremely important \nthat the primaries, as they develop, be ones that the candidates focus \nmore on the positive, talk about what is good that is happening in the \ncountry; and then on a positive note talk about how much better we can \nbe, rather than the continual harangue we hear about how bad things are \nand how, in effect, the future looks bleak. I do not believe that. I \nthink we are as good as our past. And our past has been good.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to provide for the exchange of certain lands within \nthe \n\n[[Page S1296]]\nState or Montana, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  The Lost Creek Exchange Act of 1996\n\n Mr. BURNS. Madam President, today I am introducing the Lost \nCreek Land Exchange Act of 1996.\n  This bill would accomplish two important things. It authorizes the \nacquisition of the Lost Creek area for the public, and it may help \nprevent the closure of the Brand-S mill in Livingston MT.\n  I want to emphasize that this bill is a starting point. I fully \nanticipate major changes will need to be made. Yet, the process needs \nto move forward.\n  Under this bill, 14,500 acres of blue-ribbon bighorn sheep habitat \nknown as Lost Creek would become a part of the Deerlodge National \nForest. For the past few years, local sportsman and conservation \ngroups, the Forest Service, and many others have been interested in the \npublic acquiring this prime habitat. I, too, believe this is a \nworthwhile endeavor.\n  The bill I am introducing today would transfer the Lost Creek area, \nand 3,000 additional acres currently owned by R-Y Timber, to the Forest \nService. In return R-Y Timber will acquire the deed to 3,600 acres and \n46 million board feet of timber.\n  As most people in Park County know, R-Y Timber has an option to \npurchase the Brand-S mill in Livingston. If R-Y Timber decides to not \npurchase this mill by the middle of March, it is my understanding that \nthe chances for the mill to remain open will be very slim. While R-Y \nTimber already has a mill in Townsend, this land exchange could allow \nR-Y Timber to keep both mills operating, and therefore, prevent the \nloss of 130 much-needed jobs in the Livingston area.\n  As I stated earlier, R-Y Timber will receive the deed to 46 million \nboard feet of timber in the Deerlodge, Helena, and Lewis and Clark \nNational Forests. However, the areas for harvesting have not been \nidentified.\n  In addition, this timber will be harvested according to the Montana \nForestry best management practice, Montana streamside zone management \nlaw, and other State laws. Between 20 and 30 percent of the timber will \nbe available each year, and R-Y Timber will have 5 years to complete \nthe harvest.\n  Language has also been included to assure that designation of the \ntimber will not slow down the present limitations on the numbers of \ntrained Forest Service personnel. Under this bill, the Forest Service \nwould be required to use outside contractors to perform whatever field \nwork is necessary for the designation.\n  The Lost Creek area has been valued at about $8 million. And the days \nof the Federal Government simply paying the price tag are over. This \nbill provides a way for the public to purchase this prime bighorn sheep \nhabitat while providing some timber jobs in our communities.\n  Madame President, as I stated earlier the bill I am introducing today \nis a starting point. We have much work ahead of us. Over the next \ncouple months, I hope that the parties involved will continue to work \ntogether so this win-win bill can make it to the President's \ndesk.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 1572. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to provide \nfunds and incentives for closures of rail-highway crossings, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                the railroad crossing safety act of 1996\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that \nwould make America's railroad crossings a lot safer.\n  According to the National Safety Council, over the past 4 years an \naverage of 522 people have been killed each year in train-vehicle \ncollisions. Last year, 37 of these deaths occurred in my own State of \nOhio.\n  Almost 50 percent of these accidents occur at crossings that are \nalready equipped with active warning devices. Simply adding more \nwarning devices, therefore, is not a complete solution to this problem.\n  Some of these railroad crossings are just too dangerous. They are \nlife threatening. They are not needed, and they ought to be closed.\n  We all know, however, that people get accustomed to taking certain \nroutes. And communities get used to certain traffic patterns. That's \nwhy it's sometimes difficult for localities to close these crossings, \neven when it's clear on safety grounds that a particular crossing must \nbe closed.\n  Clearly, the local communities need some help. That's the purpose of \nmy legislation.\n  Currently, the Federal Government pays 90 percent of the cost of \nclosing a rail-highway grade crossing. But other grade crossing safety \nprojects--such as traffic signs, guardrails, and traffic lights--are \neligible for 100 percent Federal funding.\n  The bill I am introducing today will make grade crossing closure \nprojects eligible for that same 100-percent Federal funding. This will \nremove the current incentive against closure projects.\n  If the safest thing to do is close a crossing, localities should have \nan incentive to do that.\n  This bill does not involve new Federal money. The money for this bill \nis already allocated for crossing safety purposes--and all we are \ntrying to do is deploy that money in the most rational and effective \nway.\n  My bill will also provide up to $7,500 to a local highway authority \nfor each crossing closed. Furthermore, the railroad that is operating \nthe crossing will match this money.\n  That means up to $15,000 for a local community--just to close a \ncrossing.\n  Obviously, this is just the beginning of a many-pronged assault on a \nmajor safety problem. We can't close every single crossing that might \nbe dangerous. So we want to make certain that the remaining railroad \ncrossings are as safe as possible.\n  Last summer, I brought together Federal and State officials to see \nwhether changes could be made to speed the process for dealing with \nunsafe railroad crossings.\n  Previously, the installation of safety lights and gates followed a \nlinear process--one step had to be completed before another was allowed \nto begin. we created a new, streamlined process that allows officials \nto identify hazardous crossings and to implement expedited safety \nmeasures.\n  We eliminated the waiting periods between design, funding, and \nconstruction. The safety installation process used to take up to 2 \nyears--but with this new, streamlined process, we are hoping it will \nonly take about 12 months. This new process is being tried on 31 \ndifferent sites throughout the State of Ohio.\n  It is a very promising approach, and if it works in Ohio, it deserves \nto be extended all over America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1572\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The purpose of the guidelines is to encourage \n     uniformity in the analysis of such costs and benefits by the \n     States.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                            By Mr. D'AMATO:\n\n  S. 1573. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nestablish and provide a checkoff for a Breast and Prostate Cancer \nResearch Fund, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           the taxpayers' cancer research funding act of 1996\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, breast and prostate cancer have \ntaken a horrible toll on women and men throughout the world and we must \nmake every effort to eradicate these pervasive diseases. Breast cancer \nis a deadly epidemic that strikes over 180,000 women each year. It will \nkill more than 44,000 women this year alone. Similarly, prostate cancer \nwill strike an estimated 317,000 men, and will kill roughly 41,000 men \nthis year. We cannot allow these appalling rates to continue unabated. \nWe need to do something now. We need a cure and finding a cure takes \nmoney--a tremendous amount of money.\n  I rise today to introduce legislation to add another weapon to our \narsenal in the fight against breast and prostate cancer. My bill will \nprovide vital resources for the fight to eradicate this dire threat to \nthe lives of women and men across our Nation. In addition, my bill will \nsupport our efforts to combat one of the leading cancer killers of men: \nprostate cancer. This is a very straightforward bill. This bill will \naugment existing Federal research funding by easily allowing taxpayers \nto get directly involved by contributing to a newly established fund \nexpressly earmarked for breast and prostate cancer research.\n  On the Federal income tax return there currently exists a box that \ncan be selected for Federal campaign contributions. My bill will amend \nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by establishing a similar box for a \nFederal breast and prostate cancer research fund. This will allow our \ncitizens to cross swords with this dual scourge by simply placing a \ncheck in a box on their income tax return, as with the campaign \ncontribution fund. One point needs to be made very clear--this is not \nan additional tax. This is a purely voluntary means by which concerned \ncitizens may earmark a minor but vital portion of their Federal income \ntax payments expressly for breast and prostate cancer research.\n  Breast cancer is a truly horrible disease. Its incidence is rising at \nan alarming rate. In 1960, 1 out of every 14 women developed breast \ncancer in her lifetime. A few years ago it was 1 in 10. Now the figure \nis one in eight. We cannot allow this trend to continue. According to \nthe National Cancer Institute's calculations, breast cancer comprises \nabout 30 percent of all female cancers and it is estimated that the \ncost to the nation in the form of direct and indirect health care costs \nwill exceed $16 billion annually. The NCI also says that reductions in \nbreast cancer mortality will have a significant influence on these \ncosts to the Nation.\n  Like breast cancer among women, prostate cancer is a leading killer \nof American men. According to the American Cancer Society, this dreaded \ndisease is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. It is \nprojected to take the lives of approximately 41,000 men in 1996 alone.\n  Congress has just begun to pay more attention to these terrible \ndiseases by devoting increased funding for breast and prostate cancer \nresearch at the Federal level. We have made tremendous progress, but \nmuch more remains to be done. Given current budget constraints we need \na mechanism to increase breast and prostate cancer funding every year \nfrom here on out.\n  Our current method of breast cancer treatment is not a cure. Today's \ntreatments for breast cancer are very crude. We treat women with \npoison, radiation, and radical surgery with the hope that we will kill \nthe cancer and not the woman. This is similar to dropping a tiny atom \nbomb. What we need is a smart bomb for breast cancer. Something which \nwill specifically kill the breast cancer cells without causing \ndestruction to the rest of the women's body and immune system. This can \nonly be accomplished with an additional infusion of breast cancer \nresearch dollars. We also need to recruit more scientists and new ideas \nand innovations into this field. More money will jumpstart research but \nit must also cover the funding needs of research scientist and their \nprograms.\n  I am personally determined to do everything I can to fight for the \neradication of breast and prostate cancer. I hope to enlist the aid of \nmy colleagues in the establishment of this Federal breast and prostate \ncancer research fund. Breast and prostate cancer can only be \nunderstood, and eventually conquered, through increased research We \nneed a cure and we need one now. It is therefore critical that we all \njoin together in this effort to help speed the discovery of a cure for \nthese dreaded diseases.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of this critical bill.\n\n

   THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF MERRIMACK, NH\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMerrimack, NH, on their 250th anniversary. On April 2, the 22,500 \nresidents of Merrimack will begin a year-long birthday celebration \nencompassing numerous town activities to mark this historic occasion.\n  Very few towns in the United States can claim 250 years as part of \ntheir heritage. In 1746, King George II of England issued the town's \nfirst charter. During the Revolutionary War, Merrimack residents \nvolunteered as some of the original Minute Men. The volunteers fought \nin the Battle of Bunker Hill in Charlestown, MA. Miraculously, only one \nMerrimack life was lost in this battle. Later, over 40 Merrimack men \nserved heroically in the areas of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, West \nPoint, Valley Forge, White Plains, and Fort Ticonderoga. The town of \nMerrimack paid their soldiers with Indian corn since money was scarce \nat that time. This is the sort of patriotism and commitment to freedom \nthat Merrimack residents still embody today.\n  Commercial development in Merrimack began even before King George II \nissued the first charter. In 1656, John Cromwell established the first \ntrading post. More settlers began arriving via the Merrimack River, \nfrom many surrounding areas. Other trading posts were established at \nferry landings where stores were stocked with beeswax, molasses, flint, \nand powder, along with the best sellers of the day, rum and spirits.\n  In the early 1880's, rich deposits of clay were found in Merrimack \nallowing the town to create a thriving brick-making industry. By 1846, \nthere were 12 brickyards in town, employing 100 people. Many of the \nlocal buildings began using brick with granite foundation from nearby \nquarries in their construction. Brickmaking and river boating \nflourished until the railroad arrived in 1852.\n  In 1872, a cooperage shop at Reed's Ferry was established where \nEnglish immigrants came to work. In 1897, other immigrants from Greece, \nPoland, and Slavic countries arrived to work in the many mills and \nfactories being built.\n  Today, Merrimack is one of the thriving industrial towns just north \nof the Massachusetts border, housing many of New Hampshire's most \nprosperous manufacturers.\n  Over the years, Merrimack has had a number of famous residents; \nincluding Dr. Matthew Thornton whose signature appears on the \nDeclaration of Independence. Among his numerous distinctions, Doctor \nThornton was the surgeon of the New Hampshire Troop in 1745, was \nelected to the Continental Congress in December 1776, and served in the \nState senate from 1784 to 1786. In 1789, he purchased a large estate, \nand spent the rest of his 89 years in Merrimack. A monument to honor \nMatthew Thornton is displayed on the corner of route 3 and Greeley \nStreet.\n  Today, Merrimack's population has grown to include 22,500 residents. \nThe town boasts a dynamic business environment with a number of small \nto medium size businesses, many of which are family owned. In addition, \nFortune 500 companies, particularly technology firms, dot the business \nlandscape in Merrimack and are continuing to hire more and more \nresidents each year. Merrimack residents are very politically active, \nattending town and school board meetings regularly. The local chamber \nof commerce and Rotary Club are also both very involved in local \nactivities.\n  I wish the town of Merrimack a very happy 250th birthday. I share the \npride of all New Hampshire citizens in the accomplishments and rich \nhistoric background of this wonderful town and its people. \nCongratulations Merrimack.\n  (At the request of Mr. Dorgan, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/23/senate-section/article/S1298-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1298-S1299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FELIX ROHATYN'S WITHDRAWAL IS A LOSS FOR THE NATION\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to share with my \ncolleagues my deep sense of regret over the decision by Felix Rohatyn \nto withdraw his name from consideration as a nominee to the position of \nVice Chairman of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.\n  My disappointment is based upon two factors: The first is that the \nNation has lost an opportunity to benefit from the services of someone \nwho not only has deep insights into the how the American economy \nfunctions, but someone who also has decades of practical economic \nexperience both in the public and private sector.\n  Mr. Rohatyn is justifiably celebrated for his successful efforts that \nbrought New York City from the edge of bankruptcy onto sound financial \nground. He did so through a combination of public and private action \nthat resulted in downsizing the Nation's fourth largest \n\n[[Page S1299]]\ngovernment, thus creating the foundation that has allowed New York City \nto achieve a balanced budget for every year for most of the past two \ndecades.\n  Felix Rohatyn has also achieved great success in the private sector \nas the managing partner of the investment banking firm of Lazard \nFreres. Few people in the Nation can claim to have a better \nunderstanding of our capital markets and be able to back up those \nclaims with the cold, hard proof of continued profitable returns for \nthe company that he runs.\n  But it is the manner in which, and the basis upon which, Mr. Rohatyn \nwas prompted to withdraw his candidacy for this important position that \nprompts me to take the floor today.\n  I fully respect--indeed, I encourage--the right of my colleagues to \nform and express their personal opinions about Presidential nominees. \nBut that respect is diminished when that opposition takes a form that \nprecludes a nominee from even getting a fair and open hearing before \nthe Senate. That respect is diminished when instead of confronting a \nnominee during the hearing process and allowing that nominee to respond \ndirectly to his or her critics, leaked staff reports and innuendo are \nused to derail a nominee's chances.\n  But we must go beyond the manner in which these objections were \nraised to examine the objections themselves, for they portend a slavish \ndevotion to an economic orthodoxy that is out of place in our system of \nGovernment.\n  I could understand active opposition to a nominee if he or she had \nbeen an advocate of Marxist economic thought or believed that \nisolationism was a cure for America's economic ills or was an advocate \nfor some other discredited economic theory.\n  But it appears that Mr. Rohatyn simply failed to meet some arbitrary \nlitmus test as to who is or isn't a strong advocate for ending ``the \nera of big Government.''\n  Mr. Rohatyn's sin? He proposed that the U.S. Government make \ninvestments in the infrastructure of the Nation. That radical thought \nplaces Mr. Rohatyn squarely in the camp of such noted American rebels \nas Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, Theodore Roosevelt, and most notorious \nof all, Dwight Eisenhower.\n  Mr. Rohatyn also has the heretical notion that it is possible for the \nAmerican economy to grow, without risking inflation, at a faster rate \nthan the puny 2.5 percent per year that some--I repeat, some--\neconomists believe is the maximum safe rate of growth.\n  It is amazing to me that some of my colleagues can become so wedded \nto specific static numbers in the field of economics, as if the numbers \nthemselves were some sort of Rosetta Stone that could unlock the secret \nof economic prosperity. Some people must believe that understanding the \neconomy is as easy as calibrating the atomic clock or measuring the \nsnowfall at National Airport. In fact it is the philosophy and \nmethodology that underlies these otherwise meaningless statistics that \nis of critical importance. On that score, Felix Rohatyn is extremely \nwell qualified to serve on the Federal Reserve Board.\n  The Federal Reserve is supposed to be an arena in which varying \neconomic ideas can be debated, free from the constraints and pressures \nof the political arena. In that sense, it mirrors our greatest \ndemocratic institutions; if a diversity of opinion wasn't desired, \nthere would be no need to have a Vice Chairman, or a Board of \nGovernors. If monolithic thought were the intent, we would simply a \nsingle Director at the Federal Reserve, whose edicts would be carved \nonto marble tablets and then disseminated throughout the land.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Rohatyn's credentials are virtually unquestioned.\n  The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee recently stated that he \nthought the Mr. Rohatyn did ``an excellent job in New York,'' referring \nto his rescue of that city from bankruptcy.\n  Mr. Rohatyn's colleagues on Wall Street said: ``Most people on Wall \nStreet have great respect for Rohatyn and his financial skills. He is a \nguy who is not at all soft on inflation, so [we] don't know where those \nrumors to the contrary came from.''\n  The Financial Times said ``there are not many U.S. bankers worth \nlistening to. Rohatyn is the exception.''\n  The Washington Post stated, in an editorial entitled, Playing Games \nwith the Fed, that ``* * * the elected branches in recent years have \npretty well given up on the broad management of the economy. They \nmainly add to the problem, which is then left to the Fed to resolve. \nThey ought not compound the burden they create by spreading to the Fed \ntheir own doctrinal quarrel.''\n  Some may view the withdrawal of Mr. Rohatyn from consideration as a \nvictory of sorts. But by depriving the Nation of the benefits of Felix \nRohatyn's talents and by imposing an ideological straightjacket on \nFederal Reserve Board nominees, those who are rejoicing today may find \nthat theirs is a Pyhrric victory indeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/23/senate-section/article/S1298-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1299-S1300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO U.S.S. ``GREENEVILLE''\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on Friday, February 16, I traveled \nto Norfolk, VA, to deliver the keynote address at the commissioning of \nthe U.S.S. Greeneville. This naval attack submarine, was named after \nthe small city of Greeneville, TN, as a tribute to the rich history of \nthe city and its citizens. I ask that my remarks at the commissioning \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n                 Tribute to the U.S.S. ``Greeneville''\n\n       On behalf of the citizens of Greeneville--and indeed all \n     the people of the great State of Tennessee--it is an honor to \n     be with you on this proud day.\n       Standing here before this great warship--and the officers \n     and crew who will guide her in defense of freedom--we are \n     filled not only with pride in our Nation and our Navy, but \n     also with confidence that we can and will meet any challenge \n     that lies ahead.\n       It's been said that each new ship, as she leaves land to \n     find her home in the sea, begins to form a personality that \n     will be hers alone. A personality that encompasses the hopes \n     and dreams of all who built her and all who sail in her. But \n     her personality also takes on the spirit of those in whose \n     honor she is named.\n       If that is so, the U.S.S. Greeneville will be imbued with \n     the courage, pride, and patriotism epitomized by Greeneville, \n     and by the thousands of other small towns across our great \n     land whose people are the heart and soul of America.\n       She will carry with her the valor of Revolutionary War hero \n     General Nathanael Greene, for whom Greeneville was named. The \n     unflagging integrity of Greeneville's honored son President \n     Andrew Johnson, who helped unite the country after the \n     assassination of Abraham Lincoln. And the pluck of the great \n     Greeneville frontiersman Davy Crockett, who blazed a trail \n     into the wilderness and died defending the Alamo.\n       And she will carry the pride of every Greenevillian. From \n     Mayor Love and all our elected officials; to the men and \n     women of the Greeneville Metal Manufacturing Company, a \n     subsidiary of the Newport News shipyards; Admiral Francis \n     McCorckle, former commander of the battleship New Jersey and \n     a resident of Greeneville for all of his 86 years; and so \n     many others--who wrote letters, signed petitions, and lobbied \n     Congress, the Navy, and anyone who would listen, to have this \n     magnificent submarine bear its name.\n       While many today advocate a sharply diminished defense in \n     the post-Cold War world, those of you who guard the frontiers \n     of freedom know that the price of peace is eternal vigilance. \n     And it is this vessel--the nuclear attack submarine--that \n     leads the way. It is the sword point of our forward-deployed \n     defenses--the first to respond to threats from potential \n     aggressors, and the first to arrive in times of crisis.\n       Whether the mission calls for a continuous presence, as in \n     the Caribbean off of Haiti; covert surveillance and \n     reconnaissance, as in the Adriatic off Bosnia; or special \n     operations forces, such as those we have maintained for years \n     in the Korean theater; submarines provide critical direct and \n     indirect support to our military forces, and are a mainstay \n     of our strategic deterrence platform.\n       As General Nathanael Greene's colleague General George \n     Washington put it, ``There is nothing so likely to produce \n     peace as to be well prepared to meet an enemy.'' Or as a more \n     recent commentator put it, ``Today the real test of power is \n     not capacity to make war but capacity to prevent it.''\n       That is why our military and civilian leaders must exercise \n     their vigilance with foresight, with one eye always on the \n     future. The price of unpreparedness is too high in American \n     blood and treasure. We do well today to recall when the \n     decision to build the U.S.S. Greeneville was first made, the \n     current commander-in-chief was governor of Arkansas, and I \n     was performing heart transplants in Nashville. And the \n     Greeneville will continue to defend America into the next \n     century, after both of us have returned to our home states.\n       While the Russians continue to produce and improve their \n     submarine capabilities, and we face increased proliferation \n     of submarine technology among many other nations, the United \n     States continues to field the finest submarine force in the \n     world. \n     \n[[Page S1300]]\n\n       And for that we owe a deep debt of gratitude to the skilled \n     men and women of Newport News, who have built and maintained \n     the subs that have kept us ahead of our adversaries. No \n     nation on earth can match the quality and pride that shows in \n     every weld, fitting, and watertight hatch.\n       We also owe a great debt to the submariners who patrol the \n     icy depths of the world's waters in times of peace and in \n     times of war. Their courage--and devotion to duty--are a \n     model of sacrifice worthy of emulation and gratitude from all \n     of us. Americans are a patriotic people who agree with the \n     poet Homer when he writes: ``He serves me most who serves his \n     country best.''\n       To every person who played a role in the fitting-out and \n     commissioning of the U.S.S. Greeneville--Thank you.\n       To the officers and crew who will sail her into the \n     uncharted waters of the future--Good luck and Godspeed. In \n     every sea, on every mission, the spirit and prayers of the \n     people of Greeneville will go with you.\n       They, too, can repeat with you the Midshipman's prayer of \n     the Naval Academy: ``Almighty God, whose way is in the sea, \n     whose paths are in the great waters, whose command is over \n     all and whose love never faileth: . . . Protect those in \n     whose love I live. . . . Guide me with the light of truth and \n     give me the strength to faithfully serve thee, now and \n     always.''\n       Finally, to all here today to watch the U.S.S. Greeneville \n     come alive, God bless you, God bless Greeneville, and God \n     bless America.\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Dorgan, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/23/senate-section/article/S1299-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBUTE TO FREDERICK DOUGLASS AND THE TOWN OF HIGHLAND BEACH\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I join with the citizens \nof Highland Beach, MD, as they pay tribute to the memory of Frederick \nDouglass--one of Maryland's most celebrated native sons--by preserving \nhis historic house as a museum. His house, facing the Chesapeake Bay, \nlooks out onto the open sea and was a joyful reminder to Douglass of \nthe freedom he so greatly treasured.\n  While Frederick Douglass was born in Talbot County, MD, and worked on \nthe docks of Fells Point in Baltimore, he found peace and solace at his \nhome in Highland Beach. Highland Beach was the first town to be \nestablished by African-Americans in the State of Maryland and was \nofficially incorporated in 1922, although settlers had been living in \nthe vicinity for decades. The house that is dedicated here today was \ndesigned by Douglass, but sadly, he never saw its completion. Instead \nhis son fulfilled the task that was set forth by his father, ensuring \nthat the second floor balcony that Douglass had dreamed of was erected \nso that, ``as a free man, I could look across the bay to the land where \nI was born a slave.''\n  The Frederick Douglass house was placed on the National Registry of \nHistoric Places in 1992 after extensive renovations were completed. The \nhouse has also received the Orlando Rideout Prize for exceptional \nrenovation in December 1995 by the Anne Arundel County Trust for \nPreservation. While these awards reflect the beauty and history of \nDouglass' home, that Frederick Douglass could own a home as a free man \nis the true monument. Douglass rightly believed that owning property \nwas a very important economic accomplishment for African-Americans in \nthe years following the Civil War.\n  It is, in my view, most fitting that the commemoration of one of \nMaryland's most noted African-Americans comes during Black History \nMonth. Over the course of history, Maryland has been the home of many \nprominent African-Americans including writer Langston Hughes, actor and \nsinger Paul Robeson, Washington Judge Robert Terrell, and educator and \nauthor Booker T. Washington; all of whom either visited or lived in \nHighland Beach.\n  Mr. President, as the Frederick Douglass house becomes a monument in \nthe splendid community of Highland Beach, it provides an avenue for \nresidents and visitors to share in its unique and distinguished past. I \njoin the citizens of Anne Arundel County in demonstrating their pride \nin the history of Highland Beach and their expectation of continued \nsuccess in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/23/senate-section/article/S1300-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMENDING DEBORAH WOELFLEIN AS THE 1996 NEW HAMPSHIRE TEACHER OF THE \n                                  YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Deborah \nK. Woelflein, an English teacher at Merrimack High School, on being \nnamed New Hampshire's 1996 National Teacher of the Year. As a former \nteacher myself, I commend her outstanding accomplishment and well-\ndeserved honor.\n  Deborah, who is a Nashua resident, will spend the next year \nrepresenting New Hampshire's teaching profession at various statewide \nand regional functions. As New Hampshire's Teacher of the Year, she \nwill be considered for the National Teacher of the Year Award sponsored \nby the Council of Chief State School Officers and Scholastic, Inc. The \nNational Teacher of the Year Program is the oldest and most prestigious \nhonors program to focus public attention on excellence in teaching. New \nHampshire's Commissioner of Education, Elizabeth Twomey, named Deborah \nthe Teacher of the Year.\n  Among Deborah's numerous accomplishments as a teacher are several \nsuccessful conferences she organized to draw together talented teachers \nto share their expertise with their colleagues. Timothy Mayes, \nprincipal at Merrimack High School, called her ``one of our most \nrespected faculty members.''\n  New Hampshire has always been lucky to have many talented teachers, \nbut Deborah Woelflein is certainly a role model among the teachers of \nthe Granite State. I am proud of her commitment to education and \ncongratulate her distinguished achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/23/senate-section/article/S1300-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE FARM BILL--WETLAND RESTORATION\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Sections 357 and 358 of S. 1541 were included in an \namendment to which we jointly agreed. Section 357 establishes flood \nwater retention pilot projects under which farmers may receive \nincentives to restore land to fully functioning wetlands. The \nrestoration of these wetlands will benefit their neighbors by reducing \nflooding.\n  Section 358 was included in the bill to ensure that when a farmer \nvoluntarily restores a wetland on land now exempt from Swampbuster \npenalties, that land will not subsequently be considered a converted \nwetland under Swampbuster. Section 364 was then added because of \nconcern that section 358 did not protect against abandonment related \nregulatory policies. The sections need to be rewritten to work \ncorrectly.\n  Would the Senator from Indiana agree that I have correctly described \nthe history of these amendments?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I agree with my colleague about the history of these \namendments.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is important that these amendments be correctly drafted \nif they are included in the final bill. Would my colleague agree that \nwe will work together in conference to develop a provision based on the \nfollowing principle:\n  Swampbuster should operate in a manner that encourages voluntary \nrestoration of wetlands. A farmer should not suffer a Swampbuster \npenalty if land he restores to a wetland later reverts to its \nprerestoration status. However, such a provision should be implemented \nin a fashion consistent with the wetland protection goals of \nSwampbuster.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I agree with my colleague and will work to rewrite this \nprovision according to this principle in conference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/23/senate-section/article/S1300-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1300-S1301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO OPENS AN ONLINE GATEWAY SITE TO THE U.S. \n                    GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE [GPO]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to \nthose who have already spoken in recognition of February as Black \nHistory Month. Since 1926 this Nation has designated February as the \nmonth in which we honor the achievements and contributions of African-\nAmericans to our history, our culture, and our future.\n  One could also say that February is the month in which we honor our \nNation's unsung heroes--from the African-American soldiers who have \noften received no acknowledgement for fighting in the American \nRevolution to the African-American poets and authors often excluded \nfrom literary anthologies. The history of African-Americans is the \nhistory of what this country has come to mean to so many people around \nthe world. It is the story of seemingly unsurmountable odds overcome \nand challenges yet to be faced. This year the President has asked us \nall to pay a special tribute to the achievements and contributions of \nblack women who have risen above the twin burdens and racism and \nsexism.\n  Black History Month provides our Nation with an opportunity to \nreflect upon the progress which we have made as a nation in our \nstruggle to promote the constitutional principles of liberty, equality, \nand justice. One black woman who contributed to the preservation of \nthose principles was Barbara Jordan. I was honored to have served \nalongside Barbara Jordan in the Congress, and I recall very well her \nsteadfast devotion to our Constitution. Barbara Jordan eloquently and \nwith great faith articulated and lived the basic principles underlying \nour democratic government and society. I witnessed this dedication \nfirst-hand during our service on the House Judiciary Committee during \nthe impeachment proceedings of former President Nixon. Barbara Jordan \nunderstood that our Constitution is a precious covenant and did her \nutmost to defend and uphold its promises to all of the citizens of the \nUnited States. With her recent passing, our Nation has lost one of the \nConstitution's great defenders, and I know that my colleagues will \nagree with me when I say that Barbara Jordan will be greatly missed.\n  Mr. President, my own State of Maryland has been blessed to be the \nbirthplace and home of countless outstanding black Americans. Maryland \nwas a bedrock of the underground railroad which helped many African-\nAmericans find there way out of slavery to freedom. In fact, and \nHarriet Tubman, the African-American woman credited with leading more \nthan 200 men, women, and children to freedom on the underground \nrailroad, was a Marylander.\n  Born into slavery around 1821 on a Dorchester County plantation, \nHarriet Tubman escaped in 1849. However, instead of turning her back on \nthose she had left behind, Harriet Tubman used her knowledge of \nMaryland's Eastern Shore to help other slaves escape to freedom. She \nwas so successful that Maryland plantation owners placed a $40,000 \nprice on her head, dead or alive. Although she is most often remembered \nfor her work on the underground railroad, Harriet Tubman's service to \nthis Nation continued throughout her life. During the Civil War, she \nserved as a spy for the Union Army as well as a scout and a nurse. \nAfter the Civil War Harriet Tubman worked to resettle Negro war \nrefugees, to establish the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and \non behalf of women's suffrage.\n  The history of Maryland is replete with the contributions of African-\nAmerican women--many of which have gone undocumented and unrecognized. \nBlack History Month affords all Americans an opportunity to honor our \nheroes both past and present, and to remind ourselves of the many \nnational heroes whose faces do not adorn currency or postage stamps and \nwhose stories are not told in history books or encyclopedias.\n  Mr. President, as we near the end of this month, I hope that each of \nus will take a moment to remember the lessons of Black History Month \nand to carry them with us throughout the year as a reminder of all that \nis truly possible. Two hundred years ago, how many Americans would have \nimagined a Barbara Jordan or an Alice Walker? Black History Month is a \ntime to celebrate--to celebrate all of the great achievements of \nAfrican-Americans, to celebrate how far this country has come, and to \nremind us of how much further we have to go.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/23/senate-section/article/S1301-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1301-S1302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PAUL G. GOEBEL, JR.\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the passing \nof Paul G. Goebel, Jr., insurance executive and longtime friend to the \nUniversity of Michigan, Kent County Republicans, and the people of \nMichigan. Paul's life showed how hard work, honesty, and decency can \nstill produce success in \n\n[[Page S1302]]\nAmerica, and how they also can produce a giving character and important \ngood works.\n  After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1954, Paul served \na 2-year hitch in the U.S. Army. On returning home he entered the \ninsurance business. In the mid-1960's he began work with the Goebel-\nHammon agency, which became the Paul Goebel Group in the mid 1980's. \nThis successful agency provided coverage for professional associations \nand businesses. In 1994 he left the business in the capable hands of \nhis daughter, Margaret.\n  Paul's activities were never limited to his business. He served as \npresident of the University of Michigan Grand Rapids Alumni Club. As \nearly as 1968 he received the Outstanding Young Man of the Year Award \nfrom the Grand Rapids Jaycees. He was appointed an honorary member of \nthe United Way of Kent County in 1977 and served in a variety of \ncapacities for that agency, including president.\n  An Ada Township resident, Paul also was a big supporter of the \nRepublican cause in Kent County and in Michigan as a whole. The son of \nPaul G. Goebel, Sr., mayor of Grand Rapids during much of the 1950's, \nhe also served as a Kent County commissioner from 1972 to 1974 and was \nonce chairman of the county GOP. In 1974 he launched an unsuccessful \nbid to win back for the Republicans the seat once held by Gerald Ford. \nDisappointing as it was, however, this loss could hardly mar a life \nfilled with friendship, family, and an active desire to serve the \ncommunity.\n  Paul passed away on February 15, just a few weeks after being \ndiagnosed with lung cancer. My thoughts go out to his family but, sad \nas I am at his passing, I also feel privileged to have known a man of \nhis warm and giving character.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/23/senate-section/article/S1301-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1302-S1303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CHARLES CAMPBELL'S SPEECH IN HONOR OF SENATOR RICHARD B. RUSSELL\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on January 24, 1996, I joined many of \nour colleagues in honoring the late Senator Richard Brevard Russell of \nGeorgia. Almost 25 years after the death of Senator Russell, hundreds \nof Russell family members, friends, and former colleagues dedicated a \n7-foot marble statue of Senator Russell in the rotunda of the Senate \nOffice Building which bears his name.\n  In the near future, our distinguished colleague, the Honorable Robert \nC. Byrd, will insert a transcript of the ceremony into the \nCongressional Record. Today, I want to share with the Senate excerpts \nfrom a speech delivered last fall at the Governor's Mansion in Atlanta \nby Mr. Charles E. Campbell, president of the Richard B. Russell \nFoundation in Atlanta. I am grateful to Mr. William Jordan, my friend \nand a former senior staff assistant to Senator Russell, for making this \ntext available to me.\n  Mr. President, I ask that excerpts of Mr. Campbell's speech be \nprinted in the Record so that it may be part of the historical record \nof Senator Russell's distinguished career in public service.\n  The material follows:\n\nRemarks by Charles E. Campbell at the Russell Statue Luncheon, October \n                                23, 1995\n\n       Thank you, Governor Miller. First, I would like to express \n     the appreciation of the Russell foundation to Governor Miller \n     and Senator Nunn for hosting this luncheon today. Zell Miller \n     and Sam Nunn have long been friends of Richard Russell and of \n     the Russell Foundation.\n       I had the privilege of working for the last 6 years of \n     Senator Russell's life as a member of his staff in \n     Washington. Today, I have the honor to serve as Chairman of \n     the Richard Russell Foundation. The Russell Foundation is a \n     non-profit corporation established by admirers of Senator \n     Russell in Georgia. It supports numerous activities related \n     to the preservation of the Senator's memory, his records and \n     discussion of public policy questions in which Senator \n     Russell had a particular interest.\n       Next January will mark the 25th anniversary of Richard \n     Russell's death. At that time, we will have an opportunity to \n     participate in an event that will not only bring great credit \n     to Senator Russell but to our State as well. I refer to the \n     dedication of the Richard B. Russell Statue. The Russell \n     Statue is a 7-foot marble statue that will be placed in the \n     Rotunda area of the Russell Senate Office Building. The \n     Russell Senate Office Building is the oldest and most \n     prestigious of the three senate office buildings in \n     Washington. In 1972--the year after Senator Russell died--the \n     Congress, through joint resolution, renamed what had been \n     known as the ``Old Senate Office Building'' as the ``Richard \n     B. Russell Senate Office Building.'' The Russell Senate \n     Office Building is one of the most important buildings in our \n     Nation's Capitol. It was there that such momentous events in \n     the history of our country took place as the hearings to \n     inquire into President Truman's dismissal of General Douglas \n     McArthur during the Korean War (hearings which Senator \n     Russell chaired incidentally), the announcement of John F. \n     Kennedy's presidential campaign, the Senate Watergate \n     hearings (of which Senator Talmadge was such an important \n     part), and, more recently, the Clarence Thomas confirmation \n     hearings.\n       The dedication of the Russell Statue at 4 p.m. on January \n     24, 1996 will focus on three distinct aspects of Senator \n     Russell's Senate career: (1) Richard B. Russell--A \n     President's Senator; (2) Richard B. Russell--A Senator's \n     Senator and (3) Richard B. Russell--Georgia's Senator.\n       The President of the United States has been invited to \n     speak on the first topic and, while he has made no final \n     commitment, the initial indications are positive for his \n     participation. Senator Robert Byrd, the former Majority \n     Leader of the Senate, and Senator Robert Dole, the present \n     Majority Leader of the Senate, have both agreed to speak on \n     Richard B. Russell--a Senator's Senator. Our Governor will \n     speak on the topic of ``Richard B. Russell--Georgia's \n     Senator.'' Senator Sam Nunn will serve as Master of \n     Ceremonies.\n       Many of you in this room knew Richard Russell personally \n     and many others of you know him by reputation. His career was \n     one of the most outstanding in our Nation's history. He \n     served 50 continuous years in public office. he served 10 \n     years in the Georgia House of Representatives, including the \n     last 4 as Speaker. He became Speaker of the Georgia House in \n     1926 before he was even 30 years of age. He became Georgia's \n     youngest Governor in 1930 at age 32 during the depths of the \n     great depression. The administration of Governor Russell was \n     one of decisive change in our State--he cut the number of \n     State agencies from 102 to 17 and cut the cost of Government \n     by 20 percent. At the same time, there were numerous \n     progressive achievements of the Russell administration \n     including the creation of a unified system of higher \n     education under a Board of Regents insulated from politics. \n     That system survives today.\n       When a Senate seat became vacant in 1932, Governor Russell \n     ran successfully and took office at the age of 34 on January \n     12, 1933. He was the Nation's youngest Senator.\n       Richard Russell served 38 years in the U.S. Senate, \n     becoming the first person in the history of the United States \n     to serve over half their life in the Senate. During this \n     time, from 1933 through 1970--he never missed a single \n     opening session of Congress. You might call him the Cal \n     Ripken of the Senate.\n       Senator Russell's Senate career was perhaps unique in the \n     history of our Country. No Senator, at least in modern times, \n     has amassed the power and influence that Richard Russell \n     enjoyed both in the Senate itself and at the White House.\n       When we refer to Richard Russell as a ``President's \n     Senator'' we are referring to the fact that he enjoyed an \n     extremely close relationship with every American President \n     from Franklin Roosevelt through Richard Nixon and was a \n     confidential advisor of every one of them.\n       Four of the Presidents with whom Senator Russell served--\n     Harry Truman, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard \n     Nixon--had previously served in the Senate where Richard \n     Russell was the preeminent Senator. He knew them all well and \n     they all knew before they arrived at the White House that \n     Richard Russell was the foremost congressional authority on \n     national security and a Senator who was good to his word in \n     all matters. The other two Presidents--Franklin Roosevelt and \n     Dwight Eisenhower--also had extensive prior relationships \n     with Senator Russell. Franklin Roosevelt and Richard Russell \n     became friends as young men when they were both serving as \n     Governor of their States--Franklin Roosevelt in New York and \n     Richard Russell here in Georgia.\n       In fact, at the 1932 Democratic National Convention, \n     Richard Russell made a nominating speech for Franklin \n     Roosevelt in the first of Roosevelt's four successful \n     campaigns for the White House. Even though he was a new \n     Senator at the time, Richard Russell had a significant \n     leadership role in the Senate in passing New Deal farm \n     legislation that created the Farmer's Home Administration, \n     established farm price supports and soil conservation \n     protection measures. During this time, he authored the \n     National School Lunch Program.\n       Senator Russell, as a result of his position of influence \n     on the Senate Armed Services Committee, dealt extensively \n     with Dwight Eisenhower when General Eisenhower was the \n     Supreme Allied Commander in World War II. They had become \n     close friends before 1952 when General Eisenhower was elected \n     President. Their friendship continued and grew during the \n     Eisenhower Presidency.\n       One characteristic that was dominant in Senator Russell's \n     relationship not only with Presidents but with everyone else \n     was his staunch independence. No matter how close a friend he \n     was of a President nor how much political pressure was \n     brought to bear on him, he steadfastly refused to support any \n     measure in which he did not personally believe. Probably the \n     two Presidents who were the closest personally to Richard \n     Russell were Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. However, \n     in both instances, Richard \n\n[[Page S1303]]\n     Russell could not support important legislative matters pursued by \n     them. He was one of four Senators to provide the decisive \n     votes against President Roosevelt's efforts to pack the \n     Supreme Court after it declared several of the New Deal \n     programs unconstitutional. His independence also caused \n     strains in his relationship with Lyndon Johnson 30 years \n     later when he opposed certain provisions in the President's \n     civil rights legislation, the social programs of the ``Great \n     Society'' and the way in which the War in Vietnam was \n     conducted.\n       In all things, Richard Russell remained true to his view of \n     what was best for the Country.\n       If Senator Russell's friendship with Presidents was \n     unusual, his standing in the Senate itself was perhaps \n     unique. His power was such that he could have become Majority \n     Leader or Minority Leader on any number of occasions. \n     However, he declined because of his desire to maintain \n     independence of thought and voting, making it impossible \n     for him to agree in advance to support the program of any \n     administration. Instead of becoming Majority or Minority \n     Leader of the Senate, he largely selected several such \n     leaders and became the Senate's mentor. Senators of both \n     parties, of all political persuasions and from all parts \n     of the country turned to Richard Russell more than anyone \n     else for guidance and for help in the discharge of their \n     Senate duties. They knew he was a man of integrity, \n     independence and good faith.\n       Richard Russell was, in deed, a Senator's Senator.\n       He was also Georgia's Senator. Many times, it seems that \n     one who achieves the position of national prominence and \n     power as did Richard Russell, forgets his or her home state \n     constituents because of the press of what are viewed as more \n     important duties. Such was not the case with Richard Russell. \n     Up until the very end, he considered among his most important \n     duties that of faithfully representing the people of Georgia \n     in Washington. He was fond of saying ``I have been elected to \n     represent and work for Georgia's interest in Washington and \n     not Washington's interest in Georgia.''\n       Georgians have benefited immensely and continue to benefit \n     from Richard Russell's public service career. Benefits \n     directly traceable to his representation of Georgia in the \n     Senate include Lockheed--Georgia as a prime military \n     contractor and a principal employer in this State, the \n     National Communicable Disease Center here in Atlanta, the \n     Richard Russell Federal Building that houses our federal \n     court system, the numerous Corps of Engineers lake \n     developments on Georgia's rivers, and too many outstanding \n     military bases to even mention.\n       I relate two brief stories to illustrate the importance \n     serving Georgia had to Richard Russell up until the very end. \n     Several years before he died, Senator Russell became the \n     President Pro Tempore of the Senate--which is in some ways \n     roughly equivalent to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives. As President Pro Tempore, he was the titular \n     head of the Senate and third in line of succession to the \n     Presidency. A part of the job as President Pro Tempore was to \n     make appointments to various national commissions or boards \n     where the President had an appointment, the Speaker of the \n     House had an appointment and the President Pro Tempore of the \n     Senate had an appointment.\n       After routinely approving recommended appointments for a \n     couple of weeks, Senator Russell called me into his office \n     one day and had on his desk a proposed appointment to a \n     national commission. He asked me: ``Isn't there anyone in \n     Georgia qualified for any of these positions?'' We got to \n     looking around and found out that the particular appointment \n     in question was in a discipline in which a professor at \n     Georgia State University here in Atlanta was a nationally \n     recognized expert. Senator Russell deleted the name of the \n     recommended appointee and inserted the Georgia State \n     professor instead. Amazingly, thereafter the names of \n     qualified Georgians started appearing with greater frequency \n     on the lists.\n       A second true story I would relate involves Senator \n     Russell's decision regarding activities relating to his \n     death. Before he died, he specified that his body was to be \n     returned to Georgia immediately upon his death. This is \n     because he wanted his body to lie in State at Georgia's \n     Capitol here in Atlanta as opposed to in Washington. It is \n     ironic that when the President's Senator and the Senator's \n     Senator died, there were only three official activities \n     marking his death in Washington: (1) The President of the \n     United States ordered American flags to half staff; (2) the \n     President paused in his State of the Union Address for a \n     moment of silent prayer and (3) the hearse carrying Senator \n     Russells' body was viewed by the entire Senate standing on \n     the Capitol steps on its way to Andrews Air Force Base to be \n     returned via Air Force One to Georgia.\n       Richard Russell, was, in deed, Georgia's Senator. The \n     inscription selected by the Russell Foundation to be placed \n     on the Russell Statue will read simply as follows:\n       ``Richard B. Russell, Jr.--Senator from Georgia--1933-\n     1971.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/23/senate-section/article/S1302-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ASTRONAUT RICHARD SEARFOSS\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nAstronaut Richard Searfoss, a Portsmouth, NH, native, who will pilot \nthe space shuttle Atlantis, scheduled to leave Cape Canaveral, FL, in \nMarch. This is an exceptional honor for an astronaut, and everyone in \nhis home State of New Hampshire is very proud of his accomplishment.\n  Richard attended Portsmouth High School and as a student scored a \nperfect 1,600 on his scholastic aptitude test. He was also the keynote \nspeaker at the Portsmouth High School graduation ceremony for the class \nof 1994. Later, Richard on a National Science Foundation Fellowship in \n1979 earned a master of science degree in aeronautics from the \nCalifornia Institute of Technology. The people of Portsmouth recognize \nRichard as an outstanding role model for all of his hard work and \ndetermination in becoming an exemplary astronaut.\n  Richard will pilot the 9-day Atlantis mission that will allow the \nfive astronauts on board to hook up with the Russian space station, \nMir, and drop off Astronaut Shannon Lucid. Shannon will spend 4 months \naboard the manned space station, located about 200 nautical miles from \nEarth. Atlantis will dock at the space station for 5 days and then \nreturn to Earth with one of the three other astronauts who manned the \nstation. The flight will also include a spacewalk.\n  This mission is not the first time Richard has been in space. As a \ntest pilot in the October 1993 space mission, Richard was one of seven \ncrew members to participate in a 2-week life sciences mission on the \nspace shuttle Columbia. I had the opportunity to meet Richard in \nFebruary 1994, and his commitment to the space program and to America \nwas heartening.\n  New Hampshire is very proud of Richard's leadership in the NASA space \nprogram and wish him continued success in the future. We are honored to \nhave him represent us in the final frontier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/23/senate-section/article/S1303-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
