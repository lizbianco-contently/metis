We claim Your promise given through Isaiah, ``You shall \nhear a word behind you saying, `This is the way, walk in it.' ''--\nIsaiah 30:21. We humble ourselves and ask for that word of guidance \ntoday in the continuing deadlock over the budget and the shutdown of \nGovernment. Jesus' words in Mark 3:25 sound an alarm: ``A house divided \nagainst itself cannot stand.'' We acknowledge that presently we are a \ndivided government. Create in all of us a humble desire to find a \nsolution. We all belong to You; we are here in leadership by Your \nappointment, and we believe that You will show us a way to bring \nresolution without a sacrifice of truth. If we all admit our need to \nturn to You at this crucial time, You will reveal a solution beyond our \nown wisdom. O God, bless us with Your guidance and grace. We pray \nspecifically for our leaders Bob Dole, Tom Daschle, Trent Lott, Wendell \nFord, Newt Gingrich, and President Clinton. Anoint their minds and \nhearts with Your inspiring and enlightening spirit. May we, along with \nthem, listen to hear Your voice saying, ``This is the way, walk in it * \n* * and walk in it together.'' In the name of our Lord. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/19/senate-section/article/S17469-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me tell the staffs that we do not \nnormally have Sunday sessions. In fact, I think the most recent Sunday \nsession was a few years back. We do not have the exact date. I \napologize. But I think we have, hopefully, very important business to \nresolve today. I hope, in accordance with the message from the \nChaplain, that we can find a way to reach out to one another. That \nprocess is going on as we speak.\n  I understand that the President's Chief of Staff, Leon Panetta, is \nnow meeting with the Democratic leadership, Senator Daschle and others. \nHe will soon be meeting with Budget chairman, Senator Domenici, on this \nside, and the House Budget chairman, Mr. Kasich, in my office, room S-\n230. Following that meeting, hopefully, I will be able to visit with \nthe Speaker. I just hope there can be some resolution of this matter \ntoday.\n  I am now advised that the last Sunday session was October 27, 1990. \nIt has been a little over 5 years ago.\n  In my view, we made a good faith offer last night. I think it has \nbeen received as such by the President, or at least his \nrepresentatives, and hopefully, if there is a small difference, we can \nresolve that.\n  We are prepared to act. We are prepared to stay here throughout the \nday, into the evening, if necessary. I know there is a human side to \nthis, too. There are a lot of families out there who are very concerned \nand probably under a great deal of stress. I can assure them that, \nwhatever happens, when they come back to work, they will be paid for \nthe days they missed, because they were missed through no fault of \ntheir own. That we can assure them. So I hope they have that assurance.\n  So we will be working this afternoon and, hopefully, with everybody \nwith the same mindset; that is, to see if we cannot come together.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner, for his \nefforts throughout yesterday, and the other Senators on the floor, \nSenator Cochran, Senator Gorton, Senator Coverdell, Senator Snowe, and \nSenator Hatfield, of course, the chairman of the committee. He would \nlike to have us pass a continuing resolution. He would also like us to \nfinish the other appropriations bills, and while I am at it, bring up \nthe Labor-HHS appropriations bill and pass that, hopefully this \nafternoon, on a voice vote, so we can go to conference and have that \none last appropriation bill disposed of if that is possible. Maybe we \ncan accomplish that today.\n  We will have a period for morning business with Senators permitted to \nspeak up to 10 minutes each. As I said last evening, if the rollcall \nvote is necessary, we will make certain that if we should reach some \nagreement, if a rollcall vote is necessary, we will notify all Members \nso nobody is disadvantaged. Hopefully, if we can reach agreement on \nboth sides of the aisle, there would be no need for a record vote if we \ncan do it by a voice vote. Some of our colleagues, on both sides of the \naisle, are on business matters far from here. So we will try to \naccommodate their concerns.\n  If we are going to act before the next work week, we need to do it \ntoday so some of the workers will know they will be coming to work \ntomorrow or the next day.\n  So I thank my colleagues for their patience, and I thank everybody \nfor their indulgence in this Sunday session. But, in my view, it is \nimportant and we should be here. We should be trying to resolve this \ncontroversy. On the other side, obviously, it is very important.\n  Everybody understands that the primary concern, at least on our side \nof the aisle, is that we have a 7-year balanced budget, a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002. I guess I would say the major \n\n[[Page S 17470]]\nproblem is who is going to do the scoring. This is sort of inside \nbaseball, but the question is whether it will be the Congressional \nBudget Office, or the President's scoring apparatus known as the Office \nof Management and Budget.\n  So that is where we are. If we have any additional information, I \nwill certainly pass it on to my colleagues as soon as it is received. \nAfter Members have spoken in morning business, then it would be my \ndesire to have a recess subject to the call of the Chair, and we will \nsee what develops in the next 30 or 40 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/19/senate-section/article/S17469-4", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader. \nHe has been a tireless worker in this effort. We have another long day \nahead of us today. Just addressing the issue that the distinguished \nmajority leader raised, among the discussions that we had yesterday, \nagain, he framed very accurately the fact that the 7-year balanced \nbudget, that seems to be agreed upon really by both sides. The \ncontroversy that remains today to be negotiated is in the area of how \nyou formulate the economic assumptions by which, over a period of the 7 \nyears, the goal of a balanced budget is reached.\n  As the distinguished leader pointed out, the Congressional Budget \nOffice primarily serves the Congress. The Office of Management and \nBudget serves the President of the United States. We feel very \nstrongly, of course, that the CBO, Congressional Budget Office, will \ncontinue in the primary role of ascertaining those economic \nassumptions. Nevertheless, it seems, as the discussions went yesterday, \nthere was certainly an offer on the side of the Congress to permit, for \nexample, the unified balanced budget in subsection (a), which we talked \nabout in this language shall be estimated by the Congressional Budget \nOffice based on their most current economic and technical assumptions, \nfollowing a thorough consultation and review with the Office of \nManagement and Budget--again, involving the President and his principal \nadvisers.\n\n  Incidentally, Mr. President, most importantly, ``and other Government \nand private experts,'' which means that the Congress is not endeavoring \nto cloister itself simply with one set of economic factors. It simply \nis reaching out to the widest possible range to make the economic \nassumptions in a manner which, hopefully, would be acceptable to both \nthe President and the Congress.\n  I am pleased to be here today with my colleagues to continue this \nmost valuable work. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/19/senate-section/article/S17470-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE CURRENT SITUATION\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. First, let me compliment the distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Dole, for the way in which he is keeping the interests \nof the Senate in negotiations that are taking place on this resolution, \nnot only regarding the continuing resolution, but the effort to get \nsome commitment from the administration to support the effort and be an \nactively engaged partner in the effort to achieve a balanced budget. \nThat is really what is at the heart and soul of the dispute between the \nCongress and the administration at this time.\n  We know some innocent people are sort of caught in the crossfire. \nThat is unfortunate. I think that the majority leader's assurance to \nthose who are being disadvantaged and put at some financial risk as a \nresult of this impasse ought to be reassured by the statements of the \nleader.\n  There has been a lot of speculation. I know the distinguished Senator \nfrom Virginia has voiced concerns about how we go about making amends, \nor making sure that there is not an unfair result for some of those who \nhave been laid off or furloughed temporarily.\n  The fact is, I think there is some misunderstanding about the \nsituation. There is a commitment, as the majority leader has stated, to \nhelp make sure that those problems are resolved and that they are \nresolved as a part of this negotiation. We hope that is the case.\n  Some people have said, and they have called in saying, ``If people \nare not essential, if they are not necessary to the operation of the \nGovernment, why do you have them on the payroll to start with?'' That \nis not the definition of this situation. That is, that there are some \nwho are considered essential for the protection of life and property. \nThat is the definition. I think that is why there is the \nmisunderstanding, those whose presence and whose active involvement on \nthe payroll or on the job is necessary for the protection of life and \nproperty are considered essential under this situation.\n  The President, however, has the obligation to make that definition in \nmany cases. He has a good deal of leeway in making those decisions. I \nthink people recognize that after the first furlough and first \ndefinitions, within the Departments there have been some changes. Some \nwho were considered not necessary or essential for the protection of \nlife and property have been summoned to come back to work, who were not \nfirst considered essential.\n  So, this is a situation that does not happen every day. It is very \nunusual. It is out of the ordinary. No wonder there is some wonderment \nor bewilderment, confusion, about this situation.\n\n  I think all can be assured that certainly this Senate is going to \ncontinue to look out for the interests not only for those who have been \nput at some financial disadvantage, but also the American people as a \nwhole, and the interests of States. We are here representing State \ngovernments as well. That is one of the original roles of the U.S. \nSenate. We have two Senators per State so each State can be equally and \nfairly represented. So the interests of local governments are being \ntaken into account in this process, too.\n  The point I am trying to make is that although there are some \nanxieties and although there is some confusion, no one should be \nconfused about what the goal is. That is, to get this dispute resolved \nas quickly as we can and as fairly as we can and without compromising \nour commitment to achieve a balanced budget. That is the whole purpose \nof this.\n  We are sorry the dispute has turned into what some are characterizing \nas a political game or of one-upmanship, one trying to outdo the other \nwith public rhetoric and news releases and the like.\n  There is some very serious and hard work going on, and all through \nthe weekend, and has been going on the last several days. I hope we can \nresolve it today. Everyone here is paying a very serious commitment in \nthat direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Before the able Senator from Mississippi departs, \nyesterday you were present throughout the day and at a number of \nmeetings, but repeatedly the majority leader of the Senate, Senator \nDole, expressed compassion for the people who are necessarily \nfurloughed as a consequence of this problem. In the presence of the \nSpeaker and others at various times there was never any doubt--never \nany doubt--that the Congress would take appropriate action, perhaps as \na separate measure from a continuing resolution. But, nevertheless, the \nCongress would take appropriate legislative action to ensure that \nfurloughed persons are made whole with respect to their salaries.\n  We cannot make them whole for the emotional loss and strain and the \nuncertainty, but certainly when it comes to the question of their just \ncompensation, that will be done.\n  I thank the Senator and join him in recognizing the leadership \nprovided by the distinguished Senator from Kansas, the majority leader, \nSenator Dole.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator for his leadership in this effort. \nHe has been stalwart in always helping us resolve these difficult \nsituations. That has certainly been the case in this instance, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner).

Mr. President, I, too, commend all the Members of the \nSenate and the House that have labored to try to resolve this dilemma, \nbut I take just a moment, if I might, Mr. President, and step back from \nit.\n  I have just returned from Georgia, and many of the citizens I talked \nto are somewhat concerned. There is an anxiousness as to just what is \nhappening here. I think it is very important that we remember that the \nultimate issue that has driven all of these events for the last several \ndays is whether or not the United States is going to balance its budget \nor not after 30 years of not doing so.\n\n  Just the other evening, in a very historic vote, 52 to 47, the U.S. \nSenate passed a balanced budget, the first one in 3 decades. The House \nhas done the same.\n  The President has said he will veto this balanced budget, which is \nperplexing because, first of all, if any message came out of the last \nelection it was that the American people want their budgets balanced. \nThey deal with it in their family, they deal with it in their business, \nand they simply do not understand a Federal Government that cannot \nmanage itself. They want the budgets balanced.\n  The President, in 1992, as he ran for President, promised the \nAmerican people that he would balance the budget in 5 years. The \nproposal that he has been sent balances the budget in 7 years.\n  This Congress, the 104th Congress, came from the elections to balance \nthe budgets. They have fulfilled that promise. It is time for the \nPresident to do the same. He has said repeatedly, as I said, in 1992 he \nwas for a balanced budget in 5 years. He then said he would submit a \nbalanced budget in 10 years. I think he has mentioned every number in \nbetween at one time or another.\n  The point is that he has never--never--submitted a budget in balance, \nwhich is, of course, why, when his budget came before the Senate, it \nwas rejected, on one occasion, 99 to 0, and on the next, 96 to 0.\n  This is not just a contest or philosophies and the like, Mr. \nPresident. The Bipartisan Entitlement Commission appointed by the \nPresident, chaired by a member of his own party, Senator Kerrey of \nNebraska, cochaired by Senator Danforth of Missouri, told the Nation in \nthe beginning of this year that within a decade--that is on all of our \nwatch--within a decade all the vast resources of the United States will \nbe consumed by only five of our programs.\n  It is almost difficult to imagine all the vast resources of the \nUnited States being consumed by just five programs, but they are. They \nare Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Federal retirement, and the \ninterest on our debt--and then there is nothing else. That would be a \ntravesty, for this generation to be the first generation of Americans \nthat gave the country to the future crippled and unable to manage \nitself. How could we even imagine doing that to future generations, the \nchildren and grandchildren yet to come? No generation of Americans has \never willfully--willfully given the future a country crippled, \nstumbling into the next century.\n  As sober a message as that is, we need to be reminded that if we \nseize control of our destiny, if we manage these financial affairs as \nproposed in this balanced budget, we will enter the next century with \nmore opportunity than one could even imagine or has ever known or seen \nbefore. We will be putting resources back in the American family \nbecause we will lower the devastating interest rates they pay on their \nhome mortgage, on their car, on borrowing, on their student loans. We \nwill dramatically shorten the lines for employment because we will have \nan expanding economy with vast new opportunities. And, I might say, we \nshould remember that, as the world's greatest power, we will then enter \nthe new century with the muscle to back it up. What would some of these \nworld rogues rather see than the United States crippled economically, \nstumbling into that century? We should never give them that \nopportunity.\n  I saw a fact sheet just the other day and I have asked it be \nexpanded. The balanced budget that we have submitted, if ratified, \nwould save, over the next 7 years, my State of Georgia $333 million in \ndebt service. It would save my capital city, in which I live, $121 \nmillion in debt service.\n  As I said a moment ago, it will save every Georgia family nearly \n$2,000 to $3,000. That means we, in effect, will have increased their \ndisposable income between 10 percent and 20 percent. Who else is \ngetting a raise like that? What a bonus we could give the American \nfamily by simply being responsible.\n  So, while we are talking about shutdown and the like, and the \ndisputes and the meetings that are going on, let us just remember, this \nis about a Congress that is intent on balancing the budget of the \nUnited States so we can save the integrity of the Union for the future, \nfor a new century.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/19/senate-section/article/S17471-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17471-S17472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CONGRESSIONAL PAY\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today on an issue that is related to \nthis shutdown, and that is the issue of pay. I want to express my very \ndeep disappointment that we have not been able to bring up the \nlegislation which I proposed that would treat the pay for Members of \nCongress and the President in the same manner the pay is being treated \nfor Federal employees who are currently working and who will find their \npaycheck is suspended during this period of a shutdown.\n  I worked on this legislation in conjunction with the Senate majority \nleader, who supports it, and with Senator Boxer, who proposed similar \nlegislation for future shutdowns. I wanted to be sure that this issue \nalso applied to this current shutdown, so my legislation would make it \nretroactive.\n  I have 24 Members of the Senate who support this legislation, who \nhave cosponsored it. Besides myself, the Senate majority leader, \nSenator Boxer, Senators Thomas, Warner, Kempthorne, Grassley, McCain, \nCohen, Abraham, Chafee, Jeffords, Pressler, Nickles, Simpson, Specter, \nHutchison, Domenici, DeWine, Kassebaum, Brown, Craig, Coats, and \nHarkin.\n  Here we stand today. We have had a session yesterday and we had a \nsession today and we will have sessions tomorrow, hopefully, to resolve \nthis shutdown.\n  In the meantime, there is a tremendous disparity between Federal \nemployees who are working, like our staffs, and other Federal \nemployees, and those, of course, who are furloughed, and Members of \nCongress and the President. You might ask, what is the disparity? The \nfact is, Members of Congress will not face any disruption in their pay, \nyet those Federal employees who are working are going to face a \ndisruption. Their pay will lapse during this period of time.\n  You might ask, why such a discrepancy? That is a very good question. \nThat is why I proposed this legislation. Unfortunately, we cannot reach \na consensus among all Senators about bringing this legislation up for \nimmediate consideration. I find it somewhat ironic, because at the \nbeginning of this Congress, setting off in a new direction and a new \ncourse, the very first bill that this Senate and this House considered \nwas the Congressional Accountability Act. That would require that the \nlaws that apply to the rest of society would also apply to the U.S. \nCongress.\n  I cannot think of a greater example than right here, where we could \nput our money where our mouth is. Yet, unfortunately, we are back to \nthe same old procedures and business as usual. We are still preserving \nthe status quo when it comes to how Members of Congress are treated, \nand the President, vis-a-vis the rest of society. In this case, it \nhappens to be Federal employees.\n\n  I would think every Senator would support this legislation. After \nall, hundreds of thousands of Federal employees and their families are \ngoing to face serious economic disruption, hardships, inconveniences. \nYet Members of Congress will not. I do not see the equity in such an \nexample. I do not see the fairness. I do not see the responsibility. \nBecause each of us, individually and collectively, has a responsibility \nto this institution and to preserving the integrity of this \ninstitution.\n  The very thing we should be preserving is the public's confidence in \nthe way we do business. Obviously, it has \n\n[[Page S 17472]]\nsuffered during this current shutdown. But, at the very least, we can \nsay yes, we are going to face similar problems, similar inconveniences \nas to those Federal employees who will find their paycheck has lapsed. \nUnfortunately, we are not going to find that unless this legislation is \nbrought up for immediate consideration and ultimately passed.\n  Unfortunately, as I said, we have objections from others who do not \nsupport this approach. I find that remarkable, given the conversations \nI have had with Federal employees and even my own staff, in what they \nare going to be facing because they will not have the assurance of a \nsteady paycheck.\n  There are many people who have to live paycheck to paycheck. I think \nat the very least we ought to be setting an example, and not setting \nourselves apart as somehow isolated from the problems that are \nassociated with this current Government shutdown.\n  As the Senator from Arizona was just saying, Senator McCain, what \nabout the businesses--the many businesses, the hotels and the \nrestaurants that are associated, that depend on Federal employees \nworking, whether it is here or the Grand Canyon? They will never \nrecover their losses.\n  So what we are saying here is at least we ought to be experiencing \nsome problems as a result of this shutdown, the same problems that \nothers are experiencing, and certainly with respect to Federal \nemployees. Tomorrow is another payday period. Again, there is a \ndifference between how Members of the Congress and the President are \nbeing treated versus Federal employees. The difference will be that \nthose Federal employees who are working currently will see a reduction \nin their pay, but Members of Congress and the President will not.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that we will find on our calendar this \nlegislation because I think it is important to provide confidence in \nthis institution, and the direction this country is taking, but also to \nrestore the public's trust in its elected officials. And I hope that we \nwill try to set an example by sharing in the same undue burdens that \nare being placed on Federal employees and their families. Those same \nburdens should be placed on Members of Congress and the President.\n  So I hope that every Member of this body will consent to providing \nfor the consideration of this legislation on the calendar tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN.

Mr. President, I rise to share some thoughts with fellow \nSenators with regard to the nature of this problem. I do not think it \nis any mystery to most Members of the Senate why we are here.\n  Yet, as I hear this issue discussed in the national media, sometimes \nthe real crux of the problem is missed. It can be summed up by taking a \nlook at the reference in one of the documents provided in the last \nbudget round. Interestingly enough, that document was provided by the \nPresident of the United States. Included in the information on the back \npage is this figure. It is an answer to a question of what the child \nborn today would have to pay in the way of taxes to maintain the \ncurrent programs that we have in place. Mr. President, that figure is \ncalculated by a straightforward calculation that assumes there are \nabsolutely no new programs added. That has never happened.\n  In the last quarter of century we have never had a time where we have \nnot added new programs or expenditures. It assumes there are no \nemergencies. Even assuming no emergencies and no new programs, the \nchild born today will pay 82 percent of everything they earn in their \nentire life in taxes simply to honor the current programs that are on \nthe books.\n  Mr. President, let me repeat that, because I think that number must \nastound most people. It astounds me when I look at it. Eighty-two \npercent, according to the President's own numbers, will have to be paid \nin taxes simply to honor the existing programs we have.\n  The short answer of why that is true is simply because we have passed \nin prior years programs that are open-ended, that spend out \nautomatically what are called entitlements that continue to increase \nautomatically, and will take a larger and larger share of our gross \ndomestic product.\n  We are here today because there is a crisis, and that crisis is that \nCongresses in the past have obligated future generations to a point \nwhere 82 percent of everything a child earns will have to be paid to \nthe Federal Government just to honor existing programs.\n  Mr. President, there is no person, liberal or conservative, Democrat \nor Republican, who can look at that figure and imagine that America \nwill be competitive with 82 percent of everything we produce being paid \nin taxes. It will destroy incentive. It will destroy our \ncompetitiveness in world markets. And anyone who comes to this floor \nand fails to recognize the desperate need for us to address these \nprograms is simply not taking a look at the facts.\n  The facts also show we have the biggest deficit of any country in the \nworld. We have the biggest debt of any country in the world--almost $5 \ntrillion. We have the biggest trade deficit of any country in the \nworld. We have one of the lowest savings rates of any major \nindustrialized country on the face of the Earth.\n  Mr. President, when you look at the facts they are awesome. I hope \nMembers of the Senate who have come to the floor and said no action is \nnecessary will think again. If America is to remain strong, viable, \ncompetitive, and provide a future for our children other than 82 \npercent of everything they earn paid in taxes, we have to change. All \nthe rhetoric cannot hide the fact that our future is dismal unless we \nchange it. It is why I think there is such optimism in the country over \nthe willingness of Congress to stand fast and insist on changes.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Maine mentioned her \nbill which would place Members of Congress in the same circumstance as \nother Federal employees when we have a shutdown like this. I am proud \nto be a cosponsor of it. I very much hope it passes. When it comes to \nthe floor for consideration, I want to add an additional amendment. I \ndo not pretend that it will be popular. But I think it is along that \nsame line, along the line we treat ourselves like everyone else; and, \nthat is this:\n  For over a quarter of a century this Congress has passed budgets and \nignored them. They have come up with phony estimates, and then they \nhave overspent the budgets time and time again. Some of the Members who \ntalk the loudest and the longest about balancing the budget happily \nturn around and then vote to exceed the budget each year. That is why \nwe need an incentive. That is why we need the constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget recognizing the fact that Congress has been \nunable to face the reality that calls for difficult decisions.\n  I cannot imagine anyone in private thinking other than the fact that \nwe have to have some discipline. And while some Members have shied away \nfrom a constitutional limitation--as the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer recalls, we were one vote away from referring that \nconstitutional amendment out to the States--I believe some discipline \nis possible. And it relates to the way private sectors are treated.\n  Mr. President, the proposal is going to be simply this: If we meet \nour budget targets in passing the budget this year, our pay stays the \nsame. But, if we fail to meet them, for every $5 billion we realize in \ndebt that is over that target, we would lose 1 percent of our pay. So \nif it is $10 billion over, we lose 10 percent. If we are $20 billion \nover, we would lose 4 percent. This would cap out at a 30-percent pay \nreduction.\n\n  Mr. President, this will provide the real incentive because it will \nprovide that Members of Congress will pay a personal price when they do \nharm to the fiscal soundness of this Nation, and the future of our \nchildren. We will have a direct financial interest in seeing that we \nmeet our budget targets. Is it dire action? Yes, possibly. Is it \nessential? Mr. President, I believe it is essential.\n  I do not know whether that measure is going to pass or not. But I do \nknow that some discipline is essential, and in a way this treats us \nexactly like the private sector. You see, if a private business does \nnot perform, the owners and the employees are penalized in \n\n[[Page S 17473]]\nwhat they can be paid and what they can earn. There is no reason to \nexempt this Congress of the United States from the real discipline of \nthe marketplace. Our major responsibility is to get this country back \non track.\n  I intend to offer an amendment to the measure of the distinguished \nSenator from Maine that would add that incentive for Members to honor \ntheir obligation to meet budget targets.\n  Mr. President, the controversy involves two major questions. I think \nsome Americans may be surprised to focus on those because the national \nmedia have not focused on them perhaps the way we think they should. It \ninvolves commitment of this country to balance its budget in 7 years. \nAnd it involves honest real numbers. The President has said that he \ncannot live with the commitment to balance the budget in 7 years. The \nPresident has said he wants other than the Congressional Budget Office \nfigures, ones from his administration, or perhaps others, to be the \nstandard for the numbers.\n  Mr. President, I simply want to draw Members' attention to one fact. \nWhile the President now says he finds it unacceptable to be committed \nto a balanced budget in 7 years, when the President himself ran for \noffice in 1992 he looked the American people in the eye and promised to \nbalance it in 5 years.\n  Mr. President, he has never presented a budget that does that. Now, \nnot only is he not willing to stand up for a 5-year commitment, he said \nhe would veto a continuing resolution--he has, indeed, vetoed a \nprevious one--if it insists on a commitment to a 7-year balanced \nbudget.\n  Most Americans must be surprised at this. It runs directly contrary \nto his promise to the American people when he ran for office.\n  The President specifically promised a balanced budget in 5 years. \nLater he said a balanced budget in 7 years, and later in 8 years, and \nlater 9 years, and later in 10 years. That is one of the major \ndifferences of two in the failure of the President to keep his \ncommitment to try to balance the budget.\n  The second difference is over economic assumptions. I must say I find \nno item more important than realistic economic assumptions. The \ndistinguished Democratic leader, for whom I have a great deal of \nrespect, has come to this floor and noted for the record that we have \nhad assumptions that were not optimistic enough in the last few years. \nIt is quite true that prior assumptions in periods of economic upturn \nhave proved sometimes too conservative. It is the nature of the \nassumptions. We have had assumptions in the past that follow a general \nrule. They are not optimistic enough when we have an economic recovery, \nand they are not pessimistic enough when we have an economic downturn.\n  I submit the judgment and the weight of long-range economic \nassumptions should not just be how they perform in the short term of an \nupswing or a downswing but how they perform over the long term. Here \nthe record is very clear. No one should be mistaken about it. The \nassumptions we have used for the last quarter of a century, whether \nthey be from the Executive Office or the Congressional Budget Office, \nhave been wildly optimistic. They have overstated the revenue that \nwould come and they have understated the outgo, the spending of the \nFederal Government. The reality is this has been one of the major \nplaces of gamesmanship. Economic assumptions have been used to mislead \nthe American people.\n  All one need to do is take a look at the budgets for the last 25 \nyears. Every single one of them except for the last couple years have \nsuggested, while they would not balance the budget this year, they \nwould balance the budget the following year or the year after that or \nthe year after that. It used to be we would balance the budget 1 year \nout and then 2 years out and then 3 and then 4 and then 5. No one can \nhonestly look at the economic assumptions that have been used in \ncalculating our budget and not conclude that they were fraudulent. They \nhave consistently overstated revenue and consistently understated \nexpenditures. One need only look at the Social Security assumptions to \nsee the fraud.\n  I do not want to overdo this point, but I think it is critical that \npeople understand how important the economic assumptions argument is \nbecause it goes to the very integrity of the books, it goes to the very \nintegrity of whether or not we achieve a balanced budget.\n  The President is suggesting that we cook the books. That is what this \ncontroversy is all about--his refusal to honor his commitment on \nbalancing the budget and his unwillingness to live up to realistic \nestimates.\n  I do not know how many Members had a chance to look at the details of \nthe President's proposal in terms of economic assumptions earlier this \nyear. Dr. Laura Tyson defended them before the Budget Committee. One of \nthe things I found so extreme in the President's proposal was literally \nthe suggestion that they were going to use two rates of inflation, one \nrate of inflation when calculating income and another rate of inflation \nwhen calculating expenditures.\n  I understand how reasonable men and women can differ on the value and \nthe content of economic assumptions. To assume different rates of \ninflation when you are calculating the income and expenditures is \nabsurd. Could they be off slightly in the way we do the calculations? \nOf course. But there was a significant and is a significant difference \nin the way the President's people calculate inflation. It is absolutely \nfraudulent. There is no integrity in those numbers.\n\n  If we adopt economic assumptions that undercut the integrity of this \nbudget process, we will have deceived the American people.\n  Men and women can honestly disagree, and we are going to negotiate \nover how much tax cut we should have, and we are going to negotiate how \nmuch spending we should have. And everyone understands there has to be \na compromise in those areas.\n  There should be no compromise on the integrity of the budget process. \nCongress has compromised the integrity of the budget far too long. It \nis one of the core reasons why we find ourselves in the disaster \nsituation that stands before us.\n  I hope there is an agreement reached today, but I for one cannot \nagree to destroy the integrity of the budget process. I for one think \nit would be a great mistake if included in that agreement is a \nwillingness to accept phony numbers and phony assumptions and false \nclaims. It is the road that has gotten us to this problem. It is the \nproblem we must address honestly and straightforwardly. I believe, if \nwe do, if we use honest numbers and realistic changes, this country's \neconomy will blossom in the future as it has in the past.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as if \nin morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/19/senate-section/article/S17472-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17473-S17475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            EFFECTS OF SHUTTING DOWN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to share my views of appreciation \nfor the remarks just made by the Senator from Colorado. I would also \nlike to express my appreciation to the Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe], \non the introduction of her legislation, and I urge the leadership on \nboth sides of the aisle to take up that legislation and pass it.\n  As the Senator from Maine pointed out, there is a great credibility \ngap here in the Congress that we treat ourselves all too often \ndifferently from the American people. This is a glaring example of it. \nPeople who also work for the Federal Government are not receiving their \npay and benefits, and we in the Congress continue to do so.\n  That is not a good message for us to send. I do believe that as in \nthe past there is very little doubt we will compensate those who have \nbeen laid off as nonessential workers, although I would certainly hope \nwe in the Congress would examine the impact or the lack of impact of \nthe absence of some of those nonessential workers and perhaps over time \nwe could use that as a guide to downsizing the size of Government. In \nthe meantime, we in the Congress should not accept our paychecks when \nFederal workers are also not receiving them.\n  Mr. President, I wish to also point out that some of the actions \ntaken in this downsizing or laying off of essential workers and \nproviding what is deemed nonessential, cutting off what are deemed \nnonessential services to the \n\n[[Page S 17474]]\nAmerican people has gone a little bit too far, and I speak specifically \nof the Grand Canyon.\n  For the first time in its history, the Grand Canyon has been closed \ndown with a very few number of employees. Most of the services could \nhave been provided to people who come from all over the world. I think \nit is just a disgrace and a bit of political demagoguery that the Grand \nCanyon is being shut down because of this crisis. The Federal \nGovernment, the Department of the Interior and, most of all, Secretary \nBabbitt should know that we could provide services to about 90 percent \nof the visitors with just a handful of employees. I urge the President \nand the Secretary of the Interior to reverse that decision.\n  I also point out that in our zeal--and it is well-founded zeal--to \nprotect those who are Government workers who are not receiving their \npay, let us remember that there are tens of thousands, if not hundreds \nof thousands, of Americans who are directly dependent upon places like \nthe Grand Canyon--the hotel employees, the concessionaires, the people \nwho supply all of the things that go into these provisions of \nGovernment services that will never be compensated. They will never be \ncompensated. I appreciate very much what the Senator from Maine is \ntrying to do for Government workers and what we will do, but let us not \nforget that there are a whole lot of people who are not Government \nemployees but who are dependent upon Government for their economics and \ntheir livelihoods, and their families are dependent upon it, and they \nwill have a very bleak Thanksgiving because they have already lost \nincome which they can never regain.\n  That is what the tragedy of this whole confrontation and crisis is \nall about. I understand why many Americans say, as a commentator this \nmorning on one of the talk shows said, it is a food fight and mothers \nwould not approve of their sons behaving the way we have seen happen, \nespecially wrestling matches in the Chamber of the House of \nRepresentatives and a great deal of disparagement of integrity and \ncharacter and personal attacks that are being mounted on both sides.\n  But, Mr. President, I do not think we should let it distract us from \nthe fact that there is an enormous amount at stake here. And that is \nreally whether we are going to carry out the commitment that we made to \nthe American people in the election of 1994. And for us to depart from \nthe valid assumptions which have been supported by Members on the other \nside of the aisle, by the President of the United States, and all of \nus, and the Congressional Budget Office, as providing us the basis for \neconomic assumptions, would be an absolute travesty.\n  Mr. President, I will not go through again the number of times the \nPresident of the United States has changed his view as to how many \nyears it would take to balance the budget. But I do remember quite well \nin 1993 when in a rather raucous State of the Union message the \nPresident of the United States said--and I quote from his State of the \nUnion Address, as he explained to Congress and the American people why \nhe used CBO numbers to score his 1994 budget proposal.\n  He said:\n\n       I did this so that we could argue about priorities with the \n     same set of numbers. I did this so that no one could say I \n     was estimating my way out of this difficulty. I did this \n     because if we can agree together on the most prudent revenues \n     we are likely to get if the recovery stays, and we do the \n     right things economically, then it will turn out better for \n     the American people than we say. In the last 12 years, \n     because there were differences over revenue estimates, you \n     and I know that both parties were given greater elbow room \n     for irresponsibility. Let us at least argue about the same \n     set of numbers so the American people will think we are \n     shooting straight with them.\n\n  Mr. President, let us let the American people know that we are \nshooting straight with them. We can only do it with Congressional \nBudget Office numbers. I heard one of the President's advisers this \nmorning going through the same routine that they have, that if we \nbalance the budget in 7 years, if we stick to the CBO numbers, we will \ndestroy the American's ability to receive welfare, education, student \nloans, et cetera, et cetera.\n  It is the same line we have been hearing for a long, long time. \nClearly for quite awhile it has had resonance with the American people. \nThere is a legitimate question that needs to be asked. If we do not \nbalance the budget, what happens to all of those programs--education, \nMedicare, welfare, all of those programs if we do not stop this \nreckless spending? And I think the answer is obvious. None of those \nprograms can be funded if we continue to amass this enormous debt that \nhas laid $175,000 debt on every child born in America today, only to \npay the interest on the debt that we have already accumulated.\n  Mr. President, I hear a lot of talk about a compromise, so do my \ncolleagues. And compromise is the name of the business in Government. \nBut if we compromise our 7-year commitment, and if we compromise the \nCongressional Budget Office numbers, then we will have done a great \ndisservice not only to the overwhelming majority of the American people \nthat told us they wanted the budget balanced in the last election but \nto future generations of Americans who, by us using irresponsible \nnumbers and unrealistic figures, would do a great disservice to them.\n  Let me also point out one other thing, Mr. President. This is really \nall about how much money Government can spend. If we use the Office of \nManagement and Budget numbers, they will provide different estimates \nwhich will then say less sacrifice is required to balance the budget \nthereby giving the executive branch and the other bureaucracies more \nmoney to spend.\n\n  The question is, are we going to let the American people keep that \nmoney and spend it themselves or are we going to send it to Washington \nand continue to fund many, many failed programs which have not only not \nhelped the American people but in the view of many of us in the case of \nthe failed welfare system, harmed the American people more than it has \nhelped. So it is really about how much money is going to be spent.\n  I always enjoy it when my colleagues--I see my colleague from North \nDakota who has been very active on this issue on the floor--say we want \nto balance the budget, too. Give us your plan over 7 years, and give us \ncredible numbers, and we do not have a problem. We can start the \nGovernment back to work in a New York minute. But the question is \nwhether there is going to be the commitment over 7 years and whether we \nare going to use realistic numbers.\n  Mr. President, this morning the Concord Coalition took out a full \npage ad in the Washington Post. I urge my colleagues to look at it. I \ndo not agree with everything said here by the Concord Coalition, but I \ndo think they make some very important and valid points.\n  We can either get an agreement here today or tomorrow or the next day \nor the next day or on Thanksgiving Day or afterward, but at some point \nwe are going to have to agree and get the Government going again. I do \nnot know when that will be. I hope it is today. But what we decide \ntoday or tomorrow, or when we make that agreement, it will directly \nimpact the future of America. And those that call this a food fight, or \nwhether somebody was snubbed on an airplane or not, are not cognizant \nof the fact this is really what the differing philosophies are all \nabout, between this side of the aisle and that side of the aisle, \nwhether the American people should keep their money and not send it to \nWashington, DC, or whether the Government spends the money that is \ntheir hard-earned money, which is now for an average family of four in \nAmerica is $1 out of every $4. In 1950 that same average family of four \nsent $1 out of every $50 to Washington, DC, in the form of taxes. And I \nknow of no one who believes that same family in 1995 is better off than \nthat family in 1950.\n  Mr. President, I know my time has nearly expired. I urge my \ncolleagues to agree rather than disagree, and regain the level of \ncivility that is required for us in order to reach reasoned and mature \ndecisions and judgments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the unanimous-\nconsent request made earlier be amended so that I be allowed to \ncontinue in morning business for not to exceed 10 minutes. \n\n[[Page S 17475]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know that the distinguished Democratic \nleader is going to speak here on the floor in a few minutes to describe \nthe offer that was made and, apparently, rejected by the Republican \nleadership. And I would hope that Senators and the public would listen \nto it. I say this because I have a feeling in many, many ways that if \nwe were left to the situation where the Democrats and Republicans in \nthe Senate were able to work together on this, with the White House, we \nwould have a solution to this impasse.\n  Certainly, we would have a solution that would put a lot of hard-\nworking men and women back to work, people who cannot afford to miss \npaychecks and who want to be at work, people who have mortgages to pay, \nchildren to educate, parents to care for, have medical bills to pay, \ncar payments to make, and can ill-afford to lose paychecks, especially \nwhen there are jobs that need to be done and people want to do them.\n  I say that I think we could work it out between the Senate and the \nWhite House. It appears to me, however, that the other body and its \nleadership do not feel it is possible and that they say there is \nnothing that can be done. I see this remarkable situation where the \nother body simply recessed even though appropriations and spending \nbills begin--spending bills by custom; revenue bills by Constitution--\nbegin in the other body. They have left.\n  They have this fiction of waiting for the call of the Chair. But, in \nfact, their leadership has decided they would recess and that they \nwould leave. They are shirking their duty. They are shirking their \nduty. They are being paid. They ought to stay. They ought to stay and \nwork this out for those tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of men \nand women who are not being paid, who are loyal Americans, who have \ngiven a great deal of their life and effort to this country and want to \nkeep this country going.\n  We have a situation where we have become the laughing stock of the \nworld. The President of the United States cannot go to a major economic \nsummit in Japan at a time when perhaps a greater danger to this Nation \nis perhaps not the deficits we now face but our trade deficit. At least \nmuch of the deficit we owe to ourselves, but our trade deficit involves \ncountries abroad who are eating our economic lunch.\n  Every time we have $1 billion more in our trade deficit, we lose tens \nof thousands of American jobs. The President was going to represent \nthis country at a meeting in Japan where we could at least talk about \nthat with the country that has the greatest trade imbalance with the \nUnited States, but he has to remain here. He is remaining here at work. \nThe distinguished Presiding Officer is remaining here at work. I am \nhere at work.\n  I wish the Republican leadership in the House would let the House \ncome back to work, because, Mr. President, there is one thing that \nought to be very evident to everybody: We are not going to pass a \nGingrich budget. We are not going to pass a Clinton budget. We are not \ngoing to pass a Dole budget. We can pass a budget for the American \npeople. We will pass a budget that reflects the views of both \nRepublicans and Democrats of the House and of the Senate and of the \nPresident because, frankly, under the Constitution, under the laws and \nunder the history of this great country, we are all in this together.\n  So I urge everybody to stop thinking there is going to be one party \nthat is going to win everything in this. That may work in a game of \nmarbles on a playground in kindergarten. That does not work here. This \nis not a playground, even though it may appear that way to some. It is \nnot kindergarten, although it may appear that way to some. It is not a \ngame of marbles, even though it may appear that way to some. This is \nthe budget of the country, the most powerful, greatest Nation on Earth, \nthe most significant democracy history has ever known, the largest \neconomy in the world, and we are standing here because some feel they \nmay have been slighted or some feel that they must make a point that \nwill fit on a bumper sticker in next year's election, congressional or \nPresidential.\n  Mr. President, I am one Democrat who says let us have Democrats and \nRepublicans sit down. Set aside short-term political gains and do what \nis best for this country. Stop thinking that we will have a Speaker \nGingrich budget, or a leader Dole budget, or a President Clinton \nbudget, but rather that we will have a budget that can take the best of \nthe proposals of each of the three, and let us work at it.\n  We have had proposals here. The distinguished Senator from North \nDakota and I have voted for a budget that would give us a balanced \nbudget within the 7 years. We all want that. But before we balance a \nbudget that intends, in large part, to slash very needy programs so \nthat a tax break can be given to people at the highest level, let us \nask if that is what the American public really want.\n  Do they want to see money for education cut so that the most wealthy \nin this country can have a tax break? I doubt it.\n  Do they want to see nutrition programs for the most needy in this \ncountry slashed so that the wealthiest can get another tax break? I \ndoubt that the American people want that.\n  Do they want to see Medicare and Medicaid attacked to that the \nwealthiest in this Nation can have a tax break? I doubt that very much.\n  If we are going to be saving money, let us protect the most in need. \nAnd if there is extra money left over, let us apply it to the deficit. \nLet us apply it to the deficit, not to another tax break for the \nwealthiest who already pay less in taxes than any industrialized nation \non Earth. We do not need to put it there. If we really want to do \nsomething for our children, rather than giving it as a tax break for \nthe wealthiest, apply it to our national debt, apply it to our deficit.\n  In the deficits that grew up during the Reagan and Bush era, today we \nspend nearly $1 billion in interest--in interest alone --almost every \nday, $1 billion just in interest on the deficits and the increase in \nthe national debt built up during the terms of only two Presidents, \nRonald Reagan and George Bush.\n  Let us be honest about that. Some who were the greatest proponents of \nthe Reagan deficits have stood in the last 2 days on the floor of this \nSenate and said, ``We have to do something about this terrible \ndeficit.'' Well, I tell them that virtually our whole deficit is caused \njust by what we pay in interest on those profligate days in the \neighties where we made huge tax cuts and huge defense buildups and \nborrowed the money from the next generation to pay for it.\n\n  That is what happened then, Mr. President. What happens now, though, \nis what happens now. Today, we have hundreds of thousands of people out \nof work needlessly. We have hundreds and hundreds of thousands more who \nwill be out of work because of the ripple effect, whether it is the \npeople who want to get into our national parks, whether it is those who \nwill not be able to borrow money for their mortgage, VA loan, or \nanything else, whether it is those who want to make new claims in \nSocial Security.\n  Think of the hundreds of thousands, even millions of people who will \nbe out of work because of the Government programs that have stopped, \nGovernment programs that all of us, Republicans and Democrats, have \nsupported, whether it is in the VA or whether it is in our various \nmortgage programs or Social Security or anything else.\n  Let us say, OK, everybody has made their political point. They can \nuse them in their ads next year.

Mr. President, I want to speak today on a couple of \ntopics.\n  First of all, I would like to lend my voice of support for the \nproposal that was earlier discussed by the Senator from Maine, Senator \nSnowe, in regard to legislation she introduced, legislation I am a \ncosponsor of, to treat the salaries and pay of the Members of Congress \nin the same fashion that other Federal employees are being treated \nduring this period of Government shutdown.\n  I share the opinion the Senator from Maine expressed very effectively \nearlier that it is important for the public to understand that those of \nus in Congress are no different than anybody else and that we should \nlive by the same sets of rules that govern the rest of the people of \nsimilar status as we; and that is, the laws of the country should apply \nto us the way they apply to the rest of the country.\n\n  We did that earlier this year. We ended a long period of time in \nwhich Congressmen and Senators were exempt from any laws which people \nback in our States were forced on a daily basis to adhere to. In the \nsame vein as Federal employees ourselves, we should be required to be \ntreated in the same fashion as the Federal employees whose families \nthis week have been confronted with the issues surrounding the \nGovernment shutdown.\n  Also, I am intrigued by and likely to support the amendment that \nSenator Brown discussed in his remarks. I have long felt, in fact, in \nmy campaign I talked about the need for us to place some sort of \nincentive for the Members of Congress to bring about a balanced budget \nthat they all campaigned on but went to Washington and somehow found \nvery elusive.\n  The notion of in some way treating us like the officers of a \ncorporation that is running in the red intrigues me a lot, and it is \nvery appealing, I think, to citizens across this country. If the \ncountry keeps running big deficits, it hurts the country. If a business \nruns big deficits, it hurts the business. When the business runs those \ndeficits and is hurt, it is its owners, its managers who ultimately pay \na price, and normally that comes in the form of seeing their salaries \nreduced.\n  In the same vein, it strikes me perhaps we, as the Nation's stewards \nof our economy, should have the same kind of responsibility and the \nsame sort of incentive that people running a company have to make sure \nthat we do not run a deficit.\n  So I look forward to working with the Senator from Colorado to try to \ncome up with a proposal or a program or an amendment that could address \nthat set of incentives as well.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to talk briefly about why at \nleast those of us who supported the Balanced Budget Act Friday night, \nwho have been so strongly keeping committed to the notion of balancing \nthe budget in 7 years, adhere to this position, because I think those \nAmericans who are watching us in Washington, probably from time to time \nare wondering why are the stakes so high, why is it so critical that \nthis budget be balanced and the sooner the better, not in 10 years, 9 \nor 8 years, but in the 7 years we have talked about?\n  The answer is, a balanced budget means important things to virtually \neverybody in this country. To average working families, Mr. President, \nit means a chance to keep more of what they earn.\n  Most families in our country pay interest on something, some pay \ninterest on car loans that they have taken out; some pay interest on \nhome mortgages, some pay interest on student loans, some pay interest \non all of the above. Of course, there are many other items that people \nborrow money from lending institutions for today, and these interest \nrates are a big price that they pay along the way.\n  Putting the Nation's budget into balance means those interest rates \nwe pay are going to come down. It means average families who work hard \nin this country and want to keep more of what they earn will see rates \ncome down and see more money in their own pockets, instead of sending \nthose dollars along to the persons from whom they have borrowed the \ndollars. That means more money to pay for children's education, more \nmoney to spend on other family necessities. In short, average working \nfamilies get to have more control over their destinies.\n  Putting the budget into balance also means a lot for young people in \nthis country. I mentioned already the impact of the student loans and \ninterest rates paid on those loans. Let us talk about a young person \nwho is looking forward to getting out of school in the near future and \ngoing to work and earning their own living and addressing their own \nneeds, starting their own families, and so on. Considering the current \nrate of our national spending growth and the deficits we have been \ngenerating and projecting that on into the future, without restraint, \nmeans that young people today are confronting a debt burden that is \nincredibly large.\n  Already, earlier the Senator from Arizona talked about the impact of \nthese deficits on a child born in 1995. It is estimated that a child \nborn this year, Mr. President, will, in their lifetime, pay $187,000 \njust to pay their share of interest on the national debt that already \nexists and will grow during their lifetime. That would mean, Mr. \nPresident, that if we do not bring this spending spree, this sort of \nunlimited credit card type of Government operation under control, we \nwill pass on to the children of our country a lot less opportunity than \nwe inherited. It seems to me that all of us have a responsibility to \ntake care of our own bills--not to pass them on to the next generation.\n  The Senator from Vermont talked about these deficits, and I recognize \nthat they are not just deficits that started today. They have been \nbuilding over time. One of the reasons I ran for the Senate last year \nand I think a lot of the other people in the freshman class ran, was to \ncome down here and end the way business had been conducted--no matter \nwho was in the White House, no matter who controlled Congress, because \nour objective is to try and set the Nation on a new course.\n  So as we continue this discussion, as we continue to strive to find \ncommon ground with regard to starting the Government, we should not \nlose sight of the overall objective--the objective for this Senator, at \nleast, is to bring the budget into balance in 7 years so the families \nof this country will be able to keep more of what they earn, so that \nthe children of this country will not grow up with a huge debt burden \nconfronting them and spend too much of their time working to send money \nto Washington and to pay for their parent's bills, so that our Nation \ncan compete even more effectively in a new century in which global \ncompetition will dominate even more than it does today.\n  For those reasons, I am very proud of what we did Friday night, that \nfor once, despite all the conversations and talk and claims, and so on, \nthat have gone on for many years about balancing the budget, we \nactually did something about it. We ended the talk and put a bill \nbefore the House and before the House of Representatives which, if \nenacted, would balance the budget. I am proud to say I voted for that \nbill, and I am proud to say that the bill passed.\n\n  For once, Mr. President, on Friday night, we took a stand that was \nmore than just rhetoric. It was a commitment to a specific piece of \nlegislation that would accomplish the balanced budget we all talk about \nin Washington, and that people have talked about here for a quarter \ncentury. After 25 years of rhetoric, Friday night, we did something \nabout it.\n  Mr. President, I am glad I was part of that effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/19/senate-section/article/S17476-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17476-S17478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have not heard all of the presentations \non the floor today, but I am sure I would agree with some of what has \nbeen said in the context of the shutdown of Government. \n\n[[Page S 17477]]\n\n  The shutdown of Government should not have happened. It should not \ncontinue even another minute. There is a lot of talk about who is to \nblame, and there is probably plenty of blame to go around. Yesterday, I \nsaid there is not any juice left in this lemon. It has been squeezed in \na dozen different directions. The fact is that this shutdown ought to \nend.\n  The Speaker of the House, beginning last April, talked about creating \na train wreck, creating a shutdown of Government, boasting about a \ntitanic confrontation resulting in a shutdown. Well, so we have had a \ntitanic confrontation and a shutdown. Regrettably, it hurts our \ncountry. It ought not last. We should have and will have, in my \njudgment, an aggressive debate about the priorities of this country. We \nwill not have a debate and should not have a debate about whether the \nbudget should be balanced. Of course, it should be balanced.\n  The debate is about how you balance the budget. I hope that \nnegotiators, this afternoon, will decide quickly that the Government \nshutdown ends immediately, that the negotiations on a reconciliation \nbill to get to a balanced budget begin immediately, and that we balance \nthe Federal budget.\n  There is, however, more at stake than just balancing the budget. We \ncertainly should do that. But the plan to do that also represents the \nspending plan for the next 7 years, or, said differently, it represents \nthe spending priorities of this country for the next 7 years. That is \nimportant. The Senator from Arizona, before he left the floor, \nreferenced me and said that I have been active on this. He is correct. \nBut then he said that the difference is, those on the other side of the \naisle want the people to send more of their money to Government and \nthose on his side of the aisle want the people to be able to keep more \nof their money. I am telling you that is not the case. There is not \nthat difference between the two sides of this aisle. I want to \ndemonstrate that there is not that kind of difference.\n  The difference is in what we would choose to spend the public's money \nfor. I want to use a chart to demonstrate that. We recently had an \nappropriations bill on the floor, the Defense bill. The majority party, \nthe Republicans, decided that the Pentagon was not asking for enough \nmoney. They said: You are not asking for enough, we demand that you \ntake more. We insist that you accept $7 billion more in spending in \nthis 1 year, over $30 billion more in the 7 years. We insist that you \nspend more money. We insist that you buy some B-2 bombers. You did not \nask for them and we understand that. You asked to keep the production \nline open but not to buy more bombers. We insist you start buying more \nbombers. We have a plan and we insist you buy 20 more B-2 bombers that \ncost over $30 billion. We do not have enough money, they say, however, \nto keep the Head Start Program fully funded. We are short $533 million \nfor that. So 50,000 kids, everyone of whom has a name, little boys and \ngirls currently in the Head Start Program are going to be told we \ncannot afford you, we know the Head Start Program works. It is a \nwonderful program. A tremendous investment in young kids who come from \nhomes of difficulty, low-income homes. It works. It makes a difference \nin young kids' lives.\n\n  We are told by this plan that we do not have enough money for 50,000 \nof those kids. But we put the almost identical amount of money into B-2 \nbombers that the Pentagon did not ask for, did not order, and does not \nwant. The national missile defense, star wars--it is a fancy way of \nsaying star wars. There is $375 million more stuck in the budget for \nstar wars that the Defense Department did not ask for. And $1.3 billion \nis put in the budget for an assault ship, amphibious assault ship that \nthe Pentagon did not ask for; $974 million is stuck in the budget for a \nsecond assault ship that the Pentagon did not ask for. In fact, most \npeople thought the Pentagon does not want one, but Congress wants one, \nso Congress will decide which of these two it shall buy.\n  On that side of the aisle, they said, heck, as long as we have the \npublic credit card, the sky is the limit, so buy them both. We have \nplenty of money. Buy both of those ships for $2 billion. Then we say \nfor veterans health care, for those veterans who need outpatient \nvisits, 46,000 fewer hospitalizations, and about a million fewer \noutpatient visits; we are going to save money on you, veterans, because \nwe do not have the money. We spent it on ships the Pentagon did not ask \nfor.\n  Low-income home energy assistance, 1.3 million households in the \nmiddle of the winter when it gets cold, get assistance for the home \nheating bill because they do not have the money. Well, they are sorry, \nthey say we do not have the money.\n  But when it comes to F-15 and F-18 airplanes, they say, ``By the way, \nlet's buy more, the Pentagon is not right. We know they only asked for \na certain amount but we insist they buy more.''\n  I raise these points because when someone stands up and says, ``We \nare the ones who want the taxpayers to keep their money and you on this \nside of the aisle, you are the ones who want to take it from them.'' I \nsay baloney, what a bunch of nonsense. You all want to spend it on jet \nfighter planes and B-2 bombers and star wars. We want to spend it on \nStar Schools and nutrition programs and Head Start and education that \ninvests in people.\n  It is not a question of how much we spend. It is a question of what \nwe spend the money on.\n  I mentioned yesterday, there is probably no better metaphor for the \ndifference in priorities--not the difference in the desire to balance \nthe budget. We should, we must and we will balance the Federal budget.\n  Seven years, that is fine with me. Make it 5 if we can get Alan \nGreenspan and the Federal Reserve to get the boot off the public's \nneck. Every time we get any amount of economic growth at all, the Fed \njumps up and raises interest rates to slow the economy down. We can get \nsome decent economic growth in this country and we can balance the \nbudget in 5 years. We do not need 7.\n  The metaphor that I think is the best on priorities is a little \nprogram called Star Schools. It is a $25 million program nationally, \nStar Schools. In the proposal given to us this past week, Star Schools \nis cut 40 percent; 40 percent of the funding for Star Schools is gone.\n  But star wars, national missile defense, ergo star wars, a 100-\npercent increase. The Pentagon does not ask for star wars funding. \nThese folks say, ``We want 100 percent increase in star wars funding.'' \nA little program, about one-twentieth the size, a 40-percent cut in \nStar Schools funding.\n  That represents a difference. These differences in priorities are not \nlittle issues for a lot of the American people.\n  A Republican, David Gergen, who also worked for Democratic \nadministrations--he worked for the Clinton administration as well as \nReagan and Bush, but he said recently in an article the following: The \nlowest 20 percent of the population,'' under the majority's party line, \n``Would lose more income under these spending cuts than the rest of the \npopulation combined. At the other end, the highest 20 percent would \ngain more from the tax cuts than everyone else combined.''\n  That is a difference in priorities, a legitimate difference, one we \nought to have an ambitious debate on. But we ought not, because of a \ncontinuing resolution and the intransigence of some, have the \nGovernment shut down while we debate that.\n  I am not convinced these days with what is going on in Congress and \nwith the kind of extremism and the interest and, yes, even the appetite \nto create chaos and, as I said before, what one participant called a \ntitanic confrontation, I am not convinced that the Congress could very \neasily approve the Ten Commandments. Surely they would find something \nwrong with them. Almost certainly it would provoke enormous debate. \nShould there be 11 commandments or maybe only 8? Should we combine six \nand seven?\n\n  The fact is, all of us represent the same interests in this country. \nYes, we belong to different political parties. We may be conservatives \nand liberals. But I think the American public would like us to first of \nall end this shutdown, and second, turn our attention in a serious way \nto balance the Federal budget and then do much, much more because our \nlives are not just about balancing the budget.\n  That is important, and we should do that. That is not the only thing \nwe can \n\n[[Page S 17478]]\ndo in this country. There is much, much more to do to move this country \nahead, to advance our economic interests, to compete with others around \nthe world who are shrewd, tough international competitors, to help \ncreate more jobs, more opportunity, and more income for the American \npeople. There is much, much more to be done on all of that.\n  I know there are some in the Congress who do not believe in much of \nanything that Government does. They do not like Government. But you \nknow Government builds our schools, our roads. We create a police \nforce. We do it together, in something called Government. We have done \na lot of wonderful things in 50 years. We have made some mistakes, but \nwe do it together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. In this debate about priorities, what we need to do is \ndecide--all of us, of every political persuasion--that we want the same \ngoals for America. And then we debate, with the guidance of the \nAmerican people, how we achieve those goals.\n  Do we, in fact, achieve those goals by doubling the funding for star \nwars and deciding star schools are unimportant? I do not think so. Some \nothers may think so. If that is the case, we should have that debate \nand have the counsel of the American people, as we do, and make \ndecisions.\n  Mr. President, 200 years of differing views in this country have \nrequired us in a democratic system to make decisions by compromise. \nThis time is no different. Compromise is necessary now. I hope by the \nend of today we are over this hump, the Government shutdown has ended, \nand we get on to the serious business of balancing the Federal budget \nand making America better by the right investments in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the Chair advise \nthe Senator from Nevada when there is 1 minute of the 10 minutes \nremaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/19/senate-section/article/S17476-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17478-S17479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BALANCED BUDGETS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, people in the audience, people in the State \nof Nevada, people all over this country, are wondering what this is all \nabout.\n  Kevin Phillips, who is a Republican, did a piece on public radio this \nweek that I think fairly well illustrates what the problems are between \nthose on that side of the aisle and those of us over here, when he \nsaid:\n\n       If the budget deficit were really a national crisis instead \n     of a pretext for fiscal favoritism and finagling, we'd be \n     talking about shared sacrifice with business, Wall Street, \n     and the rich, the people who have the big money making the \n     biggest sacrifice. Instead, it's senior citizens, the poor, \n     the students, and ordinary Americans who will see programs \n     they depend on gutted while business, finance, and the \n     richest 1 or 2 percent, far from making sacrifice, actually \n     get new benefits in tax reductions.\n\n  Mr. President, this is what it is all about. This is extremely \ninconvenient, extremely difficult for everyone in the country, \nespecially States like Nevada where there is such a huge Federal \npresence, national parks, large recreation areas, the busiest \nrecreation area in America, the biggest entity of the Park System. I \nshould not say the largest--the most heavily visited in the entire Park \nSystem, Lake Mead Recreation Area. Almost 10 million people visit there \neach year, almost a million a month. They cannot get there. It is \nlocked up.\n  A lot of sacrifices. But the principle, Mr. President, is important, \nas indicated by a Republican, Kevin Philips, when he said what is being \ndone by the Republicans is something to benefit the rich, those people \nof position, and hurting the middle class and the poor. That says it \nall.\n  Mr. President, why are we in this situation we are in today? I see my \nfriend from the State of California, the mayor previously of one of the \nmost famous cities in America, the city of San Francisco, someone who \nrecognizes crisis because she was thrown into the mayorship as a result \nof an assassination, an American who has spent her life trying to \nbalance budgets, who has come to Congress and the Senate, talking about \nmoney, someone who has struggled with how to vote on these issues--\nbecause I have spent time with her--and who recognized she would not \nbalance the budget on the back of senior citizens by virtue of her \nvote, earlier, when we excluded from the balanced budget amendment, \nSocial Security. These are tough decisions, tough decisions for people \nwho strongly believe in a balanced budget.\n  I resent, Mr. President, because it is not factual, that people on \nthe other side of the aisle say those of us here do not believe in a \nbalanced budget. I point to my friend from California as someone who \nhas lived for balancing budgets.\n  Yesterday, when I was on this floor, I was between the two Senators \nfrom the State of Nebraska, former Governors, the former chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, Jim Exon, and the former Governor of Nebraska, \nBob Kerrey, chairman of the Entitlement Commission. In a dialog they \nindicated how they had worked over their political lives for a balanced \nbudget.\n  No, Mr. President, the balanced budget is not something that the \nRepublicans hold the prize on. We have as many on this side of the \naisle who have spent their entire lives talking about balanced budgets.\n  This is not a battle over a balanced budget. We all acknowledge there \nshould be a balanced budget. It is a question of priorities. We all \nbelieve there should be a balanced budget. This Senator from Nevada \nbelieves there should be a balanced budget. But I, along with the \nSenator from California, did not feel it should be done using Social \nSecurity proceeds. I, like Kevin Phillips, Republican political \nanalyst, do not believe the sacrifices should be made ``by senior \ncitizens, the poor, students, ordinary Americans who will see programs \nthey depend on gutted, while business, finance, and the richest one or \ntwo percent, far from making sacrifices, actually get new benefits and \ntax reductions.'' This is not a Democrat who wrote this for a \nDemocratic magazine. This is a Republican who gave an honest analysis \non National Public Radio.\n  Why are we here? We are here because the Republican majorities in the \nHouse and the Senate have not passed the appropriations bills. It is as \nsimple as that.\n  We could spend a lot of time discussing how is the best way to \nbalance the budget, and I think it is appropriate that we do that. But \nwe should do it in the context of real legislation, not contrived \ncrises that we see develop here. If the appropriations bills had been \npassed on time, we would all be home today with our families.\n  We all have stories to tell. I will have my five children together \nfor the first time in a long time, Thanksgiving. They are all now \ngathering in Nevada without the patriarch of the family. But that is \nOK, because I believe what we are doing here is important and I believe \nmy five children also believe what I am doing here today is important, \nbecause what we are doing is a matter of principle.\n  People have called my office. They want this thing resolved. I do not \nblame them. They do not identify themselves as Democrats or \nRepublicans. They are average Americans whose greatest expectation of \nGovernment is it operate to serve people's interests. They are the kind \nof people who pay their taxes, play by the rules, and vote for the \nperson and not the party. They want to know why this standoff is \noccurring, and I have explained why the standoff is occurring. It would \nbe easy for all of us to fold our tents. I would go home to Nevada to \nmy five children and everybody would disperse throughout the United \nStates, but it is not that easy.\n  We are stuck at an impasse because the bills that finance Government \nwere simply not passed on time. Under the congressional budget process, \nthe House Appropriations Committee is supposed to finish the last \nannual appropriations bill by June 10. Is it not interesting, we have \n13 appropriations bills and none of them were finished on time. \nCommerce, State, and Justice, July 19, 6 weeks late; DC appropriations, \nOctober 19, 4 months late; Labor-HHS, July 24, 7 weeks late; Defense, \nJuly 25--on and on, and, simply, they could not do it. The Senate then \nhad to follow suit. We did the best we could. \n\n[[Page S 17479]]\n\n  I have to hand it to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nthe senior Senator from Oregon, a fine, fair chairman who has done the \nbest he can under very difficult circumstances.\n  There is no excuse for these bills not having passed. But I think it \nwas part of a contrived program, established by the leaders in the \nHouse. I do not make this up. Why were these annual appropriations \nbills not passed on time? Because stuck inside most of these bills are \ncontroversial legislative proposals that otherwise would not be passed. \nAbortion, in many of the appropriations bills, has simply drawn them to \na grinding halt.\n\n  Wiping out environmental protection--one bill had 17 environmental \nriders to, in effect, wipe out the ability of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to protect clean air, clean water. They stuck in \nthings like grazing.\n  I am a western Senator and I have fought the good fight on grazing \nfor many years. There is a time and a place for grazing. It should be \nin authorizing legislation, not on appropriations bills. The same as \nmining, same as drilling in ANWR, same as clear-cutting of trees in \nvarious parts of this country. Why do we not do these in the ordinary, \nregular procession of authorizing regulation? Why in appropriations \nbills?\n  Many of these appropriations bills read more like legislative wish \nlists. The majority knew these bills must be signed into law to keep \nthe Government operating, and they viewed these bills from a gambler's \nperspective. They gambled, notwithstanding controversial legislation \nthat they could not get passed in the ordinary process, that the \nPresident would sign them anyway.\n  They were wrong. Even if the President refused and the Government \nwere to shut down, they would use the shutdown as a weapon, and that is \nwhat they have done. They would force the President to sign legislation \nthat the majority of the American public opposed for the sake of \nkeeping the Government operating. This was apparent as far back as \nApril.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised, at his request he was \nto be reminded when he had 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to have \n4 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. In April, House Speaker Newt Gingrich vowed to create a \ntitanic standoff for President Clinton by adding vetoed bills to must-\npass legislation increasing the national debt. This was reported in a \nnumber of places, including the Washington Times, on April 30. He \nboasted that ``the President will veto a number of things and we will \nput them all in the debt ceiling, and then he will decide how big of a \ncrisis he wants.'' Again, this is a quote from Speaker Gingrich.\n  We learned, a couple of days ago, why the Speaker is allowing this \nstandoff to continue and why, even from his own perspective, it is \ntougher than it would have been ordinarily. Do you know why? Because he \nhad to leave Air Force One from a door that he did not feel was \nappropriate, and the President did not spend enough time with him on \nthe airplane. This is going to the funeral of an assassinated Prime \nMinister of the State of Israel.\n  In the Washington Post, the Speaker is quoted as saying, because the \nPresident did not speak with him on the flight to Israel for Prime \nMinister Rabin's funeral, ``that is part of the reason why you ended up \nwith us sending down a tougher interim spending bill.'' The Speaker is \nalso quoted as saying, ``It is petty, but I think it is human.''\n  I suggest, Mr. Speaker, that it is not human; it is just plain petty.\n  Let us talk about some facts. Fact No. 1: Speaker Gingrich said, as \nearly as April, that a Government shutdown and default were political \ntools he was likely to use as a lever to push his extreme agenda. That \nis a fact.\n\n  Fact No. 2: There are 12 appropriations bills necessary to fund the \nGovernment. Since this Government has been in session starting last \nJanuary, the majority has simply failed to do this, and that is why we \nhave the crisis we have today.\n  Fact: President Clinton favored a balanced budget and is fighting for \none. The fight is over how to get there. The Republicans want to do it \non the backs of seniors, the poor, students, and ordinary citizens. The \nRepublicans want to do it in their own way.\n  We have now an economy that is great. We have the lowest inflation, \nthe lowest unemployment in 50 years. We have the third year in a row \nwhere we have had declining deficits--certainly not enough, but the \nthird year in a row for the first time in 50 years. We have 175,000 \nfewer Federal employees than we had 2\\1/2\\ years ago, the highest \neconomic growth since the days of Johnson, the highest corporate \nprofits in the history of the country. Why? Because the Democrats, a \ncouple of years ago, passed a budget that cut $500 billion from the \ndeficit. That is why the economy is so good.\n  Do you know we did not get a single Republican to vote with us? The \nVice President had to come and break the tie.\n  Fact: Recent polling shows Americans do not want the extreme agenda \npushed by the radical right in the GOP. That is why the Speaker is \nusing the Government shutdown and the threat of default as a way to \nblackmail this Congress and this President.\n  Final fact: Since the Republicans cannot pass their ideologically \nextreme agenda through normal legislative channels, they are trying to \nforce the President to agree to their demands to shut the Government \ndown. That is not how the system should work.\n  Mr. President, the crisis has been planned by Professor Gingrich.  He \nknows how crises develop. He has studied it. We have one here. It is \nall of his own doing, and I say, people of good will, both Democrats \nand Republicans in the Senate, should stand up and say that is not the \nway to run a government.\n  Legislation is the art of compromise, and we should work this out. We \nall agree on a balanced budget. It is a question of priorities. Let us \nfight out the priorities on the floor of the Senate and the floor of \nthe House the way we have done it for 200 years.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, about 3 days ago when we began to debate a \ncontinuing resolution which would have caused the Government to go back \nto work while we attempted to reach a balanced budget, the leading \nmember of the Democratic Party on the Budget Committee, the Senator \nfrom Nebraska, pleaded with us for what he called--and I quote him--a \n``simple extension.''\n  Mr. President, this standoff is taking place because--between a \n``simple extension'' and the dramatic change represented by the formal \n7-year budget passed by this body 2 nights ago that would balance the \nbudget by the year 2002--there is a great gulf fixed. This is not a \npetty difference. This is not a minor difference in opinion on a slight \nchange in direction for the Government of the United States. It is \nreflected in what the majority leader said if that bill passed. That \nprofound difference was reflected by the remarks of the majority leader \nto the effect that the vote that he cast to cause the budget to be \nbalanced was probably the most important that he had cast in all of his \nmany years in the U.S. Senate.\n  We on this side of the aisle wish to end the practice of spending \n$200 billion a year on programs which we like and support eloquently \nbut refuse to pay for and, therefore, send the bills to our children \nand grandchildren. Members on the other side wish for a simple \nextension of the present course of action. They argue eloquently for \nthe status \n\n[[Page S 17480]]\nquo. They like what Government is doing at the present time, and they \nare quite content to spend money and send the bills to someone else in \nsome future generation.\n  We have been informed that, if we do in fact pass a set of laws that \nwill balance the budget by the year 2002, the Federal Government itself \nwill receive a dividend of $170 billion in lower interest rates on the \ndebt and in higher tax collections because people are making higher \nincomes. The dividends to the people of the United States is some half \na trillion dollars in lower interest rates on their homes, their \nautomobiles, in better job opportunities, and in higher wages. We look \nto the future. They look to the present and to the past.\n  The President now in the present negotiations is willing to set a \ngoal of a balanced budget, a dream of a balanced budget, the thought \nthat the budget might be balanced sometime long after he ceases to be \nPresident, but he is unwilling to state it as a policy.\n  Even if we are to go to a balanced budget, there is another struggle \nwhich is not at all petty, Mr. President, between whose figures we will \nuse, those of the Congressional Budget Office, the very Congressional \nBudget Office which the President himself said was the neutral arbiter \njust 2 years ago, and the figures that the President himself through \nhis own office comes up with to suit his own purposes.\n  Many, including some otherwise thoughtful commentators on national \ntelevision, say, ``This is $1 million difference. Why are you \nquarreling over it?'' Mr. President, we are quarreling over it because \nthe difference in those estimates in the next 10 years is $1 trillion \nin spending. This President wants to use estimates that will allow him \nto spend $1 trillion more in the next 10 years, half a trillion dollars \nmore in the next 7 years, the 7 which separate us in the debate on the \nbalanced budget. That is not a modest difference, Mr. President--half a \ntrillion dollars in the next 7 years.\n  What is the difference given the fact that neither side can be \ncertain that it is right? If the White House is wrong and the \nCongressional Budget Office is right, and we adopt the White House \nfigures, we will never have deficits lower than $150 billion or $200 \nbillion even at the end of the 7 years. If, on the other hand, we are \nwrong, we are too conservative and they are right but our policies are \nadopted, what happens then? We balance the budget in 5 years rather \nthan 7. We simply reach our goal more rapidly with a larger fiscal \ndividend.\n  Let us put it very straightforward. Two days ago this Congress passed \na continuing resolution, one which would have put all Government \nemployees back to work with the single requirement that we state that \nwe would come up with a budget that would be balanced by the year 2002 \nusing the honest and realistic figures of the Congressional Budget \nOffice. It did not confine the President or the other party to any \nparticular tax cut, to any particular defense budget, or to any \nparticular reductions or slowing of growth in any program at all. It \nsimply said that we would debate from the same set of figures, and we \nwould reach the same desired end. That is all.\n  So this is an important difference. If you want to spend another half \na trillion dollars in the course of the next 7 years, you should favor \nthe President's course of action. That is what he wants to do. That is \nhis budget. If you feel that it is immoral, as well as economically \nwrong, to spend money today and to bill your children and grandchildren \nfor it, and you can accomplish those goals while still allowing \nspending in the U.S. Government to go up by an average of 3 percent a \nyear, then you take our side of this debate, Mr. President.\n  The debate is an important one. It is a vital one. It is, as the \nmajority leader said, at least the single most important debate in the \nlast 10 years, if not longer. It is a debate between those who believe \nthat the budget ought in fact to be in balance at the end of 7 years \nand those who have other and higher priorities and want to continue to \nspend money that they do not put up themselves but that they will bill \nto their children and their grandchildren.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/19/senate-section/article/S17479-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17480-S17481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to speak this afternoon \nas one of the seven Democrats who voted for the continuing resolution, \nHouse Joint Resolution 122, which passed the Senate on Friday.\n  Essentially, as has been stated, this resolution provided what we \nhave all wanted, a clean continuing resolution. In its third title, it \nsaid the Congress and the President, ``shall enact a balanced budget by \nthe year 2002 which is balanced.'' I believe a balanced budget is \nsomething that a majority of this body supports--perhaps it draws more \nsupport on your side of the aisle, Mr. President, than on our side, but \na balanced budget draws support from our side of the aisle as well.\n  It is my understanding this continuing resolution has not yet gone to \nthe President--in fact, that it is still in the enrolling clerk's \noffice of the Senate. It is my hope that this resolution would go to \nthe President for his signature. I would like to take a few minutes and \nexplain why I think it is important that he do the statesmanlike thing, \nand sign this resolution, put Government back to work, call the parties \ntogether, and begin to negotiate on what is really the heart of the \ndebate--the reconciliation bill.\n  As long as we keep Government shut down over the absence of a \ncontinuing resolution, essentially all we are doing is talking about \nthe size and shape of the table.\n  Now, there are those who would say, oh, that is not correct because, \ninherent in the continuing resolution is a very important point. The \nCongressional Budget Office provides the economic and technical data \nwhich enables one to judge the revenues with which one would be able to \nbalance the budget. In fact, many people believe that regardless of \nwhether you use the Office of Management and Budget or the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates, both will in fact be off and \nperhaps by some significant amount. The differences could translate \ninto billions of dollars, so it is a significant issue.\n  But we have to keep our eyes focused on the economy. I know in \nCalifornia, for the first time in several years, revenues have begun to \nmove ahead, some $700 million, ahead of estimates in this quarter of \nthe year for the State of California. That is a good omen. It means \nthat perhaps the economy will move ahead at a higher level than has \nbeen anticipated. The CBO's estimates then could be amended.\n  For me, it is not a big difference because I think the economic \nprojections will be amended, and they will be figured into the base of \nthe future years as we move along. But I think what is important is \nthat we put an end to what is taking place now because it has gone on \nnow for 5 days and is in fact beginning to hurt people. There are small \nbusinesses in my State that are contractors with the EPA or with \nDefense that are now laying off employees. There are 60,000 Head Start \nyoungsters that now may not be able to attend school.\n  I listened to Senator Stevens quite eloquently outline on the floor \nof this body yesterday afternoon the impact that this shutdown is \nbeginning to have on the military. He pointed out that in just a matter \nof a week, there will be no fuel. He pointed out that already people \nbeginning to move on military leave to go home for Thanksgiving are \nbeing stopped; that there is no money being paid for many kinds of \nduties that the military must carry out.\n  We know what is happening with our national parks. The Senator from \nArizona very eloquently stated the conditions at the Grand Canyon. At \nYosemite National Park, I can tell you that $22,000 a day is unable to \nbe taken in because it is closed.\n  We know that the Securities and Exchange Commission is unable to \ncollect higher filing fees for stocks and bonds because we have no \nappropriation bill in place, and that has cost United States taxpayers \nabout $10 million on the first day of this stalemate.\n  Then there are the hundreds of thousands of employees that have their \nhouse payments, their car payments and additional real facts of life \nthat they have to be able to carry out to exist. This dispute has gone \non long \n\n[[Page S 17481]]\nenough and we can simply put an end to it.\n  Another course is to bring back the earlier continuing resolution, \nmove for its reconsideration, amend it, and then send it to the \nPresident. The President should be given the opportunity to sign a \nclean continuing resolution.\n  Let me tell you why I think it is important that the President of the \nUnited States make a statement agreeing with the 7-year balanced \nbudget. Let me clarify, I do not believe I am alone on this side of the \naisle. Each week, I have a group of constituents for breakfast, and I \ngive them a small handout. It is not blown up and it is not fancy, but \nit is useful information and I would like to try to explain it here.\n  One pie chart represents 1969 Federal outlays, and the other \nrepresents 1995 Federal outlays. So there is a 26-year interval between \nthe two charts.\n  In 1969, military outlays were 44.9 percent of all Federal outlays. \nToday, 26 years later, we see they are just 16.6 percent of all Federal \noutlays.\n  We see where discretionary spending in 1969 was 21 percent of all \nFederal outlays. Today, it has dropped to 17 percent.\n  Now I would like to turn to net interest on the debt, not gross \ninterest, but net interest, which in 1969 represented 6.9 percent. \nToday, net interest is 14.5 percent of Federal outlays. So, in 26 \nyears, net interest on the debt has doubled as a share of Federal \noutlays.\n  We also see the major problem. We see entitlements at 26.9 percent of \nall Federal outlays in 1969 now exceeding the military budget, to 51.8 \npercent. So that today, in 1995, in terms of Federal outlay dollars, 66 \npercent of those dollars comprise entitlements and net interest on the \ndebt.\n  What has been predicted is that in the next 20 years, absent an \neffort to balance the budget, entitlements and net interest will absorb \nall of that, leaving a crushing burden of debt on those who follow us.\n  That is really the message of why a balanced budget is so important, \nand why a 7-year balanced budget, I believe can be reached.\n  In the reconciliation bill, once we get to it, we have to resolve \nconflicting priorities, and I think that is where there are differences \non both sides of the aisle. But, I believe those differences can be \nmet.\n  I listened to Senator Chafee, whom I greatly respect, speak yesterday \nafternoon on this floor on some of the changes that could be made in \nMedicare. I happen to agree with the Republican premium levels on \nMedicare. I also happen to strongly disagree with the Republicans on \nwhat they have done with quality care involving the poorest Medicare \nrecipients and the abolition of the Medicaid Program that would allow \nthe poorest seniors to be able to pay their Medicare premiums and \ncopayments through Medicaid.\n  That is a point of difference. But I think reasonable people can sit \ndown at the table and solve these problems, particularly if the \nmajority is willing to delay a tax decrease.\n  Many of us find egregious the fact----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator has an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Many of us find very egregious the fact that a $245 \nbillion tax decrease essentially drives deeper cuts in what I view as \nvery vital, safety-net programs. So I would be hopeful that we could \nend the debate on the size and shape of the continuing resolution, pass \na clean continuing resolution, send this resolution to the President, \nand I would urge him to sign it.\n  I would then urge the parties to reach across the aisle and begin to \ndiscuss how we can resolve the differences in the reconciliation bill.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time in morning \nbusiness is reserved for the Democratic leader.\n  The Chair notes the absence over a quorum. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, \nnotwithstanding the previous order, I be permitted to speak for up to 7 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, we are engaged in an exercise of trying \nto balance the budget. That term has been on every Presidential \ncandidate's lips since the 1970's. Indeed, in this Chamber, in my 21 \nyears in Congress, we have had a number of speeches on proposals to \nbalance the budget. We have had the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation \nthat was supposed to balance the budget. We had the Muskie rules back \nwhen Senator Muskie was here--he used to sit right over here, I \nremember--to balance the budget. Then we have had numerous votes on the \ndebt ceiling. We have debt ceiling legislation that we are supposed to \nprovide as a vehicle that would force a balanced budget. This has gone \non and on and on, and the American people are weary.\n  Finally, today, we are faced with a situation where our Government is \nshutting down because we cannot reach an agreement on balancing the \nbudget. I feel that there might be a better mechanical way of going \nabout this. I would rather force the Congress to have a vote every hour \nand stay here, or I would rather that the President be forced to come \nand meet with the congressional leaders every 4 hours, something like \nthey do in some of the railway labor negotiations where negotiations \nare forced rather than shutting down the Government.\n  I have been trying to find some way of sponsoring legislation so we \nhave an alternative vehicle to bring this type of impasse to a climax. \nI think it is a poor way to do business, that we are shutting down some \nof our services and that we are going through this exercise that will \nprobably be costly in the long run, as a way of forcing the issue. But, \nnevertheless, we are here. This is where we are as of this hour.\n  So where do we go from here? I hope our leaders do not compromise at \nthis point on anything less than something that will really balance the \nbudget with real numbers. If we come up with phony numbers and a more \nlengthy period of time, it will severely hurt the long-term bond \nmarket, in my opinion. It will mean that long-term interest rates will \ngo up substantially. It will mean that mortgage interest rates will go \nup substantially. It will mean eventually that student loan interest \nrates will go up substantially. It will mean that farmers' and \nranchers' interest rates will go up substantially. And it will mean \nthat our economy will be subject to inflationary pressures with high \ninterest rates. That would be very damaging to the prosperity that we \nenjoy.\n\n  Let me say that I feel passionately that balancing the budget is a \nmoral issue, and I am not one to come to this floor with a lot of \nmoralistic speeches. But it is moralistic because it is right. It is \nthe right thing to do to pay our debts. It is also moralistic because \nwe are shoving a responsibility off to someone else, our children and \ngrandchildren or future generations. We are not taking responsibility \nfor what we are spending during our watch. That is a moral issue.\n  It is also a moral issue because we are going to be robbing future \nmiddle-class wage earners and working people of part of their paychecks \nwithout consulting them. We are going to be robbing senior citizens of \na standard of living that they have come to expect and enjoy in the \nfuture, and we are going to be robbing people who are poor, who expect \nto get Government benefits or jobs or whatever from an economy that is \nabundant.\n  Therefore, I look upon this as a moral issue, as much as anything \nelse. So I feel passionately that we must carry through at this time \nand do what we have to do.\n  During this past year, I have voted for the Dole-Domenici budget in \nthis Chamber. By that, I mean the Republican budget or the budget put \nforth by \n\n[[Page S 17482]]\nSenator Domenici and the Budget Committee of the Senate and Senator \nDole, our leader. On all the votes that have come along, there have \nbeen efforts to untangle that budget that have been apple-pie-and-\nmotherhood votes to add this on or add that on.\n  I have voted with Senator Domenici to hold together that budget \npackage because I feel it is the best budget we have had in my 21 years \nin Congress. It is the first time we have had a budget that has a \nvision to move us to a balanced budget by the year 2002. That does not \nsay we are paying anything on the Federal debt. We are not. We still \nhave that huge debt to deal with. It does not say anything that we are \ngoing to get into a balanced budget until 2002. We are still engaging \nin deficit spending until 2002.\n  What is the big fight about here in town? The President of the United \nStates campaigned on a platform to balance the budget within 5 years. I \nremember Jimmy Carter's was he was going to balance the budget in 4 \nyears during the time he was President. Ronald Reagan campaigned on a \nprogram to balance the budget. Every Member of this Senate has run for \nthe Senate on a program to balance the budget.\n\n  The point is, it goes on and on and on, and there are excuses and \nthere are phony numbers, there are CBO numbers, there are these \nnumbers, that numbers. But the American people have said, enough is \nenough, get on with a plan. There are going to be some people in this \nsegment of the economy angry, some people in that segment.\n  I think it just takes an across-the-board approach. I think the \nDomenici-Dole budget has some flaws in it. There are some things in it \nI disagree with but, generally speaking, it cuts the rate of increase. \nSome of these programs have been increasing at 12 percent a year. This \nreduces the rate of increase to between 5 and 7 percent.\n  With that rate of increase, we can absorb the increases and bring us \nto a balanced budget. So when we talk about cuts, for the most part, we \nare not talking about cuts at all. We are talking about increasing at a \nslower level, but still increasing probably at the rate of inflation. \nSo at least let us get with it. At least let us do it. And I hope our \nleadership does not compromise away this work and these votes that we \nhave cast this year. I hope we stick to our guns and stick to this plan \nthat has been put forward, which I call the Domenici-Dole budget.\n\n  Mr. President, let me say something about middle-class working \npeople. One way or another, they end up paying most of the taxes in \nthis country. I think that is unfortunate. I am a member of the Finance \nCommittee, and I have tried to change that. There are promises about a \nflat-rate tax in the future, and there are promises about a tax on \nconsumption instead of income taxes in the future. But it will still \nend up that those families or those individuals who work hard, obey the \nlaw, they end up pulling the wagon. They are the ones paying for this \nnonsense, and they are the ones out there who helped elect this new \nCongress. In frustration, they are saying, ``Let us do something about \nthis.''\n  Mr. President, I think it is time for us to do something. I hope to \ncontinue to be a part of that. I ask our leadership not to make \ncompromises that are unnecessary, that go beyond the framework of the \nDomenici-Dole budget, that would leave us, once again, going away from \nhere with the American people being promised that there is going to be \na balanced budget and there is not. I hope that the President and the \nCongress will heed the American people.\n  I thank the Chair for this opportunity to speak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/19/senate-section/article/S17481-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER.

Their hard work \nshould be recognized.\n  However, I hope that in their understandable haste, our negotiators \nwill not lose sight of the objective--which is not just to secure a \npeace, but to secure a just and lasting peace.\n  Most Members of Congress would agree that for an agreement to have a \nreasonable prospect of achieving a stable peace, it must include the \nfollowing provisions:\n  First, a clear demarcation of defensible borders for Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and resolution of all territorial issues among the parties;\n  Second, clear lines of demarcation between the military forces of the \nparties to the agreement and procedures for separating the forces;\n  Third, concurrence by all parties and witnesses to the agreement to \nmultilateral lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina upon \nentry into force of the agreement;\n  Fourth, acceptance by all parties and witnesses to the agreement to \nUnited States involvement in an effort to equip, arm, and train Bosnian \nFederation Forces;\n  Fifth, establishment of clear standards for violations of the \nagreement and the unrestricted use of force by NATO to include air \npower as necessary to respond to violations of the agreement which \nthreaten not only the peace, but the security of our forces;\n  Sixth, an end to military intervention by the Governments of Croatia \nand Serbia and Montenegro in Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n  Seventh, the dismantlement of the integrated air defense network \nlinkages between Serbia and Bosnian-Serb held areas of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina;\n  Eighth, full NATO implementation of the deny flight operation; and\n  Ninth, measures to ensure that indicted war criminals are not in \npositions of authority, including any elected office.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that these are the minimum elements of \na viable peace agreement. Without these elements, it is unlikely that a \ngenuine peace will hold. Without these elements, it is unlikely that \nBosnia will survive.\n  We should not mistake securing any peace agreement in Dayton with \nsecuring a stable peace. No matter how difficult the negotiations are, \nif they fail to achieve an agreement that secures the integrity and \nindependence of Bosnia they will have been a waste of time.\n\n  Also essential to a stable peace is restoring public confidence and \ntrust in the Government, institutions, and leaders of Bosnia. Absent \njustice, there will be no trust and no peace will endure. For the long-\nsuffering Bosnian people, to believe in the peace, they \n\n[[Page S 17483]]\nmust witness for themselves that justice will be done in Bosnia. \nJustice is the only comfort we can provide to mothers and fathers who \nhave lost their children to war crimes. This will not be a just peace \nif war criminals remain at large and unaccountable for their heinous \ncrimes.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, any peace will be short-lived if it does \nnot provide the Bosnians with the authority and the means to defend \ntheir territory and their people. Absent a stable military balance, \nthose who have clearly been the aggressors in this conflict will seek \nto press their advantage again. Whatever agreement is initialed in \nDayton, it must provide for lifting the arms embargo and for addressing \nthe existing military imbalance. If it does not, it will serve no \ngreater purpose than to delay an inevitable return to hostilities. It \nwill simply be another invitation to future aggression.\n  Placing these important matters aside, foremost on the minds of the \nAmerican people is whether or not young Americans should be ordered to \nenforce a peace agreement in Bosnia.\n\n  Mr. President, in my view, the deployment of American forces into \nharms' way requires very careful deliberation on the part of the \nadministration and the Congress. The President has informed me that he \nwill come to Congress for support. That is the right thing to do. It \nwould be unwise to send American forces without the support of the \nCongress and the American people. Right now, I do not believe that the \nPresident has it.\n  He certainly will not have it, if a peace agreement does not include \nthe provisions I have mentioned. But, he is also unlikely to receive \nour support if the implementation plan for our military forces does \nnot, at the very least, include the following essential provisions:\n  First, well-defined and clearly stated mission objectives achievable \nthrough military means;\n  Second, robust rules of engagement allowing for disproportionate \nresponses, as appropriate, to any attacks on United States and NATO \nforces and no restrictions or impediments on the ability of United \nStates and NATO military forces to defend themselves;\n  Third, United States military forces will operate only under a \nunified NATO command whose orders and authority cannot be constrained, \nconditioned, blocked or vetoed by any other party including the United \nNations;\n  Fourth, United States military forces shall use the authority granted \nin any annexes to the maximum extent consistent with their resources \nand shall act to deter, defeat or punish any violations from whatever \nsource;\n\n  Fifth, clear criteria for measuring progress toward achieving the \nobjectives of the operation, a detailed exit strategy, and adequate \nresources for achieving these objectives and effecting a safe exit for \nall United States forces from Bosnia;\n  Sixth, procedures for integrating appropriate UNPROFOR forces \ncurrently in Bosnia into a NATO-led implementation force and procedures \nfor withdrawing any other UNPROFOR forces from Bosnia; and\n  Seventh, specific provisions to prevent conflict between United \nStates and non-NATO Forces and members of the civilian population of \nBosnia.\n  Mr. President, I believe that these criteria are very simple and very \nbasic. I am not certain that Congress will go along with sending \nAmerican Forces even if these provisions are included in a peace \nagreement and implementation plan. However, I am certain that without \nthese elements, not only will Congress overwhelmingly disapprove of the \npeace agreement and the plan to send American Forces as peacekeepers, \nbut that neither of these plans will have a chance of succeeding.\n  The administration says that NATO will collapse if the United States \ndoes not send Americans into Bosnia as peacekeepers, but what happens \nto NATO if Americans are used to keep a peace which cannot be kept? \nWhat happens if we send Americans without adequate authority and \nprovision to protect themselves? NATO should remain strong and united, \nhowever, unity in failure is the worst possible outcome. How much worse \noff would NATO be if United States and other NATO Forces were deployed \nin Bosnia only to leave in failure?\n\n  Which brings me to my final question: Why this option? Why is sending \n20,000 American troops to Bosnia the only option being considered by \nthe Clinton administration? Why was no consideration given to using \nAmerican air power and American supply lines for ground forces provided \nby our European allies?\n  Mr. President, many questions remain. The President has not yet made \nthe case for American involvement in Bosnia on this massive scale. The \nCongress has clearly stated its view that the President should seek \nauthorization for any deployment to Bosnia. The Congress has also \nclearly stated its preference for lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia so \nthat Bosnians may defend themselves. And we have done this time after \ntime after time on a bipartisan basis. Many of us who supported lifting \nthe embargo, did so not just because of our support for Bosnia's \ninherent right to self-defense, because we hoped we could avoid sending \nthousands of Americans into Bosnia to defend Bosnians. But, the \nPresident chose not to do that--and now we are where we are.\n  Mr. President, we fully understand the constitutional authority of \nthe President of the United States. We also understand the \nconstitutional responsibility of the Congress. There is no greater \nresponsibility for an elected representative than to prevent the \nneedles shedding of American blood. We intend to exercise that \nresponsibility with the utmost care.\n  Mr. President, I want to particularly thank the Presiding Officer for \nhis efforts not only in helping me prepare this statement, but for his \nconsistent support for the position that I have outlined here and for \nhis leadership on the Senate floor and in the Senate negotiations on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  I appreciate very much his help.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the distinguished leader departs \nhere momentarily, I would like to join in acknowledging the Presiding \nOfficer's very active participation in this and a broad range of \nmatters relating to the military. He served on the Armed Services \nCommittee with great distinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/19/senate-section/article/S17482-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17483-S17484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE APPROPRIATIONS BILLS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to bring up the subject of \nthe appropriations bill. I addressed the distinguished majority leader \nearlier today. We had indications that the President might sign two of \nthe three pending appropriations bills.\n  But at this hour there seems to be still some doubt as to whether or \nnot he will sign the Defense appropriations bill which, as the majority \nleader recalls, the distinguished Senator from Alaska and the Senator \nfrom Hawaii, being chairman and ranking members of that committee, put \nthrough with a very strong vote.\n  It would seem to me inconsistent. It seems to me if the President \nwere thinking about a further commitment, a commitment for which I \nstill have serious reservation, of ground troops into that theater that \nyou would need to have as a foundation the signing of the Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  There are $647 million in that bill for the specific purpose of \ncontingency operations--not included in Bosnia but other operations, \nand should you put a further financial burden on the defense budget \nwithout the allocation of those funds for the ongoing, it seems to me \nto be just an inconsistent operation. I hope that this message would go \nto the White House at this moment.\n  Mr. DOLE. I appreciate the Senator's interest in the defense \nappropriations bill.\n  It has also been expressed by the chairman of the subcommittee, \nSenator Stevens, I think in a conversation earlier today with Senator \nWarner, a telephone conversation. I understand the President was going \nto sign legislative appropriations and Treasury, Postal appropriations \nabout 5 o'clock today. I hope he has done that. That would mean, if we \ndo not come together on a continuing resolution, which I think we will, \nthat those people could be back at work.\n  But I would underscore what the Senator from Virginia has stated. If \nthe President is thinking about--and I know he is thinking about it--\nany deployment in Bosnia, it seems to me he would be in a much stronger \nposition--I leave that judgment to him because I have not made a \njudgment yet on that \n\n[[Page S 17484]]\nissue--if he signed the Defense appropriations bill and did it very \nquickly and sent the appropriate signal that he was not going to weaken \nour defense in any way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Before the majority leader leaves the floor--and I know \nhe is involved in very delicate negotiations in trying to get our \nGovernment running again--I express my appreciation for again what is \nclearly a balanced statement. It is one that clearly recognizes the \nconstitutional authority of the President of the United States. But the \nmajority leader's statement also clearly recognizes the constitutional \nresponsibility of the Congress of the United States, and there is \nnothing in the majority leader's statement nor anything that has been \ndone in this body that would be in abrogation of that constitutional \nauthority the President has. But at the same time, as the majority \nleader said, we have no greater responsibility than to ensure that if \nour young men and women are sent into harm's way, we have exercised our \nresponsibility in our role as those who provide the funding and the \napproval or disapproval.\n\n  I think also Senator Dole's statement clearly sends a signal to the \nPresident of the United States that he can send troops, and he does \nhave that constitutional authority, but without the approval of the \nCongress and the American people that exercise is doomed to failure. \nWhen we express our concern about the fragility or the permanence of \nNATO, nothing could be more damaging to NATO and the Atlantic Alliance \nthan the dispatch of troops and some casualties taken by Americans \nbecause it was a peace agreement that did not meet the criteria just \nlaid out in the majority leader's statement, and therefore the American \npeople demand, as they did in Somalia and as they did in Beirut --only \nthis time that crisis would be magnified by a thousandfold--that our \nAmerican troops be withdrawn because it was a peace that could not be \nkept. Then I would suggest to our supporters of NATO--and the majority \nleader and I are members of that group--there is no greater damage that \ncould be done to the Atlantic Alliance than that scenario. So before we \nsend troops, I would hope there would be debate on this floor, debate \nand discussion, as there was concerning the Persian Gulf.\n  Again, I recognize how great are the responsibilities the majority \nleader has at this moment. They are intense and severe. But I think it \nis very important, since we may be going out of session for this week, \nthat the majority leader make this statement. He reflects the views of \nthe overwhelming majority, I believe, of Members of both sides of the \naisle. This statement may be lost in the short term, but we will be \nbalancing what agreement is made, if an agreement is made, with the \nmajority leader's statement, the criteria and the provisions which were \nlaid out which I think are not only unreasonable but a bare minimum as \nthe criteria for any agreement and any possibility it may have of being \npermanent.\n  Again, I do not know exactly how to express the appreciation of lots \nof people for the role that the majority leader has played in this \ncrisis, especially in his effort to lift the arms embargo. I do not \nbelieve we would have lost the tens of thousands of innocent lives if \nthe arms embargo had been lifted at the time the majority leader first \ntried to achieve that goal, but now we are where we are. Now we are \nplaying the hand we are dealt. I believe that if in the formulation of \na peace agreement the criteria and provisions that the majority leader \noutlined are adhered to, we may have an opportunity to receive the \napproval of the Congress and the American people and prevent what could \npossibly be a very serious confrontation between the two branches of \nGovernment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, again let me thank the Senator from Arizona \nfor his constant assistance and leadership on this issue. I think he is \ncorrect. I think we speak for Senator Lieberman and countless Senators \non the other side of the aisle. If they were here at this point, they \nwould be speaking out. So this is not a partisan issue. It never has \nbeen a partisan issue. It is about what steps should be taken before we \ndecide to commit American forces anywhere under any condition. There \nare many concerned parents and grandparents around the country as well \nas young men and women themselves. I think we owe it to them and to \ntheir families and anybody in the future to make sure that certain \ncriteria have been met. In my view, these are reasonable. I hope the \nPresident will find the criteria outlined in the statement to be \nreasonable. We will be furnishing a copy to Mr. Lake, the President's \nsecurity adviser, within the next few moments.\n  (Mr. McCAIN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DOLE. We are still working on the agreement. We are very hopeful. \nSo I think unless there is somebody wishing to speak, I would ask we \nstand--does the Senator from Virginia wish to be recognized?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. Then would the Senator then go into recess subject to call.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/19/senate-section/article/S17483-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SIGNING OF APPROPRIATIONS BILLS\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I indicated earlier the President was about \nto sign legislative and Treasury. I am now informed he has signed the \nlegislative appropriations bill and the Treasury, post office \nappropriations bill. So that brings it to a total of six that have been \nsigned, two or three that are still in conference, and one still has \nnot passed the Senate because of objections on the other side, the \nLabor-HHS bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I assume, I say to the distinguished \nmajority leader, if the message has come down those two bills have been \nsigned, that still casts doubt as to the Defense appropriations bill, \nand both the majority leader and the distinguished Presiding Officer \nand the Senator from Virginia send this urgent message to the President \nto sign that key piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/19/senate-section/article/S17484-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17484-S17485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     UNITED STATES TROOPS IN BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I just wish to supplement my remarks by \nonce again commending the Presiding Officer and, indeed, the \ndistinguished majority leader for their leadership on this issue \nthroughout. But I do recall so vividly at the time that President Bush \nwas dispatching our troops into the gulf region he specifically came to \nCongress. I recall the debate, a very thorough and careful debate went \non for 2 days in the Senate, and the final vote was but five votes \napart; by a bare margin of five votes the Senate gave its approval, I \nwould say--under the Constitution, of course, the President has the \nright, but the Senate gave its approval of the President exercising his \nconstitutional right to use the troops that were then already deployed \nin the gulf region in a role which could involve the use of force of \narms.\n  That same type of resolution--very simple, very straightforward--\nshould be employed in this case if it is the desire of the President to \ngo forward. I am hopeful, as the distinguished majority leader said, \nthat there could be other options. People should recognize that the \nUnited States is heavily involved in the air missions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER has given detailed accounts many times on the \nfloor of the Senate of the involvement of the men and women of our air \narm and the risks that they have taken. Likewise at sea, the United \nStates is providing the principal naval units for the purpose of the \nenforcement of certain embargoes that are now in place. And likewise, \nwe have on duty in the Adriatic often a carrier and often other ships \nsupporting the helicopters that are needed for backup for rescue \noperations, should that be necessary. We saw that, of course, at the \ntime the distinguished Air Force officer was shot down and then \neventually rescued.\n  So, Mr. President, the United States is very heavily engaged at this \ntime. Also, the American taxpayers have footed a bill that exceeds $1 \nbillion, as we would want to do for humanitarian and medical and other \ntypes of humanitarian assistance to people of that war-torn region.\n  So, I hope tonight we urge upon the President to reflect very \ncarefully before he makes a final decision, and that he regards it \nessential to come to the Congress, as did President Bush. And, lastly, \nonce again, I am hopeful that he will sign the Defense appropriations \n\n[[Page S 17485]]\nbill. The distinguished Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, and I did \ntalk earlier today. He has been very active with the White House in \ngiving the reasons, together with Senator Inouye of Hawaii, for the \nneed for the signing of that bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/19/senate-section/article/S17484-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this joint \n     resolution, except section 106, whenever an Act listed in \n     section 101 as passed by both the House and Senate as of the \n     date of enactment of this joint resolution, does not include \n     funding for an ongoing \n\n[[Page S 17488]]\n     project or activity for which there is a budget request, or whenever an \n     Act listed in section 101 has been passed by only the House \n     or only the Senate as of the date of enactment of this joint \n     resolution, and an item funded in fiscal year 1995 is not \n     included in the version passed by the one House, or whenever \n     the rate for operations for an ongoing project or activity \n     provided by section 101 for which there is a budget request \n     would result in the project or activity being significantly \n     reduced, the pertinent project or activity may be continued \n     under the authority and conditions provided in the applicable \n     appropriations Act for the fiscal year 1995 by increasing the \n     rate for operations provided by section 101 to a rate for \n     operations not to exceed one that provides the minimal level \n     that would enable existing activities to continue. No new \n     contracts or grants shall be awarded in excess of an amount \n     that bears the same ratio to the rate for operations provided \n     by this section as the number of days covered by this \n     resolution bears to 366. For the purposes of the Act, the \n     minimal level means a rate for operations that is reduced \n     from the current rate by 25 percent.\n       Sec. 112. Notwithstanding any other provision of this joint \n     resolution, except section 106, whenever the rate for \n     operations for any continuing project or activity provided by \n     section 101 or section 111 for which there is a budget \n     request would result in a furlough of Government employees, \n     that rate for operations may be increased to the minimum \n     level that would enable the furlough to be avoided. No new \n     contracts or grants shall be awarded in excess of an amount \n     that bears the same ratio to the rate for operations provided \n     by this section as the number of days covered by this \n     resolution bears to 366.\n       Sec. 113. Notwithstanding any other provision of this joint \n     resolution, except sections 106, 111, and 112, for those \n     programs that had high initial rates of operation or complete \n     distribution of funding at the beginning of the fiscal year \n     in fiscal year 1995 because of distributions of funding to \n     States, foreign countries, grantees, or others, similar \n     distributions of funds for fiscal year 1996 shall not be made \n     and no grants shall be awarded for such programs funded by \n     this resolution that would impinge on final funding \n     prerogatives.\n       Sec. 114. This joint resolution shall be implemented so \n     that only the most limited funding action of that permitted \n     in the resolution shall be taken in order to provide for \n     continuation of projects and activities.\n       Sec. 115. The provisions of section 132 of the District of \n     Columbia Appropriations Act, 1988, Public Law 100-202, shall \n     not apply for this joint resolution. Included in the \n     apportionment for the Federal Payment to the District of \n     Columbia shall be an additional $16,575,016 above the amount \n     otherwise made available by this joint resolution, for \n     reimbursement to the United States of funds loaned for \n     certain capital improvement projects pursuant to Public Law \n     81-533, as amended; Public Law 83-364, as amended; Public Law \n     85-451, as amended; and Public Law 86-515, as amended, \n     including interest as required thereby.\n       Sec. 116. Notwithstanding any other provision of this joint \n     resolution, except section 106, the authority and conditions \n     for the application of appropriations for the Office of \n     Technology Assessment as contained in the conference report \n     on the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1996, House \n     Report 104-212, shall be followed when applying the funding \n     made available by this joint resolution.\n       Sec. 117. Notwithstanding any other provision of this joint \n     resolution, except section 106, any distribution of funding \n     under the Rehabilitation Services and Disability Research \n     account in the Department of Education may be made up to an \n     amount that bears the same ratio to the rate for operation \n     for this account provided by this joint resolution as the \n     number of days covered by this resolution bears to 366.\n       Sec. 118. Notwithstanding any other provision of this joint \n     resolution, except section 106, the authorities provided \n     under subsection (a) of section 140 of the Foreign Relations \n     Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (Public Law \n     103-236) shall remain in effect during the period of this \n     joint resolution, notwithstanding paragraph (3) of said \n     subsection.\n       Sec. 119. Notwithstanding any other provision of this joint \n     resolution, except section 106, the amount made available to \n     the Securities and Exchange Commission, under the heading \n     Salaries and Expenses, shall include, in addition to direct \n     appropriations, the amount it collects under the fee rate and \n     offsetting collection authority contained in Public Law 103-\n     352, which fee rate and offsetting collection authority shall \n     remain in effect during the period of this joint resolution.\n       Sec. 120.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this joint resolution:\n       (1) Continuing resolution.--The term ``continuing \n     resolution'' means a bill or joint resolution that includes \n     provisions making further continuing appropriations for \n     fiscal year 1996.\n       (2) Debt limit extension measure.--The term ``debt limit \n     extension measure'' means a bill or joint resolution that \n     includes provisions increasing or waiving (for a temporary \n     period or otherwise) the public debt limit under section \n     3101(b) of title 31, United States Code.\n       (3) Reconciliation bill.--The term ``reconciliation bill'' \n     means a bill that is a reconciliation bill within the meaning \n     of section 310 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n\n     SEC.   . COMMITMENT TO A SEVEN-YEAR BALANCED BUDGET.\n\n       (a) The President and the Congress shall enact legislation \n     in the first session of the 104th Congress to achieve a \n     balanced budget not later than fiscal year 2002 as estimated \n     by the Congressional Budget Office, and the President and the \n     Congress agree that the balanced budget must protect future \n     generations, ensure Medicare solvency, reform welfare, and \n     provide adequate funding for Medicaid, education, \n     agriculture, national defense, veterans, and the environment. \n     Further, the balanced budget shall adopt tax policies to help \n     working families and to stimulate future economic growth.\n       (b) The balanced budget agreement shall be estimated by the \n     Congressional Budget Office based on its most recent current \n     economic and technical assumptions, following a thorough \n     consultation and review with the Office of Management and \n     Budget, and other government and private experts.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3062) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the joint \nresolution be read a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So, the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 122), as amended, was passed.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, that was the compromise language that would \nextend until December 15 the date agreed upon. In fact, I ask that a \ncopy \n\n[[Page S 17489]]\nof the resolution--I might just read it quickly. This is the agreement \nreached. I want to thank my colleague, Senator Daschle, and thank \nSenator Exon. Also, of course, I want to thank my colleague, Senator \nDomenici, and the others who have been working on this throughout the \nday and throughout yesterday. There have been Members on each side. I \nknow Senator Warner has been involved, as have others. But what we have \nagreed to now, in a bipartisan, nonpartisan way, I think, is a very \nsatisfactory conclusion to what has been a rather tense situation the \npast several days.\n\n       (a) The President and the Congress shall enact legislation \n     in the first session of the 104th Congress to achieve a \n     balanced budget not later than fiscal year 2002 as estimated \n     by the Congressional Budget Office, and the President and the \n     Congress agree that the balanced budget must protect future \n     generations, ensure Medicare solvency, reform welfare, and \n     provide adequate funding for Medicaid, education, \n     agriculture, national defense, veterans, and the environment. \n     Further, the balanced budget shall adopt tax policies to help \n     working families and to stimulate future economic growth.\n       (b) The balanced budget agreement shall be estimated by the \n     Congressional Budget Office based on its most recent current \n     economic and technical assumptions, following a thorough \n     consultation and review with the Office of Management and \n     Budget, and other Government and private experts.\n\n  We also take care of back pay in this resolution. And the continuing \nresolution will be at 75 percent. I will ask the chairman of the \nAppropriation Committee to explain this in more detail. And it will \nextend until December 15.\n  I would be happy to yield to the distinguished Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The able minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the President pro tempore.\n  I want to commend the distinguished majority leader for his \nleadership in the effort he has made in the last 24 hours to achieve \nthis agreement. I also commend the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico, our chairman of the Budget Committee, for his effort. It was \nthe Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Nebraska, our ranking \nmember, who have done a great deal of work in the last couple of days \nto get us to this point. I appreciate very much their efforts.\n  I have discussed this with the President. He fully supports it and \nwill sign it. As the majority leader has indicated, this resolution \nwill allow us to continue to fund the Government until the 15th of \nDecember at a level of 75 percent. It reopens the Government and gets \npeople back to work. It reaffirms our commitment to balancing the \nbudget, it spells out our commitment to protecting our priorities--\nMedicare and Medicaid, education, the environment, defense, \nagriculture, and veterans. There will be consultation on economic \nassumptions with the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of \nManagement and Budget and private experts. It really presents the \nframework for negotiations.\n  Now that this is behind us, I think the time for us to negotiate the \nreal balanced budget is at hand. This gives us that opportunity. I am \nvery pleased that we were able to reach the agreement tonight.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, before I yield to the Senator from Oregon, \nSenator Hatfield, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, let me also \nthank Senator Lott who has been on the telephone the last hour or two \nchecking with Members who had problems.\n  Also, Senator Gorton who helped us with some editorial comment and \ncorrected a few things which were not quite accurate.\n  Senator Mack and Senator Cochran were there yesterday afternoon and \nagain today helping us bring this together.\n  And, of course, Senator Warner has been on the floor and in the \nmeetings. We appreciate that very much. Coming from Virginia he has a \nnumber of concerns about Federal employees.\n  As I said earlier, the Senator from New Mexico deserves great credit. \nI think it is fair to say it indicates again if we can reach out we can \ncome together.\n  I think we preserved a very important principle: a balanced budget in \n7 years. That was very important to Members on this side and I think to \na number of Members on the other side.\n  Also, obviously the Presiding Officer has been in the thick of this \nfrom the start. We appreciate the President pro tempore's discussions, \nand a number of other colleagues, Senator McCain, who is not on the \nfloor, and Senator Pressler, who was there for a few hours this \nafternoon. We had a lot of people come and go and a lot of input.\n  I yield now to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield for \n30 seconds?\n  I also think a number of staff people, including Bill Hoagland and \nJohn Hilley, deserve special commendation for the terrific work they \nhave done. They and many other members of the staff have worked for the \nlast couple of weeks to achieve this. I appreciate very much their \neffort and all the work they have done to make this happen.\n  On our side, Senator Reid and Senator Dorgan and Members of our \nleadership have also been extremely helpful and demonstrated a \nsignificant level of leadership.\n  Let me also thank Leon Panetta and members of the White House for the \ncooperation and tremendous effort that they also made to make this \nhappen tonight.\n  A number of people are responsible for the fact we are here tonight. \nI think it is fair to say we have shared in a great deal of effort to \nmake it happen, and we are very pleased.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator Hatfield is recognized.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I, first, would like to add my word of \ncongratulations to our leadership, Senator Dole, Senator Daschle, the \nchairman and ranking member of the Budget Committee, and others who \nhave been very much involved.\n  Let me just say, we now have 6 appropriations bills of the 13 signed. \nSo this continuing resolution will cover the seven bills not signed. I \nthink it is very important to note we have now extended until December \n15. We must act upon these remaining bills in order to get agreement \nbetween the White House and the Congress. And the most important bill, \nin my view, is the Labor-HHS. That is the only appropriations bill the \nSenate has refused to consider, and we must move on that bill in order \nto get it covering the important programs of education, health and \npublic services.\n\n  Also, for those programs that have been terminated by either the \nHouse or the Senate, this will fund those programs at 75 percent of \nlevel until that date. Also, it restores the back pay. That may be the \nbest news of all for some of those who are getting down to the end of \ntheir resources and need this assurance they will be paid for those \ndays they have been furloughed.\n  So I want to, again, say this is a great occasion to see this impasse \nbrought to an end, and through the extraordinary bipartisan effort of \nboth sides of the aisle and the White House, this achievement is very \nsignificant.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The able Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this agreement will allow all Federal \nworkers to return to their jobs tomorrow morning and all Government \noperations will return to normal. This is not a win for Republicans or \nDemocrats, this is a win for the American people.\n  This will ensure the first balanced budget plan in more than a \nquarter century. Up until today, Republicans in Congress had passed and \ncommitted to a 7-year balanced budget, but after today, the President \nis now on board. He and his administration are now committed to \nachieving a balanced budget in 7 years using the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office. While this is a giant first step, there is \na lot of work to getting it done, and I pledge my full effort to try to \nget this done in the next 3 to 4 weeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am concerned that we are in the \nprocess of jimmying the numbers so that President Clinton can spend \ntens of billions of dollars that we do not have on programs that we \ncannot afford.\n  It appears that we are laying the predicate for assuming away the \ndeficit problem. \n\n[[Page S 17490]]\n\n  I intend to oppose any budget which increases total spending above \nthe level we set out in our budget.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from North \nDakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield to the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Exon, who is seeking to make a statement.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from North Dakota. I just \nwant to add my voice of thanks for the true bipartisan effort that was \nmade, especially over the last 2 days, certainly under the effective \nleadership of Senator Daschle, on this side, and Senator Dole on the \nother, in cooperation with my friend and colleague, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Domenici, the excellent staffs on both sides, \nBill Hoagland on the Republican side and Bill Dauster over on our side, \nand all associated therewith. We came to many points on the cliff when \nI was not sure we were ever going to jump across, but we did on many, \nmany occasions.\n  I am very pleased with the fact that, as Senator Domenici just said, \nit was a bipartisan effort. We were not trying to make political \npoints, we were trying to reach an agreement to balance the budget in 7 \nyears that this Senator has stood for for a long, long time and \naccommodate as many as we could.\n  The main thing, of course, is that finally, as I have been suggesting \nfor the last few days, what we did was have a breakthrough today, \nfinally, by extending the argument, if you will, to December 15. That \nmeans that everybody can go back to work, if we can get this passed in \nboth the House and the Senate this evening, and the Government can \nreturn to full functioning by tomorrow morning. This has not been easy, \nbut it has been rewarding, once again, that after a lot of effort and \nunderstanding among friends who sometimes have different views on how \nwe get from point A to point B, we do get together and accomplish what \nwe want to do.\n\n  Mr. President, I simply say and emphasize that while this is a good \nagreement, it really requires a lot of heavy lifting between now and \nthe 15th day of December, because we have all of these contentious \nareas remaining with regard to how we do meet the 7-year balanced \nbudget goal and the different parts of the budget and how we allocate \nthe funds are going to be contentious.\n  I just hope that the bipartisan spirit that brought this short-term \nagreement together can be carried on to a considerable degree with the \nheavy lifting that we have yet to do.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/19/senate-section/article/S17487-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following joint resolution was ordered placed on the calendar on \nNovember 18, 1995:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to redesignate the Black Canyon of the Gunnison \nNational Monument as a national park, to establish the Gunnison Gorge \nNational Conservation Area, to establish the Curecanti National \nRecreation Area, to establish the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National \nPark Complex, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n           the black canyon national park complex act of 1996\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I introduce a piece of \nlegislation that has been a long time coming; to the State of Colorado \nand in particular, the western slope of my State, as well as to myself.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to create the Black Canyon of the \nGunnison National Park Complex. This represents, in my view, an \ninnovative approach to protecting unique natural resources for future \ngenerations in the most fiscally responsible manner possible.\n  Madam President, this legislation does far more than simply create a \nnew national park from what is now a national monument on the western \nslope of Colorado. This legislation establishes a cooperative approach \nto managing this natural resource and calls for all affected resource \nmanagement agencies in the area, to play key collaborative roles.\n  Madam President, I want to stress that equally important to what this \nlegislation does, is what it does not do: this legislation does not \nrequire additional Federal expenditures, it does not require additional \nland acquisitions, and the collective management approach that this \nlegislation creates does not in any way require, imply, or contemplate \nan attempt by the Federal Government to usurp State water rights and \nState water law.\n  The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture will \nmanage the entire area as it should be managed--as a single, \ninterrelated and inseparable unit, connected by the magnificence of the \nGunnison River itself.\n  Establishment of the complex will afford the Secretaries the \nopportunity to share both fiscal and human resources in the \nadministration and management of this unique resource. This legislation \nwill eliminate duplicative management operations and form a \ncoordinated, streamlined and fiscally responsible management structure.\n\n  Implementation of this act will cost next to nothing. It is good \nbusiness. No land acquisitions will be needed, no new areas will be \ncreated and this will not be an additional burden to the taxpayer. In \nfact, implementation of this act will save money by enabling the \nagencies to cooperate and share resources to a much greater extent than \nthe current management allows.\n  Beginning at the upper most reaches of the proposed complex, this \nlegislation will create the Curecanti National Recreation Area. This \narea has a long history of being operated by the National Park Service \nand the Bureau of Reclamation as a widely popular recreation area. The \nnew Curecanti National Recreation Area will encompass three lakes \ncreated by the three dams on the Gunnison River which form the heart of \nthe area. Together, these lakes are a recreationalist's paradise and a \nfisherman's heaven, regardless of the season.\n  Within the recreation area will be created the Curecanti \nArchaeological District. This area contains prehistoric sites dating as \nfar back as 10,000 years. These unique sites may provide dramatic \ninformation that will significantly augment our knowledge of early \nhuman occupation of the high mountain valleys in the mountains of \nColorado. New chapters will be added to what is known about \nsouthwestern archaeology.\n  This legislation will also establish the Denver and Rio Grande \nNational Historic Site at Cimarron, within the recreation area. This \nsite is a monument to the talents of the early mountain railroad \nbuilders and is a focal point to illustrate the crucial role of the \nnarrow gauge railroad in realizing the development of western Colorado \nand the entire west.\n  The Gunnison National Forest forms the other boundary of the national \npark complex. This forest offers a wide variety of recreational \nopportunities as well as incredible scenic views. Portions of the \nforest have been included within the complex and will be managed in \nconcert with the other resources in this area.\n  What is now the Gunnison National Monument lies immediately upstream \nof the recreation area. Visitors to this wonderful site describe this \nresource with adjectives such as gorgeous, awesome, and spectacular. \nEveryone who has visited this 2,000 foot deep, nearly impenetrable \ncanyon go on to say that \n\n[[Page S 17491]]\nthose words are inadequate to describe the impact of this glorious \nnational wonder. This area is clearly worthy of the designation \n``National Park,'' and all the protections and management policies that \ndesignation bring to it.\n  This legislation, when enacted, will designate the monument as the \nnewest national park in the National Park System, again with \npractically no cost to the agency or the taxpayer. Visitors will be \nable to look over the side of the sheer canyon walls, hear the roar of \nthe river, feel its strength, and view the canyon which, today, is no \ndifferent than the day thousands of years ago when the first humans \nvisiting the area failed to cross its chasm.\n  Upstream and adjacent to the new national park, the Bureau of Land \nManagement will administer and manage the Gunnison Gorge National \nConservation Area which would also be created by this act.\n  This 64,139-acre tract will be managed for the protection and visitor \nuse of the canyon. Recreational opportunities from raft trips, to \nhunting, fishing, camping, and hiking offer a wealth of opportunities \nto enjoy the natural resources at their very best. This area clearly \ndeserves increased protection for future generations, as well as for \ntoday's visitors.\n\n  The national park complex which will be created by this legislation, \ntaken in its entirety, is a world class site. Managed cooperatively as \nan interagency project, it can only improve.\n  It is important to note, Madam President, that while all Americans \nwill benefit by the creation of this national park complex, my \nconstituents living in Gunnison, Montrose, and the other nearby \ncommunities, will be impacted most. For this reason, the legislation I \nam introducing today is not a finished product and I am looking forward \nto detailed hearings to receive the advice and counsel of all \ninterested parties.\n  My subcommittee staff will immediately begin soliciting feedback on \nthis legislation, and hearings in the early spring will follow. \nFollowing those comments and hearings, my staff and I will make the \nappropriate technical changes to this legislation and will work closely \nwith leadership in the full committee, our leadership in the Senate and \nour colleagues in the House to promptly move this legislation and \npresent it to the President for his signature.\n  Throughout this process, my staff and I are eager to listen to the \nviews of all concerned and to fine-tune this legislation cooperatively \nand in good faith with all who wish to participate.\n  Finally, Madam President, I would take a moment to pay special \ntribute to three special--and new--members of my staff who have worked \nwith special drive and determination on this legislation. Ms. Rhea Suh, \nof my personal staff, Ms. Kathryn ``Kayci'' Cook, and Jim O'Toole of \nthe committee staff, have been invaluable to me in the process.\n  In previous years, I have introduced Black Canyon legislation that, \nquite simply, went nowhere. It was written in an attempt to be all \nthings to all people and that, unfortunately, resulted in nothing more \nthan printed chaos.\n  In the 104th Congress, we threw away all the old concepts and \nstarted, quite literally, from ground zero. It was only with the fresh, \nenergetic, and creative minds of these fine professionals that, \ntogether, we were able to come up with an entirely new concept. This \nconcept which I am introducing today, presents our Nation with the \nopportunity to provide the greatest protection of a unique resource \nthrough the least amount of bureaucracy and expenditure. Now, finally \nafter all these years, I am introducing legislation which I am \nconfident will meet with broad support and which will, finally, become \nthe law of the land.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1424\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, this is good news tonight. The impasse has \nbeen broken. It is certainly good news for the country, and good news \nfor the hundreds of thousands of Federal workers who have been \nfurloughed and who have been wondering if this Thanksgiving would be a \nhappy one for their families. It is good news for citizens around the \ncountry who are wanting to have their Government back in action.\n  Mr. President, now that we have achieved this breakthrough tonight, \nin what was really an initial skirmish on a much larger issue about how \nwe bring balance to the budget, and how we bring the fiscal affairs of \nthis country into balance, I think now, perhaps, is the time to start \nlooking ahead at how we could achieve the greater agreement, how we \ncould balance the budget in a unified way over the next 7 years, and \nhow we could do it within the constraints of this agreement.\n  I say to my colleagues that there are a number of ways that we could \nhave a breakthrough on the larger debate that is underway. I urge my \ncolleagues to look at CBO and OMB economic forecasts as one way out of \nthe morass that we are headed into with respect to a long-term \nagreement.\n  Mr. President, we could settle this dispute, balance the budget on a \nunified basis by 2002, but do it in a balanced way, in a way that was \nfair to all interested parties. Just so my colleagues have something to \nthink about over the week break that we are about to have, I am going \nto put in the Record one possible compromise. I stress that it is a \ncompromise, because this is not a proposal that will find favor among \nevery Democrat, it is not a proposal that will find favor among every \nRepublican; but I think we have to remember that a Democrat controls \nthe White House, the Republicans control the Congress, and the \nPresident can maintain a veto with the number of Democrats that are in \nthe House and in the Senate.\n  So, ultimately, we are going to have to compromise between what the \nRepublicans want to do and what the Democrats want to do. Both sides \nare moving from principle, both sides have strong views about what is \nin the best interest of the country. Ultimately, neither one is going \nto get everything they want. We are going to have to compromise. It \nwill be a principled compromise when it is finally made, but I urge my \ncolleagues to take a look at what I am going to outline this evening, \nas they take this break for Thanksgiving and see if it is not at \nleast an outline of what we can achieve if we worked in good faith and \nsat down together and reasoned out a final agreement.\n\n  Mr. President, first of all, you take the 7-year goal. I think the \nvast majority of Members of Congress agree that 7 years is an \nappropriate goal to bring balance to the unified budget of the United \nStates. I want to stress that that is not the end of the job, because \nto achieve real balance, we are going to have to balance without using \nSocial Security trust fund surpluses. But the first step is to achieve \nunified balance, and to do that in 7 years is a good goal.\n  One of the great disputes we have had is whether we ought to use CBO \neconomic forecasts or the OMB economic forecasts. I think a lot of \npeople get lost and say: What is CBO? What is OMB? Simply, for those \nwho are listening, CBO is the Congressional Budget Office; OMB is the \nOffice of Management and Budget. The Office of Management and Budget is \ncontrolled by the President; the Congressional Budget Office is \ncontrolled by the two Houses of Congress. They have two different \nscenarios for what the economic growth is going to be in this country \nover the next 7 years. CBO says 2.3 percent; OMB says 2.5 percent. \nInterestingly enough, over the last 20 years, economic growth has \naveraged 2.5 percent. Interestingly enough, the Wall Street Journal, \nlast week, endorsed the President's economic assumptions. But they said \nthat both of them are too pessimistic.\n  Well, what would happen if we just compromised between the OMB and \nCBO economic forecast? That would provide an additional $225 billion \nthat we could distribute over the next 7 years, if we used the OMB \neconomic forecast. Again, the Wall Street Journal says it is too \npessimistic. If we did that and we went down the large categories of \nspending that we have to decide on, if we are going to achieve a \nbalanced budget on a unified basis by 2002, one can see the possibility \nof a compromise that would look something like this: In the Republican \nbill, in domestic discretionary spending, they have achieved savings or \ncuts, if you will, of $440 billion over the next 7 years.\n  In a potential compromise, we might have a hard freeze, and just \nfreeze domestic discretionary spending for 7 years--freeze it. That \nwould save $289 billion. We have had intense debates on this floor \nabout Medicare. In the Republican proposal they have saved $270 billion \nout of Medicare. On a compromise that would balance on a unified basis \nin 7 years, we could have a savings of $140 billion. That would \npreserve and protect Medicaid. It would strengthen the program, and it \nwould do what the trustees say is necessary. But it would not threaten \nto close rural hospitals in the same degree as the Republican plan. It \nwould not put the same burden on beneficiaries as the Republican plan.\n\n  I suggested to my colleagues a potential compromise. On Medicaid, the \nRepublican plan calls for $163 billion of savings, or cuts, if you \nwill, over the next 7 years. A compromise might follow more closely the \ncommonsense plan introduced by conservative Democrats in the House and \nSenate, an $80 billion savings out of Medicaid.\n  On agriculture, the Republican plan is to cut $12 billion. Here it is \nnot restricting the rate of growth. Here it is a real cut--no question \nabout it. It is $12 billion less in agriculture. An alternative would \nbe the President's number of $4 billion.\n  Mr. President, the Republican plan goes too far. It goes too far. \nThey eliminate the authorization for an agriculture program that has \nbeen in the law since 1938. They eliminate it. I think everybody \nrecognizes agriculture needs some changes, but we should not be \neliminating the farm program in this country. We certainly should not, \nwhen our competitors are already spending three or four times as much \nas we are on agriculture, and just waiting for us to wave the white \nflag of surrender. That does not make sense.\n  So I submit to my colleagues that perhaps a $4 billion reduction \ncould be part of a final package that achieves balance on a unified \nbasis by the year 2002. \n\n[[Page S 17497]]\n\n  Student loans. The Republican package calls for a $5 billion \nreduction. Mr. President, this is one area where I think most Members \non our side--certainly, I think every Member on our side--would say we \nshould not cut student loans by a nickel. That is not good for the \nfuture of America, to restrict people's ability to go to college. So \nlet us eliminate that one area of cuts--the $5 billion that is in the \nRepublican plan.\n  Welfare reform. The Republican plan has $107 billion.\n  An alternative would be a number, about $47 billion, again, close to \nwhat was in the commonsense plan offered by conservative Democrats in \nthe House and the Senate.\n  I say to my colleagues, this difference is important because if we \nare serious about our rhetoric, if we really want people to go to work \nand not be on welfare rolls, we have to understand that will cost some \nmoney.\n  The Republican Governor of Wisconsin has reminded people if you \nreally want to put people back to work, you have to have the child care \nthat will allow them to go back to work. We know that means a savings \nof less than what is in the Republican plan.\n  In addition, in the Republican plan, they dramatically reduce the \nearned income tax credit. Ronald Reagan said the earned income tax \ncredit was the best profamily, prowork program that ever came out of \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I do not think we want to be cutting the earned income \ntax credit that will actually mean a tax increase for some 7 million \nfamilies in America. We should not be increasing their taxes.\n  On veterans, the Republican plan calls for $7 billion of savings; the \nalternative, $5 billion.\n  Now, some people are beginning to wonder, where do you get this extra \nmoney? First of all, remember, we have adopted a compromise between the \neconomic assumptions of CBO and OMB. When we do that, we have $225 \nbillion of additional resources that can be used over the next 7 years.\n  I want to swiftly point out that every forecaster in the private \nsector has suggested that OMB is actually quite conservative with their \neconomic forecasts. Most of the private-sector forecasts are more \noptimistic than either OMB or CBO.\n  Another way we get additional resources is by an adjustment in the \nConsumer Price Index. The Consumer Price Index is used to adjust Social \nSecurity payments. It is used to index the income tax system. The whole \nidea of the Consumer Price Index and using it has been that we are \nadjusting to the cost of living.\n  The experts are now telling us that the Consumer Price Index \noveradjusts for the cost of living. It is making too big an adjustment. \nIn fact, we just had a commission that reported to the Finance \nCommittee and said that we are overcorrecting from 0.7 of 1 percent to \n2 percent a year in the Consumer Price Index.\n  If we would adopt just a half-a-point correction, 0.5 correction in \nthe Consumer Price Index, that would save $139 billion over the next 7 \nyears.\n  Other mandatory spending, the Republican plan, $16 billion of \nsavings; this alternative that we propose, $58 billion.\n  Then we go to revenues. Loophole closures: In the Republican \nconference report they call for $18 billion of loophole closures. In \nthe alternative, we double that and call for $37 billion in loophole \nclosures.\n  I might just say to my colleagues, the biggest pot of money that we \nhave are the tax entitlements. We have heard a lot of talk about \nreducing the spending entitlements--Medicare, Medicaid, a lot of talk \nthat they are growing too fast. Indeed, they are. So we achieve savings \nin the spending entitlements of Medicare and Medicaid.\n  The tax entitlements are the biggest pot of money of all. We are \ngoing to have $4 trillion of tax entitlements over the next 7 years, \ncompared to $3 trillion spent on Social Security, about $2 trillion \nspent on Medicare. So the biggest pot of money of all is the tax \nentitlements.\n\n  We could achieve $39 billion of savings out of a pool of $4 trillion \nwithout any heavy lifting around here. It ought to be done.\n  Mr. President, the Republican plan calls for $245 billion of \nadditional tax preferences--tax cuts. Very frankly, a compromise would \nrequire something less than that. There are many of us that do not see \nthe wisdom of reducing revenue when we are adding $1.8 trillion to the \nnational debt that already stands at $5 trillion.\n  Why are we cutting taxes when we already have a debt of $5 trillion \nand we are adding $1.8 trillion to it over the next 7 years?\n  We will have to borrow every penny of that tax cut. So compromise \nmight be to reduce that proposed tax cut in the Republican plan from \n$245 to $131 billion.\n  Then we get to the so-called fiscal dividends. In the Republican \nplan, the CBO says they get a fiscal dividend of $170 billion. Fiscal \ndividend, Mr. President, simply means that once we move toward balance, \nthe markets in this country are going to adjust. They are going to \nlower interest rates. We are going to get greater economic growth, and \nthat will produce a fiscal dividend of $170 billion. The alternative \nplan I am discussing tonight, that would be a fiscal dividend of $114 \nbillion.\n  Then, of course, because we substantially reduce the deficit under \nthe Republican plan, there would be $150 billion of debt-service \nsavings. Under this alternative plan that I am discussing tonight, the \ndebt-service savings would be $113 billion.\n  Then, of course, there is the difference in the economic assumptions \nthat I mentioned at the beginning, the bridge between the Congressional \nBudget Office economic forecast and the Office of Management and Budget \neconomic forecast. That is a difference of $225 billion.\n  The bottom line: deficit reduction in the Republican plan of $1.131 \ntrillion over the next 7 years. In the Democratic plan --I will not \nlabel it a Democratic plan because really this would be a compromise. \nThis would be a compromise between the Democratic alternatives that \nhave been offered previously, the Democratic priorities and the \nRepublican priorities. Maybe we ought to call it the American plan.\n  It would achieve deficit reduction of $1.121 trillion. It would \nachieve unified balance in the year 2002. We would have done it with \nmuch less in the way of cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, no cuts to \neducation. We would have done it with much less in the way of cuts in \nreductions to food programs and agriculture. It would still be a tax \nreduction, but would not be as big as the Republicans have been calling \nfor.\n  There would be more money for highways and bridges. There would be \nmore money for research, which I think is critical to the future of \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, I will ask that a table that outlines this potential \ncompromise be printed in the Record. I hope my colleagues and the \nstaffs of my colleagues would take a look at this over the break \nperiod, because at some point we will have to come together in the \nHouse and the Senate between the Congress and the White House. This is \nat least an outline, a suggestion, something to think about, about how \nwe could bring the two sides together and achieve something great for \nAmerica.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the table printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVE BUDGET PACKAGES               \n                       (Changes from CBO baseline)                      \n                (7-year changes; in billions of dollars)                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 Republican   Potential \n                                                 conference   compromise\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDiscretionary: Discretionary savings..........         -440         -289\nMandatory:                                                              \n    Medicare..................................         -270         -140\n    Medicaid..................................         -163          -80\n    Agriculture...............................          -12           -4\n    Student loans.............................           -5            0\n    Welfare reform (includes EITC, nutrition).         -107          -47\n    Veterans..................................           -7           -5\n    CPI.......................................          -18         -139\n    Other mandatory...........................          -16          -58\nRevenues:                                                               \n    Loophole closers..........................          -18          -37\n    Tax cuts (shown as positive number b/c                              \n     they increase the deficit)...............          245          131\nFiscal dividend...............................         -170         -114\nDebt service..................................         -150         -113\nCBO/OMB baseline bridge.......................            0         -225\n                                               -------------------------\n      Total deficit reduction.................       -1,131       -1,121\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. REID.
