Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his \ngraciousness in allowing me some time to announce the realization of \nanother component of our initiative to prevent violence against women: \nthe national domestic violence hotline. The hotline, which officially \nopened on February 24, signifies the realization of the key provision \nof the Violence Against Women Act passed by the Congress as part of the \n1994 crime bill.\n  I urge my colleagues, as we go into appropriations, to continue to \nfully fund this. The toll-free number is 1-800-799-SAFE. This will \nprovide immediate crisis assistance counseling and local shelter \nreferrals to women across the country 24 hours a day. And for women \nthat are watching right now on C-SPAN, again, I want to repeat this \nnumber: 1-800-799-SAFE. There is also a TDD number for the hearing \nimpaired: 1-800-787-3224.\n  The hotline will help to ensure that any person suffering due to \nviolence in their home will have immediate access to information and \nemergency assistance whenever they need it. This is an important part \nof our initiative to end the family violence that has such devastating \nconsequences for women, children, and families in Minnesota and \nthroughout the country.\n  Roughly 1 million women are victims of domestic violence each year, \nand battering may be the single most common cause of injury to women--\nmore common than auto accidents, muggings, or rapes by a stranger.\n  According to the FBI, one out of every two women in America will be \nbeaten at least once in the course of an intimate relationship--one out \nof every two women in America. The FBI also speculates that battering \nis the most underreported crime in the country.\n  It is estimated that the new hotline will receive close to 10,000 \ncalls a day. And for all women that are watching, again, the number is \n1-800-799-SAFE,\n\n[[Page S2144]]\n\nand the TDD number for the hearing impaired is 1-800-787-3224.\n  Mr. President, my wife, Sheila, speaks about domestic violence all \naround Minnesota. Sheila was speaking in southern Minnesota 2 days \nbefore the hotline opened. She spoke with a woman who had been living \nin New York with her abusive husband and 5-month-old child. Her husband \nhad moved to New York following their marriage, and he kept his wife \nand child very isolated there. The husband was very controlling and \nmade it impossible for his wife to socialize, make friends, or have a \njob. He checked on her all the time to make sure that she was at home \nwith their baby. In addition to beating her routinely and savagely, he \ntook out a life insurance policy on her. So she lived in constant fear \nof being killed.\n  This woman told Sheila that every time she opened the apartment door, \nshe was sure someone would be on the other side with a shotgun. Her \nhusband at one time had been out of town on a business deal. He left in \nthe afternoon and planned on returning the following morning. After he \nleft, she decided that it was her only chance to get away. Panicked and \npressed for time, she called a local hotline number but found it was \ndisconnected. She was devastated. She called the legal aid society in \nNew York City and was initially told that they could not help her.\n  Out of sheer desperation, Mr. President, she persisted with legal aid \nand was finally given a local agency phone number. Calling the local \nagency, the woman informed them that she wanted to return home to \nMinnesota. They were able to access a computer and put her in touch \nwith a battered women shelter in her hometown. She and her baby were on \na plane the next morning before her husband got home.\n\n  Mr. President, this woman was lucky. She was able to find the \ninformation she needed. But how much better it would have been if the \nhotline had been up and running to give her the information \nimmediately. Unfortunately, some women might not have the whole day to \ntrack down information.\n  I think this shows how crucial the national network like the hotline \nwill be for keeping women and children safe--even, literally, saving \ntheir lives. When a woman calls the hotline, her call will be answered \nby a counselor who can provide crisis assistance and who can also \naccess a nationwide data base and provide the caller with up-to-date \ninformation about shelters and other services in her community. If the \ncaller wishes, the hotline counselor can even transfer her call to a \nlocal counselor.\n  Because the hotline is toll-free, women can call in complete privacy, \nnever having to fear a long-distance number will appear on their \ntelephone bill and, therefore, alert an abusive partner. Help is also \navailable in Spanish and other languages.\n  I hope that the new national domestic violence hotline will help \nwomen and families find the support, the assistance, and the services \nthey need to get out of homes where there is violence and abuse.\n  In addition to establishing networks between counselors, shelter \nworkers, law enforcement officers, and service providers, the hotline \nwill help make sure that anyone who is not safe in their home has \naccess to their services.\n  Mr. President, once again, the toll free number from the floor of the \nU.S. Senate is 1-800-799-SAFE, and for those that are hearing impaired, \nthe number is 1-800-787-3224.\n  What I wish to do with the indulgence of my colleagues is for the \nnext several weeks come to the floor of the Senate at least once a day \nwhen I can find the time--and I will find the time because this is a \npriority--to read this number. It is important that as many women and \nas many children and as many families as possible understand this new \ninitiative. It is very important to making sure that women and children \nhave the protection they needed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I ask unanimous consent I may proceed for 10 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Mr. President, for the past several years, we have been \ntrying to pass legislation to fix the Superfund toxic waste cleanup \nprogram. Superfund is a program with a tortured history and certainly \nan uneven record of success that can only be described as truly uneven. \nWe have accomplished some good things since the law was passed in 1980, \nbut those accomplishments under Superfund have come at a tremendous \ncost.\n  Almost everyone agrees--and I will say, Mr. President, I do not think \nanyone disagrees--that Congress should enact a Superfund reform bill as \nsoon as possible. Even President Clinton said recently that ``we have \nto repair the Superfund toxic waste cleanup program.''\n  I agree with the President about the need to fix Superfund. \nUnfortunately, in the speech that the President delivered last Monday, \nMarch 11, in New Jersey, he went on to attack the Superfund \nreauthorization process now underway in Congress. Using the old worn \nout rhetoric about ``making polluters pay,'' the President \nmischaracterized the proposals on which we are now working.\n  I believe it is just plain wrong to imply that the Superfund \nliability reform proposals we are considering would shift costs from \nthe polluters to the taxpayers. That is the theme that is being \nsounded. The pending proposals we are considering in the Environment \nand Public Works Committee would do no such thing. What we seek to do \nin the committee is to use money that comes from the three Superfund \ntaxes which are levied on the chemical industry, the oil industry, and \nmanufacturing corporations, and use the money, which does not come from \nthe ordinary taxpayer; it comes through those three entities: chemical \nindustry, oil industry, and manufacturing corporations, for the \ncleanup. This is the money that is collected for cleanup. It is paid \ninto a Superfund trust fund for the suspected polluting class.\n\n  That is the source of revenues to fund liability reform. No one is \ntrying to shift the cost of cleanup to our constituents. Unless one is \nalready paying any of the three Superfund taxes, there is no need to \nworry about being made to pay for Superfund. There is no talk about \nletting polluters off the hook and making taxpayers pay. The \nPresident's advisers know this so why do they continue to misinform him \nabout our plans? The President's invocation of the tired old ``polluter \npays'' rhetoric does not help us get the job done. Maybe some focus \ngroup somewhere has told the President's advisers that this is a \nwinning issue for the administration, but the rhetoric does nothing to \nadvance the Superfund policy debate.\n  Under Superfund, anyone can be tarred with the polluter stigma. If \nyou disposed of something--think of this--legally and in accordance \nwith the best practices of the day in the 1970's or the 1960's or the \n1950's or even earlier, you can still be held liable under the \nSuperfund law and be called a polluter. You can be held liable for a \nlaw that passed way after the so-called pollution was done.\n  On Monday, the President suggested that Congress should ``help small \nbusiness and communities trapped in the liability net.'' In other \nwords, the President said help those communities that dispose of these \npolluting substances before the enactment of Superfund. Let them off \nthe hook. I agree with the President, but how can he ask us to let one \nor two groups of polluters off the hook and then complain that we are \ndoing something wrong when we try to help others who may be trapped in \nthe same liability net? I suppose the logic is that if you are small \nand a public entity--a public entity being a county or a town or city \nor municipality--and you are liable under Superfund, somehow that is \nnot pollution. If you let that person off but you are something else, \npresumably if you are a larger business and you are a polluter, you \ncannot let that person off. This, it seems to me, is Superfund logic at \nits worst. It may be good politics, but it is irresponsible in the \nmiddle of a serious policy debate.\n  The timing of the President's remarks was also disappointing. We are\n\n[[Page S2145]]\n\nin the middle, as I say, of a serious policy debate about Superfund in \nthe community. In 1993 and 1994, the Democratic administration with a \nDemocratic House and a Democratic Senate had 2 years to put together \nand move its own Superfund bill. They came forward with a bill, and \nthat excused or limited the liability of big and small polluters in a \nnumber of ways. Whatever the merits of the bill, Mr. President--and I \nvoted for it in committee--it failed to pass either branch of the then \nDemocratically controlled House and Democratically controlled Senate. \nTherefore, you had at that time a Democratic President, a Democratic \nHouse, and a Democratic Senate and they could not make reforms in \nSuperfund, showing how difficult this problem is.\n  Now, in our committee, Senator Smith has taken the lead and put \nforward a bill some 8 months after we took over the Congress, that is, \nthe Republicans. Since introduction of that legislation in the \nsubcommittee, Senator Smith and others have met with the administration \nfor countless hours to explain the bill, to make technical changes, and \nto clarify its intent where needed. We are in the middle of bipartisan \nnegotiations. We are striving to understand the administration's \nconcern with the bill and to accommodate it wherever possible. We are \nwaiting for more information from the administration on cost concerns \nthe administration has raised and the impact of these changes, how they \naffect the agency, for example, and its resources.\n\n  In short, the administration has a serious forum in the Environment \nand Public Works Committee where we are meeting every day to exchange \nviews on Superfund. This is why I find it curious and disappointing \nthat the administration would choose this particular time to launch a \nfactually inaccurate and politically contrived attack on the \nnegotiation process and product.\n  I have counseled colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the \ncommittee that I am fortunate enough to chair that we must have a \nbipartisan approach if we are going to solve these complex \nenvironmental problems. I believe Superfund could be a model for how we \ncan reach agreement on a sensitive problem in this year, a difficult \nyear because of the political implications of the Presidential \ncampaign. I believe Superfund could be a model for how we reach \nagreement on these difficult matters. I fail to understand how the \nPresident's advisers on environmental issues, who surely understand \nthat Superfund proposals cannot be reduced to simple solutions and \nslogans such as ``polluters must pay,'' can engage with us in serious \nnegotiations while on the other hand they seek partisan advantage based \non distortions.\n  Mr. President, it is time for the administration to choose. Does it \nwant Superfund this year or is it willing to miss this chance and \npermit Superfund to continue to exact its hideous toll on our economy? \nIf we are going to fix Superfund, the administration must tone down its \nrhetoric and work with us to fix this badly broken program.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to indicate how disappointed I was \nlast evening that we were unable to take up the resolution on Taiwan \nand the Taiwan Straits. We had prepared a sense-of-the-Congress \nresolution early in the week, had distributed it and talked to many. It \nwas agreed to by the administration. It was also sponsored by the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and the ranking member. In \nany event, the upshot was that its introduction was objected to on the \nminority side, I think largely by the staff, and therefore we did not \ndo it. We do intend, however, to come back and do that next week.\n  Mr. President, as all of my colleagues know, over the last 8 months \nthe People's Republic of China has held an increasing number of missile \ntests and military exercises.\n  Last year, starting in July, there were 21 to 26 missile tests; in \nJuly and August, troop movements in provinces bordering Taiwan. The \npurpose of these tests has obviously been to intimidate the Taiwanese. \nThey have been accompanied by denunciations of President Li. They have \nbeen timed to coincide, of course, with the election that takes place \nthere.\n  Now, unfortunately, the People's Republic of China has escalated the \nsituation with these new tests, tests that are the closest ever to the \nmain island and purposely, of course, timed to affect the election \nwhich will take place later this month. They have also been close to \nTaiwan's two ports, and that has been very worrisome. These are \nreckless, I think, and greatly disturbing to most people in this \ncountry.\n  We have a strong interest in the peaceful settlement of the Taiwan \nquestion. That interest of ours is central to the three communiques and \nthe People's Republic of China joint communiques that we have entered \ninto over the years, as well as the Taiwan Relations Act, which is to \nprovide stability in that part of the world and which provides for a \none-China policy and which provides for a peaceful movement toward that \none-China policy.\n  I firmly believe we need to reexamine our relationship with China. I \nthink we have to narrow the number of issues in which we become \ninvolved and not seek to run their country. But when we do have \nagreements, then we have to make sure that they are adhered to by both \nthe Chinese and ourselves. Our relationship currently is filled with \nitems that have not been consistent with these agreements--the \nintellectual property agreements, the nuclear proliferation in Pakistan \nand Iraq.\n  So, Mr. President, it is necessary that we do state our position; \nthat we do insist on a peaceful direction and resolution of this issue; \nthat we do clarify our one-China policy; that we do congratulate the \nTaiwanese in their movement toward democracy and open markets and urge \nthat same open market approach take place in China.\n  So I commend the Taiwanese, their government, for reacting calmly to \nthese provocations. They, I think, have shown considerable restraint, \nand I congratulate them on their long march toward democracy. I hope \nthat continues during the election next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/15/senate-section/article/S2145-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2145-S2147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NATIONAL GOVERNORS' ASSOCIATION WELFARE AND MEDICAID PROPOSALS\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, 3 months ago President Clinton vetoed the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995. The failure to balance the Federal budget \ncontinues to hang like a dark cloud over American families and \nbusinesses. The heavy yoke of Federal budget deficits still threaten to \nchoke off economic growth and future prosperity. Moreover, by vetoing \nthis legislation, the President also preserved a welfare system which \ntraps millions of children into a cycle of dependency.\n  A few weeks after the balanced budget veto, President Clinton stopped \nwelfare reform again by vetoing H.R. 4, the Personal Responsibility and \nWork Opportunity Act of 1995. However, the President also pledged that, \n``I am nevertheless determined to keep working with the Congress to \nenact real, bipartisan welfare reform.''\n  Mr. President, 1 month ago the men and women who serve as the chief \nexecutives of our 50 States presented the President, the Congress, and \nthe American people with bold new proposals to restructure Medicaid and \nreform the welfare system. Gathering from across the country, the \nGovernors set aside their own differences and found the common ground \nand bipartisan consensus which have been missing in Washington. The \nGovernors have presented us with a fresh opportunity to bridge the \ndifferences which divide the Congress and the President.\n  The Committee on Finance has recently completed a series of hearings \non the National Governors' Association proposals. On February 22, six \nGovernors, four Democrats and two Republicans, urged the Congress to \nquickly pass both welfare and Medicaid reforms. We heard from Governors \nCarper, Chiles, Engler, Miller of Nevada,\n\n[[Page S2146]]\n\nRomer, and Thompson--who along with Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah--created \nthe welfare and Medicaid proposals at a time when few believed such a \ntask would be possible.\n  It would have been easy for these Governors to allow politics and \nindividual interests to divide them. Instead, they put their \nreputations on the line when it would have been safe to simply leave \nthe task for someone else. This was an effort that was built on a \ngenuine search for common ground and bipartisanship.\n  Indeed, the proposals were adopted unanimously with the support of \nthe most conservative and most liberal Governors and everybody in \nbetween.\n  The Finance Committee heard additional testimony from the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services and two panels of experts on the \nGovernors' proposals. Let me briefly summarize and highlight some of \nthe most important provisions of the NGA proposal.\n  In welfare reform, the Governors agreed to build upon H.R. 4 which \nPresident Clinton vetoed, but they have responded favorably to many of \nthe President's requests. The President called for additional child \ncare funds. The Governors ask for $4 billion more in child care funds. \nThe President insists he supports time limits on welfare benefits and \nthe Governors agree.\n  The President called for protecting States in the event of an \neconomic downturn, so the Governors propose another $1 billion for the \ncontingency fund.\n  The President objected to certain Federal mandates and the Governors \nagree. The President and the Governors also agree on the concept of \nperformance bonuses to reward States for moving families from welfare \nto work.\n  In ``Restructuring Medicaid,'' the Governors responded to many of the \nPresident's concerns outlined in his veto of the Balanced Budget Act. \nPerhaps most important, States would guarantee Medicaid coverage to \nnearly every current Medicaid recipient. The current mandatory services \nwould all be guaranteed. The Governors increased funding for persons \nwith disabilities. The Governors agreed to continue current nursing \nhome laws and regulations.\n  These are all significant compromises for the Governors to make. \nThese changes demonstrate that the Governors are firmly committed to \nthis bipartisan effort.\n  In a speech to the National Conference of State Legislatures last \nJuly, President Clinton expressed doubts about whether block grants for \nMedicaid and food stamps would keep pace with changing economic \nconditions. Once again, the Governors responded to the President's \nconcerns. Governor Romer has described the NGA Medicaid proposal as a \n``true combination of a per capita cap and a block grant.'' Under the \nGovernors' proposal, each State would receive a base allocation of \nfunds. In addition, there would be a supplemental insurance umbrella to \nprovide funding for unanticipated growth in the program.\n  In light of all of these changes, one might objectively expect an \nenthusiastic endorsement of the NGA proposals from the administration. \nThe proposals moved significantly to the President's positions. They \nwere constructed with the help of Democratic Governors, some who served \nwith President Clinton in the National Governors' Association when he \nwas a Governor.\n  To be candid, the administration's response to the Governors' \nproposal has been profoundly disappointing. Even with all of the \nmodifications offered in the Governors' proposals, Secretary Shalala \ntestified the administration opposes the NGA proposal in its present \nform. It is apparent that while the administration talks about \ncomprehensive reform, it, in fact, prefers the status quo.\n  At this year's State of the Union Address, President Clinton told the \nCongress and the American people that, ``the era of big government is \nover.'' I guess the folks at HHS did not get the message.\n  In describing the current welfare system, the Governors and the \nadministration would seem to be talking about two different worlds. The \ncurrent welfare system is a masterpiece of mediocrity at best. But time \nand again, the administration talks about protecting children as if the \ncurrent system were good for children. In contrast, the Governors have \ntold Congress that the current welfare policies ``punish parents who \nwork too much, they punish mothers and fathers that want to stay \ntogether, they punish working families who save money, and they reward \nteenagers who have babies out of wedlock.'' This is not a legacy to \nleave for our children.\n  The family is the cell of society and Washington has proven it does \nnot know how to build strong families, only bureaucracies. And now the \nbureaucracy threatens to stop bipartisan welfare reform.\n  The Governors are looking forward while the Federal bureaucracy \nclings to the past. While the administration talks about a commitment \nto the present system, Governor Thompson talks about being trapped in a \nfailed system. The bureaucracy would have us believe that States are \npoised to callously reduce health care coverage for the poor. In \ncontrast, Governor Thompson believes he would be able to expand health \ncoverage to an additional 30,000 children who are not covered today if \nreforms are made. He would add hospital coverage for 32,000 indigent \nadults.\n  While the Governors tell us that immediate action is necessary, the \nadministration wants to appoint a commission to study the current \nMedicaid formula.\n  While Democratic and Republican Governors alike sharply criticize the \ncurrent waiver process and the heavy hand of the Health Care Financing \nAdministration, Secretary Shalala defends keeping the power in the \nhands of the Federal bureaucracy. The very idea that the Federal \nGovernment must protect children and the elderly from the Governors and \nState legislatures is not only wrong. It is insulting.\n  President Clinton had it exactly right when he told the National \nConference of State Legislatures last July that ``we couldn't have done \nall this without a strong commitment to changing the way the government \ndoes the people's business here in Washington, because the old federal \nways and the old federal bureaucracy were not going to permit the kind \nof changes we have to make to get to the 21st century.''\n  How prophetic and how ironic. The old Federal ways and the old \nFederal bureaucracy are alive and well and are now standing in the way \nof authentic welfare reform. How predictable but disappointing.\n  Well, Mr. President, the Chief Executive cannot escape the blame for \nthis result.\n  President Clinton went on to say that, ``reinventing government means \nreinventing the way the Federal Government does business with you as \nwell. We have worked very hard to forge a genuine partnership between \nthe States and the National Government.''\n\n  Mr. President, at the current rate of spending, the welfare system is \ndriving both partners into bankruptcy. Who then will be left to serve \nthe needy?\n  Over the next 7 years, the Federal, State, and local governments will \nspend more than $2.4 trillion on the current welfare and Medicaid \nprograms. That is equal to all State and local government expenditures \nbetween 1992 and 1994. In 1994, for $2.4 trillion, you could have \npurchased:\n  Every farm, including the value of all land and buildings in the \nUnited States;\n  All livestock;\n  Every new house sold in the United States;\n  All household equipment sold in the United States, including all \nfurniture, every television, all dishes, every kitchen appliance, and \nhome computer;\n  Every piece of clothing and all shoes sold;\n  All nonresidential buildings, that is, every office building, \nhospital, and school purchased in 1994.\n  All nonresidential information processing equipment including all \noffice computers and photocopying equipment.\n  These are some of the things you could have bought in 1994 and there \nwould still have been enough money to fund the entire Medicaid Program \nin 1994. It is simply outrageous for the administration to scare the \nAmerican people about slowing the rate of growth in these programs.\n  We need to talk about what happens if we do nothing. The plain fact \nremains that if we do nothing to the current welfare system, more \nchildren will\n\n[[Page S2147]]\n\nbe on welfare in the coming years. It is time the administration \nstopped hiding behind children.\n  the NGA proposals have sparked an important debate not only about the \nfuture of these programs, but the future of the relationship between \nthe States and the Federal Government as well. Despite Secretary \nShalala's opposition to every fundamental change to the current welfare \nsystem, we should move forward on the Governors' welfare and Medicaid \nproposals. It is time to dispell the false choices conjured up by the \nbureaucracy and give the States the opportunity to change the future.\n  Mr. President, 37 months ago, President Clinton promised the Nation's \nGovernors that he would work with them to ``remove the incentive for \nstaying in poverty.'' He told the Governors that ``many people stay on \nwelfare not because of the checks * * * they do it solely because they \ndo not want to put their children at risk of losing health care or \nbecause they do not have the money to pay for child care * * *.''\n  As President Clinton has indicated, Medicaid must be part of the \nsolution for returning families to work. Separating Medicaid from the \nrest of the welfare reform package simply will not work. Medicaid \nreform is welfare reform. If the President genuinely wants bipartisan \nwelfare reform, his administration cannot pitch the NGA proposal out as \njust so much straw.\n  At that NGA meeting 3 years ago, President Clinton also told the \nGovernors that the American people ``don't want our process divided by \npartisanship or dominated by special interest, or driven by short-term \nadvantage.''\n  Mr. President, the Governors have given us the opportunity to meet \nthis expectation. it is my hope that the President will join with us \nand embrace this opportunity.\n  If the administration rejects this last best chance for \nbipartisanship in the next few weeks and welfare reform fails for a \nthird time, the American people should clearly understand that \nGovernors they elected were defeated by the Federal bureaucracy and the \nspecial interests it serves. The American people should then judge the \nadministration not by its words but by its deeds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/15/senate-section/article/S2145-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE RUSSIAN POULTRY DISPUTE\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about recent \ndevelopments in the United States-Russian trade relationship. In \nFebruary, Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin announced a ban effective \ntomorrow--March 16--against imports of American-produced poultry to \nprotect Russian farmers. This proposed ban is of great concern to \nAmerican agriculture and, if imposed, would be a terrible blow to the \nAmerican poultry industry.\n  Our poultry sales to Russia have been one of our great exporting \nsuccess stories. In 5 short years, Russia has become the largest \nforeign market for United States-produced chicken and turkey--worth \nover $500 million a year The tremendous growth in popularity of \nAmerican poultry with Russian consumers is due, in no small part, to \nits recognized quality and reasonable price.\n  On March first, I sent a letter and spoke to our trade \nrepresentative, Mickey Kantor, expressing my concerns over the proposed \nRussian ban and Moscow's increasing protectionism against foreign \nimports. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 1, 1996.\n     Hon. Michael Kantor,\n     U.S. Trade Representative, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Ambassador: I am writing in reference to our two \n     conversations on the Russian Government's recent ban on \n     imports of United States-produced poultry. Apparently, this \n     ban is part of a broader projectionist plan by the Russian \n     Government to block agricultural imports into Russia. As I \n     told you, these actions will severely hurt the U.S. poultry \n     and agribusiness industries.\n       If the Russian Government does not act swiftly to end the \n     ban on poultry imports, I strongly urge the Administration to \n     take forceful retaliatory measures. Immediate action should \n     include: Trade retaliation under Section 301 against imports \n     of Russian products--in particular on imports of aluminum and \n     other ferrous and non-ferrous metals.\n       An across-the-board freeze on Export-Import Bank loans and \n     credits to Russia, including the recently approved $1 billion \n     assistance package for the Russian aircraft industry.\n       Suspension of U.S. assistance programs to Russia, including \n     those from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the United \n     States Agency for International Development, which focus on \n     assisting the global competitiveness of the Russian economy.\n       Should these measures not result in a satisfactory response \n     from Moscow, the Administration should also reconsider its \n     support for the International Monetary fund's recently \n     concluded $10 billion economic-assistance package for Russia.\n       Let me reiterate that I am particularly shocked by these \n     protectionist actions by the Russian Government, given the \n     generous assistance the U.S. has provided in helping Russia \n     to enter the global economy.\n       I greatly appreciate your support on this issue, which is \n     of utmost importance to the U.S. poultry and agribusiness \n     industries.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              William V. Roth, Jr.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Shortly after I sent that letter, Russian Prime Minister \nChernomyrdin told Vice President Gore that the ban was off and that \nAmerican poultry exports to Russia could continue uninterrupted. Based \non press reports, I understand Russia's chief veterinarian still \nthreatens to block imports of United States poultry.\n  Mr. President, due to these conflicting signals from Moscow, it is \nunclear what action the Russian Government will take. I hope that Prime \nMinister Chernomyrdin is good on his word. We will have to see what the \nRussians do after tomorrow.\n  However, if the ban is imposed, I strongly urge the administration to \ntake the forceful and immediate responses I outlined in my letter to \nAmbassador Kantor--including retaliation against Russian imports into \nthe United States, a freeze on Export-Import Bank loans and credits, \nand suspension of American foreign assistance programs to Russia.\n  If these measures should prove to be insufficient, then I would urge \nthe administration to reconsider United States support for a $10 \nbillion assistance package the International Monetary Fund has promised \nRussia.\n  Mr. President, if we do not send a strong message to the Russians, it \nwill only encourage them to take further protectionist measures that \nwill only hurt United States exporters, Russian consumers, and Russia's \neconomic development as a full partner in the world economy.\n  Russia's apparent swing to protectionism is particularly disturbing \ngiven the high level of American aid to Russia. Since the end of the \ncold war, the United States has given over $1.5 billion in foreign \nassistance to Russia, not including several billion dollars we have \nprovided to promote Russian trade. In light of U.S. generosity, \nMoscow's protectionist bent against American products is simply \nastonishing.\n  I trust that the Russian Prime Minister's word will be good, the \npoultry ban will not go into effect, and that Russia's commitment to \nfree trade will not weaken, but will grow stronger.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/15/senate-section/article/S2147-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2147-S2148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           JOHN P. CAPELLUPO\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise at this time to recognize a fellow \ncitizen for the achievements and contributions he has made to this \nNation and industry in which he has worked for three decades.\n  John P. Capellupo, president of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace, will \nstep down from his position and retire from this leading U.S. producer \nof military aircraft on March 31.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on \nDefense, I am intimately aware of the contributions that John Capellupo \nhas made to aerospace and the national security of the United States.\n  Mr. Capellupo, or Cap as he is widely known, began his aerospace \ncareer in 1957 working as a technical analyst on the F-101B aircraft \nand super Talos missile programs at what was then the McDonnell \nAircraft Co. in St. Louis. He rose steadily through the engineering \nranks, into program management, and ultimately, to the company's \nhighest leadership positions. In February 1989, he was named president \nof McDonnell Douglas Missile Systems Co. In January 1990, he left St. \nLouis for Long Beach, CA, to become deputy president of Douglas \nAircraft, the company's commercial and military transport division. In \nMay 1991, he returned to St. Louis as president of what is now \nMcDonnell Douglas Aerospace.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, Mr. Capellupo served as a \ndriving force\n\n[[Page S2148]]\n\nbehind a diverse list of successful and essential military programs: \nthe AV-8B, F/A-18, T-45, C-17, Apache helicopter, and Harpoon, SLAM, \nand Tomahawk missiles. Most recently, he provided the management focus \non affordability which dramatically reduced costs on the new Joint \nDirect Attack Munitions Program.\n  Yet of all his achievements and contributions to our national \ndefense, none eclipses his work to bolster our maritime strength via \nthe F/A-18 Hornet program. He was there on day one when the idea of a \ncombination fighter and attack aircraft--a strike fighter--was no more \nthan a study project with a fancy acronym. He shepherded the program \nthrough its infancy, planned its growth and improvement, and watched it \nmature into the safest, most reliable and maintainable aircraft ever \nflown into combat by the Navy. Never one to fear following a tough act, \nMr. Capellupo later directed the studies that defined the Navy's strike \nfighter for the 21st century--the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. Under his \nleadership, and with the future of Naval aviation hanging in the \nbalance, this program has become a monument to efficient and effective \ndefense program management.\n  In my tenure in the Senate and as the Governor of Missouri, I have \nworked with thousands of business leaders and defense officials from \nacross the country and around the world. There are very few of the same \nhigh caliber as John Capellupo. His energy, integrity, enthusiasm, and \ndedication are unequaled. So, too, are his achievements on behalf of \nour military strength and national security. For this, our great Nation \nand its people thank him and wish him and his family the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/15/senate-section/article/S2147-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, on March 17, 1996, Representative and Mrs. \nBenjamin Lu of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative office \nin Washington, DC, will sponsor the Music for Democracy concert at the \nKennedy Center. It will be an occasion to celebrate Taiwan's long \njourney toward democracy.\n  The late President Chiang Ching-Kuo nurtured the seeds of democracy \non Taiwan by lifting the emergency decree, liberalizing personal \nfreedoms and legalizing opposition political parties. After Chiang's \ndeath in 1988, President Lee Teng-Hui presided over further economic \nand political liberalization, vowing to make the Republic of China a \nnation built on economic opportunity and democracy.\n  Now in 1996, Taiwan is indeed a success story with a strong, growing \neconomy and open democratic elections. Over the last 8 years, the \nPeople of the Republic of China have participated in the free election \nof the National Assembly, three elections of the Legislative Yuan, the \nelection of the Governor of Taipei Province, and mayoral elections in \nTaipei and Kaohsiung.\n  The most notable in the progression will occur on March 23 of this \nyear, when Taiwan will hold its first free and direct election of the \nPresident of the Republic of China.\n  Mr. President, there will be four presidential candidates on the \nballot, the incumbent President Lee Teng-Hui being one of the four. \nThis presidential election will answer the old question of whether \ndemocracy is possible or appropriate in a Chinese society. As the \nRepublic of China has demonstrated to the world, democracy is truly \nappropriate and possible for Taiwan, and for all countries. Democracy, \nin Taiwan's case, has been achieved without sacrificing either \npolitical stability or economic growth.\n  I have met President Lee Teng-Hui and have been impressed by his \ncommitment to democratic principles. I also understand from individuals \nassociated with President Lee and his Government, such as Professor N. \nMao, that he is a man truly dedicated to making the Republic of China a \nfirst-rate nation and its people prosperous and free.\n  Mr. President, I commend Representative and Mrs. Lu for sponsoring \nthe Music for Democracy Concert on March 17. I join the people of the \nRepublic of China on Taiwan in their celebration of democracy and \ncommend President Lee for his efforts in leading the Republic of China \ndown that road. Mr. President, I salute President Lee and his people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/15/senate-section/article/S2148-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 161\n\n  Mr. BOND.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Regulatory \n     Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) a vibrant and growing small business sector is critical \n     to creating jobs in a dynamic economy;\n       (2) small businesses bear a disproportionate share of \n     regulatory costs and burdens;\n       (3) fundamental changes that are needed in the regulatory \n     and enforcement culture of federal agencies to make agencies \n     more responsive to small business can be made without \n     compromising the statutory missions of the agencies;\n       (4) three of the top recommendations of the White House \n     Conference on Small Business involve reforms to the way \n     government regulations are developed and enforced, and \n     reductions in government paperwork requirements;\n       (5) the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act have \n     too often been ignored by government agencies, resulting in \n     greater regulatory burdens on small entities than \n     necessitated by statute; and\n       (6) small entities should be given the opportunity to seek \n     judicial review of agency actions required by the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to implement certain recommendations of the 1995 White \n     House Conference on Small Business regarding the development \n     and enforcement of Federal regulations;\n       (2) to provide for judicial review of the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act;\n       (3) to encourage the effective participation of small \n     businesses in the Federal regulatory process;\n       (4) to simplify the language of Federal regulations \n     affecting small businesses;\n       (5) to develop more accessible sources of information on \n     regulatory and reporting requirements for small businesses;\n       (6) to create a more cooperative regulatory environment \n     among agencies and small businesses that is less punitive and \n     more solution-oriented; and\n       (7) to make Federal regulators more accountable for their \n     enforcement actions by providing small entities with a \n     meaningful opportunity for redress of excessive enforcement \n     activities.\n\n     SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall become effective on the date 90 days after \n     enactment.\n             TITLE I--REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SIMPLIFICATION\n\n     SEC. 101.

COMPLIANCE GUIDES.\n\n       (a) Compliance Guide.--For each rule or group of related \n     rules for which an agency is required to prepare a final \n     regulatory flexibility analysis under section 604 of title 5, \n     United States Code, the agency shall publish one or more \n     guides to assist small entities in complying with the rule, \n     and shall designate such publications as ``small entity \n     compliance guides''. The guides shall explain the actions a \n     small entity is required to take to comply with a rule or \n     group of rules. The agency shall, in its sole discretion, \n     ensure that the guide is written using sufficiently plain \n     language to be understood by affected small entities. \n     Agencies may prepare separate guides covering groups or \n     classes of similarly affected small entities, and may \n     cooperate with associations of small entities to develop and \n     distribute such guides.\n       (b) Single Source of Information.--Agencies shall cooperate \n     to make available to small entities through a single source \n     of information, the small entity compliance guides and all \n     other available information on statutory and \n     regulatory requirements affecting small entities.\n       (c) Limitation on Judicial Review.--Except as provided by \n     this subsection, an agency's designation of a small entity \n     compliance guide shall not be subject to judicial review. In \n     any civil or administrative action against a small entity for \n     a violation occurring after the effective date of this \n     section, the content of the small business guide may be \n     considered as evidence of the reasonableness or \n     appropriateness of any proposed fines, penalties or damages.\n\n     SEC. 103.

In any \n     civil or administrative action against a small entity, \n     guidance provided by an agency to a small entity may be \n     considered as evidence of the reasonableness or \n     appropriateness of any proposed fines, penalties or damages \n     imposed on such small entity.\n       (b) Program.--Each agency shall establish a program for \n     issuing guidance in response to such inquiries no later than \n     1 year after enactment of this section, utilizing existing \n     functions and personnel of the agency to the extent \n     practicable.\n\n     SEC. 104.

The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my ranking member, Senator Bumpers, and I \nare very pleased to be able to bring to the floor this vitally \nimportant small business regulatory reform bill. I want to express at \nthe beginning my heartfelt thanks to Senator Bumpers, to his staff, and \nto the many Members on both sides of the aisle and their staffs who \nhelped us work on this measure. We will be presenting a managers' \namendment very shortly, when they complete drafting all of the good \nideas that came in.\n  We had a very good hearing on this in the Small Business Committee. \nLots of people have had good ideas. We have been able to incorporate \nmost of them. We are not able to handle all of them. But this measure \nis targeted clearly to small business.\n  As we come up on the first anniversary of the White House Conference \non Small Business, I think it is very important that we move forward. I \nappreciate the Members who have allowed us to go forward today with \nthis bill.\n  As most of my colleagues know, last June almost 2,000 delegates to \nthe White House Conference on Small Business came to Washington to vote \non an agenda of top concerns for small business. The top 60 \nrecommendations were published by the conference last September as a \nreport to the President and Congress entitled, ``Foundation for a New \nCentury.'' Three of the top recommendations in the White House \nconference call for reforms in the way that Government regulations are \ndeveloped, the way they are enforced, and reforms in Government \npaperwork requirements.\n  The common theme of all recommendations is the need to change the \nculture of Government agencies, the need to provide a responsive ear \nand a responsive attitude toward small business and small entities.\n  Let me emphasize, while we are talking about small business, many \npeople just think maybe it is the business downtown on the square or \nthe mom-and-pop operation or the small contractor, but this bill also \nincludes small entities. We have many entities of local government, \ncharitable entities, educational entities, that would be affected and \nwould be protected by the provisions in this bill.\n  We held a hearing in Atlanta, GA, on small business. We were very \ngraciously provided the facilities of Georgia Tech to hold that \nhearing. The president of Georgia Tech was kind enough to come and be \nwith us. As he and I listened to the concerns of small business, he \ntold me afterward, ``It is amazing how many of these concerns actually \naffect small colleges and universities as well.'' So, while \ntraditionally we think of the small for-profit entities, there are \nbenefits as well for nonprofits, for governmental entities, and \ncharitable organizations as well as educational entities.\n\n  One of the top recommendations of the conference of the White House \nand small business was to put teeth into the Regulatory Flexibility \nAct, to provide regulatory relief for small entities, small businesses, \nsmall towns, small school districts, small nonprofit organizations. \nBack in 1980, Congress passed what was called the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act. I suppose regulatory flexibility came from the idea \nthat Federal agencies are supposed to look at the issuance of \nregulations and make them flexible, so the impact on the small entities \ncould be made flexible enough to carry out the purpose of the \nunderlying statute under which the regulations were issued, without \nimposing unnecessary burdens on those small entities, hence the name \nregulatory flexibility. ``Be flexible,'' is what Congress told Federal \nagencies, ``in dealing with regulations impacting small entities, small \nbusinesses, and not-for-profits.''\n  There is a problem with that. Congress said we are not going to have \nany judicial enforcement of regulatory flexibility. With that, too many \nFederal agencies took that as a sign to say we are not going to pay any \nattention to it. When small businesses said, ``Have you paid attention \nto regulatory flexibility,'' they said, ``No, it did not apply.'' Even \nthe advocacy council, the Small Business Administration, has been \ntotally stiffed by many Federal agencies when it has gone before them \nand said, ``Look, we serve small business and believe there is a \nproblem. It is not a reg-flex-compliant, small-entity regulation that \nyou have issued.''\n  We had hearings before the Small Business Committee in the past year, \nwhere the SBA's chief counsel for advocacy indicated that not only was \nregulatory flexibility being ignored, but that there is a tremendous \nburden on small business in many of these regulatory directives. In \ngeneral, they say that the burden on small business is some 50 to 80 \npercent more per employee than it is for larger businesses.\n  Let me cite just one particular statistic that I found striking. In a \nmanufacturing business, a large business can calculate that all the \nFederal regulations that I think we would all agree are designed to \nachieve worthwhile purposes of worker safety, a healthy environment, \nand a whole range of issues that we work on, cost about $2.50 per hour \nper employee.\n  For every hour that is worked, the manufacturing business pays the \nemployee his or her salary, plus they have to calculate another $2.50. \nFor a small manufacturing business with 50 or fewer employees, that \ncosts $5 an hour. That means the small business starts off with a $2.50 \nan hour penalty over what the larger business has to pay. That makes \nour small businesses less competitive with larger businesses. It also \nmakes our small businesses much less competitive with overseas \ncompetitors who may not have those burdens.\n  As a result, there has been strong bipartisan support to provide for \njudicial enforcement of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The President \nhas called for it. The Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration has called for it. Leading Members on both sides of the \naisle in this body have called for it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters of support for S. 942 that come from the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, the Small Business Legislative Council, the \nNational Retail Federation, the National Association of Home Builders, \nAssociated Builders and Contractors, the National Association of Towns \nand Townships, and the National Association of Manufacturers.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 1996.\n     Hon.

The Bond-Bumpers legislation includes important \n     provisions that have been top priorities for NFIB members for \n     many years. It also includes provisions that were recommended \n     by\n\n[[Page S2152]]\n\n     small business owners at the 1995 White House provisions that \n     were recommended by small business owners at the 1995 White \n     House Conference on Small Business. The bill has these \n     important elements:\n       Strengthening the Regulatory Flexibility Act\n       Provisions that would encourage a more cooperative \n     regulatory enforcement environment regulation.\n       Updating the Equal Access to Justice Act.\n       Providing for the judicial review of the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act of 1980 is of particular concern to the small \n     business community because it has the potential to fulfill \n     the promise of that 16 year old law. The purpose of \n     ``reg.flex.'' was to fit regulations to the scale and \n     resources of the regulated entity. A strong ``reg.flex.'' \n     process will provide a substantial measure of the regulatory \n     reform that small business owners have wanted for years.\n       The vote on S. 942 will be a ``Key Small Business Vote'' of \n     the 104th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Donald A.

Christopher Bond,\n     Committee on Small Business, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the Small Business \n     Legislative Council (SBLC), I wish to express our strong \n     support for your legislation to amend the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act (RFA) to add judicial review, and to make \n     other small business regulatory process improvements.\n       As long-time supporters of the RFA, we know from first-hand \n     experience that agencies have been able to ignore the law due \n     to the lack of judicial review. At the time of the enactment \n     of the original RFA, we thought it was a risk we could \n     reluctantly accept in order for us to overcome the then \n     formidable resistance of the bureaucracy to the entire law. \n     Time has proven that the price was too much to pay.\n       The original concept of the original law is still sound. \n     The goal is to have agencies undertake an analysis of \n     proposed rules to determine whether they have an adverse \n     impact on small business. If such a determination is made, \n     then the agency must explore alternatives to mitigate the \n     impact on small business. Unfortunately, agencies have simply \n     ignored the law in the absence of judicial review.\n       Small business is at the regulatory breaking point. All too \n     frequently, small business owners tell us, ``I am not sure I \n     can advise my son or daughter to join me in the business. It \n     is not worth it, the hassles outweigh the joys. They just \n     might be better off working for someone else.'' It is time to \n     reverse that trend.\n       Enactment of the judicial review amendment to the RFA was \n     one of the priority recommendations of last year's White \n     House Conference on Small Business.\n       Congratualtions on this initiative! We look forward to \n     working with you towards the passage and enactment.\n       The SBLC is a permanent, independent coalition of nearly \n     one hundred trade and professional associations that share a \n     common commitment to the future of small business. Our \n     members represent the interests of small businesses in such \n     diverse economic sectors as manufacturing, \n     retailing, distribution, professional and technical \n     services, construction, transportation, and agriculture. \n     Our policies are developed through a consensus among our \n     membership. Individual associations may express their own \n     views.

Kit Bond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Kit: On behalf of the National Retail Federation (NRF) \n     and America's 1.4 million U.S. retail establishments, I am \n     writing to strongly support your bipartisan, ``Small Business \n     Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act'' (S. 942). For years \n     Main Street retailers have been shouting for relief from the \n     federal regulatory nightmare. The bipartisan legislation \n     you've assembled should provide exactly that.\n       This bill includes important relief for small retailers--in \n     particular strengthening the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Reg-\n     Flex was designed to force federal regulators to consider the \n     excessive burden regulations place on small businesses. The \n     improvements included in this bill will give family-owned \n     retailers the hammer necessary to break the regulatory \n     juggernaut. It will help provide Main Street businesses with \n     the common sense solutions they have been searching for.\n       Other features of the bill such as its ``Plain English'' \n     requirement and its direction to agencies to set-up programs \n     to waive civil penalties for first-time violations are also \n     important and valuable. Small retailers simply cannot afford \n     to spend valuable time in non-productive activities.\n       Again thank you on behalf of America's retailers and the \n     one in five Americans employed in the retail industry for \n     your leadership in important regulatory relief.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           John J. Motley III,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Government and Public Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n[[Page S2153]]\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Home Builders,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: It is my understanding that you may be \n     considering S. 942, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \n     Fairness Act of 1996. S. 942 was reported to the full Senate \n     unanimously by the Senate Small Business Committee on March \n     6, and on behalf of the 185,000 member firms of the National \n     Association of Home Builders (NAHB), I urge you to support \n     this bill and oppose any weakening amendments.\n       S. 942 is based on several recommendations of the White \n     House Conference on Small Business (the Conference) which \n     addresses the regulatory burden currently faced by small \n     businesses in the United States. First of all, S. 942 would \n     require federal agencies to streamline and simplify their \n     regulations. Secondly, this legislation would create a Small \n     Business and Agriculture Enforcement Ombudsman to compile the \n     comments of small businesses with respect to regulatory \n     enforcement, and annually rate agencies based on these \n     comments. While this is a step in the right direction, NAHB \n     would respectfully suggest that the Ombudsman be given \n     meaningful authority to intervene on behalf of an aggrieved \n     small business.\n       Additionally, S. 942 would establish a meaningful judicial \n     review process for regulations under the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act, enabling small business owners to challenge \n     onerous regulations in court, forcing agencies to ensure that \n     rules do not adversely impact small businesses.\n       Many of our members were active participants in the \n     Conference. Hence, we feel strongly that the recommendations \n     adopted by the Conference should be implemented by Congress. \n     As the recent report of the Small Business Administration \n     (SBA) points out, small businesses currently shoulder a \n     disproportionate share of the regulatory burden and generally \n     have the least amount of resources to devote to regulatory \n     compliance.\n       Most NAHB members are truly small businesses, and we \n     support the provisions of S. 942. This legislation has broad, \n     bipartisan support, and we strongly urge you to pass this \n     bill without any weakening amendments.\n       Thank you for considering our views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Randall L. Smith,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               Associated Builders\n\n\n                                        and Contractors, Inc.,\n\n                                      Rosslyn, VA, March 11, 1996.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: The Senate will soon be considering the \n     Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 \n     (S. 942). On behalf of Associated Builders and Contractors \n     (ABC)--and its more than 18,000 contractors, subcontractors, \n     material suppliers, and related firms from across the \n     country--I urge you to support the legislation.\n       S. 942 will implement key recommendations from the 1995 \n     White House Conference on Small Business aimed to facilitate \n     compliance with federal regulatory and administrative \n     requirements imposed on the private sector. ABC believes S. \n     942 is an important step in managing the increasing \n     regulatory burden on U.S. companies and small businesses in \n     particular.\n       In particular, the legislation would strengthen enforcement \n     of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. It would grant judicial \n     review to ensure regulatory flexibility requirements are \n     carried out by allowing small businesses to challenge certain \n     agency actions or inactions in court. This will help enforce \n     the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which was intended to require \n     that federal agencies ``fit regulatory and informational \n     requirements to the scale of the businesses.'' It is critical \n     that Congress enact this judicial ``hammer'' to enforce \n     agencies to address regulatory impacts on small businesses.\n       Although the nation's regulations are intended to benefit \n     the public, they in fact place a disproportionate burden on \n     small businessmen and women--those who actually create the \n     vast majority of jobs in America. The Small Business \n     Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 will help \n     alleviate this main obstruction to economic development and \n     free America's small business owners to generate valuable \n     jobs.\n       The majority of ABC's members are small businesses. The \n     U.S. Small Business Administration has identified \n     construction contractors as one of the top small business-\n     dominated industries responsible for generating a significant \n     number of new jobs annually. In fact, from 1993 to 1994, \n     general building and specialty construction contractors \n     created almost 290,000 new jobs.\n       Over-regulation is not only burdensome for small \n     businesses, but also impacts the economy. For the \n     construction industry, excessive regulation translates into \n     higher costs that are eventually passed onto the consumer for \n     private sector contracts. Over-regulation on public sector \n     contracts costs the federal government and the taxpayer \n     millions of dollars per year. An additional burden is placed \n     on the nation's economy because the increased cost of doing \n     business from excessive regulations results in fewer jobs.\n       Again, ABC urges you to vote in support of S. 942 to help \n     improve the ability of small businesses to comply with \n     federal regulations. The Small Business Regulatory \n     Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 will encourage small \n     business participation in the regulatory process and provide \n     the necessary opportunity for redress of arbitrary \n     enforcement actions. Thank you for your consideration of this \n     important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Charlotte W. Herbert,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Government Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                          Towns and Townships,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 1996.\n     Hon. Kit Bond,\n     Chairman, Small Business Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: The National Association of Towns and \n     Townships (NATaT) would like to thank you for your leadership \n     in developing legislation to strengthen the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA). NATaT strongly supports S. \n     942, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act \n     of 1996. NATaT has long supported judicial review of the \n     Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), which is a major component \n     of S. 942.\n       NATaT represents approximately 13,000 of the nation's \n     39,000 general purpose units of local governments. Most of \n     our member local governments are small and rural and have \n     fewer than 10,000 residents. These small communities simply \n     do not have the resources to comply with many mandates and \n     regulations in the same fashion that larger localities are \n     able. The impact of federal regulations on small localities \n     was understood by the authors of the RFA and small localities \n     were therefore included under the definition of small \n     entities in that act.\n       NATaT has long recognized the failings of the RFA and has \n     fought to strengthen it over the years. We have concluded \n     that the only way to get federal agencies to take notice of \n     their responsibilities under the RFA is to allow small \n     entities to take an agency to court for failure to follow the \n     provisions of the RFA. Strong judicial review language would \n     do just that. NATaT strongly supports the judicial review \n     language and would oppose any efforts to weaken it.\n                                                      Tom Halicki,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Manufacturers,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 1996.\n     Hon. Christopher S. ``Kit'' Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Kit: The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) \n     is pleased to offer its strong support for S. 942, The Small \n     Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996. This \n     measure, which may be considered on the Senate floor today, \n     is an important down payment on improvements to the nation's \n     regulatory system.\n       Senate passage of S. 942 would be an important first step \n     toward lifting regulatory barriers to increased flexibility, \n     productivity and growth, particularly for small companies. \n     The measure would allow small companies to stay focused on \n     growing their businesses and creating jobs by increasing the \n     accountability of regulatory agencies and decreasing \n     unnecessary compliance burdens.\n       A recent study commissioned by the U.S. Small Business \n     Administration concludes that small businesses shoulder 63 \n     percent of the total regulatory burden while accounting for \n     50 percent of employment and sales. According to the report, \n     ``The Changing Burden of Regulation, Paperwork, and Tax \n     Compliance on Small Business,'' the average cost of \n     regulation per employee in firms with 500 or more workers is \n     $2,979. That compares with $5,532 for firms with 20 or fewer \n     employees, an intolerable burden that must be reduced.\n       We also support the Nickles/Reid amendment, which will \n     provide Congress with an opportunity to review major \n     regulations under a fast track procedure. This will encourage \n     the Federal bureaucracy to do a better job of developing \n     sensible regulations.\n       The NAM believes that this legislation will yield smarter \n     regulations that protect health, safety and the environment \n     and bolster economic growth and job creation. I strongly urge \n     you to support S. 942 and the Nickles-Reid amendment as part \n     of a continuing effort to modernize the nation's antiquated \n     regulatory system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Jerry J. Jasinowski,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there are a number of other important \namendments and provisions in this bill, in addition to providing \njudicial enforcement of regulatory flex. We take a very simple step of \nsaying, with respect to compliance guides, when you write a regulation, \nyou have to tell the small entities how, in plain English, they are \nsupposed to abide by the regulation, what it is supposed to do, and how \nthey can comply with it.\n  If a regulatory agency brings an enforcement action against a small \nentity, the small entity has a right to take a look at those so-called \nplain English guidelines and present it to the court or the \nadministrative hearing officer and say, ``Hey, look, we are doing what \nthey told us to do,'' or if it is so confusing that they cannot figure \nit out, they have a case to make in the court or in the administrative \nhearing: ``We had no idea what we were supposed to do to comply with \nthis.''\n\n[[Page S2154]]\n\n  Another area that we think is very, very important is to change the \natmosphere of inspectors and examiners who go out into the field \nrepresenting the Federal Government to administer regulations.\n  Mr. President, you and I can cite many examples, I am sure. There are \nan overwhelming number of examples where dedicated public servants go \nout and work with the people they regulate to help them come into \ncompliance. But I know we also can cite examples where a regulator goes \nout, an examiner goes out, and they think they have been sent from the \nking to impose fines, to impose sanctions and that their objective is \nto make life miserable. That is certainly the impression that too many \nof the witnesses before our hearings have held. They feel that there \nare some agencies in some areas or even some individuals who just have \nthe wrong idea: They do not work for the people; they are there to \ncollect fines and to impose penalties.\n  We set up fairness rules, and we set up an ombudsman. The ombudsman \nprovision creates a small business enforcement ombudsman to provide a \nplace where small businesses can complain and voice their concerns on \nexcessive regulatory enforcement actions.\n  Right now, I have asked some of those small businesses why they do \nnot complain to the guy's boss. They said, ``Well, as soon as we do \nthat, he is going to tell the inspector who is giving us so much \ntrouble, who fined us $4,000 for not having a warning label on a bottle \nof kitchen dishwashing soap, and we are liable to get twice that fine \nthe next time.''\n  We set up an ombudsman system, regional fairness boards where you can \ngo to complain, and if a number of small entities pinpoint a particular \nagency or even a particular inspector, then through the Small Business \nAdministration, which knows the identity of the complaining witnesses, \nthe attention of the supervisory personnel in the enforcing agency can \nbe advised that this particular inspector or maybe this particular \noffice is overreaching, is not performing its function of seeing that \nthe purpose of the statute is carried out, that they are more \ninterested in the enforcement sanctions and the fines.\n\n  We believe this will help change the culture so that regulators, \nexaminers and inspectors know that their job, when they go out, is to \nsee that the workplace is environmentally sound, healthful, safe and \nnot to impose fines, and regulations. This does not take away any of \nthe penalties. This says how you go about it should be designed to \nachieve compliance, not to impose penalties.\n  There is another measure which is included in this bill, one which \nwas introduced by Senator Domenici as a result of hearings we had in \nNew Mexico, to provide, on a pilot basis, in OSHA and EPA for the \ninvolvement of small businesses and small entities in the early stages \nof regulatory development, so you can have somebody sitting at the \ntable as you look at the statute and you try to determine how best to \ncarry it out. Somebody can say, ``Well, to do this in the small \nentities, it will be easier to go this way to get the job done than to \ngo that way.''\n  We think that offers great promise. It will be tested, and we will \nsee if we can, in fact, make sure that we get the job done of complying \nwith the law.\n  Finally, there is a change in the Equal Access to Justice Act. That \nact is supposed to provide compensation for small businesses and small \nentities who are subject to regulatory proceedings, the imposition of \nfines. If it turns out that the Federal Government has asked for much \nlarger fines or penalties than are warranted in the case, they are \nsupposed to get compensation. Under existing law, however, the \nstandards are so strict that it is a promise without performance.\n  We amend the Equal Access to Justice Act to level the playing field \nto bring some accountability to the actions between an agency and a \nsmall business entity so that when the agency makes a demand, it is \ngoing to have to be in proportion to what the violation is worth and \nwhat can actually be proven in a hearing, either administrative or \njudicial, to allow them to recover costs for representing themselves \nagainst an overreaching agency.\n  These things, I think, make this a good starting point for ensuring \nthat Federal agencies give a hearing to small businesses and to small \nentities and take account of how their activities may impact those \nbusinesses.\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I hope that when we vote on this measure \nnext Tuesday, we will have overwhelming support from this body. The \nHouse has considered but has not moved forward on legislation. I hope \nthat by listening to Members on both sides and doing a tremendous \namount of staff work--and I want to compliment not only the staff on \nthis side, but on the minority side for their diligent work--we have a \nreasonably good piece of legislation.\n  We have made accommodations. There are a number of amendments we \nbelieve we can accept by voice vote. Senator Nickles and Senator Reid \nhave one for congressional review that we think is vitally important. \nIt has overwhelmingly passed the Congress. I think it was 100 to 0. \nThat is about as good as you can get. It has already passed the Senate. \nI do not think we need another vote on that one, but we expect to \naccept that. And there will be a managers' amendment.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  With that, as I turn to my ranking member, I ask unanimous consent to \nallow Tom McCully, a legislative fellow in the Small Business \nCommittee, privilege of the floor for the duration of the consideration \nof this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the chairman of the Small Business \nCommittee, my colleague, Senator Bond, made a magnificent statement on \nthis very comprehensive bill. As Mo Udall used to say, ``Just about \neverything that needs to be said has been said, but everybody hasn't \nsaid it.'' I know that what I have to say will be largely repetitious, \nbut let me start, first, by just complimenting Senator Bond for his \ntenacity and determination in getting this bill out of the committee \nand getting it to the floor.\n  I believe I can truthfully say this is one of the two or three times \nsince I have been in the Senate where Members, if this becomes law, \nwill have an opportunity to go home and actually tell the small \nbusiness community that we have done something for them that was \nactually meaningful, that they can relate to and that they will \napplaud.\n  Sometimes the small business community can get very volatile and \nvocal about the fact that nobody here hears them or really cares about \ntheir problems. And there is some merit to that. Very few of the \nrecommendations they have made at these various White House conferences \non small business have ever resulted in legislation here. In 1980, when \nwe passed the Regulatory Flexibility Act, we patted ourselves on the \nback and gave ourselves the good government award and went home and \ntold the small business community what we had done for them. Not much \ntime elapsed before they said, ``You didn't do anything for us.''\n  They were absolutely right about that. The Regulatory Flexibility Act \nsimply has not worked. If it had, we would not be here this morning. So \nreally the initiative taken by Senator Bond is to correct that, and to \nfulfill a promise to the small business community--oh, yes, if you want \nto put the political aspect to it--to enable the Members of the U.S. \nSenate to go home and appear before small business groups and tell them \nhow much you love them, but this time you can actually justify it by \npointing to this legislation, if it becomes law, which I feel sure it \nwill.\n  Why did the Regulatory Flexibility Act not work? Because it had a \nprovision in it that said the agencies who write the rules that govern \nthe people subject to their jurisdiction, it said that those agencies, \nfirst of all, had to make a determination that the rules they were \nwriting were or were not unduly burdensome on the small business \ncommunity. If they were, of course, then they had to do a regulatory \nanalysis of how it affected small business as opposed to others. They \nhave to do that to make a determination anyway. If they found that this \nwas burdensome on the small business community, then they had to go \nthrough a lot of hoops.\n  Agencies do not like to jump through hoops. So what did they do? \nAlmost\n\n[[Page S2155]]\n\nwithout exception they would simply say these regulations are not \nunduly burdensome on the small business community; therefore, they did \nnot have to do anything more to accommodate the burden of that \nregulation on small business.\n  What was really the biggest omission of all in the Reg Flex Act of \n1980 was that once the agency said, no, this does not hurt small \nbusiness, small business could not do anything but stand there and take \nit because there was no judicial review. Under this bill, if they make \na decision that a regulation is not burdensome, unduly harsh on small \nbusiness, if they make that decision, they are going to have to defend \nit in court because the small business community has a right of \njudicial review on that determination.\n\n  So they are going to be much more circumspect about the regulation \nand certainly going to be much more circumspect about finding that the \nrules are not harsh on small business.\n  There are people who do not much like the judicial review part of \nthis and say, you are going to clog the courts up with small business \npeople contesting every regulation that has ever been written. That is \npowerful nonsense. Small business people do not like to spend money in \ncourt more than anybody else does.\n  But let me tell you, if I were going to summarize the vitality and \nthe effectiveness of this bill in one sentence, or the reasons for it, \nit is because the small business people of this country spend 60 to 80 \npercent more dollars per employee to comply with Government regulations \nthan big business does. How would you like to be a small business \nmaking widgets, and let us assume General Motors, one of the biggest \ncorporations in America, also makes widgets, and you have to compete \nwith General Motors, and then they come out with all these burdensome \nregulations, which are a piece of cake to General Motors, but, you \nknow, you are going to have to spend 60 to 80 percent more than they \nare per employee to comply with those rules?\n  That is what this is all about, Mr. President. It is going to sail \nthrough. If there is a vote against this bill I am going to be \nsurprised because everybody here knows those things I just described to \nyou make sense.\n  The equal access to justice, which gives the small business community \nthe right to go two court and to challenge some of the findings of the \nagencies, is long overdue. The equal access to justice, which says if \nthe Government sues you for $1 million, and they wind up getting an \naward of $10,000 or even $50,000, the Justice Department, the small \nbusiness person can sue for his attorney fees. This is a point that the \nJustice Department helped us with. And we accepted it. I applaud the \nJustice Department for it because the language says that if the award \nis disproportionately smaller than that requested, you are entitled to \nattorney fees.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor S. 942 and the \npending managers' amendment with the distinguished chairman of our \ncommittee, Senator Bond. This bill is one of the most significant \naccomplishments of the 104th Congress, and it is one of the best bills \nfor the small business community in the last 15 years. It is important \nbecause it resolves major concerns to the small business community that \nhave been unresolved for many years. And, it follows by less than 1 \nyear the conclusion and recommendations of the 1995 White House \nConference on Small Business.\n  Senators who support this bill can say to their small business \nconstituents, ``We not only hear you; we agree with much of what you \nare saying, and we are responding.'' With this bill, Senators can do \nmore than give platitudes for small business. We can do something that \nwill effect the lives of every business owner who deals with a Federal \nregulator.\n  S. 942 makes important, positive changes in two statutes which grew \nout of the 1980 White House Conference on Small Business: The \nRegulatory Flexibility Act and the Equal Access to Justice Act. This is \na bill--all too rare in this Congress--which I can assure my colleagues \nthat we would be considering if my party were in the majority. Some of \ntoday's bill's issues--particularly the judicial enforceability of the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act, or Reg Flex--have been the subject of \nconsternation among small business owners almost since the act was \npassed in 1980. The recommendations of the White House Conference, as \nwell as the work done by the National Performance Review under Vice \nPresident Gore, are the foundations of today's bill.\n  I want to emphasize that the spirit of S. 942 is one of reforming the \nregulatory environment--a cause which President Clinton's \nadministration has championed since its inception both in the National \nPerformance Review and in Executive orders which the President has \nsigned. We are not only endorsing the Clinton administration's new \nregulatory philosophy, we are writing some of its program into law so \nthat this new attitude does not change under some future President. \nSection 202 of the bill is specifically based on an Executive order, \nwhich President Clinton signed, providing for waiver or reduction of \npenalties and fines for small businesses in certain circumstances. His \nExecutive order is exactly that approach to take if we are to change \nthe climate of animosity between Government and small business which \nhas existed for years.\n  There are several specific provisions of this bill which deserve \nmention. First, however, I want to compliment the chairman for the way \nhe has handled this bill in our committee and since it was reported. \nAlthough the administration did not testify on the bill before the \nSmall Business Committee, in subsequent days the chairman, the staff \nand I have held literally dozens of consultations with various agency \nofficials about the bill. More importantly, we have worked very hard to \naccommodate the views and suggestions of the Clinton administration. \nWithout exception, the suggestions and requests both from the \nadministration and from Senators on and off the committee have been \nconstructive and helpful. The staffs of the Finance Committee and the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee have been especially helpful in crafting \nthis far-reaching bill.\n  The Managers' amendment incorporates dozens of changes, some quite \nsignificant, in either language or policy from the bill reported by the \ncommittee. However, it does not retreat in any way from the main \npurpose of the bill. In fact, the administration's views have helped us \nto make the bill stronger and more effective for small business. I want \nto dispel any notion that the so-called bureaucrats have opposed this \nbill for fear that it would create more work for their agencies. The \nGeneral Counsels' offices at Treasury, Justice, Labor, and other \ndepartments have offered advice which has improved upon what our \ncommittee originally approved 2 weeks ago.\n  Allowing judicial enforcement of the rights created under the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act of 1980--which S. 942 for the first time \ndoes--removes a bone that has been stuck in the throat of small \nbusiness owners for over 15 years. The original act did not permit \nanyone to go to Federal court to enforce the promise that agencies \nwould: First, consider whether a proposed rule significantly affected a \nsubstantial number of small entities; and second, consider whether \nsteps should be taken to account for the special problems of small \nentities. The only enforcement of the act was the moral authority of \nthe law and SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy who is charged with \nmonitoring agencies' implementation of Reg Flex.\n  Small firms, according to the GAO, pay between 60 and 80 percent \nmore, per employee, for the cost of complying with Government \nregulations than do the big businesses who are often their competitors. \nSmall business owners do not have armies of accountants, clerks, and \nlawyers to help them comply with the Government's endless demand for \ninformation and enforcement of rules.\n  For several years, the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy has reported to \nthe Senate Small Business Committee on the performance of agencies in \nfollowing the mandate of the Reg Flex Act. Some agencies have been \nconscientious, others sadly have not. That report, to date, has been \nalmost the only means of enforcing agency compliance with the act. \nThere is at least a perception that some agencies of the Government \nhave routinely used the act's escape clause by saying that a \nsignificant number of small entities would not be substantially \naffected. This has occasionally been done when\n\n[[Page S2156]]\n\nthe facts were obviously to the contrary. Yet there was no legal \nrecourse for businesses affected.\n  Today, all that changes. Those who should be protected by the Reg \nFlex Act will be. Small business owners, small town governments, and \nsmall nonprofit associations will be empowered to go into Federal court \nand obtain justice if a Federal agency has not followed the law. This \nlaw puts the Reg Flex Act on the same footing with other parts of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act--which is to say that individuals are \nprotected against actions which are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accord with the law.\n  Judicial review of reg flex was one of the top recommendations of the \n1995 White House Conference on Small Business, as was overall \nregulatory reform. Less than a year after the end of that conference, \nCongress is acting on those recommendations--a large part of them--by \nenacting these major changes in Federal regulatory law and policy. \nImportant as judicial enforcement is, however, it is not the only big \nchange made in this bill.\n  Perhaps the headline for this bill should be: IRS made subject to reg \nflex law. For the first time, the scope of the Reg Flex Act is being \nextended to cover so-called interpretative rulemakings. IRS and a few \nother agencies issue what are termed interpretative rules which, they \nsay, merely explain the requirements of the statute. Nonetheless, these \nrules have great weight in the courts. They must be observed if the \nbusiness owner wants to avoid a confrontation with the Government. \nUntil the present moment, interpretative rules have not been subject to \nthe requirements of the Reg Flex Act. Today, that also changes. IRS \nwill be required to conduct an analysis under the act if a new rule \nsubstantially effects a significant number of small entities. And that \nfinding will itself be subject to judicial review under section 5 of \nthe Administrative Procedures Act.\n  Let me hasten to add that we do not believe allowing judicial review \nwill result in a flurry of spurious lawsuits against the Government. \nInstead, we believe that agency rule writers will follow the new reg \nflex law and perform analyses which will avoid the necessity of anyone \ngoing to court. IRS particularly has a problem with tax protesters \nfiling frivolous suits against the Government. The courts should deal \nsummarily with such people, including imposing costs and fines in \nappropriate cases for those who sue to obstruct the Government.\n  The Equal Access to Justice Act [EAJA] which this bill amends \ndeserves special mention. This important law allows individuals of \nsmall firms who have been sued by Government to recover their attorneys \nfees if they prevailed in the suit. This law has often failed of its \npurpose because it contained a two-part test which court decisions made \nnearly impossible to achieve. Under existing law, the small company \nmust first show that he or she is a prevailing party. So, if the \nGovernment alleged 10 or 100 violations, and then only proved one minor \none, the company was not a prevailing party.\n  Second, even if someone prevailed on each and every count, he has to \nshow that the Government's action was not substantially justified. \nCourts have interpreted this phrase to mean that the Government's suit \nmust have been without foundation in law or fact--virtually a frivolous \nsuit under rule 11 of the civil rules. This is an almost impossible \ntask, since the Government invariably has some basis for acting, even \nif it is not enough to persuade a judge or jury.\n  Our bill changes both these standards and makes it possible for the \nbusiness owner to recover his fees by showing that the Government's \nfinal judgment was disproportionately less than an express demand by \nthe Government during the course of the suit. So, if the Government \nsought $1 million to settle the case, and the judge or jury awarded, \nfor example, $1,000 or $5,000, the defendant should be able to recover \nhis fees. The phrase ``disproportionately less'' than an express demand \nby the Government was suggested by the Justice Department, and it was a \nvery helpful suggestion. Obviously, this will not prohibit any agency \nfrom telling anyone the maximum legal penalty for a violation.\n  Additionally--and this should be emphasized by all who read and apply \nthis section--the court or agency can deny attorneys fees if it finds \nthat ``special circumstances make such an award unjust.'' This phrase \nalso came from the Justice Department, and it is contained in the \ncurrent law. Clearly, we do not want to pay attorneys fees for someone \nwho escaped conviction on a mere technicality but who was, nonetheless, \nprobably guilty.\n  It is certainly not our intention to pay the lawyers for people who \nare essentially bad actors but who escaped punishment by the grace of \nthe Almighty. Many circumstances, such as an exclusionary rule \nchallenge, can be imagined where it would be wrong for the taxpayers to \nreimburse someone's attorneys fees, and the courts are empowered to use \nsome reasonable discretion.\n  Finally, the courts are not obliged to allow the maximum rate of $125 \nper hour in every case. This is an increase from the $75 per hour \nmaximum in current law, a figure which has not been changed in many \nyears. The courts should look to existing law under section 1988 of the \nCivil Rights Act for guidance. Fees should be set in relation to \nprevailing fees actually charged in the community. Moreover, courts \nshould require attorneys to substantiate their fees through time-sheets \nor other appropriate records.\n  The Justice Department is still not entirely satisfied with this \nlanguage, as the statement of administration policy indicates. But the \nadministration has my assurance, and that of Senator Bond, that we will \ncontinue to work with them to improve upon this language in conference \nwith the House.\n  The House previously passed a bill allowing for some judicial review \nof reg flex decisions, but our bill is broader. Moreover, the House \nbill does not amend the EAJA, does not contain an ombudsman provision, \nand does not allow for Regulatory Advisory Boards. It is a rather \nnarrow bill, and I hope that we will be able to persuade the House to \nsubstantially broaden it or, better yet, to accept our bill. To this \npoint, the House has not been able to bring major regulatory reform to \na conclusion, just as the Senate failed to complete debate on S. 343 \nearlier in this session. This bill, however, can and should go forward \nregardless of the outcome of those debates. This bill can only help our \neconomy's small business sector, and I hope our colleagues in the other \nbody will move expeditiously to send this bill to the President for his \nsignature.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill. The small \nbusiness community will undoubtedly appreciate those who have helped us \ntoday.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Bond and his staff, particularly Keith \nCole and Louis Taylor, for their cooperation and support during the \ndevelopment and consideration of this bill. This bill shows that \nreasonable people of good will can still accomplish a great deal in \nthis Congress, and I hope it will be a precedent for other bills.\n  Mr. President, on the equal access to justice, I point out it was the \nJustice Department that came up with the phrase which I think is almost \na stroke of genius when they said, ``Why don't you use the term \n`disproportionate award'?'' That is, if the Government sues for $1 \nmillion and they get a disproportionately smaller amount than that, \nthen the small businessperson is entitled to his attorney fees. There \nare some exceptions to that, of course--if he has been guilty of a \ncriminal act or willful wrongdoing or something like that--but normally \nhe not only will be entitled to attorney fees, but the equal-access-to-\njustice provision, which is essentially incorporated here with Senator \nFeingold, essentially the amendment he offered on the floor--I think it \npassed 98-0--that increased the amount the small businessperson could \nrecover from $75 an hour to $225 an hour. We have put that in this \nbill.\n  Now, Mr. President, there are some cases in which offenses can be \nwaived, penalties can be waived, under a certain set of conditions. If \nyou really want, sometimes, to enforce a regulation, no exception, \ncross every ``t'' and dot every ``i'', you can still make things a \nlittle tough for some small business people.\n  The National Performance Review Group headed up by Vice President \nGore had recommended that there be a provision in here that some people\n\n[[Page S2157]]\n\ncould be excused from burdensome penalties if it was rather \nunintentional and had been corrected. That ought to be a source of some \nstrength. I, frankly, thought that labor might oppose that, but they \ndid not. It is not designed to ratify or condone bad conduct on the \npart of some small businessman but just to keep it from being too \nharsh.\n  Now, Mr. President, the final thing that I want to mention, there is \na provision in here--and it may not be perfect; some people have voiced \nconsiderable reservation about it--but the provision is that the Small \nBusiness Administration will be home to an omsbudsman, and that \nombudsman is there to take complaints from the small business \ncommunity.\n  You have heard that classic joke for 100 years, ``I'm here from the \nIRS and I am here to help you,'' and people are terrified when the IRS \nwalks in. Usually if that agent happens to be abusive--and I use the \nIRS because they are everybody's favorite whipping boy--if that agent \nhappens to be abusive on top of the fact you know that he is there to \nget in your pocketbook, it makes it doubly troublesome. This is also \ntrue of a lot of people who come into your plant to enforce the OSHA \nlaws or all the other regulations that they write. If a small business \nman or woman feels that he or she has been put upon in an unfair, \nburdensome, and abusive way, they will have somebody to report that to.\n\n  It just occurred to me, Mr. President, one of the biggest cases I \never had involved a defense contract. My client was a manufacturer of \ntent pins. Tent pins came in different sizes, anywhere from 18 inches \nto 24 inches, and they were designed, of course, to drive in the ground \nto hold a tent up for the army, for the troops. Now, you have to \nunderstand the tent pins had to be absolutely perfect--sanded. You \nwould not believe the regulations that my client had to comply with to \nbuild a tent pin which, when used, was going to be hit by a \nsledgehammer.\n  He had one of those crazy, as luck would have it, a crazy inspector. \nThe guy used to go through his trash at night after he would leave to \nsee if he could find something. The reason I am telling you that--it is \nhumorous now because that happened 35 years ago; it was not funny \nthen--it bankrupted my client. It took 7 years--I had never had a case \nin the U.S. Court of Claims before. They sent a referee down to Fort \nSmith, AR, and we tried that thing. It took a week. Happily, the \nreferee of the Court of Claims was a very attentive judge. He was an \nelderly man. He understood the problem. He listened very carefully. He \nawarded my client, I believe, $100,000, one of the biggest judgments I \never got. You would think I could remember to the penny what it was.\n  It turned out, as a personal note, that Betty and I were getting \nready to take our daughter to Boston to Children's Hospital for what we \nknew was going to be a tremendous expense and we did not know how to \npay for it, and I collected on that judgment 3 days before we left. It \nsaved my life.\n  I have had firsthand experience with the Government inspector who \nbankrupted my client. We did get that amount of money. But that was \nafter 7 years. We did not get a dime of interest. We did not get a dime \nof penalty. We did not get a dime in attorney fees. All we got were \nactual damages.\n  Now, as a country lawyer in a town of 2,000 people, I could not \nbelieve the Government treated people like that. They admitted they \nwere wrong, but no attorney fees, no interest, no penalty, after 7 \nyears. Well, at least these people are going to be entitled to attorney \nfees.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Carol Moseley-\nBraun as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes. I would like to \nadd--to make sure we have a list of cosponsors, I will read for the \nrecord the cosponsors:\n  In addition to Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator Bumpers and myself, we \nhave Senator Burns, Senator Coats, Senator Coverdell, Senator DeWine, \nSenator Dole, Senator Domenici, Senator Faircloth, Senator Frist, \nSenator Grams of Minnesota, Senator Grassley, Senator Hutchison, \nSenator Kempthorne, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Lott, Senator Lugar, Senator Pressler, Senator Robb, Senator \nStevens, and Senator Warner.\n  I also note that a number of these people, including Senator Robb, \nare working very actively with us, with Senator Nickles, with Senator \nJohnston, Senator Dole and others on a broader regulatory reform \npackage. I think they want it understood, as I certainly do, that this \ndoes not supplant the need for other regulatory reform efforts, and it \nin no way is a substitute for them. We think this is a very important \nrifle shot to deal with the problems of small business, and we believe \nit does not deal with the broader regulatory issues.\n  Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a statement of the legislative history of this measure which is \nprepared by staff for Senator Bumpers and me on behalf of the \ncommittee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Committee Legislative History for S. 942\n\n\n                     i. summary of the legislation\n\n       The final version of the bill, embodied in a managers \n     amendment, makes a series of technical and other amendments \n     to S. 942, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness \n     Act of 1996. The amendment resolves many of the questions \n     raised by the Administration with the bill as reported by the \n     Small Business Committee. The amendment also makes changes \n     for better implementation of certain recommendations of the \n     1995 White House Conference on Small Business regarding the \n     development and enforcement of Federal regulations, including \n     judicial review of agency actions under the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act (RFA). The scope of the RFA requires a \n     regulatory flexibility analysis of all rules that have a \n     ``significant economic impact on a substantial number'' of \n     small entities. Under the RFA, this term ``small entities'' \n     includes small businesses, small non-profit organizations, \n     and small governmental units.\n       As amended, S. 942 provides a framework to make federal \n     regulators more accountable for their enforcement actions by \n     providing small entities with an opportunity for redress of \n     arbitrary enforcement actions. The goal of the Act is to \n     foster a more cooperative, less threatening regulatory \n     environment between agencies and small businesses and other \n     entities. In addition, S. 942 provides a vehicle for \n     effective and early participation by small businesses in the \n     Federal regulatory process by incorporating amended \n     provisions of S. 917, the Small Business Advocacy Act.\n\n\n                    ii. section-by-section analysis\n\n                               Section 1\n\n       This section entitles the Act the ``Small Business \n     Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996.''\n\n                               Section 2\n\n       The bill makes findings as to the need for a strong small \n     business sector, the disproportionate impact of regulations \n     on small businesses, the recommendations of the 1995 White \n     House Conference on Small Business, and the need for judicial \n     review of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\n                               Section 3\n\n       This section outlines the purposes for the bill. The bill \n     addresses some key federal regulatory recommendations of the \n     1995 White House Conference on Small Business. The White \n     House Conference produced a consensus that small businesses \n     should be included earlier and more effectively in the \n     regulatory process. The bill provides for a more cooperative \n     and less threatening regulatory environment to help small \n     businesses in their compliance efforts. The bill also \n     provides small businesses with legal redress from arbitrary \n     enforcement actions by making federal regulators accountable \n     for their actions.\n\n                               Section 4\n\n       This section provides that the effective date of the Act is \n     90 days after enactment. Proposed rules published after the \n     effective date must be accompanied by an initial regulatory \n     flexibility analysis or a certification under section 605 of \n     the RFA. Final rules published after the effective date must \n     be accompanied by a final regulatory flexibility analysis or \n     a certification under section 605 of the RFA, regardless of \n     when the rule was first proposed. However, IRS interpretive \n     rules proposed prior to enactment will not be subject to the \n     amendments made in chapter four of the Act expanding the \n     scope of the RFA to include IRS interpretive rules. Thus, the \n     IRS could finalize previously proposed interpretive rules \n     according to the terms of currently applicable law, \n     regardless of when the final interpretive rule is published.\n\n\n                               title one\n\n                              Section 101\n\n       This section defines certain terms as used in the act. The \n     term ``small entity'' is currently defined in the RFA to \n     include small business concerns, as defined by the Small \n     Business Act, small nonprofit organizations\n\n[[Page S2158]]\n\n     and small governmental jurisdictions. The process of \n     determining whether a given business qualifies as a small \n     entity is straightforward, using thresholds established by \n     the SBA for Standard Industrial Classification codes. The RFA \n     also defines small organization and small governmental \n     jurisdiction. Any definition established by an agency for \n     purposes of implementing the RFA would also apply to this \n     Act.\n\n                              Section 102\n\n       The bill requires agencies to publish ``small entity \n     compliance guides'' to assist small entities in complying \n     with regulations which are the subject of a required Reg Flex \n     analysis. The bill does not allow judicial review of the \n     guide itself. However, the agency's claim that the guide \n     provides ``plain English'' assistance would be a matter of \n     public record. In addition, the small business compliance \n     guide would be available as evidence of the reasonableness of \n     any proposed fine on the small entity.\n       Agencies should endeavor to make these ``plain English'' \n     guides available to small entities through a coordinated \n     distribution system for regulatory compliance information \n     utilizing means such as the SBA's U.S. Business Advisor, the \n     Small Business Ombudsman at the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, state-run compliance assistance programs established \n     under section 507 of the Clean Air Act, Manufacturing \n     Technology Centers or Small Business Development Centers \n     established under the Small Business Act.\n\n                              Section 103\n\n       The bill directs agencies that regulate small businesses to \n     answer inquiries of small entities seeking information on and \n     advice about regulatory compliance. Some agencies already \n     have established successful programs to provide compliance \n     assistance and the amendment intends to encourage these \n     efforts. For example, the IRS, SEC and the Customs Service \n     have an established practice of issuing private letter \n     rulings applying the law to a particular set of facts. This \n     legislation does not require other agencies to establish \n     programs with the same level of formality as found in the \n     current practice of issuing private letter rulings. The use \n     of toll free telephone numbers and other informal means of \n     responding to small entities is encouraged. This legislation \n     does not mandate changes in current programs at the IRS, SEC \n     and Customs Service, but these agencies should consider \n     establishing less formal means of providing small entities \n     with informal guidance in accordance with this section.\n       The bill gives agencies discretion to establish procedures \n     and conditions under which they would provide advice to small \n     entities. There is no requirement that the agency's advice to \n     small businesses be binding as to the legal effects of the \n     actions of other entities. Any guidance provided by the \n     agency applying statutory or regulatory provisions to \n     facts supplied by the small entity would be available as \n     relevant evidence of the reasonableness of any \n     subsequently proposed fine on the small entity.\n\n                              Section 104\n\n       The bill creates permissive authority for Small Business \n     Development Centers (SBDC) to offer regulatory compliance \n     assistance and confidential on-site assessments for small \n     businesses. SBDCs would not become the single-point source of \n     regulatory information, but would supplement agency efforts \n     to make this information widely available. Neither this \n     section nor the related language in section 105 are intended \n     to grant any exclusive franchise on regulatory compliance \n     assistance. Rather, these sections are designed to add to the \n     currently available resources to small businesses for \n     assistance with regulatory compliance.\n\n                              Section 105\n\n       the bill authorizes Manufacturing Technology Centers, \n     commonly known as ``Hollings Centers,'' and other similar \n     extension centers administered by the National Institute of \n     Standards and Technology, to engage in the types of \n     compliance assistance activities described in Section 104 \n     with respect to SBDCs.\n       This legislation places strong emphasis on compliance \n     assistance programs for small businesses. These programs can \n     save businesses money, improve their environmental \n     performance and increase their competitiveness. They can help \n     small businesses learn about cost-saving pollution prevention \n     programs and new environmental technologies. Most \n     importantly, they can help small business owners avoid \n     potentially costly regulatory citations and adjudications. \n     The bill calls for both the Small Business Development \n     Centers and the Department of Commerce's Manufacturing \n     Technology Centers to provide a range of technical and \n     compliance assistance to small businesses. Some of the \n     manufacturing technology centers already are providing \n     environmental compliance assistance in addition to general \n     technology assistance.\n       The bill also provides that it in no way limits the \n     authority and operation of the small business stationary \n     source technical and environmental compliance assistance \n     programs established under section 507 of the Clean Air Act \n     Amendments of 1990. There is strong support for that program. \n     There are also other excellent small business technical \n     assistance programs in various forms in different states. \n     This bill is not intended to affect the operation and \n     authority of those programs. comments from small business \n     representatives in a variety of fora support the need for \n     expansion of technical assistance programs.\n\n                              Section 106\n\n       This section directs agencies to cooperate with states to \n     create guides that fully integrate federal and state \n     requirements on small businesses. Separate guides may be \n     created for each state, or states may modify or supplement a \n     guide to federal requirements. Since different types of small \n     businesses are affected by different agency regulations, or \n     are affected in different ways, agencies should consider \n     preparing separate guides for the various sectors of the \n     small business community subject to their jurisdiction. \n     priority in producing these guides should be given to areas \n     of law where rules are complex and where businesses tend to \n     be small. Agencies may contract with outside entities to \n     produce these guides and, to the extent practicable, agencies \n     should utilize entities with the greatest experience in \n     developing similar guides.\n\n\n                               TITLE TWO\n\n                              Section 201\n\n       The bill creates a Small Business and Agriculture \n     Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman at SBA to give small \n     businesses a confidential means to comment on and rate the \n     performance of agency enforcement personnel. This might \n     include providing toll-free telephone numbers, computer \n     access points, or mail-in forms allowing businesses to rate \n     the performance and responsiveness of inspectors, auditors \n     and other enforcement personnel. As used in this section of \n     the bill, the term ``audit'' is not intended to refer to \n     audits conducted by Inspectors General. This Ombudsman would \n     not replace or diminish any similar ombudsman programs in \n     other agencies.\n       The Ombudsman will compile the comments of small businesses \n     and provide an annual evaluation similar to a ``customer \n     satisfaction'' rating for different agencies, regions, or \n     offices. The goal of this rating system is to see whether \n     agencies and their personnel are in fact treating small \n     businesses more like customers than potential criminals. \n     Agencies will be provided an opportunity to comment on the \n     Ombudsman's draft report, as is currently the practice with \n     reports by the General Accounting Office. The final report \n     may include a section in which an agency can address any \n     concerns that the Ombudsman does not choose to address.\n       The bill also creates Regional Small Business Regulatory \n     Fairness Boards at SBA to coordinate with the Ombudsman and \n     to provide small businesses a greater opportunity to track \n     and comment on agency enforcement policies and practices. \n     These boards provide an opportunity for representatives of \n     small businesses to come together on a regional basis to \n     assess the enforcement activities of the various federal \n     regulatory agencies. The boards may meet to collect \n     information about these activities, and report and make \n     recommendations to the Ombudsman about the impact of agency \n     enforcement policies or practices on small businesses. The \n     boards will consist of owners or operators of small entities \n     who are appointed by the Administrator of the Small Business \n     Administration. Prior to appointing any board members, the \n     Administrator must consult with the leadership of the \n     Congressional small Business Committees. There is nothing in \n     the bill that would exempt the boards from the Federal \n     Advisory Committee Act, which would apply according to its \n     terms.\n\n                              Section 202\n\n       The bill directs all federal agencies that regulate small \n     businesses to develop policies or programs providing for \n     waivers or reductions of civil penalties for violations by \n     small businesses in certain circumstances. This section \n     builds on the current Executive Order on small business \n     enforcement practices and is intended to allow agencies \n     flexibility to tailor their specific programs to their \n     missions and charters. Agencies should also consider the \n     ability of a small entity to pay in determining penalty \n     assessments under appropriate circumstances. Each agency \n     would have discretion to condition and limit the policy or \n     program on appropriate conditions. For purposes of \n     illustration, these could include requiring the small \n     business to act in good faith, requiring that violations be \n     discovered through participation in agency supported \n     compliance assistance programs, or requiring that violations \n     be corrected within a reasonable time.\n       An agency's policy or program could also provide for \n     suitable exclusions. Again, for purposes of illustration, \n     these could include circumstances where the small entity has \n     been subject to multiple enforcement actions, the violation \n     involves criminal conduct, or poses a grave threat to worker \n     safety, public health, safety or the environment.\n       In establishing their programs, agencies may distinguish \n     among types of small entities and among classes of civil \n     penalties. Some agencies have already established formal or \n     informal policies or programs that would meet the \n     requirements of this section. For example, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency has adopted a small business enforcement \n     policy that satisfies this section. While this legislation \n     sets out a general requirement to establish penalty waiver \n     and reduction programs, some agencies may be subject to other \n     statutory requirements or limitations applicable to the \n     agency or to a particular program. For example, this section \n     is\n\n[[Page S2159]]\n\n     not intended to override, amend or affect provisions of the \n     Occupational Health and Safety Act or the Mine Safety and \n     Health Act that may impose specific limitations on the \n     operation of penalty reduction or waiver programs.\n\n\n                              title three\n\n                           Sections 301 & 302\n\n       The bill would amend the Equal Access to Justice Act to \n     assist small businesses in recovering their attorneys fees \n     and expenses in certain instances when agency demands for \n     fines or civil penalties in enforcement actions are not \n     sustained. While this is a significant change from current \n     law, it is not the intention of the Committee that attorneys \n     fees be awarded as a matter of course. Rather, the \n     Committee's intention is that awards be made frequently \n     enough to change the incentives of enforcement personnel and \n     to assist in changing the culture among government regulators \n     to increase the reasonableness and fairness of their \n     enforcement practices. Past agency practice too often has \n     been to treat small businesses like suspects. A goal of this \n     bill is to encourage Government regulatory agencies to treat \n     small businesses as partners sharing in a common goal of \n     informed regulatory compliance. Government enforcement \n     attorneys often take the position that they must zealously \n     advocate for their client, in this case a regulatory agency, \n     to the maximum extent permitted by law, as if they were \n     representing an individual or other private party. But in the \n     new regulatory climate for small businesses under this \n     legislation, government attorneys with the advantages and \n     resources of the federal government behind them in dealing \n     with small entities must adjust their actions accordingly.\n       The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) provides a means for \n     prevailing small parties to recover their attorneys fees in a \n     wide variety of civil and administrative actions between \n     small parties and the government. This bill amends the EAJA \n     to create a new avenue for small entities to recover their \n     attorneys fees in situations where the government has \n     instituted an administrative or civil action against the \n     small entity to enforce a statutory or regulatory \n     requirement. In these situations, the test for recovering \n     attorneys fees in whether the final outcome imposed or \n     ordered in the case (whether a fine, injunctive relief or \n     damages) is disproportionately less burdensome on the small \n     entity than the government's actual demand. This test does \n     not provide attorneys fees if there has merely been a \n     reduction in the burden on a small entity between the demand \n     and the final outcome. The test is whether the demand is out \n     of proportion with the actual value of the violation.\n       The comparison is always between an ``express demand'' by \n     the government and the final outcome of the case. An express \n     demand is just that--any demand for payment or performed by \n     the government, including a fine, penalty notice, demand \n     letter or otherwise. However, the term ``express demand'' \n     should not be read to extend to a mere recitation of facts \n     and law in a compliant.\n       This test should not be a simple mathematical comparison. \n     The Committee intends for it to be applied in such a way that \n     it identifies and corrects situations were the agency's \n     demand is so far in excess of the true value of the case, as \n     demonstrated by the final outcome, that it appears the \n     agency's assessment or enforcement action did not represent a \n     reasonable effort to match the penalty to the facts and \n     circumstances of the case. In addition, the bill excludes \n     attorneys fee awards in connection with willful violations, \n     bad faith actions and in special circumstances that would \n     made such an award unjust.\n       The bill also increases the maximum hourly rate for \n     attorneys fees under the EAJA from $75 to $125. Agencies \n     could avoid the possibility of paying attorneys fees by \n     settling with the small entity prior to final judgment. The \n     Committee anticipates that if a settlement is reached, all \n     further claims of either party, including claims for \n     attorneys fees, could be included as part of the settlement. \n     The government may obtain a release specifically including \n     attorneys fees under EAJA.\n\n\n                               title four\n\n                              Section 401\n\n       The bill expands the coverage of the FRA to including IRS \n     interpretive rules that provide for a ``collection of \n     information'' from small entities. The intention of the \n     Committees to permit enforcement of the RFA for those IRS \n     rulemakings that will be codified in the Code of Federal \n     Regulations. Although the Committee believes IRS should take \n     an expansive approach in interpreting which of its actions \n     could have significant economic impact on small businesses, \n     less formal IRS publications such as revenue rulings, revenue \n     procedures, announcements, publications or private letter \n     rulings are not covered by the bill. The term ``collection of \n     information'' as used in the Paperwork Reduction Act (Title \n     44 U.S.C., Section 3502(4)) is defined to include the \n     obtaining or soliciting of facts or opinions by an agency \n     through a variety of means including the use of written \n     report forms, schedules, or reporting or record keeping \n     requirements, which the Committee interprets to include all \n     tax recordkeeping, filing and similar compliance activities.\n       If an agency is required to publish an initial regulatory \n     flexibility analysis, the agency also must publish a final \n     regulatory flexibility analysis. In the final regulatory \n     flexibility analysis, agencies will be required to describe \n     the impacts of the rule on small entities and to specify the \n     actions taken by the agency to modify the proposed rule to \n     minimize the regulatory impact or small entities. Nothing in \n     the bill directs the agency to choose a regulatory \n     alternative that is not authorized by the statute granting \n     regulatory authority. The goal of the final regulatory \n     flexibility analysis is to demonstrate how the agency has \n     minimized the impact of small entities consistent with the \n     underling statute and other applicable legal requirements.\n\n                              Section 402\n\n       The bill removes the current prohibition on judicial review \n     of agency compliance with the RFA and allows adversely \n     affected small entities to seek judicial review of agency \n     compliance with the Act within one year after final agency \n     action, except where a provision of law requires a shorter \n     period for challenging a final agency actions. The \n     prohibition on judicial enforcement of the RFA is contrary to \n     the general principle of administrative law, and it has long \n     been criticized by small business owners. Many small business \n     owners believe that agencies have given lip service at best \n     to RFA, and small entities have been denied legal recourse to \n     enforce the Act's requirements.\n       The amendment is not intended to encourage or allow \n     spurious lawsuits which might hinder important governmental \n     functions. The one-year limitation on seeking judicial review \n     ensures that this legislation will not permit indefinite, \n     retroactive application of judicial review. The bill does not \n     subject all regulations issued since the enactment of the RFA \n     to judicial review. After the effective date, if the court \n     finds that a final agency action was arbitrary, capricious, \n     an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with \n     the law, the court may set aside the rule or order the agency \n     to take other corrective action. The court may also decide \n     that the failure to comply with the RFA warrants remanding \n     the rule to the agency or delaying the application of the \n     rule to small entities pending completion of the court \n     ordered corrective action. However, in some circumstances, \n     the court may find that there is good cause to allow the rule \n     to be enforced and to remain in effect pending the corrective \n     action.\n\n                              Section 403\n\n       The bill requires agencies to publish their factual, policy \n     and legal reasons when making a certification under section \n     605 of the RFA that the regulations will not impose a \n     significant economic impact on a substantial number of small \n     entities.\n\n                              Section 404\n\n       The bill amends the existing requirements of RFA section \n     609 for small business participation in the rulemaking \n     process by incorporating a modified version of S. 917, the \n     Small Business Advocacy Act, introduced by Senator Domenici, \n     to provide early input from small businesses into the \n     regulatory process. For proposed and final rules with a \n     significant economic impact on a substantial number of small \n     entities, EPA and OSHA would have to collect advice and \n     recommendations from small businesses to better inform the \n     agency's regulatory flexibility analysis on the potential \n     impacts of the rule.\n       The agency promulgating the rule would consult with the \n     SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy to identify individuals who \n     are representative of affected small businesses. The Agency \n     would designate a senior level official to be responsible for \n     implementing this section and chairing an interagency review \n     panel for the rule. The findings of the panel and the \n     comments of small business representatives would be made \n     public as part of the rulemaking record. The final bill \n     includes modifications requested by Senator Domenici after \n     consultations with the Administration. These modifications \n     clarify the timing of the review panel and create a limited \n     process allowing the Chief Counsel to waive certain \n     requirements of the section after consultation with the \n     Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs and small \n     businesses.\n\n  Mr. BOND. How much time does the Senator from Montana require?\n  Mr. BURNS. How much time does the Senator have?\n  Mr. BOND. I ask the Chair that question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 24 minutes, and \nthe Senator from Arkansas has 29 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield to the Senator from Montana 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair. It has been my pleasure to serve on the \nSmall Business Committee ever since I came to the Senate, and under the \nchairmanship of both Senator Bond and Senator Bumpers. I know of the \nhours they put in on this and the leadership they display. They have \nbeen trying to do this for quite a while. Finally, we have a product on \nthe floor that I think will work.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 942, the Small Business \nRegulatory Fairness Act. This is a bill that we have worked on in the \nSmall Business Committee, with the help of many\n\n[[Page S2160]]\n\nWhite House Committee on Small Business delegates. It is a bill that \nwill give much needed relief to small businesses all across the \ncountry. And the end result will benefit us all.\n  Small businesses are responsible for the vast majority of new jobs \ncreated in the last year, in spite of everything the Government is \ndoing to hinder that growth. In Montana, where 98 percent of our \nbusinesses are considered small business, not 1 day goes by that I do \nnot hear ``Get the Government off our backs and we would be creating \nmore jobs,'' or ``If you would just get out of the way, more folks \nwould be starting new businesses and our economy would be improving.''\n  Mr. President, from the awesome amount of paperwork that various \nGovernment agencies require to the fines that threaten small businesses \nif they do not comply with the thousands of regulations imposed on \nthem, it is no wonder that some folks are discouraged from starting or \ngrowing their business.\n  This bill will ease some of that burden. It makes it easier for small \nbusinesses to comply with regulations by letting them know what is \nexpected from them--in clear, simple language. And if the rule is not \nclear or not spelled out specifically in a compliance guide, the small \nbusiness cannot be penalized. It is just one way of making the \nGovernment agency more responsible--and of making compliance easier on \nour small businesses. Who can argue with that?\n  It also directs the SBA to set up regional ombudsmen for small \nbusiness and agriculture, giving folks a place to go to voice their \ncomplaints about unfair enforcement of regulations--without fear of \nretribution. This provides a check on the agency, forcing their \ninspectors to be accountable for their actions. Small businesses can \ncritique the inspectors and Government lawyers, and we then get an idea \nof how responsive different agencies are to small business.\n  There are a lot of ways we can help small business today. The White \nHouse Conference on Small Business produced 60 recommendations of what \nwe can do to help. In nearly every category, dealing with regulations \nwas mentioned. There is much more to be done to curtail unnecessary \nregulations and reduce the presence of Government in our lives--but \nthis is just a first step.\n  We will always have rules and regulations--that is just the way our \nGovernment works. And no doubt we need some of those. But let us make \nit easy to understand and easy to comply. Let us give those being \nregulated a fair chance. I would encourage my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation on Tuesday by voting for its passage. I know \nMontana's small businesses are counting on this and I would imagine \nthat small businesses all across the country, as well as their \ncustomers, would be eager to see this passed.\n  Mr. President, we hear stories in our home States--we all have them--\nwhen we go home and sit down with the people who are providing the \nbiggest percentage of new jobs in this country, which is the small \nbusiness community, the entrepreneurs just starting out, and they are \nexpanding. We know how important this is. They are also saying that we \nhave to get Government off of their backs. If we just get out of the \nway, more folks would go into business and they would start expanding \nthe economy as much as they can, just on a new idea, making some things \nhappen.\n  Government rules and regulations are always going to exist in some \nareas of business and in other areas of our life, but now we will have \na part of Government that is actually going to be an advocate for small \nbusiness. This will put a person in the region to whom a small business \ncan go and take the problem they are having with a regulatory agency--\nsomeone to hear them out and who they could have a relationship with, \nso that they might solve their problems.\n  Mr. President, we had a big problem in the State of Montana in the \nwood products industry, which is a big industry. We have some post and \npole people who treated fencepost or treated lumber. They used some \nchemicals that, yes, are highly toxic. Rather than working with the \npeople to get them in compliance, the EPA just went and found the \nviolations and made the fines so big, and the cleanup so expensive, \nthat they all went broke. I can cite four in the State of Montana \nalone. Here is the bad part about it. I forget the chemical they dip \nthe posts into now, but there was one full 55-gallon drum and one half-\nfull of creosote. What they did is, after they took the soil, they \nhired a person from Portland with an incinerator to burn the soil, and \na soil handler from Florida to bring it clear to Montana, and we have \npeople in Montana that can do the same thing. That was all charged \nagainst the owner. Then they left this big hole in the ground. They did \nnot finish burning their soil. They gave up on that. They actually \nopened up the 55-gallon drum and poured what was left in it back into \nthe hole, contaminating the whole area.\n  Now, this is our Government at work. And then they told the poor guy, \n``Fence that off, would you?'' He put up a 36-inch web around it \nwithout any barb on top of it.\n  We can cite time after time after time examples of regulators or \nregulation enforcers that set up their own little fiefdom, and they are \nking for a day. And we hope this piece of legislation, which all of us \nhad a hand in developing, will do something about that.\n  I am really happy that our good friend from Oklahoma is pursuing the \nway we write our regulations, the way we write our administrative \nrules, after the piece of legislation has been introduced. I have been \npreaching on that for a long time. Those rules and regulations should \ncome back to the committee of jurisdiction, if nothing else, to be \nreviewed so that they do reflect the intent of the law and the intent \nthat we had.\n  I congratulate my chairman and ranking member on this committee \nbecause I think it is a humongous step in the right direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMontana. I note that he has been a very active participant in hearings, \nand he also held a very useful and productive hearing in Montana. He \nhas contributed greatly to his committee.\n  Now I will yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma, who has been \nvery active in our issues and has come before our committee to testify \non a number of small business issues. We are very happy to be able to \naccept an amendment that he and Senator Reid of Nevada have offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I want to compliment my colleague, \nthe chairman of the Small Business Committee, Senator Bond, for his \nleadership, as well as that of Senator Bumpers. It is great to see two \npeople work together and push legislation that will be a real asset to \nsmall business. That is exactly what they have done. They have worked \ntirelessly in this committee. I served on that committee, and I tell my \ncolleague, when I served on that committee, it was kind of frustrating \nbecause we talked a lot, but we did not do much.\n  Frankly, the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Arkansas are \ndoing things, passing legislation to help small business, trying to \nmake sure with the legislation they have introduced today that the \nimpact of regulations on small business will be heard. If, for some \nreason, the regulatory agencies do not take small business impacts into \naccount, their legislation will provide a means for directing the \nagencies to take those impacts into account in their regulations. So I \ncompliment them for their efforts and leadership.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3534\n\n                (Purpose: To provide for a substitute.)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, in order to make the procedural activities \nwork appropriately, if the Senator from Oklahoma will withhold, I send \nto the desk the managers' amendment on behalf of Senator Bumpers and \nmyself and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the managers' amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself and Mr. \n     Bumpers, proposes an amendment numbered 3534.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S2161]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3535 to Amendment No. 3534\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure economy and efficiency of Federal Government \n   operations by establishing a moratorium on regulatory rulemaking \n                    actions, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for himself, Mr. \n     Reid, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Dole, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Feingold, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3535 to amendment No. 3534.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this is an amendment on which Senator \nReid, myself, and many others in the Senate, including Senator \nHutchison, Senator Bond, Senator Bumpers, have had a lot of input. We \nworked on it a lot and actually passed this amendment through the \nSenate on March 29, 1995, by a vote of 100 to 0. This amendment was in \ncontrast to some legislation that the House passed. The House passed a \nmoratorium on all regulations. We considered in the Senate actually a \nbill somewhat similar to that, which had passed through the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. However, this is a substitute.\n  The moratorium would have lasted only until the end of last year; it \nwould have expired December 31, 1995. It would not have an impact \ntoday. It might have stopped some regulations that were going forward \nin that period of time. This legislation, though, will be permanent \nlaw. We did pass it with bipartisan support. I thank Senator Reid. It \nis not often that we have bipartisan support on legislation that will \nreally have a significant impact. I am glad we have it in the \nlegislation that Senator Bond and Senator Bumpers had, the so-called \nreg flex proposal, and also the congressional review proposal that \nSenators Reid, Hutchison, and myself are pushing today.\n  This legislation, instead of having a moratorium, we will have a \npermanent law that says Congress should review all new regulations. If \nyou find that an agency passes a final rule and it has a significant \nimpact, and you do not like it, you should stop it, you should change \nit. We, in Congress, many times will pass a law and congratulate \nourselves and say we did a good job, give the regulatory agencies a \nfair amount of flexibility in implementing that law, but then we kind \nof turn our backs and we get busy and forget about what we did.\n  Then we find the full impact of the law once it is final and the \nrules are promulgated. It may be a year or two after we pass the \nlegislative language that we find that rules issued pursuant to that \nlaw have a very significant economic impact--sometimes very, very \nsignificant negative economic impact. Sometimes the rules can be \nenormously expensive. Sometimes they can be ludicrous.\n  Yet we are sitting on our hands in Congress. And our constituents are \nsaying, ``When did you guys pass that law? What did you do? Do you know \nwhat you were doing?'' A lot of times we sit back and say, ``Well, the \nlaw had very good intentions.'' And, if you read the statutory \nlanguage, it sounded pretty good. But the final rules implementing the \nstatutory language leave a lot to be desired.\n  This proposal would say that when the regulatory agencies make their \nfinal rule, notification of that final rule will be sent to Congress, \nand sent to the GAO. And we can review it. If it is a major rule, or \nsignificant rule as determined by the administration, usually if it has \nan economic impact over $100 million on the economy, that rule will be \nsuspended for 45 days. So it does not go into effect immediately. So we \nhave a chance to listen to people, and before it becomes final we can \nstop it. Under this proposal, Congress can pass a joint resolution of \ndisapproval. We have expedited procedures in the bill so no one can \nfilibuster, or stop the will of the majority.\n  So, you can get a vote in both Houses passing a resolution of \ndisapproval, and send it to the White House, and say, ``No. We think \nthis rule is a mistake. This is not what we meant. We think it goes too \nfar. It is too expensive, too cumbersome''--for whatever reason; maybe \nbecause our constituents are telling us this rule does not make sense. \nMaybe the rule does not have an economic impact over $100 million. It \ndoes not have to, if our constituents convince us that the rule does \nnot make sense. We can stop it.\n  That is what this legislation is all about. This is going to \nencourage congressional review of rules and I think put more \nresponsibility on Congress. We have not done very good in legislative \noversight. Maybe we are too busy. For whatever reason, there are lots \nof rules and regulations out there that many people say are idiotic and \ndo not make sense, and they are too expensive.\n  I see the occupant of the chair. I know of his profession prior to \ncoming to the Senate as a physician. And I can think of one law that \npassed--the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act. It had very good \nintentions. But the net result was that in a lot of areas it was very \nexpensive. As a matter of fact, I had physicians in my State telling \nme, ``Wait a minute. We cannot do lab tests in our own office. We have \nbeen doing it for 20 years. And I have to give blood tests. I have to \ngive results to my patients, and quickly, if I am going to give quality \nhealth care. And now I have a rule implementing the Clinical Laboratory \nImprovement Act which says that I cannot do that in my office. I have \nto send it off to a pathologist in Nashville, TN, or Oklahoma City, or \nMaine. Their office is 200 miles away, and it may take 24 hours or 48 \nhours to turn that around.'' That is dangerous medicine. Maybe that \nrule implementing the legislative act went too far.\n  This proposal would give us a chance, if a regulatory agency comes \ndown with a rule, to review that rule. And, if we do not like it for \nany reason, we can stop it and we send it to the President. If he \ndisagrees with us, he can veto it.\n  Mr. President, I can think of any number of agencies that Congress \nneeds to spend more time watching. And, again, maybe all of the \nlegislation had very good intent. But the regulations' impact went too \nfar.\n  There is a rule floating around right now in OSHA called ergonomics. \nIt sounds very good. It protects people from injuries caused by \nrepetitive motions. But, all of a sudden, the Department of Labor is \ntelling people how high their desk has to be, or are getting ready to \ntell people that they cannot lift a box or a package which is over 25 \npounds. The Department of Labor is suggesting you must have two people. \nThere are implications from this regulatory proposal that could cost \nbillions of dollars. Maybe something needs to be done to prevent injury \nto people from repetitive motions in the workplace. However, if the \nDepartment of Labor comes up with a final rule that is similar to the \nergonomics language they have been floating, I think of a lot of us \nwould say, ``Stop that. Wait a minute.''\n\n  I grew up in a machine shop. If you had someone saying that you \ncannot move anything over 25 pounds--we move a lot of heavy equipment \naround--that rule would not work.\n  So again we need a little common sense. That is what this legislation \nis all about. It is congressional review. If regulatory agencies pass a \nrule and it does not make sense, we have 45 days to pass a joint \nresolution of disapproval, and we have expedited procedures. People \nwill not be able to filibuster that rule. So we can get it through the \nSenate, if you have 51 votes, and through the House if they have a \nmajority vote, and send it to the President. If he feels very strongly \nthat that rule does not need to be rewritten or reviewed, he can veto \nit. And we can try to override his veto. So we still have checks and \nbalances. We do not suspend all rules for the 45 days, but only those \nrules that have significant economic impact as defined by the \nadministration.\n  We made a few changes--which are different in the legislation that we \npassed last year in March. We changed\n\n[[Page S2162]]\n\nthe name of the legislation to the Congressional Review Act. We put in \nan exemption for hunting and fishing rules. The 45-day delay provision \nwas changed to a complete exemption--which is different in the \nlegislation the Senate passed last March. That was sought by Senator \nStevens. And I appreciate his input.\n  Also, final rules that were issued pursuant to the Telecommunications \nAct of 1996 are made exempt from the automatic 45-day delay provision \nto ensure that short deadlines recently given the FCC under \nTelecommunications Act can better be met.\n  Also, the look-back provision that was provided to permit \ncongressional review of significant final rules issued between November \n20, 1994 and date of enactment was modified by replacing ``November 20, \n1994'' with ``March 1, 1996.'' In other words, we say that this law \nwill be effective for congressional review beginning March 1, 1996.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues--most of all, Senator Reid because I \nhave worked with him on many issues over the years, and regulatory \nreform has been in the forefront of our efforts. We know that we need \nto reduce--if not eliminate--unnecessary, burdensome, and excessively \ncostly regulations. Adoption of our amendment is an important step in \nputting Congress back to the table.\n  This bill that we will pass shortly--finally I guess next Tuesday--in \nthe Senate is going to make Congress be more responsible. Then if the \nregulatory agency passes a bad rule and we do not review it, that is \nour fault. Congress needs to step up. Committee chairs need to step up \nand monitor what the regulatory agencies are doing. And, if they do a \nbad job, we need to hold them accountable.\n  So it puts more responsibility on the Congress. We just cannot blame \nthe agencies and wash our hands. If we pass a good bill--and say, ``I \ncannot believe those regulatory agencies interpreted it that way. I \ncannot believe they did it''--now we have a chance to say, ``Wait, \nagencies. You went too far. Rewrite your rules. Change it. Take into \naccount what people are saying in rural Tennessee, or rural Missouri, \nor whatever that impact is in Arkansas.''\n  So I think it is vitally important. This is good legislation. This \nwill help.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues from Missouri and Arkansas for their \nlegislation both on reg flex, and for their cooperation and support on \ncongressional review.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last year, this same amendment passed this \nbody unanimously by a vote of 98 to 0. I remain convinced that this \nlegislation, offered by my good friend, the senior Senator from \nOklahoma, and myself, is a good solution to the problem of excessive \nbureaucratic regulation. This amendment, like this bill, will do a lot \nto put common sense back into our regulations.\n  As I visit the communities around Nevada, big and small, I see many \nsmall businesses trying to compete in these evolving markets. I know of \nmany local shops and enterprises that cater to small towns just trying \nto remain solvent. It is the same in our big cities, Mr. President. \nGovernment should not be an obstacle to commerce and competition. I am \nafraid that in too many cases it is.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has estimated the cost of complying with \nregulations is $510 billion a year, approximately 9 percent of our \ngross domestic product.\n  The amount of time spent filling out paperwork has also been \nestimated at about $7 billion. I think that is too low. I think it is \nmuch higher than that. Now, not all regulations are bad. Some \nregulations are valuable and serve important purposes, but because of \nthe regulatory efforts that we have made, we have made great progress. \nOur workplaces are generally safer. We have much cleaner water than we \nused to have, both in our rivers and streams and in our drinking water. \nAir quality standards are better than they used to be. The problem, \nthough, is that many times we pass laws and then the bureaucrats step \nin and make very complicated regulations that go beyond the intent of \nour law, beyond our sound policy.\n  These complex regulations, as I have stated, go way beyond the intent \nof Congress and fail to recognize the practical implications and impact \nof these regulations. Under the current regulatory environment, small \nbusiness owners must hire entire legal departments to comply with these \ncountless regulations. This reality has led Americans to become \nfrustrated and skeptical of Government, and that is not the way it \nshould be. According to polls, more than half the American public \nbelieve that regulations affecting businesses do more harm than good. \nThat is certainly too bad.\n\n  This amendment will allow the Congress to look at these major rules \nbefore they go into effect. We are going to pass some more laws, but \nwhen the regulations are promulgated, we are going to have the \nopportunity to look at them. If we do not like these regulations, we \ncan veto them, in effect. That is the way it should be.\n  This amendment will allow Congress to look at these major rules. This \namendment enables Congress to examine the regulations that are being \npromulgated and decide whether they achieve the purposes they were \nsupposed to achieve in a rationale, economic, and least burdensome way. \nCongress is intended to be more than just a roadblock for regulators, \nbut a voice representing the many segments of society to put democracy \nback in public policy.\n  This amendment is one that Members on both sides of the aisle can \nvote for because when we first offered it, it passed 98 to 0. And, \nsecond, it takes a commonsense approach to an issue that we all agree \nis a significant problem, that is, complex and burdensome regulations.\n  Mr. President, Americans want Congress to work together to get \nGovernment working for them, not against them. This amendment is one of \nthose that will probably not receive a single line of print in a \nnewspaper. Why? Because it is going to be accepted unanimously, \nprobably, unless someone makes a mistake and votes against it. But it \nwill pass overwhelmingly. It is being offered by the chairman of the \nDemocratic Policy Committee and the chairman of the Republican Policy \nCommittee--Senators Reid and Nickles. We need to do more stuff \ntogether. We need to set an example to the American public that we can \nwork together in a bipartisan fashion to solve burdensome problems.\n  The way regulations are promulgated is a burdensome problem, and this \namendment will do a lot to alleviate a problem that faces all \nAmericans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. As I have already \nsaid, I believe that this is an excellent amendment. We have reviewed \nit on both sides. I commend Senator Nickles, Senator Reid, and the \nothers for it. We are prepared to accept it.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Oklahoma \nfor offering the amendment. I think it is an excellent amendment. We \ncertainly are prepared to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The amendment (No. 3535) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, at this point I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senators Baucus and Feingold be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. How much time does the Senator from Virginia wish? Five \nminutes?\n  I yield the Senator 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleagues from \nArkansas and from Missouri.\n  Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of S. 942, the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 as reported from \nthe Small Business Committee.\n  As our colleagues know, several of us--actually quite a number of \nus--have been working for many months to try to develop a responsible \ncomprehensive regulatory reform package which can achieve bipartisan \nsupport.\n\n[[Page S2163]]\n\n  The bill that we are debating this morning and will vote on on \nTuesday contains elements that were included in that broader package, \nand I am very pleased to see those provisions move forward now with \nvery significant support on both sides of the aisle.\n  Specifically, this bill on which I have had a chance to work with \nSenator Bond, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, and \nothers, allows judicial review of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n  We passed the Regulatory Flexibility Act in 1980 to guarantee that \nthe special concerns of small businesses were addressed by agencies \nwhen issuing rules, but the provisions of that act were not reviewable \nin court. Unfortunately, the fact that the act was therefore, in \neffect, unenforceable led many agencies to simply disregard its \nprovisions. Needless to say, this has created enormous frustrations for \nsmall businesses. Not only were agencies failing to consider the impact \nof regulations on small businesses, but some agencies were actually \nflouting the law by that failure. Because of agency failure to take \nsmall business concerns into account as the law required, small \nbusinesses in many instances were forced to comply with rules that were \nmore onerous than necessary simply because the agencies were refusing \nto follow the law because no courts were looking over their shoulders \nto make sure that they complied.\n  In order to make the Regulatory Flexibility Act work as intended, it \nhas become necessary to make it judicially enforceable. Agencies will \nnow be required to explain how a rule likely to have significant impact \non small businesses has been crafted to minimize that impact on those \nbusinesses or else risk court action.\n  While I am pleased that the regulatory flexibility provision is \nmoving swiftly toward becoming law, I hope--and I ask my colleagues to \njoin in this effort--that it will not divert our effort to continue to \nwork on a more comprehensive bill. I still believe that we can develop \nlegislation requiring agencies to regulate in a more cost-effective \nfashion without undermining the ability to protect our environment, our \nworkers or our public health. As I have stated in the past, if we can \nmaintain the level of protections and increase the efficiency in how we \nattain it, consumers will ultimately reap the benefits. Of course, \nevery dollar that business spends beyond what is necessary to protect \nus in our environment is one less dollar that can be used to hire an \nemployee or fund a pay raise or pay for plant expansion. Not only will \nconsumers benefit but so will the economy.\n\n  Regulating in a cost-effective fashion simply makes sense. If we can \nachieve the same environmental benefit for less money, or, even better, \nachieve more environmental benefit for the same money, then we simply \nought to do it. I will continue to work with our colleagues to try to \nmake that happen. Senator Johnston of Louisiana and I are circulating \ntoday a discussion draft which I believe meets the dual and not \nmutually exclusive goals of eliminating unnecessary costs while \nsafeguarding our environment and ourselves.\n  Again, Mr. President, I commend our colleagues, particularly the \nchairman and ranking members of the Small Business Committee, Senators \nBond and Bumpers, for taking the first steps in moving responsible \nregulatory reform. I look forward to continuing to work with all of our \ncolleagues as we try to craft a responsible comprehensive regulatory \nreform bill.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield the Senator such \ntime as she may require.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to say \nhow much I appreciate the leadership that the Senator from Missouri, \nSenator Bond, the Senator from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, have provided \nfor the small business people of our country.\n  We have been working together in the Small Business Committee for \nover a year to try to get regulatory relief for those who cannot afford \nthe excesses to spend money, frankly, on things that do not help the \nbottom line, that do not help the ability to create jobs, that do not \nhelp the ability to create new capital, and that is our small business \npeople.\n  They are the ones that just do not have that margin to be able to \nfight excessive regulations that sometimes do not make sense. I think \nall of us have come together in a very bipartisan spirit, under the \nleadership of Senator Bumpers and Senator Bond, to say, let us give \nrelief at least to the small business people of our country so that \nthey will be able to grow and prosper because what will make this \ncountry economically viable once again is strong small businesses.\n  That is what this bill does. This bill will give some relief where it \nis so needed. I especially appreciate the willingness of Senator Bond \nand Senator Bumpers to work with Senator Nickles and myself on the \namendment that will allow congressional review. Of course, that bill \nhas passed the Senate by an overwhelming margin. That would allow \nCongress to be able to review regulations that come through.\n  I think that is going to be a very important first step for \naccountability in our regulatory agencies. It is really a matter of \nCongress taking responsibility for the laws it passes and the \ndelegation that it gives to our regulators.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be listed as a cosponsor of \nthe Nickles amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of Senator Bond \nand Senator Bumpers once again. I hope that we can pass this regulatory \nbill, regulatory relief bill for our small businesses with a 100-\npercent vote. I cannot imagine anyone not wanting to do this on a very \ntimely basis. The small business owners of our country deserve this \nrelief. It will help our economy because once we free small businesses \nto be able to grow and prosper, what will happen is more jobs will be \navailable for the working people of our country. That is in all of our \nbest interests.\n  So I applaud the sponsors of the bill. I appreciate the time, and \nyield back my time. Thank you.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. I compliment Senator Hutchison on a very fine statement. She \nis also one of the faithful attendants at the Small Business Committee. \nSometimes we have difficulty getting a quorum. She is dedicated to the \nsmall business community and manifests that dedication by being a good \nsteward on that committee.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the legislation that is before us today--S. \n942, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, addresses \nwhat I believe is one of the most significant problems facing America's \nentrepreneurs and small business people, and that is the burden of \nexcessive Federal regulations. These overreaching regulations prevent \nthe birth and stunt the growth of small businesses all across the \ncountry. As part of our continuing efforts on this committee to \nstimulate business activity and increase job opportunities, this \nlegislation acts as a Heimlich maneuver for the small businesses \ncommunity that is choking on gobs of Federal redtape.\n  I would first like to thank the chairman of the Small Business \nCommittee, Senator Bond, for crafting the legislation that is before \nus--and for working to develop the strong bipartisan consensus that now \nexists for its passage. Although many often speak of their support for \nrelieving the regulatory burden shouldered by our Nation's small \nentrepreneurs, Senator Bond has taken action in the offering of this \nlegislation.\n  Using the recommendations of the White House Conference on Small \nBusiness, S. 942 provides fundamental regulatory reform in the small \nbusiness sector. This legislation contains several important measures \nessential to the future of small business in America.\n  It requires that regulators provide for a cooperative and \nconsultative regulatory environment, no longer viewing small business \nas the enemy.\n  It establishes a Small Business and Agriculture Enforcement Ombudsman \nat the Small Business Administration [SBA] that will allow small \nbusinesses\n\n[[Page S2164]]\n\nto express their concerns and complaints concerning the enforcement \nactions of agencies without fear of reprisal or retaliation.\n  It requires agencies to simplify language and to use forms that can \nactually be read and understood. I don't know how many of my colleagues \nhave attempted to read the thousands of pages of regulations that are \nissued by Federal agencies, but as the small business owners in my \nState can attest, finding the time to read the regulations is only one \none-hundreth of the battle--actually understanding them is the rest of \nthe war.\n  And perhaps most importantly, it allows small businesses to finally \nbe able to enforce a law that was enacted to fundamentally change the \nprocess by which Federal regulations are written and considered with \nrespect to small businesses: the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980.\n  I believe the Regulatory Flexibility Act remains an excellent tool \nfor serving the needs of the Nation's small business community. But I \nalso believe it must be strengthened if it is to ever fulfill its \nobjective of forcing agencies to consider the impact of their \nregulations on small businesses and giving small business owners a \nlouder voice in the regulatory process.\n  For years, the call for judicial enforcement of Reg Flex has been \nclearly sounded by our Nation's small businesses. Indeed the annual \nreport of the Chief Counsel for Advocacy in the Small Business \nAdministration even concludes that ``the only solution is to subject \nagency decisions * * * to judicial scrutiny.'' Therefore, by providing \nfor judicial enforcement of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the \nlegislation we are now considering will at last provide small \nbusinesses with the fundamental right to enforce a law that has been on \nthe books for over 16 years.\n  Small businesses play a critical role in the long-term growth and \nprosperity of our Nation by providing stable, permanent jobs. My home \nState of Maine is particularly reliant on small businesses for economic \ngrowth and job creation. Of the 29,920 firms with employees in Maine, \nall but 700 are small businesses. In addition, 61.4 percent of Maine's \nprivate nonfarm workers were employed by small businesses in 1991--far \nexceeding the national average of 54 percent.\n  Nationwide, the number of small businesses has increased by 49 \npercent since 1982. These entrepreneurs are responsible for 52 percent \nof all sales in the country, and for 50 percent of private GDP. As \nthese numbers show, small business truly is the backbone of the U.S. \neconomy.\n  This legislation recognizes that the health of the small business \ncommunity has far-reaching implications for the future, and that the \nexcessive regulatory climate facing today's small businesses is a \nthreat to the overall strength of the entire American economy.\n  This legislation represents a significant step toward our goal of \nreleasing the American entrepreneurial spirit from the bonds of \nexcessive Federal regulation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting it.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to support this legislation, the \ncommittee substitute amendment to S. 942, and I want to commend the \ndistinguished chairman of the Small Business Committee, Mr. Bond, for \nhis leadership on this bill.\n  The measure before us contains several provisions that will afford \nregulatory relief to our Nation's small businesses, and will also help \nbegin to change the attitude of Government regulators who are often \nviewed by small business as adversaries rather than as sources of help \nand guidance.\n  I am pleased that S. 942 contains many of the provisions that are \nalso in bills I have introduced, S. 1350, the Small Business Fair \nTreatment Act of 1995, and S. 554, a bill I introduced about a year ago \nthat strengthens the Equal Access to Justice Act.\n  Mr. President, the regulatory structure that has developed over the \nyears performs important safety, health, and consumer protection \nfunctions. At the same time, few would dispute that the current \nregulatory system needs meaningful reform.\n  Mr. President, I have held nearly 250 listening sessions in my home \nState of Wisconsin during the past 3 years at which many of my \nconstituents have expressed their tremendous frustration and anger with \ncertain aspects of the regulatory process that sometimes is \nimpractical, impersonal, and needlessly burdensome.\n  This body debated a regulatory reform proposal last summer that \nsought to respond to this widespread frustration and anger. But, in \nlarge part, that debate focused more on changes in the actual \nrulemaking process, and featured solutions that, if not entirely \nWashington-centered, at best took a Washington perspective in \naddressing the issue.\n  The measure before us takes a different approach--focusing on the \nday-to-day, practical problems of regulation with which small \nbusinesses must contend. I want to point to just a few of the bill's \nprovisions in which I have had a special interest, and let me begin \nwith the language strengthening the Equal Access to Justice Act.\n  That 1980 law that was intended to help small businesses and \nindividuals who get into the ring with the Federal Government over \nenforcement of regulations by allowing them to recover their legal fees \nand certain other expenses if they prevail.\n  In general, I oppose the so-called loser pays or English rule under \nwhich the loser in civil litigation must pay the costs of the \nprevailing party. The additional risk of those costs can act as a \nbarrier to the courts for those who are most vulnerable. That is not \ntrue, however, for the Government.\n  In cases where the Government brings an action against a small \nbusiness or an individual, the potential cost of losing poses no such \nbarrier to Government with its vast resources. In fact, the opposite is \ntrue.\n  The costs confronting a small business or an individual that is the \ntarget of a Government action may become a barrier to a just outcome, \npossibly forcing them to concede a violation, even when none existed, \njust to avoid costly litigation.\n  When I was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate, I authored our \nState Equal Access to Justice Act, and have been working to strengthen \nthe Federal protections since coming to this body, introducing S. 554 \nto update and streamline the law.\n  The language in this bill raises the rate at which attorney's fees \nmay be awarded from $75 to $125 an hour.\n  Further, it modifies the present standard by easing the requirement \nthat a successful claimant, in addition to prevailing on the merits, \nshow that the Government's actions were unreasonable.\n  To its credit, this bill makes that standard easier to attain, and in \nturn helps small businesses and individuals to recover their attorney's \nfees. I am pleased they were included.\n  Frankly, I believe that the substantial justification defense by \nFederal agencies should be deleted entirely and proposed doing so in my \nown legislation, S. 554.\n  While I look forward to pursuing the additional reforms found in my \nbill in the future, I applaud the authors for the improvements they \nhave included in this legislation.\n  We all know how difficult it can be on a small business owner to \novercome what is sometimes overbearing Government regulation.\n  I believe that the Equal Access to Justice Act helps ease that burden \nand that the improvements offered in S. 942 will make the act work \nbetter in the future.\n  Mr. President, as I noted earlier, there are a number of provisions \nin this bill that were the basis of many of the provisions in my own \nsmall business regulatory reform initiative, S. 1350, the Small \nBusiness Fair Treatment Act.\n  And I was glad to see the committee retained a number of those \nprovisions, including a modified version of the sections requiring \nagencies to publish compliance guides describing regulations in \nstraightforward, understandable language, and then holding agencies to \nthat description when they are enforcing the regulation.\n  Beyond the obvious help these guides could provide to businesses \naffected by a Government regulation, requiring an agency to think out \nand describe a new regulation in a clear and understandable way will \nonly enhance the ability of that agency to administer the regulation.\n  Another provision common to S. 942 and my proposal relates to so-\ncalled No-action Letters.\n\n[[Page S2165]]\n\n  Again, though the provision is slightly different from the approach I \ntook, it represents a real step forward in helping small businesses \nneeding clarification of a law or regulation in a particular instance.\n  I was also pleased to see the section in S. 942 requiring agencies to \nestablish procedures under which, in some circumstances, they will \nwaive penalties on small businesses.\n  I had included a number of provisions in my own bill that included \nsimilar features, because it is far better to allow small firms that \nwant to comply with laws and regulations to devote their limited \nresources to correcting problems rather than paying fines.\n  Mr. President, this provision will also help improve and enhance the \nrelationship between small businesses and Government agencies.\n  In listening to small businessmen and women in Wisconsin, one of the \nmost troubling complaints that is raised with respect to Government \nregulation is the feeling that Government agencies too often take a \nconfrontational or adversarial approach in dealing with the business.\n  Whether or not this feeling is justified in every instance, in many \ninstances, or in only a few, it is honestly felt and reveals a problem \nthat needs fixing.\n  In one instance, the owner of a small contracting company that does \nconstruction on older houses contacted my office expressing concern \nthat certain OSHA regulations being applied to his business were \nprobably originally created for larger construction companies dealing \nwith different types of structures and should be modified for companies \nengaged in his kind of business.\n\n  He cited requirements that he prepare a safety program for every job \nhe does--even though the homes on which he works are much the same--as \nbeing inappropriate and time-consuming, and he outlined various other \nconcerns.\n  After my office contacted the agency and asked its views on his \nsuggestions, OSHA showed up at his work site to conduct a surprise \ninspection.\n  Mr. President, a small business ought to be able to raise concerns \nabout an agency's regulations without fear of triggering an enforcement \naction.\n  When the relationship between those who oversee and enforce \nregulations and those who must observe them deteriorates in this \nmanner, it only hinders compliance.\n  By requiring agencies to establish procedures to waive penalties \nunder certain circumstances, the bill can help shape the regulatory \nstructure in a way that will begin to change the attitude of regulators \nto encourage cooperation rather than confrontation.\n  The provisions establishing a Small Business and Agriculture \nombudsman to review agency enforcement activities will also help in \nchanging agency attitudes.\n  I took a slightly different approach in my own legislation, by \nexplicitly prohibiting agency personnel practices that reward employees \nbased on the number of violations they can find or the fines they can \nlevy.\n  I included this provision in response to comments made to my office \nby small business people who have reported that agency personnel have \nfelt compelled to find something wrong, even if it is small, in order \nto justify their visit to the firm.\n  Again, though the provision in my own legislation differs from the \nbill before us, the language in S. 942 is headed in the right \ndirection, and I commend the chairman for his leadership in advocating \nthe kinds of structural changes that I believe will help change the \nrelationship between regulators and small business.\n  Mr. President, the current system is not acceptable; the need for \nreform is clear and imperative.\n  And though the larger regulatory reform legislation has bogged down, \nI very much hope a compromise can be worked out and a meaningful reform \npackage can be enacted into law.\n  But, even if a compromise on the larger regulatory reform measure can \nbe hammered out, it is likely to reflect a process-oriented approach \nthat may provide large corporate interests with avenues for relief, but \ndoes little to address the day-to-day problems facing small business.\n  Nor does such legislation address the very real feeling of small \nbusinesses that Government regulators too often act as adversaries \nrather than to provide guidance in helping firms to comply with the \nlaw.\n  By contrast, the provisions outlined in this measure both provide \nsome practical regulatory relief and can improve the relationship \nbetween businesses and agencies.\n  Mr. President, I again congratulate the senior Senator from Missouri \nfor his leadership on this measure, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthe bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am proud to support the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Fairness Act as a cosponsor.\n  Before I was elected to the Senate in 1992, I spent more than 40 \nyears in the private sector as a farmer and a businessman. I know \nfirsthand how hard it is to run a small business successfully, and how \nmuch harder it has become due to burdensome Government regulations.\n  It is only fair that we recognize the limited resources of small \nbusinesses, and the need to provide the small business community with \ngreater access to the regulatory process. This bill contains important \nprovisions that encourage comment from small business on proposed \nregulations; promote easier compliance with regulatory requirements; \nprovide that regulations be explained in a way that they can be \nunderstood by small businessmen, not just by bureaucrats; and offer \nimproved protection for small business from punitive or capricious \nactions by regulators.\n  It is encouraging that this effort to provide greater consideration \nfor small business in the regulatory process is a bipartisan effort. \nMany of the provisions in this bill are based on recommendations from \nlast year's White House Conference on Small Business. The staging of \nthis conference is a noteworthy exception to the hostility that the \nClinton administration has otherwise shown to small business.\n  Hillary Clinton built her health care plan around an employer mandate \nthat would have devastated small business. And the President vetoed \nincreased deductibility for health insurance purchased by the self-\nemployed. Also, President Clinton's vocal support for a higher minimum \nwage demonstrates his indifference to the precarious conditions that \nare the norm for most small businesses.\n  Mr. President, I think it is ironic that President Clinton would like \nto take credit for creating more than 8 million jobs over the past 3 \nyears, when he has done so much to cripple the largest producer of new \njobs, small business.\n  I hope that we can pass the Small Business Regulatory Fairness Act as \nthe first of several bills that would provide much needed relief for \nsmall business. In particular, product liability reform, and broader \nregulatory reform are desperately needed. Also, I believe that we \nshould not ignore small business when we take up health care reform. We \nshould include the deducibility provisions for the self-employed, as \nwell as provisions like medical savings accounts that would make health \ncare more affordable for small businessmen and their employees.\n  I commend the Senator from Missouri for his work on behalf of the \nsmall business community. The provisions of his bill add some badly \nneeded common sense to the regulatory process. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. This bill is regulatory \nreform in the very best sense. It will make a practical difference in \nthe daily lives of men and women who operate small businesses and \ncreate jobs in Montana and all across the country. It will do so \nwithout undermining the environmental and health and safety laws that \nprotect our families and our communities.\n  Mr. President, we need to cut back the Federal bureaucracy. I do not \nthink there is anybody who disagrees with that. There is too much \nredtape. People know that. They tell Congress that. They are correct. \nAlready the administration has eliminated some 16,000 pages of Federal \nrules and redtape. Think of that. The administration has already \neliminated 16,000 pages. It is a good start but we can do more.\n  Moreover, some Federal regulations just do not make sense like the \nrule\n\n[[Page S2166]]\n\nthat required loggers in northwest Montana to buy steel toed boots even \nthough they work on slippery frozen slopes where those kinds of boots \ncan actually create a hazard, or the rule that would have banned the \nuse of common bear sprays that hikers need to protect themselves.\n  Rules like these drive Montanans crazy, with good reason.\n  We got those rules withdrawn. But we need a more comprehensive \nsolution, so we do not have to react to every stupid rule that comes \nalong. And, in large measure, this bill provides it.\n  Three aspects of the bill are particularly important.\n  The first is making is simpler for business to comply with the law.\n  We need strong health and safety laws. And we need them enforced. \nBut, when it comes to small businesses, regulators need to start with \nan attitude of cooperation rather than confrontation.\n  Montana small businesses want to comply with the law. After all, they \nlive in the community. They want it to be clean and safe.\n  But, in too many cases, the laws and regulations are written in such \ngobbledy-gook that average folks cannot figure out what they are \nsupposed to do.\n  This bill helps. For example, it requires agencies to issue \nguidebooks, written in plain English, explaining what steps a small \nbusiness must take to comply with new rules.\n  And it requires agencies to give decent answers to small businesses \nthat have specific questions about how a new rule applies to them.\n  Now, these requirements may be bad news for lawyers, but they are \ngood news for small businesses.\n  The second is strengthening the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n  Reg flex, as it is called, is designed to make sure that as they \nwrite new rules, the bureaucrats pay specific attention to how small \nbusinesses and towns will be affected. Unfortunately, this requirement \nhas been ignored to often.\n  So the bill allows a small business to go to court to require an \nagency to comply with the law.\n  During last year's debate on regulatory reform, I was concerned about \ncreating dozens of new opportunities for lawsuits, especially from \nlarge corporations, that would clog the courts and bring things to a \nhalt.\n  But I think the provision in this bill makes good sense. It will not \nhave that same defect. It is focused on small business. And it just \nassures that agencies have taken a reasonable look at the impact their \nrules will have on small businesses.\n  The third is the Nickles-Reid amendment. This provision requires \nagencies to submit major new rules to Congress for review before they \nbecome effective.\n  This review will inject an important check into the system. We in \nCongress can be a backstop for common sense. We can help sort out the \ngood rules from the bad.\n  If an agency goes haywire, like OSHA did with its logging rule, \nCongress can reject the rule. But if an agency is doing a good job, \nprotecting public health and safety, things will stay right on track.\n  All told, Mr. President, this is a solid bill. It will cut redtape \nand make the bureaucracy more responsive to the concerns of small \nbusinesses.\n  Moreover, it is a bipartisan bill. It is a model of how we should be \nlegislating around here.\n  I compliment the chairman of the Small Business Committee, Senator \nBond, and the ranking member, Senator Bumpers, for their hard work \ndrafting this bill, developing a consensus, and bringing the bill to \nthe floor. I am proud to cosponsor it and hope it will pass with \noverwhelming support.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as a former small businessman, I understand \nthe need for regulatory relief and flexibility for small businesses.\n  Recent estimates indicate that regulations cost employees more than \n$5,000, with much of the cost wrapped into an unbelievable 1.9 billion \nhours filling out forms, each year.\n  In addition to killing jobs, the cost of this red tape is passed \ndirectly to consumers through higher prices on goods and services. The \nworkers are tired of Washington bureaucrats eating up their wage \nincreases.\n  Over the last 3 years I have met with hundreds of workers who have \ndetailed the tremendous burdens of Government rules and regulations.\n  I also met with many job providers at last year's White House \nConference on Small Business. Delegates from every State came together \nto discuss the problems that job providers face and to suggest ways in \nwhich Congress could help.\n  The bill before us today is a direct result of their efforts. \nAlthough it addresses just a few of their suggestions, I am here to \nlend my support to this first step in providing small business with \nsome real regulatory relief.\n  In 1980, Congress passed the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This bill \nrequired that Federal agencies consider the impact of proposed \nregulations on job. Unfortunately, that law didn't give job providers \nmuch of an enforcement mechanism.\n  This bill will change that.\n  At the suggestion of the White House Conference, this legislation \nwill reduce the impact of Federal regulations on job providers by \nauthorizing judicial review of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A court \ncould set aside a rule, or order an agency to take corrective action if \nit finds an action was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or \notherwise not in accordance with law.\n  The bill will also create an atmosphere of cooperation between job \nproviders and regulatory agencies, by giving job providers the \nopportunity to participate in the rulemaking process and by allowing \nagencies to wave penalties for first-time rule infractions.\n  This bill allows job providers to conduct their work on a level \nplaying field by providing an opportunity to correct arbitrary \nenforcement actions and require Federal agencies to be less punitive \nand more solution oriented.\n  Most importantly, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness \nAct will require Federal agencies to examine the need for regulations \nand weigh them against the Nation's need for job creation.\n  In closing, Mr. President, regulatory reform is absolutely essential \nif job providers and workers are going to grow and continue to create \nthe jobs that propel the economy and promote prosperity.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. It is a first step in \nchanging Federal agencies policies that kill jobs, and a first step \ntoward removing the shackles of unnecessary Government rules and \nregulation from American workers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes and 20 seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. Six minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes, twenty-four seconds, and twenty-\nfour minutes on the other side.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield the Senator from Georgia 3 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank my distinguished colleague from Missouri.\n  I rise in support of his extended efforts to reduce and relieve \nAmerican business of the enormous regulatory burdens that we have put \non the sector of our economy that generates the vast majority of the \nnew jobs.\n  We just held a field hearing of the Small Business Committee in \nGeorgia, and this quote was most alarming. One businessman came before \nthe committee, and he said:\n\n       The Federal Government of the United States of America has \n     become the No. 1 enemy of small business.\n\n  It was astounding to hear the presentations of these business people \nas they pointed time and time again to the onerous burdens that are \nbeing put on them and their inability to match them. Sixty percent of \nAmerica's businesses have four employees or less. How in the world can \nthey possibly keep up with the staggering requirements coming year \nafter year on these small businesses? The result is they do not hire \nanother employee.\n  The Lord's prayer has 66 words; the Gettysburg Address 286 words. \nThere are 1,322 words in the Declaration of Independence, Mr. \nPresident. But Government regulations on the sale of cabbage has a \ntotal of 26,911 words--on the sale of cabbage. According to the Georgia \nNFIB, there are 168,000 businesses in Georgia, and 53 percent have four \nor less employees.\n\n[[Page S2167]]\n\n  I wish to reiterate again and again, there is absolutely no way for \nthese very small businesses to match the enormous regulatory burden \nthat has built up over the last 20 years. This is where we are creating \nnew jobs. We have to take steps, as this bill does, to make it more \npossible for small businesses to expand and to hire new employees.\n  The greatest thing we can do for that person standing in line trying \nto find a new job is to make a healthier climate for small business in \nAmerica.\n  I yield back whatever time is remaining to the chairman.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I might say to my colleague from Georgia \nthat we have been graciously offered additional time from the minority \nside. If the Senator has additional comments, we would be happy to \nyield, speaking on behalf of the minority, 3 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator. I appreciate the extension of the \ntime from the minority. I do have a few more things to say about the \nhearing that was held in Georgia.\n  The Georgia Public Policy Foundation conducted a survey on behalf of \nmy own small business advisory task force and found the following: The \nestimated cost of regulation as a percentage of sales was approximately \n1.5 percent; 24 percent of these businesses have been involved in \nregulation-related lawsuits. That means that one in four companies, one \nin four small businesses in our State has had to be involved in a \nlawsuit, a lawsuit and all the expenses associated with that, over \nregulation; 53 percent of the respondents indicated--and this is the \nmost important fact--53 percent, over half, responded that they would \nhire additional employees in the last 3 years if it had not been for \nthe costs of regulation.\n\n  So, once again, as I said a moment ago, regulation itself and the \nextent of it and the size of it and scope of it is causing people to \nnot get hired because the money is going to manage the regulations and \nnot to pay the salary of a person who is looking for a job.\n  Prof. Gerald Gay, chairman of the department of finance at Georgia \nState University, strongly endorsed the concept of strengthening the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act, which is what we are doing today, \nspecifically calling for judicial review, which is what we are doing \ntoday.\n  He went on to note that regulations are of concern to large and small \nbusinesses. The difference is that small business cannot absorb the \nexcessive regulatory compliance costs that larger businesses can. This \nputs them at a competitive disadvantage. As I said, it keeps them from \nhiring another employee, and keeps them from starting a business in the \nfirst place.\n  Professor Gay, in his testimony, had an interesting quote from one of \nour early Presidents and writers of the Declaration of Independence, \nThomas Jefferson. I have often used this quote:\n\n       A wise and frugal government which shall restrain men from \n     injuring one another, which shall leave them otherwise free \n     to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, \n     and which shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it \n     has earned.\n\n  This is the sum of good government. It is that very salient point \nthat American Government has forgotten in the last 20 or 30 years. We \nare denying the people the ability to be entrepreneurial, we are \ndenying people the opportunity to focus on their work, and we have \nturned the Government from being a good partner into being a bully \nboss. This legislation remembers that the Government is supposed to be \na partner first.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Tennessee be granted 4 minutes from the minority side on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support of \nS. 942, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. First, \nI want to commend the distinguished managers of this legislation, \nSenator Bond and Senator Bumpers, for their tireless, bipartisan \nefforts to bring this legislation to the floor of the Senate. Today, I \nam proud to join them and my colleagues on the Small Business Committee \nin providing regulatory relief for our Nation's job creation engine--\nsmall business.\n  Mr. President, the high cost of Federal regulations is restricting \neconomic growth in this country. Regulations are really hidden taxes; \nthey drive up the cost of doing business. As this chart shows, the cost \nof regulations has risen rapidly over the last 10 years. Today, \nregulatory costs exceed $600 billion a year, a 30-percent increase over \na decade ago. That's $600 billion in lost job creation, lost \nproductivity, and lost economic growth. By the year 2000, regulatory \ncosts are expected to continue growing.\n  However, this chart does not show that regulatory burdens fall \ndisproportionately on small business. Recent research by the SBA found \nthat small businesses bear over 60 percent of total business regulatory \ncosts. Specifically, the average annual cost of regulatory, paperwork, \nand tax compliance for small business is $5,000 per employee while the \ncost for large businesses is only $3,400 per employee. This is no way \nto treat our Nation's No. 1 job creators who employ more than half of \nour entire work force.\n  Mr. President, let me briefly illustrate this problem in more \npersonal terms. Last year, Chairman Bond joined me in Memphis for a \nSmall Business Committee field hearing where we listened directly to \nthe regulatory problems of small business owners. Ron Coleman, an auto \nparts manufacturer in Memphis, told us about the unique regulatory \nburdens that he faces. He said ``Government regulation is the single \nmost time-consuming aspect of my business. Small businesses must deal \nwith the same rules and regulations as large businesses, only we are \nunable to call the human resource director, the vice president of \ngovernmental affairs, the corporate legal department, or the OSHA \ncoordinator for help.'' The legislation before us today will help hard-\nworking entrepreneurs like Ron.\n  S. 942 includes many provisions that will reform the regulatory \nprocess, but I want to highlight the enforcement reforms in particular. \nOne of the stated purposes of this bill is ``to create a more \ncooperative regulatory environment among agencies and small businesses \nthat is less punitive and more solution-oriented.''\n  Senator Shelby and I have worked very hard over the last year to \nenact a small business regulatory bill of rights to change the \nconfrontational nature of regulatory enforcement. We believe that small \nbusinesses should be able to participate in voluntary compliance audit \nand compliance assistance programs that protect them from excessive \nfines and penalties. We also believe that agencies should factor \nability to pay into their penalty assessments so that small firms are \nnot driven out of business by an excessive fine. Section 202 begins to \naddress these concerns, but it can be strengthened. I thank Senators \nBond and Bumpers for working with me and Senator Shelby on this \nsection. I look forward to working with both of you in further hearings \non this issue.\n  Mr. President, I would like to close today with this thought. For \nyears, business owners and their employees on the front lines have been \ndelivering the same clear and concise message to Congress: the Federal \nGovernment is strangling us with regulations, compliance, burdens, and \naggressive enforcement, and we need relief. If Congress passes the bill \nbefore us today and the President signs it into law, we at last can \nreply to them with an equally clear message: we have heard you, and we \nare taking action. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation that will foster a new era of entrepreneurial growth in \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I want to take a minute to say how much we \nappreciate the contributions of the Senator from Tennessee. He \norganized a very productive field hearing for us. It was most \ninformative. He has been an active participant in the work of the Small \nBusiness Committee, and we certainly appreciate his efforts. I thank \nhim for his remarks today as well as his contributions in making this a \nbetter bill.\n  Mr. President, we have no other business on this side and not much \ntime. If the ranking member agrees, I think we might proceed to a voice \nvote on the adoption of the substitute amendment\n\n[[Page S2168]]\n\nor such comments as the Senator from Arkansas might have.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I just want to close my part of the \nprogram by complimenting my very able and long-time assistant, John \nBall, who has been with the Small Business Committee as both staff \ndirector and director for the ranking member now for many, many years. \nHe has performed yeoman service on this.\n  I also hasten to say that the work of Keith Cole and Louis Taylor has \nbeen truly outstanding. Between these three people, and Senator Bond \nand myself, but especially the staff members, we think we have crafted \na pretty good bill. I want to pay my special thanks publicly to these \nstaffers who have labored very hard to make this possible.\n  I am prepared to go forward with final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The question is on agreeing to the \nsubstitute amendment, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 3534), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the committee \namendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended.\n  The committee amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask that this measure be set aside \npursuant to the previous agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is set aside.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, pursuant to a previous agreement between the \nleaders, the vote will be set aside until Tuesday.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Murkowski be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I join with my ranking member in \ncomplimenting the staff. John Ball I have worked with for several \nyears. We are very pleased with the leadership of Louis Taylor on the \nSmall Business Committee and Keith Cole who has had previous experience \non the other side in Congress, and we are delighted that he has come to \nbe with us on the Senate side.\n  These three staffers have had a very interesting several weeks. They \nhave had an opportunity to meet more people in this administration. We \nhave had the support from the elected officials in the Federal \nGovernment for regulatory reform, but we have certainly had a \ntremendous amount of interest and attention and full-time, around-the-\nclock work for our staff members dealing with the members of the \nagencies who will be affected.\n  I can say to all of our friends in small businesses and small \nentities around the country that it is quite apparent that this measure \nwill have an impact on the way that agencies deal with small entities \nand small businesses.\n  I believe that we have, with the help of many useful comments from \nthe agencies themselves, crafted a workable but significant change in \nthe culture of the Federal agencies in regard to small entities and \nsmall businesses.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have nothing further to add. I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/15/senate-section/article/S2148-4", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2168-S2178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BALANCED BUDGET DOWNPAYMENT ACT, II\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I have a unanimous-consent request that \nhas been agreed to on both sides that I would like to propound at this \ntime.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to send an \namendment to the desk at this time; further, that it not count as one \nof the managers' amendments under the consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3536 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3536 to amendment No. 3466.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 577 of the pending amendment, strike lines 14 \n     through the period on line 23.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, my amendment strikes a portion of this \nbill related to Oregon's request for a welfare waiver. I am striking \nthis language because the Secretary of Health and Human Services has \nnow assured me that the administration will complete its commitment to \nmy State.\n  I should like to read the letter to the Senate that I have just \nreceived from Secretary Shalala.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of my colleague, \nSenator Wyden, as well, because he has been deeply involved and \ninterested and concerned about this issue as well.\n  The letter is addressed to me as chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am pleased to inform you that an \n     agreement has been reached between the Department of Health \n     and Human Services officials and the State of Oregon on the \n     key issues that would allow the State to implement the Oregon \n     Option welfare reform demonstration for AFDC, JOBS, and \n     related HHS programs, including issues pertaining to federal \n     funding. The uniqueness of Oregon's proposal in the context \n     of the Administration's Memorandum of Understanding with the \n     State warrants a special approach, to be applied only in \n     Oregon, to carrying out this demonstration. You have my \n     commitment that I officially will grant the waiver as soon as \n     HHS staff and State staff can finalize the details of an \n     agreement.\n       Oregon and HHS staff together have crafted an agreement \n     that demonstrates a solid partnership for testing new \n     approaches to welfare reform. This agreement focuses on \n     achieving important outcome-based benchmarks for helping \n     families move from welfare to work and reducing child \n     poverty.\n                                                    Donna Shalala.\n\n  Mr. President, let me just give a brief background to this amendment \nand the process leading up to it.\n  I wish to also amend her letter that I have just read on a verbal \nunderstanding that we had this morning, and that is relating to the \ntiming of this waiver in the language ``as soon as HHS and State staff \ncan finalize the details of an agreement.'' She committed herself this \nmorning to me that this would not take longer than 2 weeks. And the \nGovernor of our State, in conversation with him this morning as well, \nindicated that this would be a satisfactory time period.\n  This action delivers the final and most critical piece of what we \ncall the Oregon Option. Oregon's situation is unique. There is not \nanother State in the Union that has achieved this particular status.\n  In September 1994, 40 members of Federal agencies, most based in \nWashington, DC, visited Oregon to talk about doing business \ndifferently. In December 1994, nine Cabinet members including the Vice \nPresident of the United States signed a memorandum of understanding \nwith Oregon's Governor in a coast-to-coast satellite televised \nceremony.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert in \nthe Record a copy of the memorandum of understanding reached between my \nState and the Federal Government.\n  There being no objection, the memorandum was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Memorandum of Understanding Regarding ``The Oregon Option''\n\n\n                               I. Purpose\n\n       The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding is to \n     encourage and facilitate cooperation among Federal, State and \n     local entities to redesign and test an outcomes oriented \n     approach to intergovernmental service delivery. This special \n     partnership and long-range commitment will serve as \n     demonstration of principles and practices which may serve as \n     a model for improvements nationwide.\n\n\n                             II. Background\n\n       In July 1994, Oregon proposed a multi-year demonstration \n     with the Federal Government to redesign intergovernmental \n     service delivery, structured and operated to achieve \n     measurable results that will improve the lives of Oregonians.\n       Oregon is uniquely suited for an experimental demonstration \n     to develop an outcomes oriented approach to intergovernmental \n     services. The State and many local governments have begun \n     using an outcomes model for establishing long-range vision, \n     setting public priorities, allocating resources, designing \n     services, and measuring results. The Oregon Legislature has \n     endorsed the Oregon ``Benchmarks.'' Further, many nonprofit \n     organizations, businesses, and civic groups in Oregon are \n     aligned to a benchmark process with State, county and local \n     jurisdictions.\n\n\n                  III. Principles to guide cooperation\n\n       The following principles should guide the parties \n     cooperation in this undertaking:\n       A re-designed system would be:\n       Structured, managed, and evaluated on the basis of results \n     (i.e., progress in achieving benchmarks).\n       Oriented to customer needs and satisfaction, especially \n     through integration of services.\n       Biased toward prevention rather than remediation of \n     problems.\n       Simplified and integrated as much as possible, delegating \n     responsibilities for service,\n\n[[Page S2170]]\n\n     design, delivery, and results to front-line, local-level \n     providers, whether they are local agencies or local offices \n     of state agencies.\n\n\n                  iv. responsibilities of the parties\n\n       The parties to this memorandum will work together as \n     partners to (1) identify benchmarks, strategies, and measures \n     that provide a framework for improved intergovernmental \n     service delivery and (2) undertake efforts to identify and \n     eliminate barriers to achieving program results.\n\n\n                             v. authorities\n\n       The principles and responsibilities covered in this \n     memorandum are intended to improve the coordinated delivery \n     of intergovernmental programs. This memorandum does not \n     commit any of the parties to a particular level of resources; \n     nor is it intended to create any right or benefit or diminish \n     any existing right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n     enforceable at law by a party against the United States, \n     State of Oregon, any state or federal agency, any state or \n     federal official, any party of this agreement, or any person. \n     While significant changes to the intergovernmental service \n     delivery system are anticipated as result of this effort, \n     this is not a legally binding or enforceable agreement. \n     Nothing in this memorandum alters the responsibilities or \n     statutory authorities of the Federal agencies, or State or \n     local governments.\n\n\n   signatures of memorandum of understanding regarding ``the oregon \n                                option''\n\n       Vice President Al Gore.\n       Secretary Labor HHS Donna E. Shalala.\n       Secretary of Housing Henry G. Cisneros.\n       Director, Office of National Drug Control Policy Lee P. \n     Brown.\n       Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich.\n       Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley.\n       Attorney General Janet Reno.\n       Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy.\n       Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown.\n       Dir. of the White House Office of Management and Budget \n     Alice M. Rivlin.\n       Asst. to President for Domestic Policy Carol H. Pasco.\n\n                                 Oregon\n\n       Governor, Barbara Roberts.\n       Senate President, John Kitzhaber.\n       Mayor PDX, Vera Katz.\n       Commission, Salem, Randall Franke.\n       Mayor of Corvallis, Charles Vars.\n       Mayor, City of Gresham, Gussie McRobert.\n       Mayor of Ashland, Katherine Golden.\n       Mayor of Independence, Marion Rossie.\n       Commissioner LaGrande, John Howard.\n       Commissioner Lane, Steve Cornacchia.\n       Multnomah County, Beverly Stein.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. With the understanding that we had the blessings of all \nlevels of Government, the Oregon Legislature passed a comprehensive \nwelfare reform bill that became the basis for the Oregon option welfare \nreform waiver request. Oregon's JOBS Plus Program gives parents the \nopportunity to find substantive work with above-minimum wage pay and \nincludes employer involvement. Employees earn a livable wage while \nlearning valuable work skills.\n  Oregon's attempt to reform welfare is designed to allow people the \nopportunity to work, thereby taking them off the welfare rolls. Through \ninnovative program planning, Oregon has seen a decline in its welfare \ncasework the last 2 years while facing increases in population. And I \nwish to repeat this. Oregon has had a decline with this experimental \nprogram in its welfare caseload the past 2 years while facing increases \nin population. With this waiver, we will be able to move further into \nthat program of reform.\n  On July 3, 1995, 9 months ago, Oregon submitted its waiver request to \nthe Department of Health and Human Services and Department of \nAgriculture. We then fell into the abyss. With Congressional welfare \nreform appearing possible, including changes that would allow Oregon to \nimplement most of the options without waivers, action slowed down on \nall sides. I became very concerned that the rhetoric and the reality \nwere incongruent. I inserted language in this omnibus appropriations \nbill to force the administration to act on our request one way or the \nother. This is not the way I like to do business, Mr. President, but I \nhad no other recourse. I am very pleased that today the administration \nhas delivered on their promises. The idea behind the Oregon option is \nthat outcomes and results govern the expenditure of funds, not \ndirection from Washington. Today, the administration, and in particular \nSecretary Shalala, has sent a clear and unequivocal message of a \ncommitment to results.\n  I thank the administration for allowing us to go forward. Their \ncommitment is well placed. The Vice President referred to the Oregon \noption in December 1994, as quoted in the Oregonian, ``This is all \nabout going from red-tape to results.'' The Vice President's senior \npolicy adviser was quoted in the August 6, 1995 Washington Post as \nsaying,\n\n       The Oregon option is probably the largest system of \n     performance-based government in the United States that is \n     actually up and running. We see it as a possible model for \n     the future of Federal-State relations.\n\n  While I cannot guarantee that the approach Oregon wants to take on \nwelfare reform will be successful because we do not live in a world of \nguarantees, we have seen positive strides with our programs thus far. \nWe have a great track record of delivering on our promises. Our \nGovernor, John Kitzhaber, and the head of our welfare department, Steve \nMinnich, deserve the gratitude of all Oregonians for the effort they \nhave expended to make these programs work.\n\n  I should like to say parenthetically that our Governor was the \npresident of the State senate, and he is a medical doctor. During his \ntime as president of the State senate, he was the one who brought the \nparties together and crafted the Oregon Health Reform Act, and this is \nthe record of a very dedicated public servant and one who has quietly \nand with great effectiveness brought about that change in our own \nhealth programs in Oregon, at least as far as we could go. And now he \nhas undertaken the welfare program for reform. I am honored to be his \nmessenger to the cause that he represents here in Washington.\n  My home State of Oregon has a pioneering spirit. We face obstacles \narmed with creative solutions and the perseverance to see them to \nconclusion. Each day Oregon proves itself willing to take on hard \nissues such as health and welfare reform, programs which serve as \nmodels for the rest of the country. Mr. President, today I am reminded \nof the words of Herbert Hoover. He said once, ``Words without actions \nare the assassins of idealism.'' The Secretary's action certainly \nmaintains my idealism that innovative welfare reform is possible.\n  I am very pleased to again note that my new colleague, recently \nelected from my State, and a man who has brought great distinction to \nour State by his service in the House of Representatives and pursuing \nprograms of this type throughout his political career, has now joined \nme as a full-fledged partner and I thank him for his continued effort \nand interest in this matter.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I first want to extend my appreciation to \nSenator Hatfield. The chairman of the committee has done yeoman work on \nthis and on so many issues for our State and for our country. He has \nhonored me with the chance to work with him on the Oregon option in \nboth the House and the Senate. I want him to know how much I appreciate \nhis help and his counsel. I think it is clear that the administration \nlooks to him for leadership on these issues and to a great extent it is \nbecause of Senator Hatfield that the administration consistently comes \nto us for the opportunity to test these issues. I want the Senator to \nknow how grateful I am to be able to work with him and in particular, \nto support his amendment today.\n  I think Senator Hatfield has outlined quite well that the welfare \nsystem in America today does not work for anyone. It certainly does not \nwork for taxpayers. In so many instances they watch as their tax \ndollars are frittered away. And I know that it does not work for many \nof those who are in the system. I have talked to them, and many of them \nhave said they would very much like to break out of the system, but \nthey get caught in a Catch-22. They may have a child at home and would \nlike to work, but if they start working they lose their child care. So, \nto a great extent, the welfare system in America today does not work \nfor much of anybody.\n  What I think Senator Hatfield has outlined is that Oregon, with our \nunique Oregon option, a plan that is being tried literally nowhere in \nthe country, is offering the Nation the chance to break out of the \nencrusted shell of the old welfare system. We are saying, in effect, \nthat we would like to bust loose, like we did with the Oregon health \nplan, and focus most specifically on results.\n  Senator Hatfield has made so many of the important points that I \nwould\n\n[[Page S2171]]\n\nlike to just touch on one or two others that I believe have great \nimplications for the national debate about the delivery of services in \nour country, and particularly our human services. We know that many of \nour colleagues are now part of the debate that suggests either you \nought to run everything from Washington, DC, that Washington, DC has \nthe answers, or you should just give it back to the States and see what \nhappens.\n  The Oregon option is a plan developed with the leadership of our \nGovernor, John Kitzhaber, who has done outstanding work in the human \nservices area, and with the help of the administration. The Oregon \noption offers an alternative approach that falls in between the two \nextremes of either running it all from Washington, DC, and saying \nWashington, DC, has the answers, or simply turning it over to the \nStates and seeing what happens.\n  Oregon, in effect, with the Oregon option, is saying that if we are \nallowed to be free of some of the Federal shackles and some of the \nFederal red tape, we will guarantee we will focus on real \naccountability with respect to services. We will make sure that the \nfocus is getting people off welfare into gainful employment in the \nprivate sector, and we will focus on results, we will focus on \naccountability.\n  I suggest to the Senate that the Oregon option does show real promise \nof getting to a creative third path between those who say ``run it all \nfrom Washington'' and those who just say ``turn it all over to the \nStates and we will see what happens.'' Yes, let us give the States more \nfreedom and more authority, but let us also require accountability. \nThat is what the Oregon option is going to do.\n  I think it is worth focusing for a moment on how this is actually \ngoing to produce change in the system. In the future, with the Oregon \noption, a welfare office is going to be evaluated not by whether all of \nthe boxes in every application get checked, but by how many individuals \nactually move into good, nonsubsidized jobs and whether we are reducing \nthe number of children who live in poverty.\n  Right now, probably the best way to describe the system is that if \nyou have somebody who is on welfare and at home, the system just goes \nforward. You do not have to adjust any benefits. You do not process any \npaperwork. There is no job training to account for, no assets that \nmight accumulate. The system just goes on and on and on. Under the \nOregon plan, those individuals who are running welfare services, are \ngoing to know the focus is on making sure there are results, making \nsure that you actually see people move into the private sector. This is \nwhat reform ought to be all about.\n  There are a number of specific features about the Oregon plan that I \nthink make great sense for welfare reform generally. Under the Oregon \noption, the State is going to invest in what is known as transitional \nchild care and preventive child care. As a Member of the other body, I \nsaw repeatedly that there were individuals, particularly women who head \nhouseholds, who would be able to get off welfare. Sometimes they would \nget off a couple of times. They would be in the private sector, they \nwould be making headway, then their child care would fall apart, and \nthey would slide back onto public assistance.\n\n  The Oregon option, with its innovative approach toward child care is \ngoing to help prevent that in the future. The Oregon option allows \nwelfare recipients to keep certain assets that can expedite the \ntransition from welfare to work and make sure people do not fall back \non welfare.\n  Finally, the focus with respect to the State's role is on real work \nsituations, not these make-work kind of arrangements, but real \nemployment opportunities where welfare recipients get trained on-site, \nby business people who have actual needs in the job markets in our \nState.\n  A lot of us see the welfare system as something that can be a ladder \nto a fresh start. It is not supposed to be a feather mattress. It is \nsupposed to be a ladder. I am excited about the chance to change lives \nfor the better in our State, excited about the fact that the Oregon \noption is going to allow taxpayer dollars to be used in a more \neffective way.\n  I want to commend both the administration and Secretary Shalala. I \nhave had a chance to work with her on the Oregon option and the Oregon \nhealth plan. We think this is our one-two punch in reforming services \nthat affect thousands of families. Secretary Shalala deserves great \ncredit for that.\n  Finally, our Governor, as Senator Hatfield has noted, is consistently \nout in front in trying to look at these issues. I think, when you write \nthe history of health reform, and I know the President is particularly \ninterested in this issue, the country is going to look at what Oregon \nhas done in health care and the way Oregon has made tough choices and \nthe way Oregon has focused on prevention and focused on medical \neffectiveness and focused on ways to build a new partnership with \nproviders. Because of Dr. Kitzhaber's work, the Oregon health plan is \ngoing to make a difference in health reform across this country. It is \ngoing to be something that the rest of the Nation is going to look to. \nNow, with the Oregon option we have a chance, through welfare reform, \nto complement the work that has been done on the health care side.\n  So I urge the adoption of the Hatfield amendment. As you can tell, we \nare passionate, on a bipartisan basis, about this important cause. It \nis going to change lives across our State. I think it is going to make \na difference across our Nation, and I am pleased and honored to be here \nwith Senator Hatfield to support his amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I know of no other comments to be made \nat this time.\n  Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3536) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague for his \nvery strong assistance on this.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3496\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment is now before the Senate.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in Walla Walla, WA, there is a general \nmedical and surgical facility for the Veterans' Administration. That \nfacility serves a wide range of veterans over a very considerable area.\n  The people of Walla Walla are proud of the facility. The various \nveterans organizations in the area have asked us to rename it in honor \nof Gen. Jonathan M. Wainwright. As you know, Mr. President, General \nWainwright was a distinguished American military leader, having \ncommanded American troops in the Philippines and Corregidor after the \ndeparture of General MacArthur. He was imprisoned for 4 years, \nreleased, and ultimately observed the surrender of the Japanese on the \nU.S.S. Missouri on V-J Day. He won the Congressional Medal of Honor. \nGeneral Wainwright was born in Fort Walla Walla, while his family was \nthere with the First Cavalry.\n  The people of Walla Walla are going to erect a statue in his honor, \nand they wish to rename the facility in honor of General Wainwright.\n  A bill introduced by the Congressman from the district, Mr. \nNethercutt, passed the House of Representatives last year. It seems to \nbe buried so deeply in the Veterans' Committee that it is not going to \nget out certainly in time for the Memorial Day ceremony by which time \nwe hope to have caused this renaming to take place.\n  This is not a cleared amendment but, Mr. President, I think it should \nbe noncontroversial. Senator Murray and I very much urge our colleagues \nto agree with us, to adopt it as a rider to this bill since it has \nalready passed the House.\n\n[[Page S2172]]\n\n  With those remarks, I think I need no more time of this body speaking \nabout this amendment, about Walla Walla, or about General Wainwright. \nSo I will yield the floor, but I am constrained at this point to ask \nfor the yeas and nays on the amendment with the hope that will bring \nthe whole subject to the attention of those who have objected to it to \nthis point and that it will soon be cleared.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I do have a group of amendments that \nhave been cleared on both sides. I will make a unanimous-consent \nrequest.\n\n\n Amendment Nos. 3537, 3538, 3539, 3540, 3541, 3542, 3543, 3544, 3545, \n                     and 3546 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I now send to the desk a number of \namendments that have been cleared on both sides of the aisle. I ask \nunanimous consent that they be considered en bloc, agreed to en bloc, \nand that the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table. I withhold.\n  Mr. President, my unanimous consent request has been formally \nmodified, but that has already been taken care of. I renew my \nunanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nickles). Without objection, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendments en bloc. The amendments (Nos. 3537, \n3538, 3539, 3540, 3541, 3542, 3543, 3544, 3545, and 3546) were agreed \nto, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3537\n\n       Insert the following at the appropriate place under Title \n     III of the Committee amendment:\n       ``Sec.   . Any funds heretofore appropriated and made \n     available in Public Law 102-104 and Public Law 102-377 to \n     carry out the provisions for the project for navigation, St. \n     Louis Harbor, Missouri and Illinois; may be utilized by the \n     Secretary of the Army in carrying out the Upper Mississippi \n     and Illinois Waterway System Navigation Study, Iowa, \n     Illinois, Missouri, Wisconsin, Minnesota, in Fiscal Year 1996 \n     or until expended.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, \nand Senators Harkin, Simon, Grassley, and Moseley-Braun.\n  The purpose of the amendment is to allow surplus funds previously \nearmarked to be reprogrammed to the Upper Mississippi/Illinois Waterway \nNavigation Feasibility Study.\n  The navigation study in fiscal year 1996 is underfunded and, \nconsequently, will be unable to meet the 6-year study deadline unless \nmore funding is provided. This shortfall has been recognized by \nSecretary Lancaster who has persisted in reprogramming discretionary \nmoney to help make up the shortfall. This amendment provides the \nSecretary the authority to reprogram an additional sum of money \ncurrently earmarked for the St. Louis harbor study that the corps will \nnot be able to spend this year.\n  Even with this potential transfer, we understand they remain $1.8 \nmillion underfunded which we will have to make up in fiscal year 1997.\n  The amendment does not increase the overall cost of the 6-year $43 \nmillion study to update the 50-year-old locks and dams on the Illinois \nWaterway and Upper Mississippi River.\n   Mr. President, this study is a priority item. Conference report \nlanguage in the energy and water appropriations bill for fiscal year \n1996 was included directing the corps to:\n\n       Expedite work on the study and ensure that the Division \n     Engineer's public notice on the feasibility report is issued \n     no later than December of 1999 . . . because of the need for \n     a timely review of future navigation needs on the upper \n     Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway.\n\n  According to the corps in 1992, tows at Upper Mississippi locals 22-\n25 were delayed a total of 87,000 hours. As river traffic grows over 4 \npercent per year, the corps estimates that delays at locals 22-25 would \nbe in excess of a day early in the 21st century.\n  The president of Farmland Industries told us recently that they have \n18 trains running round the clock to try to meet foreign demand. Even \ntoday, there is 12 million tons of grain on the ground in Iowa that \ncannot find a ride to markets abroad--what will it be like when \nfreedom-to-farm takes effect and export demand continues to grow? The \nlonger it takes to upgrade the 50-year-old system, the harder it will \nbe for U.S. grain to continue to find a home in the world market at \ncompetitive prices.\n  The bottom line is that this is a trade, competitiveness, and jobs \nissue. Our farmers need this. This is one of our principal competitive \nadvantages and the action taken now will be the basis of our \ncompetitive position 5, 10, and 20 years from now. If we have grain \npiling up now, what will it be like in 10 years? Who believes that we \ncan remain a reliable exporter of grain if we let our system \ndeteriorate at the same time the Department of Agriculture is \nprojecting record $60 billion in agricultural exports and a record $30 \nbillion trade surplus?\n   Mr. President, Senators who are concerned about competitiveness, \npromoting trade opportunities, protecting jobs, and growing the economy \nshould be on board this effort. We know the corps is on board and we \nneed to get the Office of Management and Budget on board. This is not a \npriority at OMB and it should be. Trying to capture the growing Asian \nmarket is not pork--it's the economy, stupid.\n  It is critical that the administration follow the Secretary for Civil \nWork's lead in pursuing this study. It is a project of national \nsignificance that deserves priority attention. It is necessary that the \nadministration make a request for fiscal year 1997 appropriations which \naccurately reflects the funding necessary to keep this study on \nschedule. If this study can wait, we are telling farmers that exports \ncan wait. They can't.\n  Other nations are aggressively emulating our inland waterway system--\nBrazil, China, and Germany, to name a few. The question is whether we \nwill forsake that advantage to the detriment of our young farmers and \nnation balance of trade. This is our chief artery to the world market. \nSome foreign competitors can beat us on price until our grain hits our \ninland waterway system--which is the cheapest way to ship a ton of \ngrain in the world.\n  I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee \nand full committee for accommodating us on this issue. In the coming \nmonths and years, the urgency for action will increase to address the \nlack of capacity on this critical corridor. This will be a priority \nissue, not just for carriers but for shippers who are farmers. Senators \nwill hear from farmers and farm groups on this issue. This amendment is \nto promote and permit exports and job growth and I appreciate the \nsupport of the Senate.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3538\n\n(Purpose: This Amendment adds $1,000,000 to the Adolescent Family Life \n                program for total funding of $7,698,000)\n\n       On page 546, line 21 of the pending amendment, increase the \n     rescission amount by $1,000,000.\n       On page 572, line 16 of the pending amendment, strike \n     ``$129,499,000'' and insert in lieu thereof ``$130,499,000''.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as we try to steer toward a growing \neconomy and a balanced budget, there has been a growing consensus that \nall our goals must rest on a restored ethic of personal responsibility. \nThere is an alarming teenage birth rate in the United States. The teen \nbirthrate in the United States is double the rate in other \nindustrialized societies such as Australia and the United Kingdom. Over \n72 percent of teenage births in 1993 were to unwed mothers; 12,000 \nchildren were born to mothers under the age of 15. It is worth pausing \nto reflect on the enormous significance of these statistics regarding \nout-of-wedlock births. Adolescent pregnancy threatens the health of \nboth the young mother and child. Teenage mothers are more likely to \nlack adequate prenatal care and to give birth to a low-birthweight \nbaby.\n  We can reduce unintended teenage pregnancies by encouraging \nabstinence and personal responsibility. If you want to reduce the \nnumber of abortions performed in the United States, teaching children \nto say ``no'' to peer pressure is a good starting place. The Adolescent \nFamily Life Program, known as the title XX program, is a worthwhile \nprogram which focuses on the issues of abstinence, adolescent \nsexuality, adoption alternatives, pregnancy, and parenting. The \nAdolescent Family Life Program has broad bipartisan support when it was \noriginally enacted in 1981\n\n[[Page S2173]]\n\nand when it was reauthorized in 1984. Congress appropriated $6,698,000 \nfor this program in fiscal year 1995; my amendment would increase its \nfunding to $7,698,000 in fiscal year 1996.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3539\n\n       On Page 590, after the word ``for'' on line 19, strike all \n     up to the word ``payment'' on line 23.\n       On Page 590, after the word ``education'' on line 25, \n     strike all up to the period on page 591, line 3.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3540\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a waiver of the enrollment composition rule \n under Medicaid for Chartered Health Plan of the District of Columbia)\n\n       At the end of title III, on page 771 after line 17, add the \n     following new section:\n       Sec.   . The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \n     grant a waiver of the requirements set forth in section \n     1903(m)(2)(A)(ii) of the Social Security Act to D.C. \n     Chartered Health Plan, Inc. of the District of Columbia: \n     Provided, That such waiver shall be deemed to have been in \n     place for all contract periods from October 1, 1991 through \n     the current contract period or October 1, 1999, whichever \n     shall be later.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3541\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Sec.   . Of the funds appropriated by Public Law 104-37 or \n     otherwise made available to the Food Safety and Inspection \n     Service for Fiscal Year 1996, not less than $363,000,000 \n     shall be available for salaries and benefits of in-plant \n     personnel: Provided, That this limitation shall not apply if \n     the Secretary of Agriculture certifies to the House and \n     Senate Committees on Appropriations that a lesser amount will \n     be adequate to fully meet in-plant inspection requirements \n     for the fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the amendment I offer with my colleague \nfrom Arkansas will ensure that funds appropriated to the Food Safety \nand Inspection Service for fiscal year 1996 are used to cover in-plant \ninspector salaries and benefits requirements before being obligated for \nother purposes. The reason for this amendment is simple. The Food \nSafety and Inspection Service has chosen to purchase computers over \npaying the salaries of inspectors who ensure the safety of our Nation's \nmeat and poultry supply.\n  Mr. President, this agency requested $594 million for fiscal year \n1996, a 13-percent increase over the fiscal year 1995 appropriation. \nWith a total allocation for discretionary spending below a freeze at \nfiscal year 1995 enacted levels, this subcommittee could not grant the \nrequested increase. We appropriated $544 million to the agency. The \nPresident signed the fiscal year 1996 Agriculture, Rural Development, \nFood and Drug Administration and Related Agencies Appropriations Act on \nOctober 21, 1995. Apparently, the Food Safety and Inspection Service \ndid not alter its spending plans for the year to live within the amount \nappropriated to it. Now, here we are, about half way through the fiscal \nyear, with a request for a supplemental appropriation of $9.5 million \nfor the Food Safety and Inspection Service, which includes $3.2 million \nfor inspector positions, $3.5 million for training for the new hazard \nanalysis and critical control point [or HACCP], inspection program, and \n$2.8 million for the animal production food safety initiative. This \nsupplemental request from the President is offset in budget authority \nby a proposed rescission in funds appropriated to the Cooperative State \nResearch, Education, and Extension Service buildings and facilities \naccount, but not in outlays, as required by congressional budget rules. \nIn investigating why the Agency faces a shortfall, we are told that the \nAgency decided to commit the $8.4 million it had requested for the \nField Automation and Information Management initiative, of which \nbetween $4 and $5 million remain. FSIS chose computers over inspectors. \nWhen asked if inspector positions would be protected if the Agency ran \nshort of funds at the end of the fiscal year, the answer was ``no.'' \nRather than commit this money to an identified shortfall in inspector \nfunding, it has come to us for more money.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will ensure that above all, there are \nadequate numbers of inspectors in the plants for the remainder of the \nfiscal year to ensure that the meat people put on their tables is safe \nand wholesome. At the same time, it will ensure that processing plants \ndo not shut down, thereby increasing the cost of meat in the groceries, \nand reducing prices that farmers receive for their animals because they \ncan't get them to market.\n  We agree with the Department that the modernization of the current \ninspection program is essential, and endorsed it in the Senate report \naccompanying the fiscal year 1996 Agriculture Appropriations Act. Where \nwe disagree is that the current inspection system should suffer at the \nexpense of expediting implementation of the new system or other Agency \ninitiatives. It is essential that we maintain the existing system while \nefforts are underway to implement the new system. In fact, I believe \nthat the No. 2 priority of the Food Safety and Inspection Service \nshould be training to implement the new HACCP rule. Once the new \ninspection system is in place, then is the time to dismantle the \ncurrent system.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment \nto ensure that adequate funds are available to keep meat and poultry \ninspectors on the job.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3542\n\n       On page 769, line 24, delete the word ``Of'' and insert \n     ``Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, of'.\n       On page 770, line 4, after the word ``available'', insert \n     the words ``for operating expenses''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3543\n\n    (Purpose: To amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \n                   authorize the export of new drugs)\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, yesterday morning I had the honor of \naddressing the National Medical Device Coalition, an association of \nfar-thinking medical device manufacturing executives who have come to \nWashington to press for meaningful Food and Drug Administration reform.\n  In their visits with Senators and Representatives this week, NMDC \nmembers will be offering the most compelling case I know for FDA \nreform, and, specifically, reform of medical device regulation.\n  Indeed, they urge that reform of the medical device regulatory \nprocess should be a top priority of this Congress, and I couldn't agree \nmore.\n  As the NMDC points out, there are severe problems facing the medical \ndevice industry in our country--problems which impede the ability of \nmanufacturers to maintain our world class competitive edge and continue \nto produce products which have so many public health benefits.\n  I think that Wayne K. Barlow, president of the NMDC summed it up the \nbest in his March 11 address to the American Institute for Medical and \nBiological Engineering. Mr. Barlow, who happens to also be president of \nWescor, Inc., a small medical device manufacturer in Logan, UT, said:\n\n       The U.S. Medical Device industry is severely challenged. \n     Its survival beyond the 20th century has been case in doubt. \n     The innovative fervor that once characterized our industry is \n     evaporating. We are seeing an alarming exodus of companies, \n     technologies, and jobs to other countries. Do not doubt that \n     we are in a life-or-death struggle nor that its outcome will \n     determine whether our industry has a future in this country.\n\n  Mr. Barlow went on to say:\n\n       Powerful forces are reshaping health care delivery and the \n     associated markets for health care products in America. The \n     three major components are (1) dynamic restructuring of \n     global markets, (2) Federal regulatory policies, and (3) the \n     U.S. product liability climate. These forces in combination \n     have debilitated the industry. In consequence, America is \n     being pulled down toward second-rate status in medical \n     technology.\n\n  I think that the NMDC has done us a valuable service in their \nconcerted emphasis this week to educate the Congress on issues \nassociated with medical devices.\n  As they point out, this diverse industry is comprised largely of \nsmall businesses, which manufacture a wide range of products all of \nwhich contribute positively to our U.S. trade balance.\n  A regulatory climate which threatens the health of these small \nbusinesses, threatens the health of our economy as well.\n  But it also threatens public health, because declining incentives for \ninnovation force production overseas. And when that innovative edge \nmoves offshore, Americans will be deprived of the latest medical \nproducts, products which could improve or even save lives.\n  One of the top priorities of the NMDC, eliminating FDA's involvement\n\n[[Page S2174]]\n\nin granting permission to export medical products, is also a top \npriority of mine, and is the subject of the amendment Senators Gregg, \nKassebaum, Kennedy, and I are offering here today.\n  Let me turn to a specific discussion of the amendment, which is a \nsubstitute for the FDA Export Reform and Enhancement Act (S. 593) \napproved unanimously by the Labor Committee last July.\n  I want to commend all of my colleagues who have worked on the FDA \nexport issue in this Congress.\n  In the House, Congressman Fred Upton has exhibited a great deal of \nleadership on this issue. The chairman of the Commerce Committee, \nRepresentative Thomas Bliley, and the ranking member, Representative \nJohn Dingell, must be credited for working closely together to fashion \nthe House language on export contained in the continuing resolution \nunder discussion today.\n  In this Chamber, I must recognize all of the original cosponsors of \nthe Senate bill, S. 593: Senators Gregg, Kassebaum, Abraham, Frist, and \nCoats.\n  My good friend, Senator Kennedy, was instrumental in fashioning the \ncompromise language that was unanimously adopted by the Labor Committee \nin July and in the amendment we now consider.\n  In the interest of moving forward our important goal of increasing \nthe export of medical products, I ask all of my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  I think that the amendment we offer today is a vast improvement over \ncurrent law. It undoubtedly will allow a more free export of American \nmedical products abroad.\n  However, I must also recognize that our original bill, and the bill \napproved by the House of Representatives, provides even greater \nopportunities for such exports, without the intrusive hand of the FDA \nin first approving those exports. I am hopeful we can work during the \nconference to get a compromise which will move toward that free-\ntrade concept while still ensuring protection of the public health.\n\n  I was chairman of the Labor Committee in 1986 and worked very hard to \nget the provision in current law which relaxed our restrictive trade \npolicies regarding pharmaceutical products not approved by the FDA.\n  At that time, the law did not go as far as I would have liked, but we \ndid make some important strides such as permitting the export of drugs \nnot approved by the FDA to 21 specified countries.\n  Section 801(e)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act already \ncontains extremely important principles, and sufficient safeguards, in \nthe area of exports:\n\n       A food, drug, device, or cosmetic intended for export shall \n     not be deemed to be adulterated or misbranded under this Act \n     if it--\n       (A) accords to the specifications of the foreign purchaser,\n       (B) is not in conflict with the laws of the country to \n     which it is intended for export,\n       (C) is labeled on the outside of the shipping package that \n     is intended for export, and\n       (D) is not sold or offered for sale in domestic commerce.\n\n  A very good argument can be made that this provision alone should \nconstitute our national policy.\n  It is important to understand that this is essentially the policy of \nevery country in the world, except for the United States.\n  While I think that it should be the primary responsibility of the \ngovernment of each nation to protect its own citizens, I am also a \nrealist and know that many believe that additional requirements must be \nimposed on our domestic manufacturers to ensure public health abroad.\n  I do not question that well-intentioned motivation. At the same time, \nI would point out that no other country in the world imposes such \nrequirements.\n  As I have suggested previously, we should all take note of the \nperspective of Dr. John Petricciani, an official of the Massachusetts \nbiotechnology firm, Genetics Institute, Inc.\n  Prior to joining the private sector, Dr. Petricciani spent over 20 \nyears in the Public Health Service, including serving as Director of \nthe FDA Center for Biologics, head of the World Health Organization's \nbiologicals unit and Deputy Director of the Public Health Service \nNational AIDS Program Office. As Dr. Petricciani has stated:\n\n       The real issue here is one of benefit and risk. Do the \n     benefits to foreign countries in the current law outweigh the \n     risks imposed on the U.S. in terms of draining jobs and \n     capital investment in research, development, and \n     manufacturing? As has been pointed out by others, one of the \n     results of that drain is the earlier availability of products \n     in Europe and elsewhere than in the U.S. If we were \n     discussing electronics or automobiles, I would not be as \n     concerned because the American people are not being placed at \n     a meaningful disadvantage by such delays.\n       However, the issue here is medical products that can make a \n     very big difference in the health of the American people. The \n     current law is resulting in new products being introduced \n     first in foreign countries where U.S. firms are forced to \n     manufacture them. I believe that we are paying far too high a \n     price in terms of delayed availability of new products in the \n     U.S. for the theoretical benefit being provided to developing \n     countries.\n       I would also like to point out that if a U.S. company \n     really wanted to export a product that would be acceptable in \n     the U.S., all they would have to do is manufacture it outside \n     the U.S. and export it to a developing country.\n\n  Now is the time to revise and reform the current export \nrestrictions--both for public health and international trade \nconsiderations.\n  The question is not whether we should change current law, but how we \nshould change the current law.\n  As I said earlier, I prefer the House language. But I am also a \nrealist and recognize that to include a provision under unanimous \nconsent today there will be some matters that will not be resolved to \nmy satisfaction.\n  I would like to review briefly the history of the development of this \nlegislation in the 104th Congress.\n  First, the companion bills, S.593/H.R. 1300 were introduced last \nMarch.\n  The theory behind this legislation was simple and direct.\n  Essentially, S. 593 and H.R. 1300 would harmonize the U.S. policy \nwith the policy adopted by every major trading nation in the world.\n  This would allow U.S. producers to sell their products freely to \nWorld Trade Organization-member countries so long as such products were \nnot violative of the laws of the importing country. This is a good law \nand good policy and is the rule by which the rest of the world lives \nby.\n  Because of concerns that such unfettered free trade might possibly \nsubject citizens in Third-World countries to dangerous U.S. exports, a \ncompromise was reached in the Labor Committee last July. The compromise \nwould allow shipment of drugs to any country in the world if they were \nalready approved by one of a list of some 20-odd countries deemed to \nhave sophisticated drug approval and regulatory systems.\n  The purpose of this so-called bank shot was to decrease the \npossibility that some small Third World country might somehow unwisely \nallow, or be somehow coerced to allow, dangerous products into its \nborders.\n  In parallel with this bank shot, the Labor Committee compromise \ncontemplated the creation of a so-called tier II list of countries with \nregulatory systems found adequate to protect the health and safety of \ntheir citizens. Drugs and devices could be shipped directly to those \ncountries even in the absence of an approval of a Tier I country with a \nsophisticated drug approval system.\n  Subsequent to the markup, the GAO was requested to provide technical \nassistance to help the Senate formulate tier II country criteria as \nwell as technical assistance in helping the Senate to select an initial \nlist of tier II countries.\n  Understandably, and perhaps, unavoidably, the creation of these \ncriteria and the initial list has presented contentious issues. Neither \nthe GAO nor FDA are anxious to get involved in the middle of such an \ninherently complex issue.\n  I believe there is agreement among sponsors of our amendment today \nthat we will examine this issue in more detail in conference. I feel \nvery strongly that we must allow opportunities for export beyond the \ntier I realm. That is the future of exports for our country.\n  Where the GAO and FDA fear to tread, the Congress must, and should, \nmarch in.\n  In the end, I think it is the responsibility of each government to \ndesign laws to protect its own citizens so I have philosophical \nconcerns about a system that would preclude a U.S. company to ship a \nproduct to another country--even a third world country--when that \ncountry has decided to allow the use of that product.\n  I know that some, including our colleague, Senator Simon, have, for \ngood\n\n[[Page S2175]]\n\nand legitimate reasons, raised concerns about the ability of small \ndeveloping nations like Botswana to make these crucial regulatory \ndecisions. I just question whether our Food and Drug Administration is \nas well-positioned as the public health authorities of another country, \nBotswana included, as to what products are suitable for its citizens.\n  I am even more skeptical of the wisdom of not providing a tier II \nmechanism to provide, in the absence of a tier I country approval, \ndirect shipment to countries like Russia, China, India, Brazil, and \nArgentina.\n  Why should this Congress presume to forbid American manufacturers the \nopportunity to sell products in these countries after these governments \nhave independently found that such products are legal to make and use? \nCan we not rely upon the Chinese and Russian governments to act in the \nbest interests of its own citizens?\n  I don't think that FDA approval, or the approval of a select list of \ntier I countries, should be a necessary condition for other countries \nto decide to approve, or for that matter disapprove, the use of a \ncertain medical product. Accordingly, I believe that, American \nmanufacturers should be given the same opportunity to compete with \nmanufacturers of products approved for use in tier II, but not tier I, \ncountries. Deciding which medical products to allow into the stream of \ncommerce is an important power for each sovereign nation to exercise.\n  In closing, I want to commend our colleagues in the House for \ndeveloping a proposal which represents an improvement over the original \nversion of S. 593/H.R. 1300. Frankly, I believe that the imminent \nhazard provisions of the House-passed bill grants sufficient authority \nto the Secretary of Health and Human Services to halt shipments of \ndangerous projects. As a practical matter, I don't think that the \nimminent hazard provisions of this new Senate amendment act much \ndifferently.\n  We have an opportunity in the 104th Congress to enact FDA export \nlegislation. This legislation can advance the public health of the \nUnited States and internationally. This legislation can benefit \nemployees and potential employees of American medical products \nmanufacturers.\n  It is estimated by experts that each $1 billion in exports results in \nthe creation of 20,000 new jobs for Americans. We in Congress have a \nunique opportunity and special responsibility to expand our trading \nmarkets for biomedical products.\n  This legislation is consistent with advancing the public health and \nwith our international trade policy. I commend Senators Gregg, \nKassebaum, and Kennedy in moving this amendment and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to see if we can resolve this issue in the \nconference committee.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment represents a great deal of \neffective work by Senator Gregg, Senator Kassebaum, and Senator Hatch, \nand I commend them for their efforts. The provisions are similar to \nthose in the bill unanimously approved by the Senate Labor Committee \nlast year.\n  This amendment will reform the export policy of the FDA and enhance \nthe competitive position of U.S. manufacturers of drugs and medical \ndevices in the international market. At the same time, it will protect \nconsumers in the Third World from unapproved, unsafe and ineffective \nproducts that might be exported from the United States but that their \ngovernments lack the expertise to evaluate.\n  This amendment represents an appropriate balance between the needs of \nU.S.-based industries and the need to provide adequate safeguards for \nthe distribution of U.S. medical products in other countries. \nMultinational pharmaceutical manufactures also recognize that this \namendment will ease the major regulatory problems that have been a \nbarrier to locating production facilities in the United States.\n  For many years, the United States was one of the few countries in the \nworld with a well-developed procedure for approving drugs and medical \ndevices. The FDA is still the gold standard throughout the world, but a \nnumber of other industrialized countries have now adopted sophisticated \nsystems for safeguarding their citizens.\n  In recent decades, foreign markets have become increasingly important \nto U.S. manufacturers, and foreign competition has become increasingly \nstrong. The United States still leads the world in biotechnology, in \nmedical device development, and in drug development--but we cannot be \ncomplacent about maintaining our leadership.\n  The increasing internationalization of the production and \ndistribution of medical products has been accompanied by a welcome \nimprovement in international efforts to coordinate standards of ethical \nconduct and to monitor the use of these products in countries around \nthe world. Nonetheless, serious abuses have occurred, and continue to \noccur.\n  This legislation recognizes these trends and responds to changing \nconditions in several ways. First, it recognizes countries whose \napproval methods have reached international standards of excellence. \nExports of products that have not been approved in the United States to \ncountries with such programs have been permitted since 1986. This bill \nstreamlines that process.\n  In addition, the bill allows manufacturers to export products to any \nother country in the world, provided that the recipient country wants \nthe product, and provided that the product has been approved by any of \nthe countries specified in the legislation as having excellent drug \napproval processes. For established, responsible pharmaceutical \ncompanies, this requirement is not a burden. They routinely seek \napproval of a new drug in one of the countries named in the bill, \nbefore any broader exports are contemplated. But this requirement will \nassure that irresponsible companies do not try to use the label ``Made \nin the U.S.A'' to peddle unsafe drugs or medical devices to other \nnations.\n  Many of the worst abuses by drug companies have come in deceptive \npromotions in which approved drugs are promoted for inappropriate uses \nand without necessary safety warnings. To protect consumers in other \ncountries, the legislation also requires that U.S. drugs marketed in \nthese countries must be labeled in accordance with the requirements of \nthe country that approved the safety of the products. Promotional \nactivities must be consistent with indications and contra-indications \non the label.\n  The bill also authorizes the Secretary of HHS to immediately suspend \nthe export of any American-made drug that poses an imminent hazard to \npublic health in an importing country.\n  American manufacturers must be free to compete effectively in world \nmarkets. But America also has a responsibility to assure that the label \n``Made in America'' will not be used to promote unsafe or ineffective \nproducts. This bill strikes an appropriate balance between these two \nimportant goals.\n  Unfortunately, the companion provision in the House bill includes \nnone of these safeguards to protect foreign consumers. Instead, it \nallows U.S. manufacturers to export any product, no matter how unsafe \nor ineffective, anywhere in the world. This kind of carte blanch is \nclearly unacceptable. It does not serve the commercial interests of \nresponsible manufacturers. It makes a mockery of the quality standard \nthat his always been associated with products labeled ``Made in the \nU.S.A.'' And it will endanger innocent foreign consumers, including \nAmericans traveling or living abroad, who rely on that label.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this amendment, and to insist on those \nsafeguards in whatever bill is finally sent to the President.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senators Hatch, \nKassebaum, and Kennedy for their great assistance in the development of \nthis amendment which will reform the laws governing the export of \npharmaceutical products and medical devices. It is imperative that this \nCongress take action immediately to change the inappropriately \nrestrictive laws that grossly limit the export of medical products that \ncan be legally marketed in other countries but are not yet approved by \nthe U.S. Federal Food and Drug Administration [FDA]. On August 2, 1995 \nthe Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee unanimously reported S. \n593, the FDA Export Reform and Enhancement Act of 1995. This bill made \nimprovements in the area of free trade while retaining some important \npublic health protections.\n  Prior to 1986, medical products, including drugs, biologicals, animal\n\n[[Page S2176]]\n\ndrugs, and medical devices generally could not be exported unless they \nwere approved by the FDA. With the passage of the export legislation \nauthored by Senator Hatch in 1986, this inappropriate and paternalistic \npolicy was somewhat corrected. The 1986 amendments allowed drug \nmanufacturers to ship their products to a codified list of 21 specific \ncountries. It is my understanding that there was no prohibition \nincluded in the law that would prevent the expansion of that list, yet \nin the 10 years this law has been in effect, no attempt has ever been \nmade to modernize this limited list.\n  On July 13, 1995, I held a hearing before the Aging Subcommittee of \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee on the issue of whether \nadditional changes in the export laws are needed. There we determined \nthat it is critical that we eliminate unnecessary restrictions which \nserve to encourage American pharmaceutical and medical devices \ncompanies to maintain research, production and investment to conduct \nclinical research in foreign countries; build factories overseas; and \nsend high paying high-tech jobs to foreign competitive markets. Our \ncurrent FDA export regimen is causing us to relinquish our intellectual \nleadership in the health care field. Improvement to the export policy \nin this country will also free up limited resources at the FDA, better \nenabling the agency to focus on the mission of timely, efficient \napproval of new products that meet the needs of American patients in \nconjunction with comprehensive FDA reform.\n  In this hearing, we listened to both drug and medical device \nmanufacturers testify as to how the U.S. laws--unparalleled anywhere in \nthe world--are negatively impacting their business, investments, and \nthe patient population they serve in the United States. For example, \nSteve Ferguson, chief operating officer of the Cook Group, Inc., \ntestified that our consideration of the FDA as the ``gold standard'' is \n``generally a joke that you hear throughout the world, the standard is \nthat, FDA approved just means that it is outdated. You are already on \nto the second or third generations over there, unless you are in the \nbusiness, it is hard to understand that.''\n  We also heard from Mr. Michael Collins, chief operating officer of \nMedtronic, who stated--\n\n       Every week that the current policy continues to be \n     implemented, more American jobs are lost through the \n     relocation of manufacturing overseas and the loss of market \n     share to foreign competitors.\n\n  Mr. Mark Knudson, a managing partner of Medical Innovation Partners, \na venture capital firm, testified that: ``5 or 10 years ago the pace of \ninnovation and the intensity of regulation were not as mismatched as \nthey are today * * *. We can no longer consider a medical investment \nopportunity which does not have a European strategy * * * the capital \nrequired to reach market is so much greater in the United States \ntoday.''\n  I am concerned that if we don't change these laws soon that we will \nhave sent so many of these high-technology businesses overseas, the \ntrend will be irreversible. The domestic drug and device industries are \ntwo of the too few sectors of the economy in which the United States is \nthe acknowledged world leader and the U.S. producers have a favorable \nbalance of trade, but the negative turn in these statistics is \nfrightening. The Labor Committee reported out a bill 16 to 0 that began \nto address this problem. That substitute version of S. 593, worked out \nbetween Senators Kassebaum, Hatch, Kennedy, and myself, was clearly a \npositive expansion of current law.\n  The bill we are including as a manager's amendment today represents a \nfurther iteration of that legislation in an attempt to address issues \nthat remained in the committee-passed bill. This bill allows export of \nhuman drugs, animal drugs, biologics or medical devices not approved by \nthe FDA. U.S. products, under this bill, could be exported to any \ncountry in the world if a product was approved by at least one country \nfrom a list of countries we were able to agree have appropriately \nsophisticated regulatory systems. These countries consist of the 21 \nthat have this status under current law: Australia, Austria, Belgium, \nCanada, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, Finland, France, Iceland, \nIreland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, New Zealand, \nNorway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, \nwith the additions of Israel, South Africa, the body of the European \nUnion, and member countries in the European Economic Area--countries in \nthe European Union and the European Free Trade Association.\n  As under current law, the exported products must be permitted in the \nimporting country and must comply with all of the relevant laws imposed \nby that country. Moreover, the following safeguards must be satisfied \nand a FDA-unapproved product may be exported only if the product is \nmade in conformity of good manufacturing practices; the product is not \nadulterated; the product is labeled and advertised in accordance with \nthe requirements of the approving country; the product is in accordance \nwith the specifications of the foreign purchaser; and, the product is \nlabeled for export and not sold or reimported into the United States.\n  Along with free export to the above countries with sophisticated \nregulatory systems, we have included a provision which ensures this \nlist will not be static, a major problem now. The Secretary, \nmanufacturers, countries, and individuals will have the opportunity to \nexpand the list of countries with sign-off authority on products \nproduced in the United States that have market potential outside of \nthis country. It is our strong intent that this provision will be used \nto keep the list dynamic.\n  In addition, we have expanded the provisions in current law for \ntropical diseases to include other diseases that are not prevalent in \nthe United States. We have done this as a compromise. I personally \nbelieve all countries should have complete autonomy over their trade \nand what products they allow to be marketed to their citizens. However, \nsome of my colleagues disagree, feeling we should play watch-dog over \nthe rest of the world's markets. So, as a middle ground, we have agreed \nthat American companies should have the freedom to explore the \ndevelopment of therapies and cures which address diseases that may be \ncommon among the populations of other countries, even though the \ndisease is not often seen in the U.S. There is no good reason why \npaternalistic United States regulatory policies should relegate \ncitizens of other countries to poor health, particularly when our \nregulatory regime is so behind-the-times that the need to pass this \nbill is universally acknowledged. Any countries not designated by \neither provision can receive exports of products not approved by FDA if \nthe product is approved by at least one country with regulatory \nsophistication.\n\n  During the course of our hearing, a concern was raised by Senator \nSimon that altering the export laws under the original terms of S. 593 \nmight result in the dumping of unsafe products into Third World \ncountries. Dr. John Petricciani, vice president for regulatory affairs \nwith Genetics Institute, a Boston biotechnology firm, and former \nDirector of the FDA's Center for Biologics, and head of the World \nHealth Organization's Biologicals Unit, with 20 years in the \nCommissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service as Deputy Director \nof the National AIDS Program Office, responded to Senator Simon in a \nletter that is included in the hearing record. I would like to include \na portion of his letter for the Record here as well:\n\n       The real issue here is one of benefit and risk. Do the \n     benefits to foreign countries in the current law outweigh the \n     risks imposed on the U.S. in terms of draining jobs and \n     capital investment in research and development and \n     manufacturing? As has been pointed out by others, one of the \n     results of that drain is the earlier availability of products \n     in Europe and elsewhere than in the U.S. If we were \n     discussing electronics or automobiles, I would not be as \n     concerned because the American people are not being placed at \n     a meaningful disadvantage by such delays.\n       However, the issue here is medical products that can make a \n     very big difference in the health of the American people. The \n     current law is resulting in new products being introduced \n     first in foreign countries, where U.S. firms are forced to \n     manufacture them. I believe that we are paying far too high a \n     price in terms of delayed availability of new products in the \n     U.S. for the theoretical benefit being provided to developing \n     countries.\n       I would also like to point out that if a U.S. company \n     really wanted to export a product that would be unacceptable \n     in the U.S., all they would have to do is manufacture it \n     outside the U.S. and export it to a developing country.\n\n  American jobs are being sent abroad because of current laws which \nrestrict\n\n[[Page S2177]]\n\nthe export of drug and medical technology not approved in the United \nStates. These laws not only waste scarce Food and Drug Administration \nresources--they ignore the sovereignty of our trading partners around \nthe world. Today's world marketplace demands that these barriers to \nU.S. global competitiveness be reformed.\n  A 1995 survey of U.S. medical device inventors and manufacturers by \nthe Wilkerson Group showed that more than 90 percent of the firms \nsurveyed planned to market new products overseas first. Ninety-eight \npercent of medical device companies in the U.S. are small businesses--\nemploying fewer than 500 employees. These companies need to generate \nsales quickly in order to make appropriate returns to their startup \ninvestors, finance their manufacturing operations, and be able to \nafford the approval process in the United States which costs them a \ngreat deal in both time and money.\n  Although the 1986 Drug Export Act represented a good step forward, it \nhas led to the development of a patchwork quilt of bureaucracy that has \nforced U.S. manufacturers to establish and maintain facilities outside \nthe United States. At the same time, the law imposes time-consuming \nrequirements on FDA, whose resources should be reprioritized to the \nreview of new, life-saving medicines and technologies for American \npatients. Offshore movement often begins with the relocation of \nclinical trials, closely followed by R, which is most efficient when \ndone in conjunction with the medical professionals involved in the \ntrials.\n  Within the device industry, 50 percent of established companies and \n87 percent of startup ventures are moving their clinical trials to \nforeign countries. This means American patients not only are not \nreceiving access to the most cutting-edge innovative medical products, \nbut also are several generations behind in what products have been \napproved and are in common use. Clinical trials are also critical to \nthe success of products developed by pharmaceutical companies, who \ngenerally expend millions of dollars on this phase of drug development.\n  In a time of unprecedented harmony in worldwide trade, as reflected \nby recent passage of GATT, our laws relating to the export of foods, \ndrugs, medical devices, and cosmetics should reflect that comity as \nwell. The rate of growth in the favorable balance of trade that the \nmedical device industry in this country has historically seen is \nslowing dramatically. The average annual rate of growth in this \nindustry was 26 percent in 1988-1992; it dropped to 11 percent in 1992-\n1994.\n  In addition, the increased competition from foreign competitors--as \nwell as American firms who have moved part or all of their operations \noverseas, and are now foreign competitors as well--is being evidenced \nin patent activity. The United States has consistently held close to \nthree-quarters of the medical device patents granted in the United \nStates, but foreign growth in this industry means that foreign-owned \ncompanies now hold thousands of U.S. patents, not just hundreds.\n  The paternalistic approach evidenced in our current law is no longer \ncompatible with today's world marketplace. In my view the original \nversion of S. 593, which was introduced by Senator Hatch and co-\nsponsored by Senators Kassebaum, Abraham, Frist and Coats as well as \nmyself, was a good approach. This would have allowed free export to any \nWorld Trade Organization [WTO] member nation, and export to non-WTO \nmembers with 30 days notice to the Secretary of HHS, who had the \nauthority to stop exports destined to be imminent hazards to the public \nhealth of citizens overseas. Similar efforts were led by Representative \nFred Upton in the House; he introduced the companion bill H.R. 1300 \nwith 24 cosponsors last summer.\n  However, in the spirit of bipartisanship, Senators Hatch, Kassebaum, \nand I, undertook an effort to try to work with Senator Kennedy to \ncreate a revised bill. The version of this bill being considered here \ntoday embodies the resultant compromise. While I believe this \nlegislation is still more restrictive than it should be, there is a \nreal value to moving a good bill rather than gaining nothing. This \nexport bill is good trade policy and is consistent with advancing the \npublic health.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3544\n\n     (Purpose: To provide for welfare reform in the State of Texas)\n\n       On page 577 line 14 of the committee substitute, insert:\n       ``Sec. 213 If the Secretary fails to approve the \n     application for waivers related to the Achieving Change for \n     Texans, a comprehensive reform of the Texas Aid To Families \n     With Dependent Children program designed to encourage work \n     instead of welfare, a request under section 1115(a) of the \n     social Security Act submitted by the Texas department of \n     Human Services on September 30, 1995, by the date of \n     enactment of this Act, notwithstanding the Secretary's \n     authority to approve the applications under such section, the \n     application shall be deemed approved.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3545\n\n  (Purpose: To remove regulatory impediments to community development)\n\n       Section 223B of the amendment is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``Sec. 223B.

If no one is on the floor to do business on the \nappropriations bill, I seek unanimous consent to speak for 15 minutes \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor and speak \nabout two pieces of legislation, one which I introduced last week and \none which I will introduce next week, simply to alert my colleagues \nabout what I intend to do with them.\n  Before I do, let me suggest that I think it is time for us to ask the \nPresident and the majority leaders and minority leaders of the House \nand the Senate to restart the budget negotiations and work to try to \nreach another budget agreement.\n  As I was coming over here this morning, I was thinking about a young \nman from Jamestown, ND. I was thinking of this issue of the budget, and \nof trying and failing. We went through all of this last year. In fact, \nI was one of the two Senate Democratic negotiators, along with Senator \nExon. We spent day after day in S-207, at the White House, in the Oval \nOffice, in the Cabinet room. Those of us involved in the negotiations \nknow we did not reach a conclusion. We did not settle on a plan to \nbalance the budget in 7 years, but we should, we can, and we ought to.\n  I was thinking about the young man from Jamestown, ND, in this \ncontext as I came over this morning. He is a young man who attended a \nwonderful little grade school in Jamestown, and he dreamed of being an \nastronaut. He grew up to be a strapping, happy young man named Rick \nHieb.\n  He joined the program to become an astronaut, went to NASA, became an \nastronaut, and flew up in the space shuttle. I recall seeing Rick in \nJamestown not only before he went up in the space shuttle, but also on \ntelevision, as I sat on my living room couch, watching him and two of \nhis fellow astronauts, who had flown in this mission with him.\n  The mission was that they were to grab, I believe it was, an Intel \nsatellite,\n\n[[Page S2178]]\n\na 10,000-pound satellite that had malfunctioned. They were to grab this \nsatellite in outer space and hold it with an arm they had constructed. \nThey were going to repair this satellite--it had never been done \nbefore--traveling 16,000 miles an hour in weightlessness while trying \nto grab a 10,000-pound satellite.\n  Rick and his two colleagues went out. Something stuck on the \napparatus, and they failed to grab the satellite. Do you know what the \nheadlines were that night? The headlines were that ``NASA Failed.'' \n``The Astronauts Failed.'' ``The Mission Failed.''\n  The next day, still orbiting in space, they tried again. They spent a \ncouple of hours walking in space, trying to manipulate and maneuver to \ngrab that satellite, and they failed again. And the second day the \nnewspapers said, ``NASA Mission Fails.'' ``Astronauts Fail.''\n  Then they spent some time trying to figure out how they could fix \nthis problem, and they spent a day doing that. The next day, they went \nback out for a third time, and that is when many of us watched them on \nlive television, I think, for about 4 hours, as they orbited around the \nEarth working this mechanism to grab the Intel satellite and fix the \nsatellite. And they did it.\n  What they did was something that they had never before rehearsed, \nthey had never planned and they had never done before. But they went \nout a third time and risked failure because they wanted to succeed.\n  Rick came to my office some time later. I asked how tough it was to \ntry to do something in space that they had never even practiced. He \nsaid, ``The shame would have been not to try.'' There is no shame in \ntrying and failing. The shame is in failing to try, and they went out \nand failed twice and the world heard that they had failed. The third \ntime they went out and did something no one expected they could do, and \nthey succeeded.\n  It is not just astronauts in space with the courage and bravery of \nRick Hieb and his colleagues who ought to understand the message that \nthe shame is if you fail to try.\n  Last year, we did not get a budget agreement. The fact is, we ought \nnot quit, we ought to try again. Now is the time for us to try to reach \na budget agreement.\n  We have a circumstance in which the majority leader is running for \nPresident. The President is running for reelection. We have a very \nunique political circumstance in this country. It will probably make it \na little difficult to deal with the budget issue. But that does not \nmean we should not continue to try. It is time to restart the budget \nnegotiations, and it is time for us to succeed in developing a plan for \na balanced budget in the interest of this country.\n  Mr. President, let me ask unanimous consent to proceed for as much \ntime as I consume in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was speaking about the negotiations to \ntry to reach some kind of a balanced budget plan. I know there has been \na lot of windmilling of the arms and gnashing of the teeth and wringing \nof the hands. There has been a lot of huffing and puffing on both sides \nof the aisle about the budget deficit and about who is at fault for not \nreaching a plan of some type to deal with the budget deficit. But the \nplain fact is, both sides, it seems to me, have something to \ncontribute.\n  I have said on the floor that the Republicans, I think, need to be \ncommended. The Republicans have said to us, this is something we must \ndo. They have continued to apply pressure that we reach some kind of a \nsolution. That, I think, serves this country's interests. The Democrats \nalso serve this country's interests by saying, yes, let us do that, but \nlet us do it the right way. Just doing it, if you do it the wrong way, \ncan be terribly destructive to this country.\n  The choices on spending, which is what we are really talking about \nwhen we balance the budget, are critically important. Some came to the \nfloor of the Senate and said, ``We have a deal for you. Let us cut Star \nSchools by 40 percent and let us increase spending on star wars by 100 \npercent.''\n  I do not know what air they breathe, but that does not seem like very \nclear thinking to me. So the method by which we balance the budget is \ncritically important. How many people do you want to kick out of the \nHead Start Program? That is a program that really works and helps \nchildren. How many kids do you want to tell, ``You no longer have an \nentitlement to have a hot lunch at school. You come from a poor family, \nbut we decide you have no longer an entitlement to have a hot lunch at \nschool in the middle of the day.'' How many people want to tell poor \nchildren that in this country? Some do, because that has been the \nproposal.\n  My point is, we should balance the budget, but we should do it with \nthe right priorities. But, most of all, I think it is time for the \nPresident and the Members of the Congress to understand now is the time \nto try again. If we simply take the lower of the figures on spending \ncuts offered during this negotiations, the lower of the figures from \neither party, it adds up to over $700 billion in spending cuts and adds \nup to the kind of spending cuts that will reach a balanced budget in \nthe year 2002.\n  So, it is not a case of not having the will to get there. It is a \ncase of not agreeing to the menu of the spending cuts. It is time to \ntry again. It is time for the President and Members of Congress to sit \ndown, restart the negotiations, and solve this problem.\n  As I said, before I relinquish the floor, we have a very unique \ncircumstance facing us. We have a majority leader here in the Senate \nrunning for President. We have a President down at the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue who wants to keep his job. A lot of what is going \nto go on this year, I assume, will have a substantial amount of \npolitical overtones.\n  But there ought not be, it seems to me, a political judgment in this \ncountry that says balancing the budget is not important. It is \nimportant. It is the right thing to do, and it ought to be done the \nright way. I think the President and leaders of Congress have an \nobligation to restart these negotiations, restart them now, and \ncontinue budget negotiations until we finalize a plan and agree to a \nplan to reach a balanced budget. The American people deserve that and \nthis country deserves that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/15/senate-section/article/S2168-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2178-S2179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE TRADE DEFICIT AND JOBS IN OUR COUNTRY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to just speak briefly about two \nissues. One is a jobs issue and the other is a crime issue. Both, I \nthink, are important to this country. I introduced a bill on one \nsubject last week, and I am going to introduce a bill on the other next \nweek. I just talked about the budget deficit. That has been coming down \nsome in recent years. It is still too high, but it has been coming \ndown.\n  Nobody talks about the trade deficit. The trade deficit has been \ngoing up. Last year was a record. The fact is the trade deficit goes up \nbecause we are exporting manufacturing jobs out of this country. It \nmeans fewer jobs and fewer opportunities and less income for too many \nof the American people who need a good job with good income.\n  How do we deal with the jobs issue? I do not have all the answers. I \nknow we have to deal with the trade deficit. Nobody here talks about \nit. The trade deficit is going to be repaid ultimately with a lower \nstandard of living in this country. So we have to deal with that.\n  One thing we ought to do, just for starters, relates to a bill I \nintroduced in the Senate last week. It is very simple. The bill simply \nsays, let us stop providing tax loopholes or tax incentives for those \npeople who move their plants and their jobs overseas. I bet there are \nnot many people here who know that is what goes on in this country.\n  We have in our Tax Code in this country a provision that says, if you \nhave a manufacturing plant in America, and you have 100 jobs or 1,000 \njobs or 10,000 jobs in America, we will give you a deal, you close up \nthat plant, fire those workers, move them overseas, and you get a tax \nbreak. You get a tax break.\n  You get two plants sitting side by side across the street from each \nother, and they make the same product, hire the same number of workers, \nand one of them closes up and moves overseas and the other one stays \nhere. Guess\n\n[[Page S2179]]\n\nwhat the difference is? Our Tax Code says the one that moved overseas, \nyou do not have to pay taxes to this country even though you \nmanufacture the same product and ship it back to sell in Pittsburgh or \nDenver or Fargo. You do not have to pay taxes. The company in a State \npays taxes out of its income, but you do not pay taxes out of your \nincome because, as long as you move the company overseas, you can keep \nthe income over there tax free until you are repatriated back. Most do \nnot repatriate back, so they get a fat, juicy tax incentive for moving \ntheir plants overseas and closing their plants in this country.\n  It does not take smelling salts to get people clear-headed enough to \nunderstand that this is a fundamentally goofy provision in our tax law. \nIf you cannot start with the first step in deciding that we are going \nto stop providing incentives for people to ship their jobs out of \nAmerica and move their jobs overseas, then we do not have a ghost of a \nchance of solving our problem in this country with fewer jobs that pay \nwell.\n  Why do I say that? People say there are more jobs in our country. \nYes, there are more jobs. The fact is, there are also more people in \nour country, and the more jobs we are getting are not the kind of jobs \nthat pay well. Too often they are service industry jobs that do not pay \nvery well. Guess what kind of jobs are leaving? The manufacturing jobs \nthat used to pay well with good benefits. What we need to do is shut \nthe loophole that says move your jobs overseas and we will pay you to \ndo it. Shut it and shut it immediately.\n  The piece of legislation I introduced last week, which I hope to have \na number of votes on in the Congress, some hearings on, is very simple. \nThere are two provisions in it. One says, shut the insidious loophole \nthat says we will pay you if you move your jobs overseas. Just shut it \ndown. End it. Just be done with it.\n  Second, you take the money from that, a little over $2 billion, and \nyou use it to provide tax credits for those who create new net jobs in \nour country. Those who create new jobs, more jobs now than they did \nover the previous couple-year base of their employment, they get a 25-\npercent tax credit on their payroll taxes, 25-percent tax credit for 2 \nyears for the new jobs they create.\n  Let us use the savings by closing the loophole that exists to move \njobs overseas and use those savings to provide an incentive to create \njobs over here.\n  What could be more sensible than that? It is very simple: Yes or no, \ndo we want to close the loophole that exists to send jobs overseas? Of \ncourse we do. We ought to. I had a vote here on the Senate last year \nand 52 Members voted to keep the loophole open. I will give them a \nchance to redeem themselves a couple of times this year. Should we \nclose the loophole? Of course we should. Should we provide incentive to \nkeep jobs in this country? Of course we should.\n  This is a very simple proposition. This does not go into a big school \nto learn. This is not advanced math. You give people an incentive for \nmoving their jobs, they will move them; provide people incentive to \ncreate jobs, you will have more jobs here.\n  Mr. President, S. 1597 is a piece of legislation--and I hope my \ncolleagues will become acquainted with it because we will vote on it a \nnumber of times this year. I hope that enough colleagues will \nunderstand their constituents have an interest in it and will approve \nthis. I would like to see one Member of the Senate go to one town \nmeeting in one community in this country and stand up, and in the first \nsentence of the town meeting say, ``By the way, I have a new idea. My \nidea is this: We should put in our Tax Code a little incentive that \nwill reward companies who shut down their plants in America and move \ntheir jobs overseas.'' I think they would get booed out of the room \nbefore they get to the second sentence. That is what our Tax Code does. \nI am determined that we will shut that perverse, insidious incentive \ndown, and we will do it soon.\n  That relates to the issue of jobs. Will that fix our jobs problem? \nNo, but it will help. At least doctors understand to save the patient \nthe first thing you do is stop the bleeding. That is what this bill is \nabout.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/15/senate-section/article/S2178-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2179-S2180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 CRIME\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Now, the issue of crime. People want good jobs in our \ncountry. They also want to feel safe, and ours is a country with a \nserious crime challenge. I have a crime clock which shows the problem \nwe have. One murder every 23 minutes; one forcible rape every 5 \nminutes; one robbery every 51 seconds; one aggravated assault every 28 \nseconds. We have 23,000 murders in America every year, and 110,000 \nrapes.\n  This is a country with a serious crime problem. I have said on the \nfloor many times, and I want to repeat it, that it does not take Dick \nTracy to understand who is going to commit the next violent crime. It \nis someone who committed a previous violent crime, and, in most cases, \nsomeone who has been in prison and who has been released early.\n  Earlier this week, I mentioned two recent cases, both of them in the \nWashington, DC, area. But I could stand up here and tell 3,400 similar \nstories, because 3,400 people have been murdered by people who should \nhave been in prison and unable to murder anybody, but they were let out \nearly. They were told that, since they behaved in prison, they would be \nlet out early.\n  Here are two of these cases. One involves a young woman named Bettina \nPruckmayr from Washington, DC, a young attorney, 26 years old, just \nstarting her career here in Washington, DC. She was allegedly abducted \nby a 38-year-old man named Leo Gonzales Wright on the evening of \nDecember 16. Mr. Wright abducted her and forced her to drive to an ATM \nmachine. He has been linked to this crime through a bank security \nphoto. He stabbed Bettina Pruckmayr, 38 times--7 times in the back, 3 \ntimes in the neck, and elsewhere in the body with sufficient force to \nbreak her bones. He killed her brutally.\n  Who is Leo Gonzales Wright, this man who allegedly killed Bettina \nPruckmayr? This young attorney was killed by someone who should not \nhave been able to kill an innocent person. He should have been in jail. \nHe is a man who previously committed robbery, previously committed \nrape, previously committed murder, previously committed armed robbery. \nDespite rape, robbery, and murder, this man, at age 38, was walking \naround the streets of Washington, DC. In fact, after he was released \nearly from prison, the police picked him up for selling drugs. But he \nwas not put back in prison.\n\n  It does not take Sherlock Holmes to figure out who will commit the \nnext crime. It is someone who should have been in prison, like this \nalleged killer--who had murdered before, robbed before, raped before--\nbut who is walking the streets because someone in the criminal justice \nsystem said, ``We want to let you out of prison early''--and did. The \nresult is a 26-year-old young attorney named Bettina is dead. It should \nnot have happened.\n  The second case involves a 13-year-old boy named Jonathan Hall, from \nFairfax County, VA. I do not know much about Jonathan Hall except what \nI have heard on the news. Jonathan Hall was a young boy who was stabbed \n58 times and thrown in a pond for dead. When they found him, they found \ngrass and dirt between his fingers because he apparently, with 58 stab \nwounds, had tried to pull himself out of the pond. He was not dead when \nhe was thrown into the pond, but he died.\n  The alleged killer of Jonathan is a fellow names James ``Buck'' \nMurray. James ``Buck'' Murray was sent to prison for murdering a cab \ndriver a number of years ago. While he was in prison he was put on work \nrelease and he kidnapped a woman. Then, he murdered a fellow inmate. \nThat is two murders and a kidnaping. And guess what? A few months ago \nhe was walking the streets of Virginia, a free person, because the \ncriminal justice system apparently felt it was OK that he could get out \nearly. And now a 13-year-old boy is dead because a person who should \nhave been in prison was walking the streets.\n  There are 3,400 other murder stories just like these. I have had some \narguments with the folks in my State about the criminal justice \nsystem's approach to letting people out early. Here are the early \nrelease policies of some States, which I bet most people do not know. I \nwill not go through and name\n\n[[Page S2180]]\n\nall of the States. Here is a State near the top of the alphabet that \nsays to a violent criminal, every year you serve in prison you get 540 \ndays off for good time. In other words, for every year you serve, you \nget out almost 2 years early. Serve 10 years--people say it is a big \ndeal that we now say to violent criminals you have to serve 85 percent \nof their sentences. They get sentenced 10 years, they serve 85 percent \nof that time, and a violent criminal is out early. The average violent \noffender is now sentenced to a 20-year term and serves less than half \nof that sentence. The average person serving time in prison for murder \nin America serves only 7 years.\n  The States say, ``If you are good in prison, we will let you out \nearly.'' Then, people like Bettina and Jonathan and others get murdered \nbecause we decided we cannot afford to keep violent people in prison \nwhere they belong-- 180 days a year, good time credits for every year \nyou serve, half a year off. Here is 180 days, 120 days, 365 days, 400 \ndays, 547 days. These are the number of days of good time that the \nStates give to these people. ``If you are good in prison, no matter how \nviolent you are, we let you out early.'' This has to stop. This sort of \nthing cannot continue in our country.\n\n  If we, as a country cannot assure the safety of innocent people by \ndeciding that those who commit violent acts, those who commit murder, \nwill go to prison and stay there until the end of their sentence, if we \ncannot assure people we will keep these folks off the street, then we, \nin my judgment, have not done our job. Most of this has to do with \nState government. In fact, all of this does.\n  Nobody is let out of the Federal system early. There is no automatic \ngood time credit for being good in the Federal system. The last crime \nbill eliminated that because of my provision that said that we are \ngoing to get rid of good time. I want the States to do the same thing. \nIf you are a violent criminal, no good time for good behavior. You are \ngoing to be sent to prison to be kept off the streets.\n  I am introducing legislation next week called the SAFER Act, the Stop \nAllowing Felons Early Release Act. I want to distinguish between the \nfelons in prison who are violent versus those who are not. I want \nprisoners who committed violent crimes to know that when they go in \nprison, they are going to stay in prison until the end of their term. \nMy bill provides an incentive through the Federal truth in sentencing \ngrant program to eliminate parole and good time credits for violent \noffenders.\n  We have an amount of money under the truth in sentencing grant \nprogram for prison construction, and for other purposes, that is \nallocated to eligible States. I would reduce these grants by 25 percent \nfor the States that have not decided to end early release for violent \ncriminals. For those States who have decided they will end early \nrelease for violent criminals, they will participate fully in this \ngrant program and receive an incentive payment.\n  If a State decides it does not want to do that, that it wants to keep \nmoving violent prisoners back to the streets, then they will lose a \nportion of this incentive grant program.\n  My legislation is simple. It will not force the States to do \nanything, but it will say to them, with the amount of money that we are \nusing here in the Congress, in the crime bill, we want to at least try \nto provide incentive to those States that do the right thing. The right \nthing is to start deciding all across this country, especially in the \nState criminal justice systems, that violent people sent to prison will \nstay in prison.\n  It is probably hard to know how some of these families feel, \nespecially when they discover their loved one has been killed by \nsomebody who should not have been in a position to kill anybody. My \nmother was killed in a manslaughter incident. It was not the kind of \nincident I have described with Jonathan Hall and Bettina Pruckmayr, but \nI understand getting a telephone call about having a loved one involved \nin this kind of a crime, having a loved one lose her life in a violent \ncrime. I can only imagine how families feel when they hear that their \ndaughter or their mother or their son has been killed, and then they \ndiscover that the perpetrator was someone who has murdered two other \npeople and spent a fraction of the time they should have spent in jail, \nbut who, because the State let them out early, was in their \nneighborhood threatening their lives and their children's lives.\n  This country has to do better than that. This country has to decide \nthere are some criminals who, by their acts of violence, demonstrate \nthat they deserve no good time, no early release. The American people \ndeserve to have those people sentenced and put away in a prison cell \nuntil the end of their term.\n  I hope very much that, as we discuss a crime bill this year and \ncontinue to work through the questions that confront the American \npeople about jobs and crime and health care and education, and the \nrange of issues that people care about and want us to do something \nabout, we will take a look at this issue. Do we not have an obligation, \nwhen we have a person who has committed a murder, a kidnapping, another \nmurder, to decide that this person does not deserve to be on our \nstreets? Do we not have that responsibility? If the State governments \ndo not exercise that responsibility, do we not have the right to try to \nprovide some incentive and initiative there? I think we do.\n  This issue of devolution that we are talking about now in the \nCongress is that the Federal Government cannot do anything right, so we \nshould send it all back to the State and local governments. These cases \nI am talking about are all State cases. Nobody is getting out of the \nFederal prisons early to do this. We have determinate sentencing, and \nthere is no good time because I saw to it.\n  In the State judicial systems, you can earn up to 2 years off of your \nsentence for every year served. All you have to do is be good. Half of \nour prison population in America are nonviolent prisoners. Half of them \nare convicted of violent crimes. I want us as a country to distinguish \nbetween the two. I want prison cells open and available for those who \nhave committed violent acts. Jonathan Hall should not be dead today, \nnor should Bettina Pruckmayr, nor should 3,400 other Americans killed \nby people let out early, who should have still been in prison. I hope \nwe will discuss this at some great length this year as we discuss the \ncrime bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lugar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business for 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, recent information from a wide variety \nof sources make two things very clear about the issue of drug policy, \ndrug trends and the problems it causes, and that is that teenage drug \nuse is on the rise, a disturbingly fast rise, and also that the \nAmerican public remains very concerned about the need for counter-drug \npolicies that are effective.\n  We know from virtually every survey, every reporting mechanism on \ndrug use that adolescent use is on a rocket ride into the upper \natmosphere. We know from hospital data that emergency room admissions \nare on the increase and that many of these involve young people. Late \nlast year, we had firm confirmation of just how bad things are and \nwhere they are headed.\n  The administration released the latest high school survey. These data \nmake it abundantly clear that not only is use of drugs going up, but \nyouthful attitude toward the dangers of drug use are changing and \nchanging for the worst. The best spin that the administration could put \non the data was somehow, ``Well, it's not as bad as it was in 1979.''\n  Just what sort of a comment does that say? It notes that since 1992, \nthe proportion of 10th graders using illicit\n\n[[Page S2181]]\n\ndrugs in the prior 12 months had risen by almost 75 percent. Marijuana \nuse among 8th graders--those would be people as young as 13 years of \nage--has risen by 2\\1/2\\ times. Prevalence among 10th graders has \ndoubled.\n  These figures are bad enough, but what is worse is that they come \nafter decades of decline. If we had a chart, that chart would show from \nthese very same surveys, because they have been annual over a long \nperiod of time, that from 1979 down through 1992, there was a dramatic \ndrop in the number of teenagers experimenting with drugs.\n  Since 1992, as this recent report clearly states, something is wrong, \nand there is a dramatic rise in that downward trend of the years from \n1979 to 1982.\n  But that is not all, Mr. President. The DAWN survey of emergency room \nadmissions is up. The PRIDE survey, echoing the problems in our \nschools, shows that use is up. The household survey shows that use is \nup. So, clearly, something is wrong. But we can take heart: Things are \nnot as bad as they were in 1979.\n\n  What these figures mean is that we are storing up trouble for the \nnext decade. We are in the process today of creating a new wave of drug \nabuse and addiction that is going to create problems for tomorrow.\n  This trend, as I said, comes after years of decline in adolescent use \nand the creation of an understanding during that period of time among \nthe young about the dangers of drug use that helped to insulate them \nfrom ever starting to experiment with drugs.\n  Over the last 4 years, with this trend going up, that attitude that \ndrugs are dangerous among young people is changing. So I think it is \nlegitimate to ask and look at reasons why it is changing.\n  One of the principal reasons is that we have lost a coherent public \nmessage that drug use is dangerous and wrong. One of the main reasons \nfor this is the disappearing act performed by the President on the \nwhole drug question. Simply put, the bully pulpit stands empty. There \nis no message and no moral authority.\n  That, hopefully, is changing with the appointment of the new drug \nczar. Hopefully that is changing with the President 10 days ago in \nBaltimore holding a nationwide meeting by satellite to young people on \nthe dangers of drugs and the President's concern about it.\n  The President in his speech mentioned the problems that his family \nhad with drugs, I guess a brother it was.\n  Hopefully, it is turning around just because the President feels \ncomfortable talking about the problem. It seemed to me that for this \nwhole first term of office, the President must not have talked about it \nbecause he did not feel comfortable talking about it.\n  But whether it is the President of the United States, whether it is \nthe music stars that the younger generation looks to that are parading \nthe legitimacy of drug use or movie stars, the movie industry not \nplaying it down, or whether it is just a plain lack that we do not have \non television anymore the ads that the industry used to put on that \ndrug use was bad, the public service announcements that drug use was \nbad, whatever it is, it all adds up to this dramatic increase in the \nuse of drugs, most important, the dangerous experimentation by young \npeople and the fact that that portends danger 10 years down the road \nfor other problems that come from enhancement of drug use, the crime \nand everything that goes with it.\n  So there is no message out there, and the people who used to have the \nmoral authority to give that message are no longer giving it.\n  Daily, more Americans die from the consequences of drug use, more are \nmaimed in drug-related violence than have died in many of our overseas \nventures. Certainly, more lives are at risk than have been lost to date \nin Bosnia. Yet, what do we see? We see a commitment of manpower, \nresources and treasure bound for far-flung fields in dubious \nenterprises of peacekeeping, and meanwhile we have a major problem \nright here at home calling for action and leadership.\n  We send peacekeeping missions to Bosnia, but where is our antidrug \nmission in Detroit? Where are the prime time news events to sell a \npolicy on drugs, that drugs are dangerous? As I have said, the \nPresident had this wonderful assembly in Baltimore to bring attention \nto it. He has appointed an outstanding person as drug czar. But until \nthese things happen--where was the media attention from past action by \nour political leadership on the drug problem?\n  If you do not think there is a problem of leadership on the drug \nquestion, try to find a word in the newspapers at that time about the \nresignation of Dr. Brown when he resigned late last year. Try to find \nmention of recent Gallup polls on public opinion about drugs. Try to \nfind honorable mention of the surveys, the other surveys that I \nmentioned in my comments this afternoon.\n  If you go back to this period of time when the political leadership \nof America during the 1980's was saying, ``Just say no to drugs,'' when \nour TV tubes were filled with stories and public service announcements \nabout the dangers of drugs, when our respected leaders in entertainment \nwere saying drugs are bad--Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 \nmore minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. When we had Bill Bennett resign as drug czar during \nthis period of time, it was front-page news. When Dr. Brown left 2 or 3 \nmonths ago, you may remember the story was buried someplace on page 12 \nin one of the newspapers I read. Dr. Brown's resignation there, the \nstory of it was buried along with news about drugs or the public's \nconcern.\n  That fact of how the media treat this very serious problem, versus \nhow serious the public at the grassroots really feel it is, tells us \nsomething about the present state of our drug policy and how the media \nthink. Since they do not care about the drug issue, since the media do \nnot care about the drug issue, it ceases to be news. Never mind the \npublic attitude or what these surveys show, just somehow it does not \nhappen to be news.\n  It is clear, however, Mr. President, that the public is very, very \nconcerned about this issue. A poll earlier this year showed that over \n80 percent of the public saw stopping the flow of illegal drugs to the \nUnited States as their primary foreign policy concern. Just in the last \nfew weeks, the Gallup poll organization released information on the \npublic's attitude about drugs.\n  This poll makes it clear that, unlike with the administration or the \npress, the drug issue has not fallen off the public's agenda. According \nto this poll by Gallup, 94 percent--I want to repeat that--94 percent \nof the American public say the drug abuse problem is either a crisis or \na serious problem. They rate drugs second only to crime, which often is \nlinked to drugs as their main concern.\n  Indeed, according to the poll, Americans rate the drug problem as \nmore serious than the problems of health care, welfare reform, or even \nthe budget deficit. Since you would be hard pressed to find this \nconcern reflected in our media, press, radio, and TV, I think we ought \nto state that again. The public rates the drug problem as more serious \nthan health care, welfare, and the deficit. So I hope our national \nmedia leaders are going to take that to heart. Of course, I hope our \npolicy leaders pay attention.\n  Congress is listening, probably because we are closer to the \ngrassroots. We have a responsibility in the process of representative \ngovernment to keep our ear to the grassroots. I think most do. And \nfollowing up on that, Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich declared a new \ninitiative on drugs. This is in keeping with the past congressional \nefforts to make the drug issue a very serious policy concern. We \ncreated the drug czar's office to coordinate policy in the middle of \nthe last decade. We gave the administration a variety of tools to \nimprove our international efforts.\n  We have supported coherent programs when they have been explained and \ndefended. Just this week, we gave $3.9 million, in this appropriations \nbill that we are on, to the Office of Drug Policy so our drug czar can \nhave more equipment to do his work. We have acted in the past to \nencourage direction and purpose, and it is clear that we need to do \nthis more often. So that is why the task force launched by our majority \nleader and the Speaker of the House will help us to do that. I happened \nto be named cochair of that task\n\n[[Page S2182]]\n\nforce. I also have the position of Chairman of the Senate Caucus on \nInternational Narcotics Control.\n  In both of these efforts, every member of the task force and the \ncaucus--we pledge to do everything we can to put this issue back on the \nright track, meaning that it is as important a policy concern for us in \nthe Congress as it is for the 94 percent of the people at the \ngrassroots who say it is a major concern, more so than balancing the \nbudget or welfare reform or health care reform. I believe my colleagues \nwill do that.\n\n  But there is no task force, there is no caucus, no law that we can \npass that is the answer to this problem by itself or even a serious \ncommitment by the administration to this--albeit that is very, very \nimportant as an answer. Hopefully, the new appointee as czar highlights \nthat, and he will do that. I feel that he will. We also, though, need a \nmore sweeping, renewed effort to get the word out to a new generation \nof young people about the harm and wrongs of using drugs.\n  But our efforts cannot stop or start with just Government action. It \nis going to take a public commitment to the effort. We have to see \ncommunities and families reengaged on the issue. We need parents \ntalking to children. We need a strong, clear message coming from our \ncultural elite, from the media, and from our community leaders. It is a \nmessage that we must continually renew. It is not a sometime thing, Mr. \nPresident.\n  If we do not do this on a concerted basis, we put the next generation \nat risk. Most importantly, as political leaders, as just part of the \nelement of our total society to accomplish this goal, we have ignored \nour responsibilities, but so have the other elements of society.\n  When mothers sell their sons for drugs, when our own military bases \nare not free of drug trafficking, we have a problem that touches home. \nWhile only one American has died in Bosnia, many Americans die from \ndrug use and have their lives ruined by drugs every day. We have a \nclear interest in doing something meaningful on this issue. It strikes \nhome. The public understands it. The American people support meaningful \naction. This is a problem that we cannot afford to ignore. It is an \nissue that can only grow worse if we do not act. That is why the \ninitiative to establish a serious drug policy is critical for the \nfuture.\n  So, I call not just upon my colleagues to work to renew our effort or \nto renew Congress' leadership on an issue so essential to the health \nand welfare of the Nation's young, but I call upon all of society to \nrespond accordingly.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/15/senate-section/article/S2180-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2182-S2186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BALANCED BUDGET DOWNPAYMENT ACT, II\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3547 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], for himself, Mr. \n     Hollings, Mr. Pell, Mr. Daschle and Mr. Kerry, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3547 to No. 3466.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       The appropriation for the Arms Control and Disarmament \n     Agency in Public Law 103-317 (108 STAT. 1768) is amended by \n     deleting after ``until expended'' the following: ``only for \n     activities related to the implementation of the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention'' : Provided, That amounts made available \n     shall not be used to undertake new programs or to increase \n     employment above levels on board at the time of enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we have been working with the other side \nof the aisle to see if there was some way to get additional operating \nresources for the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency or ``ACDA'' as it \nis called. ACDA's appropriation in this bill has been reduced to \n$35,700,000, down from its current level of $50,378,000, and far below \nthe President's request of $75,300,000.\n  This amendment frees up approximately $2,700,000 in prior year \nappropriations that are earmarked in the fiscal year 1995 Commerce, \nJustice, and State Appropriations Act for the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. It allows these resources to be used instead for ACDA \nsalaries and expenses. The amendment stipulates that these funds not be \nused to increase ACDA's staff. However, given the current funding \nsituation that I have outlined, adding staff does not appear to be a \nviable option for this agency.\n  Mr. President, we have tried to find an acceptable offset or list of \noffsets to provide ACDA with more than the $2,700,000 in this \namendment. I know that was the wish of our distinguished minority \nleader, Senator Daschle, and Senator Pell, our former Foreign Relations \nCommittee chairman. I believe that was the hope of the chairman of our \ncommittee, Senator Hatfield. However, this has not proven to be \npossible and this amendment represents the best we can do at this time.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3547) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay it on \nthe table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n              Bonneville Power Administration Refinancing\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on section \n3303 of the bill we are now considering. Section 3303, on Bonneville \nPower Administration refinancing, is bipartisan legislation which would \nresolve permanently past interest rate subsidy criticisms regarding the \nFederal Columbia River Power System [FCRPS] investments in a manner \nthat benefits Federal taxpayers while minimizing the impact of the \nBonneville Power Administration's [Bonneville] power and transmission \nrates.\n  Section 3303 is substantially equivalent to legislation transmitted \nto the Congress by the administration on September 15, 1994. Senator \nMurray and I introduced the administration's proposal as S. 92 on \nJanuary 4, 1995. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \nreported S. 92 on July 11, 1995. This legislation has already passed \nthe Senate and the House as part of H.R. 2491, the 7-Year Balanced \nBudget Reconciliation Act of 1995. The administration continues to \nsupport this legislation and I urge the Senate to adopt it again.\n  This legislation is important to my region of the country because it \nwill enhance the long-term electric rate stability of the Bonneville \nPower Administration and thereby better position Bonneville to retain \nmarket share and thereby be better able to fund all of its \nresponsibilities, including the fish and wildlife duties under the \nNorthwest Power Act and the repayment obligations to the U.S. Treasury. \nIn exchange for providing enhanced certainty to Bonneville in terms of \nits Treasury repayment responsibilities, the U.S. Treasury would \nrealize additional returns from Bonneville ratepayers and the Federal \nbudget deficit would be reduced by about $89 million over the current \n7-year budget window. In short, section 3303 would provide long-term \nrate stability benefits for Northwest ratepayers and increased revenues \nfor the U.S. Treasury. The Congress should again pass this legislation \nand forward it to the President for final enactment.\n  Mr. President, Bonneville is at a crossroads. As a power marketer of \nabundant inexpensive hydroelectric power from the Columbia River and \nother river systems in the Pacific Northwest, Bonneville was for many \nyears unhampered by serious competitive pressure. Free for the most \npart\n\n[[Page S2183]]\n\nfrom the constraints that normally attend close competition, Bonneville \nwas able to use its economical resource mix to achieve revenues that \nenabled it to pursue the ambitious mandates of the Pacific Northwest \nPower Planning and Conservation Act of 1980, commonly referred to as \nthe Northwest Power Act. Whatever their views of Bonneville's mandated \nprograms, Bonneville's customers stayed because Bonneville was by a \nsubstantial margin the low-cost provider, with a reliable and stable \nbulk electric power system unequaled in the world. Indeed, low cost \nFederal hydroelectric power was the key assumption underpinning the \nNorthwest Power Act.\n  That assumption must now yield to a new reality. The costs of \nBonneville's required fish mitigation efforts under the Endangered \nSpecies Act and the Northwest Power Act, and Bonneville's resource \nacquisitions, primarily nuclear energy and electric power conservation, \nhave driven Bonneville's price upward. At the same time, other factors \nhave aligned to drive down the costs of alternative sources of electric \npower. New technology in the form of highly efficient combined cycle \ngas turbines, declining gas prices caused by open competition and the \ndiscovery and exploitation of huge gas deposits in Canada, and the \npresence of surplus gas generation in California have combined to lure \nlong-term Bonneville customers away from Bonneville and Federal \nhydroelectric power.\n  First and foremost Bonneville is a business enterprise. It must meet \nthe competition, and maintain a customer base sufficient to fund its \nstatutory responsibilities and to protect the billions of dollars \ninvested in the FCRPS by Federal taxpayers. To meet these \nresponsibilities, Bonneville has cut and continues to cut costs \ndramatically through huge program deferrals, program elimination and \nstaff reductions. These severe cuts are essential to maintain an \nadequately low product price. Nonetheless, the Congress has realized \nthat these measures may not be enough. To maintain a long-term customer \nbase, Bonneville must be rate stable, meaning it must be able to assure \nits customers that they are insulated from important risks of cost \nescalation.\n  For many years, several administrations have threatened to change \nfundamentally the terms upon which Bonneville satisfies its obligation \nto return the taxpayers' investment in the FCRPS. These proposals had \nvarying facets but in general would have increased substantially the \nreturns to the Treasury. The annual threats, elicited in Bonneville's \ncustomers a grave concern that steeply increased returns to the \nTreasury would ultimately be visited on them. Section 3303 will \neliminate this risk. Yet at the same time it will exact from ratepayers \na fair price for eliminating the uncertainty. Analogizing to a common \ntransaction relating to mortgages or other financial contracts, the \nbill would have Bonneville and its ratepayers pay a charge to refinance \nthe contract to obtain other favorable terms. At the same time, the \nbill acknowledges the new reality of the market-place and seeks to \nstrengthen Bonneville so that it is positioned in the long-run to \nrecoup the Federal investment in full.\n  The purpose of section 3303 is to assure power purchasers that \nBonneville will not be forced to raise its wholesale electric rates to \nnoncompetitive levels in order to satisfy possible future changes in \nlaw or practice relating to the requirements under which Bonneville \npresently repays the Federal capital investment funded by \nappropriations in the FCRPS. In exchange for providing enhanced \ncertainty in the terms of Bonneville's repayment responsibilities, the \nU.S. Treasury would realize additional returns from Bonneville \nratepayers because enactment of the bill would increase Bonneville's \npayments in respect of the affected investments by a net present value \nof $100 million.\n  Section 3303 would accomplish this by providing for reconstitution of \nthe outstanding repayment obligations of Bonneville for the \nappropriated capital investments in the FCRPS. Section 3303 would reset \nBonneville's repayment obligation on all outstanding appropriated \nFederal investments in the FCRPS, as of October 1, 1996. The interest \nrates to repay the FCRPS investments would thus increase from their \nrelatively low imbedded levels, which average approximately 3.4 \npercent, to current Treasury interest rates. Treasury interest rates at \nthe time of the resetting of the principal amount of the investments \nare expected to be substantially higher than the historically imbedded \nrates.\n  The total principal amount outstanding on the appropriated investment \nrepayment responsibility, now approximately $6.7 billion, would be \nreset to equal the sum of the net present value of the payments \nBonneville would be expected to make under current practice, plus an \nincrement of $100 million. The present value would be determined using \nthen current Treasury rates. The bill would lead Bonneville to recover \nfor return to the Treasury an additional $100 million in net present \nvalue over that which would be returned under existing repayment \nconditions. This supplement to the present value of Bonneville's \nrepayment obligation will cause a noticeable but tolerable increase in \nthe costs to be recovered in Bonneville's rates. As I indicated \npreviously, it would also result in favorable budget scoring effects.\n  Section 3303 would provide necessary certainty to Bonneville \ncustomers, by requiring that Bonneville offer certain contract terms in \nall future and existing contracts for the sale of electric power and \nthe provision of transmission services. These contract terms would be \nintended to discourage a future Congress from amending law in a manner \nthat would exact further returns with respect to an investment once the \ninvestment is repaid, or from taking returns on the investment in \naddition to the principal and interest provided under the section 3303.\n  Mr. President, in summary I emphasize that section 3303 is bipartisan \nlegislation which passed the Congress in the 1995 reconciliation bill \nand continues to be supported by the administration. The proposal would \nsatisfactorily resolve a longstanding disagreement in a manner that is \nfair and provides certainty to both Pacific Northwest electric \nratepayers and Federal taxpayers. Section 3303 would also enhance the \nlong-term rate stability of the Bonneville Power Administration, better \nposition Bonneville to retain market share, and thereby improve \nBonneville's ability to fund all of its responsibilities, including the \nfish and wildlife duties and Treasury repayment. I urge the Senate to \nagain pass this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the section-by-section \nanalysis that has been prepared to accompany section 3303 be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record; as follows:\n\n    Section 3303 Bonneville Power Administration Section-by-Section \n                                Analysis\n\n\n                              INTRODUCTION\n\n       The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) markets electric \n     power produced by federal hydroelectric projects in the \n     Pacific Northwest and provides electric power transmission \n     services over certain federally-owned transmission \n     facilities. Among other obligations, BPA establishes rates to \n     repay to the U.S. Treasury the federal taxpayers' investments \n     in these hydroelectric projects and transmission facilities \n     made primarily through annual and no-year appropriations. \n     Since the early 1980's, subsidy criticisms have been directed \n     at the relatively low interest rates applicable to many of \n     these Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) \n     investments. The purpose of Section 3303 is to resolve \n     permanently the subsidy criticisms in a way that benefits the \n     taxpayer while minimizing the impact on BPA's power and \n     transmission rates.\n       The legislation accomplishes this purpose by resetting the \n     principal of BPA's outstanding repayment obligations at an \n     amount that is $100 million greater than the present value of \n     the principal and interest BPA would have paid in the absence \n     of this Section 3303 on the outstanding appropriated \n     investments in the FCRPS. The interest rates applicable to \n     the reset principal amounts are based on the U.S. Treasury's \n     borrowing costs in effect at the time the principal is reset. \n     The resetting of the repayment obligations is effective \n     October 1, 1996, coincident with the beginning of BPA's next \n     rate period.\n       While Section 3303 increases BPA's repayment obligations, \n     and consequently will increase the rates BPA charges its \n     ratepayers, it also provides assurance to BPA ratepayers that \n     the Government will not further increase these obligations in \n     the future. By eliminating the exposure to such increases, \n     the legislation substantially improves the ability of BPA to \n     maintain its customer base, and to make future payments to \n     the U.S. Treasury on time and in full. Since Section 3303 \n     will cause both BPA's rates and its\n\n[[Page S2184]]\n\n     cash transfers to the U.S. Treasury to increase, it will aid \n     in reducing the Federal budget deficit by an estimated $89 \n     million over the current budget window.\n\n\n                       SUBSECTION (a) DEFINITIONS\n\n       This subsection contains definitions that apply to this \n     Section 3303.\n       Paragraph (1) is self-explanatory.\n       Paragraph (2) clarifies the repayment obligations to be \n     affected under Section 3303 by defining ``capital \n     investment'' to mean a capitalized cost funded by a Federal \n     appropriation for a project, facility, or separable unit or \n     feature of a project or facility, provided that the \n     investment is one for which the Administrator of the \n     Bonneville Power Administration (Administrator or BPA) is \n     required by law to establish rates to repay to the U.S. \n     Treasury. The definition excludes Federal irrigation \n     investments required by law to be repaid by the Administrator \n     through the sale of electric power, transmission or other \n     services; and, investments financed either by BPA current \n     revenues or by bonds issued and sold, or authorized to be \n     issued and sold, under section 13 of the Federal Columbia \n     River Transmission System Act.\n       Paragraph (3) defines new capital investments as those \n     capital investments that are placed in service after \n     September 30, 1996.\n       Paragraph (4) defines those capital investments whose \n     principal amounts are reset by Section 3303. ``Old capital \n     investments'' are capital investments whose capitalized costs \n     were incurred but not repaid before October 1, 1996, provided \n     that the related project, facility, or separable unit or \n     feature was placed in service before October 1, 1996. Thus, \n     the capital investments whose principal amounts are reset by \n     Section 3303 do not include capital investments placed in \n     service after September 30, 1996. The term ``capital \n     investments'' is defined in subsection (a)(2).\n       Paragraph (5) defines ``repayment date'' as the end of the \n     period that the Administrator is to establish rates to repay \n     the principal amount of a capital investment.\n       Paragraph (6) defines the term ``Treasury rate.'' The term \n     Treasury rate is used to establish both the discount rates \n     for determining the present value of the old capital \n     investments (subsection (b)(1)) and the interest rates that \n     will apply to the new principal amounts of the old capital \n     investments (subsection (c)). The term Treasury rate is also \n     used under subsection (g) in determining the interest rates \n     that apply to new capital investments, as that term is \n     defined.\n       In the case of each old capital investment, Treasury rate \n     means a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, \n     taking into consideration prevailing market yields, during \n     the month preceding October 1, 1996, on outstanding interest-\n     bearing obligations of the United States with periods to \n     maturity comparable to the period between October 1, 1996, \n     and the repayment date for the old capital investment. Thus, \n     the interest rates and discount rates for old capital \n     investments reflect the Treasury yield curve proximate to \n     October 1, 1996. Likewise, in the case of each new capital \n     investment, the Treasury rate means a rate determined by the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration \n     prevailing market yields during the month preceding the \n     beginning of the fiscal year in which the related facilities \n     are placed in service, on outstanding interest-bearing \n     obligations of the United States with periods to maturity \n     comparable to the period between the beginning of the fiscal \n     year in which the related facilities are placed in service \n     and the repayment date for the new capital investment. Thus, \n     the interest rates for new capital investments reflect the \n     Treasury yield curve proximate to the beginning of the fiscal \n     year in which the facilities the new capital investment \n     concerns are placed in service.\n       The term Treasury rate is not to be confused with other \n     interest rates that Section 3303 directs the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to determine, specifically, the short-term (one-\n     year) interest rates to be used in calculating interest \n     during construction of new capital investments (subsection \n     (f)) and the interest rates for determining the interest that \n     would have been paid in the absence of Section 3303 on old \n     capital investments that are placed in service after the date \n     of enactment of Section 3303 but prior to October 1, 1996 \n     (subsection (b)(3)(B)(ii)). These latter interest rates \n     reflect rate methodologies very similar to those specified by \n     the term Treasury rate, but apply to different features of \n     Section 3303.\n       It is expected that the Secretary of the Treasury will use \n     an interest rate formulation that the Secretary uses to \n     determine rates for federal lending and borrowing programs \n     generally.\n\n\n                  SUBSECTION (b) NEW PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS\n\n       Subsection (b) establishes new principal amounts of the old \n     capital investments, which the Administrator is obligated by \n     law to establish rates to repay. These investments were made \n     by Federal taxpayers primarily through annual appropriations \n     and include investments financed by appropriations to the \n     U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, \n     and to BPA prior to implementation of the Federal Columbia \n     River Transmission System Act. In general, the new principal \n     amount associated with each such investment is determined \n     (regardless of whether the obligation is for the transmission \n     or generation function of the FCRPS) by (a) calculating the \n     present value of the stream of principal and interest \n     payments on the investment that the Administrator would have \n     paid to the U.S. Treasury absent this Section 3303 and (b) \n     adding to the principal of each investment a pro rata portion \n     of $100 million. The new principal amount is established on a \n     one-time-only basis. Although the new principal amounts \n     become effective on October 1, 1996, the actual calculation \n     of the reset principal will not occur until after October \n     1, 1996, because the discount rate will not be determined, \n     and BPA's final audited financial statements will not \n     become available, until later in that fiscal year.\n       As prescribed by the term ``old capital investment,'' the \n     new principal amount is not set for appropriations-financed \n     FCRPS investments the related facilities of which are placed \n     in service in or after fiscal year 1997; for Federal \n     irrigation investments required by law to be recovered by the \n     Administrator from the sale of electric power, transmission \n     or other services; or for investments financed by BPA current \n     revenues or by bonds issued or sold, or authorized to be \n     issued and sold, under section 13 of the Federal Columbia \n     River Transmission System Act.\n       The discount rate used to determine the present value is \n     the Treasury rate for the old capital investment and is \n     identical to the interest rate that applies to the new \n     principal amounts of the old capital investments. Thus, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for determining the \n     interest rate and the discount rate assigned to each old \n     capital investment.\n       The discount period for a principal amount begins on the \n     date that the principal amount associated with an old capital \n     investment is reset (October 1, 1996) and ends, for purposes \n     of making the present value calculation, on the repayment \n     dates provided in this section. The repayment dates for \n     purposes of making the present value calculation are already \n     assigned to almost all of the old capital investments. For \n     old capital investments that will be placed in service after \n     October 1, 1994, but before October 1, 1996, no such dates \n     have been assigned. The Administrator will establish the \n     dates for these latter investments in accordance with U.S. \n     Department of Energy Order RA 6120.2--``Power Marketing \n     Administration Financial Reporting,'' as in effect at the \n     beginning of fiscal year 1995. These ideas are captured in \n     the definition of the term ``old payment amounts.''\n       The interest portion of the old payment amounts is \n     determined on the basis that the principal amount would bear \n     interest annually until repaid at interest rates assigned by \n     the Administrator. For almost all old capital investments, \n     these interest rates were assigned to the capital investments \n     prior to the effective date of Section 3303. (For old capital \n     investments that are placed in service after September 30, \n     1994, the interest rates to be used in determining the old \n     payment amounts will be a rate determined by the Secretary of \n     the Treasury proximate to the beginning of the fiscal year in \n     which the related project or facility, or the separable unit \n     or feature of a project or facility, was placed in service. \n     Subsection (b)(3)(B)(ii) provides the manner in which these \n     interest rates are established.) Thus, for purposes of \n     determining the present value of a given interest payment on \n     a capital investment, the discount period for the payment is \n     between October 1, 1996, and the date the interest payment \n     would have been made.\n       The pro rata allocation of $100,000,000 is based on the \n     ratio that the nominal principal amount of the old capital \n     investment bears to the sum of the nominal principal amounts \n     of all old capital investments. This added amount fulfills a \n     key financial objective of Section 3303 to provide the U.S. \n     Treasury and Federal taxpayers with a $100,000,000 increase \n     in the present value of BPA's principal and interest payments \n     with respect to the old capital investments. Since the \n     $100,000,000 is a nominal amount that bears interest at a \n     rate equal to the discount rate, the present value of the \n     stream of payments is necessarily increased by $100,000,000.\n       Subsection (b)(2) provides that with the approval of the \n     Secretary of the Treasury based solely on consistency with \n     Section 3303, the Administrator shall determine the new \n     principal amounts under subsection (b) and the assignment of \n     interest rates to the new principal amounts under subsection \n     (c). The Administrator will calculate the new principal \n     amount of each old capital investment in accord with \n     subsection (b) on the basis of (i) the outstanding principal \n     amount, the interest rate and the repayment date of the \n     related old capital investment, (ii) the discount rate \n     provided by the Secretary of the Treasury, and (iii) for \n     purposes of calculating the pro rata share of $100 million in \n     each new principal amount under subsection (b)(2)(B), the \n     total principal amount of all old capital investments. The \n     Administrator will provide this data to the Secretary of the \n     Treasury so that the Secretary can approve that the \n     calculation of each new principal amount is consistent with \n     this section and that the assignment of the interest rate to \n     each new principal amount is consistent with subsection (c).\n       The approval by the Secretary of the Treasury will be \n     completed as soon as practicable after the data on the new \n     principal amounts and the interest rates are provided by the \n     Administrator. It is expected that the approval by the \n     Secretary will not require substantial time.\n\n\n        SUBSECTION (c) INTEREST RATES FOR NEW PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS\n\n       Subsection (c) provides that the unpaid balance of the new \n     principal amount of each\n\n[[Page S2185]]\n\n     old capital investment shall bear interest at the Treasury \n     rate for the old capital investment, as determined by the \n     Secretary of the Treasury under subsection (a)(6)(A). The \n     unpaid balance of each new principal amount shall bear \n     interest at that rate until the earlier of the date the \n     principal is repaid or the repayment date for the investment.\n\n\n                     SUBSECTION (d) REPAYMENT DATES\n\n       Subsection (d), in conjunction with the term ``repayment \n     date'' as that term is defined in subsection (a)(5), provides \n     that the end of the repayment period for each new principal \n     amount for an old capital investment shall be no earlier than \n     the repayment date used in making the present value \n     calculations in subsection (b). Under existing law, the \n     Administrator is obligated to establish rates to repay \n     capital investments within a reasonable number of years. \n     Subsection (d) confirms that the Administrator retains this \n     obligation notwithstanding the enactment of Section 3303.\n\n\n                 SUBSECTION (e) PREPAYMENT LIMITATIONS\n\n       Subsection (e) places a cap on the Administrator's \n     authority to prepay the new principal amounts of old capital \n     investments. During the period October 1, 1996 through \n     September 30, 2001, the Administrator may pay the new \n     principal amounts of old capital investments before their \n     respective repayment dates provided that the total of the \n     prepayments during the period does not exceed $100,000,000.\n\n\n   SUBSECTION (f) INTEREST RATES FOR NEW CAPITAL INVESTMENTS DURING \n                              CONSTRUCTION\n\n       Subsection (f) establishes in statute a key element of the \n     repayment practices relating to new capital investments. \n     Subsection (f) provides the interest rates for determining \n     the interest during construction of these facilities. For \n     each fiscal year of construction, the Secretary of the \n     Treasury determines a short-term interest rate upon which \n     that fiscal year's interest during construction is based. The \n     short-term interest rate for a given fiscal year applies to \n     the sum of (a) the cumulative construction expenditures made \n     from the start of construction through the end of the subject \n     fiscal year, and (b) interest during construction that has \n     accrued prior to the end of the subject fiscal year. The \n     short-term rate for the subject fiscal year is set by the \n     Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the \n     prevailing market yields on outstanding obligations of the \n     United States with periods to maturity of approximately one \n     year. These ideas are included in the definition of the term \n     ``one-year rate.''\n       This method of calculating interest during \n     construction equates to common construction financing \n     practice. In this practice, construction is funded by \n     rolling, short-term debt which, upon completion of \n     construction, is finally rolled over into long-term debt \n     that spans the expected useful life of the facility \n     constructed. Accordingly, subsection (f) provides that \n     amounts for interest during construction shall be included \n     in the principal amount of a new capital investment. Thus, \n     the Administrator's obligation with respect to the payment \n     of this interest arises when construction is complete, at \n     which point the interest during construction is included \n     in the principal amount of the capital investment.\n\n\n       SUBSECTION (g) INTEREST RATES FOR NEW CAPITAL INVESTMENTS\n\n       Subsection (g) establishes in statute an important \n     component of BPA's repayment practice, that is, the \n     methodology for determining the interest rates for new \n     capital investments. Heretofore, administrative policies and \n     practice established the interest rates applicable to capital \n     investments as a long-term Treasury interest rate in effect \n     at the time construction commenced on the related facilities. \n     By contrast, subsection (g) provides that the interest rate \n     assigned to capital investments made in a project, facility, \n     or separable unit or feature of a project or facility, \n     provided it is placed in service after September 30, 1996, is \n     a rate that more accurately reflects the repayment period for \n     the capital investment and interest rates at the time the \n     related facility is placed in service. The interest rate \n     applicable to these capital investments is the Treasury rate, \n     as defined in subsection (a)(6)(B). Each of these investments \n     would bear interest at the rate so assigned until the earlier \n     of the date it is repaid or the end of its repayment period.\n\n\n   SUBSECTION (h) CREDITS TO ADMINISTRATOR'S REPAYMENT TO THE UNITED \n                            STATES TREASURY\n\n       Subsection (h) provides that the Administrator shall \n     continue to receive certain credits to annual cash transfers \n     by the Administrator to the U.S. Treasury. The credits are \n     related to annual payments by the Administrator under a \n     settlement of certain claims against the United States by the \n     Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, which claims \n     relate to the construction and operation of the Grand Coulee \n     Dam. The credits, together, with a lump-sum payment by the \n     United States to the Tribes, represent an equitable \n     allocation of the costs of the settlement between BPA \n     ratepayers and federal taxpayers.\n       The credits provided under this subsection (h) shall be \n     applied against interest or other payments to be made by the \n     Administrator to the U.S. Treasury. The payments to the U.S. \n     Treasury available for crediting include, without limitation, \n     interest and principal payments associated with capital \n     investments as reset under this Section 3303, on bonds issued \n     by BPA to the U.S. Treasury, and in connection with FCRPS \n     investment that are placed in service after September 30, \n     1996.\n       Subsection (h) also provides that it will apply \n     ``notwithstanding any other law.'' This clause assures that \n     subsection (h) amends section 6 of the Confederated Tribe of \n     the Colville Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Settlement Act, \n     P.L. 103-436 (the ``Settlement Act''). Subsection (h) amends \n     section 6 of the Settlement Act solely by reshaping over time \n     the credits otherwise available to BPA under the Settlement \n     Act.\n       BPA's obligation to make payments to the Tribes under the \n     Settlement Agreement authorized in the Settlement Act would \n     not in anyway change with the enactment of subsection (h). \n     Likewise, BPA's payments to the Tribes under the Settlement \n     Agreement authorized in the Settlement Act, would in no \n     manner be conditioned on or subject to the availability or \n     application of the credits.\n       The new schedule of credits provided in subsection (h) \n     would also not affect the present value of the ratepayers' or \n     taxpayers' respective shares of the costs of the Settlement \n     Agreement. It does, however, enable the impacts of the \n     refinancing on BPA's rates to be ameliorated in the near \n     term.\n\n\n                   SUBSECTION (i) CONTRACT PROVISIONS\n\n       Subsection (i) is intended to capture in contract the \n     purpose of this legislation to permanently resolve issues \n     relating to the repayment obligations of BPA's customers \n     associated with an old capital investment. With regard to \n     such investments, paragraph (1) of subsection (i) requires \n     that the Administrator offer to include in power and \n     transmission contracts terms that prevent the Administrator \n     from recovering and returning to the U.S. Treasury any return \n     of the capital investments other than the interest payments \n     or principal repayments authorized by Section 3303. Paragraph \n     (1) of subsection (i) also provides assurance to ratepayers \n     that outstanding principal and interest associated with each \n     old capital investment, the principal of which is reset in \n     this legislation, shall be credited in the amount of any \n     payment in satisfaction thereof at the time the payment is \n     tendered. This provision assures that payments of principal \n     and interest will in fact satisfy principal and interest \n     payable on these capital investments.\n       Whereas paragraph (1) of subsection (i) limits the return \n     to the U.S. Treasury of the Federal investments in the \n     designated projects and facilities, together with interest \n     thereon, paragraph (2) of subsection (i) requires the \n     Administrator to offer to include in contracts terms that \n     prevent the Administrator from recovering and returning to \n     the U.S. Treasury any additional return on those old capital \n     investments. Thus, the Administrator may not impose a charge, \n     rent or other fee for such investments, either while they are \n     being repaid or after they have been repaid. Paragraph (2) of \n     subsection (i) also contractually fixes the interest \n     obligation on the new principal obligation at the amount \n     determined pursuant to subsection (c) of Section 3303.\n       Paragraph (3) of subsection (i) is intended to assure BPA \n     ratepayers that the contract provisions described in \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (i) are not indirectly \n     circumvented by requiring BPA ratepayers to bear through BPA \n     rates the cost of a judgment or settlement for breach of the \n     contract provisions. The subsection also confirms that the \n     judgment fund shall be available to pay, and shall be the \n     sole source for payment of, a judgment against or settlement \n     by the Administrator or the United States on a claim for a \n     violation of the contract provisions required by subsection \n     (i). Section 1304 of title 31, United States Code, is a \n     continuing, indefinite appropriation to pay judgments \n     rendered against the United States, provided that payment of \n     the judgment is ``not otherwise provided for.'' Paragraph 3 \n     of subsection (i) of Section 3303 assures both that the \n     Bonneville fund, described in section 838 of title 16, United \n     States Code, shall not be available to pay a judgment or \n     settlement for breach by the United States of the contract \n     provisions required by subsection (i) of Section 3303, and \n     that no appropriation, other than the judgment fund, is \n     available to pay such a judgment.\n       Paragraph (4)(A) of subsection (i) establishes that the \n     contract protections required by subsection (i) of Section \n     3303 do not extend to Bonneville's recovering a tax that is \n     generally applicable to electric utilities, whether the \n     recovery by Bonneville is made through its rates or by other \n     means.\n       Paragraph (4)(B) of subsection (i) makes clear that the \n     contract terms described above are in no way intended to \n     alter the Administrator's current rate design discretion or \n     ratemaking authority to recover other costs or allocate costs \n     and benefits. This Section 3303, including the contract \n     provisions under subsection (i), does not preclude the \n     Administrator from recovering any other costs such as general \n     overhead, operations and maintenance, fish and wildlife, \n     conservation, risk mitigation, modifications, additions, \n     improvements, and replacements to facilities, and other costs \n     properly allocable to a rate or resource.\n\n\n                   SUBSECTION (j) SAVINGS PROVISIONS\n\n       Paragraph (1) of this section assures that the principal \n     and interest payments by the Administrator as established in \n     this Section 3303 shall be paid only from the Administrator's \n     net proceeds.\n       Paragraph (2) confirms that the Administrator may repay all \n     or a portion of the principal associated with a capital \n     investment\n\n[[Page S2186]]\n\n     before the end of its repayment period, except as limited by \n     subsection (e) of Section 3303.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would like to bring one item of concern to \nthe attention of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. \nSpecifically, I am concerned about a provision contained in the House-\npassed version of this bill which would prohibit expenditure of any \nfunds to expand our Embassy in Vietnam or open new facilities beyond \nthose that were in place on July 11, 1995, unless the President makes a \nnumber of certifications relating to the efforts to account for \nsoldiers missing in action from the Vietnam war.\n  Mr. President, this is an unnecessary provision which will do nothing \nto support our Government's active, successful, on-going efforts to \nresolve remaining MIA cases.\n  The Senate has not had the opportunity to speak on this particular \nprovision. The Senate last fall did, however, consider a proposal to \nslow efforts to move forward on relations with Vietnam, and we rejected \nit by an overwhelming margin. That vote certainly indicates that the \nmajority of the Senate supports moving forward in our relationship with \nVietnam.\n  I urge the chairman to recognize that there is strong opposition to \nthis provision in the Senate, and reject it in the House-Senate \nconference.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I am aware of the concerns of the \nSenator from Missouri. I am further aware that those concerns are \nshared by a large number of our colleagues, and I will make an effort \nin conference to maintain the Senate position on this issue.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and I assure him I will \nbe a vocal supporter of that position in conference.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Missouri in \nexpressing opposition to the provision contained in the House bill \nwhich will restrict our ability to move forward in Vietnam. I believe \nboth the Senate and the President have clearly expressed their \nopposition to this provision in the past.\n  The inclusion of this provision in the fiscal year 1996 Commerce-\nState-Justice conference report was cited by the President as one of \nthe reasons for his veto of that legislation. Furthermore the President \nhas indicated that he intends to veto the Foreign Relations \nAuthorization Act in part because of the inclusion of this provision \nthat will limit his ability to further normalize relations with \nVietnam. Specifically, he warns this provision ``could threaten the \nprogress that has been made on POW/MIA issues * * *''\n  I strongly opposed this restriction last fall, and I will oppose it \njust as strongly in this conference.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to address this issue as well. \nThe Senate has voted more than once on the question of how best to \npromote the full accounting of Americans missing in action in Vietnam \nand on the issue of moving forward in our relations with Vietnam. In \neach case, this body has voted to take reciprocal steps toward Vietnam \nas a means of achieving both these objectives. The provision contained \nin the House bill, if included in the conference report, would be \ncontrary to the Senate's clear record and for that reason it should be \nrejected by the conferees.\n  That is not the only reason it should be rejected, however. Working \nwith Vietnam, we have established an unprecedented process for \nresolving outstanding POW/MIA cases. American and Vietnamese teams are \nworking together to conduct field exercises and to pursue other leads. \nEven as we speak, a high-level Presidential delegation is in Hanoi \nconsulting with Vietnamese government officials on the progress of this \neffort. The legislation contained in the House bill could jeopardize \nthis ongoing work and set back the progress we are making.\n  I think we should recognize this provision for what it is--a thinly \nveiled attempt to undermine the administration's decision to normalize \nrelations with Vietnam. The majority of Members in this body was \nindicated they support normalization. We should not allow the House to \nput us on record otherwise.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Committee has \nseen fit to strike the provision of the House-passed omnibus \nappropriations bill which restricts the United States diplomatic \npresence in Vietnam. I would like to join my colleagues in opposition \nto the House provision.\n  The committee first dealt with this issue in response to a House \namendment to the CJS bill which passed without a recorded vote. That \namendment, as my colleagues may remember, prohibited funds for \nexpanding diplomatic relations with Vietnam. When the conference report \nwas approved by the Senate on December 7, 1995, it allowed for funding, \nbut conditioned funding on a Presidential certification involving \nmissing servicemen.\n  The President listed the Vietnam provision as one of his reasons for \nvetoing the CFS bill. In his estimation, the restriction ``unduly \nrestricts his ability to pursue national interests in Vietnam.'' \nNevertheless, the House has decided to revisit the issue. It has \nincluded language in its Omnibus appropriation bill virtually identical \nto the language which solicited to veto on CFS and just 2 days ago the \nthreat of another on the State Department reorganization bill.\n  I couldn't agree with the President more in this regard. He has made \na decision to normalize relations with Vietnam--a decision certainly \nconsistent with this constitutional authority, and he should not be \nconstrained in carrying it out. I commend the Senate committee for \nacting in a manner which will allow United States-Vietnam relations to \nmove forward.\n  I am still hopeful that we can put this issue behind us. The Senate, \nafter all, has demonstrated time and again its lack of support for any \nrestrictions on our relations with Vietnam. It has done so once again \nby striking the House Vietnam language in the bill before us. I \nencourage the Senate conferees to honor the very clear sentiment of the \nSenate and to hold firm.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I thank all senators for their comments. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues on the committee to try to \nresolve this issue in a way that meets their concerns.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/15/senate-section/article/S2182-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2186-S2188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          AN ENERGY DEPARTMENT IN SEARCH OF AN ENERGY MISSION\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, a great many businesses, nonprofit \norganizations, and even Government agencies have created their own \nmission statements.\n  Far from simply being slogans, mission statements can serve as a \nguiding force, setting out specific goals, principles, and objectives.\n  When I was elected to the Senate, I drafted a mission statement for \nmy office which outlines the priorities of the Minnesotans I was sent \nhere to represent, and offers a yardstick we can use to measure how \nwell we are meeting their needs.\n  It works--a mission statement brings the mission into focus.\n  But what happens when a massive Federal agency, entrusted with \nbillions of taxpayer dollars, is forced to operate without a definable \nmission? How can it remain accountable to the taxpayers when its \nmission is constantly shifting and evolving?\n  Without a well-defined mission to contain it, a bureaucracy can grow \nin one of two ways. It can spread as quickly as fire on a lake of \ngasoline, rapidly consuming every inch of available space. Or it might \nexpand slowly, like water dripping into a bucket, gradually growing in \nvolume until it finally spills over its borders.\n  Either way, the results can be disastrous.\n  Metaphors aside, if you need a concrete example that illustrates the \nkind of bureaucracy I'm describing, you need look no further than the \nDepartment of Energy.\n\n[[Page S2187]]\n\n  Mr. President, let me take you back to 1977. Jimmy Carter was \nPresident, and the Nation was still grappling with the energy crisis \nwhich had paralyzed it earlier in the decade. With the OPEC oil embargo \nand the gas lines it created still vivid memories, 1977 was the year in \nwhich Congress took what it thought was a preemptive strike against \nfuture energy emergencies by establishing a Cabinet-level Department of \nEnergy.\n  When he submitted legislation to Congress proposing a national energy \nagency, President Carter said:\n\n       Nowhere is the need for reorganization and consolidation \n     greater than in energy policy. All but two of the Executive \n     Branch's Cabinet departments now have some responsibilities \n     for energy policy--but no agency, anywhere in the Federal \n     Government, has the broad authority needed to deal with our \n     energy problems in a comprehensive way.\n\n  At the same time, however, some were questioning the need for yet \nanother layer of Federal bureaucracy. In May of that year, Nobel Prize-\nwinning economist Milton Friedman likened a national energy agency to a \nTrojan horse. ``[I]t enthrones a bureaucracy that would have a self-\ninterest in expanding in size and power,'' he wrote, ``and would have \nthe means to do so--both directly, through exercising price control and \nother powers, and indirectly, through propagandizing the public and the \nCongress for still broader powers.''\n  Fast forward to 1996. Decades of fiscal mismanagement in Washington \nhave sapped America's Treasury and left a $5 trillion debt on the \nNation's credit card.\n  Middle-class taxpayers have been called on repeatedly to bail out the \nGovernment through ever-higher taxes. Now they are frustrated, and they \nare demanding relief, and they are demanding that the Nation begin \nprioritizing its precious resources by balancing the Federal budget. In \n1996, the Department of Energy is marking its nineteenth anniversary, \nbut at an annual cost to the taxpayers of more than $15 billion, there \nis little to celebrate.\n  DOE has become a black hole for taxpayer dollars, a bureaucracy \nwithout equal, an energy agency without a clear or focused energy \nmission. Milton Friedman was right--the Trojan horse has arrived.\n  The question is, what went wrong? For one thing, the problems DOE was \ncreated to protect us against never materialized. Oil supplies \neventually rose, while oil prices dropped. The need for a national \nenergy agency became less apparent. Still, DOE has continued to grow, \nas bureaucrats seek to justify its existence by branching out into \nareas only marginally related to national energy policy. Our national \nenergy agency has cost the taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars in \nits ongoing quest for an energy mission.\n  The General Accounting Office published a troubling report last \nAugust entitled ``Department of Energy: A Framework for Restructuring \nDOE and Its Missions,'' which noted that DOE has been in transition \nalmost from the time of its creation. In discussing DOE's changing \nmissions and priorities, the GAO reported:\n\n       For its first 3 years, DOE's programs emphasized research \n     and initiatives to cope with a global energy crisis that \n     disrupted U.S. and world markets and economies. By the mid-\n     1980's, accelerating nuclear weapons production and expanding \n     space-based defense research dominated DOE's budget \n     resources.\n\n       Since the late 1980's, DOE's budget has reflected a growing \n     emphasis on solving a half-century's environmental and safety \n     problems caused by the nuclear weapons and research \n     activities of DOE and its predecessors.\n\n  To appreciate how far DOE has strayed from its original energy \nmandate, one must first understand that 85 percent of its budget today \nis spent on activities that have no direct relation to energy \nresources.\n  Let me say that again. Eighty-five percent of the budget of DOE today \nis spent on activities that have no direct relationship to energy \nresources.\n  An examination of where those nonenergy dollars are being directed is \nperhaps the best way to illustrate the enormous gap between the stated \nmissions of DOE, and the results those missions have generated.\n  The bulk of DOE's nonenergy funds goes toward the cleanup of \nradioactive waste from nuclear weapons facilities and for overseeing \nstorage of the Nation's nuclear waste. Unfortunately, the waste \nproblem--which wasn't one of DOE's missions in 1977 but has since \nbecome one of its primary responsibilities--has also become its primary \nfailure.\n  There are 26 nuclear power plants nationwide, including the Prairie \nIsland facility in my home State of Minnesota, which will run out of \nstorage space for their spent nuclear fuel beginning as early as 1998. \nThat's the very year in which DOE is required by law to start accepting \nnuclear waste at an interim storage facility. DOE has known about the \n1998 deadline for 14 years, since passage of the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct. The Senate Energy Committee this week reaffirmed its intention to \nhold DOE to its legal obligation. And yet years of backpedaling, false \nstarts, and feet-dragging by DOE have thrown that deadline in doubt.\n\n  Despite repeated warnings from Congress that the deadline is fast \napproaching, no temporary site has been selected and a permanent \nstorage facility is no more than a pipe dream at this point.\n  Those 26 nuclear plants are left with the distasteful choice of \neither building more temporary storage or closing down and depriving \nmillions of electric customers of cost-effective fuel.\n  Electric utility customers are paying the price for DOE's delay. \nThrough a surcharge on their monthly energy bills, they have already \ncontributed $11 billion of their hard-earned dollars to a nuclear waste \ntrust fund established to finance creation of a permanent storage \nfacility. DOE has raided the trust fund of $5 billion, with little to \nshow for it.\n  I would suggest, Mr. President, that the failure of DOE to move \nforward with this most basic mission--over 14 years, at a cost to the \ntaxpayers of $11 billion--should itself raise serious questions about \nDOE's ability to carry out any of its missions.\n  DOE is also responsible for national energy research, which includes \nthe development of alternative sources of energy such as solar, wind, \nsynthetic fuels, and clean coal.\n  DOE research has cost the American taxpayers more than $70 billion \nsince 1977, but we have little to show for this tremendous investment. \nThat $70 billion has bought plenty of pork, but few meaningful \nscientific breakthroughs.\n  In testimony last year before the House Subcommittee on Energy and \nWater Development, Jerry Taylor of the Cato Institute said,\n\n       Energy R spending has cost the American taxpayer plenty \n     without any real reform. . . . Virtually all economists who \n     have looked at those programs agree that Federal energy R \n     investments have proven to be a spectacular failure.\n\n  Another of DOE's missions has been to promote energy conservation in \nthe aftermath of the OPEC oil embargo.\n  But unlike the days of the oil crisis, when the Federal Government \npredicted that supplies of fossil fuels would be depleted by the year \n2000, U.S. oil reserves are 50 percent higher today than they were in \nthe early 1970's. Coal and natural gas reserves have increased \nsubstantially. Energy prices are actually lower.\n  For most Americans, the energy crunch is just a vague memory--keeping \na multimillion-dollar agency around just in case, at a time when we \nface a $5 trillion public debt, is hardly prudent Government \nmanagement.\n  And what of DOE's mission to ensure affordable power, and access to \nit by consumers? Unfortunately, DOE has been ineffective in carrying \nout both of those functions.\n  The Department's ultimate goal of guiding the Nation toward \nindependence from foreign energy sources has obviously never been \nachieved. Let me explain why.\n  DOE itself projects that crude oil production in the United States--\nwhich is already in decline--will continue to drop over the next \ndecade. By the year 2005, the United States will be 68 percent \ndependent on imported oil, and natural gas imports are expected to \nincrease as well.\n  Mr. President, 68 percent of our energy needs will come from outside \nof the United States. Back during the oil embargo it was only about 33 \npercent. You can see what problems we ran into when there was a squeeze \non the oil from abroad at that time. By the year 2005, more than double \nthat, 68 percent, will come from outside our borders. We\n\n[[Page S2188]]\n\nwill become hostage to the world's energy. That is hardly energy \nindependence. DOE has clearly strayed from its original missions.\n  At a time when Federal spending priorities are being re-examined, and \nagencies which are overgrown, obsolete, duplicative, or irrelevant--\nfour counts on which DOE must plead guilty--are being dragged into the \nlight, the Department of Energy demands scrutiny by Congress.\n  Mr. President, I believe there are three basic reasons DOE has been \nunable to achieve even its most basic missions:\n  First, DOE is too big. It takes 20,000 Federal bureaucrats to manage \nit and another 150,000 contract workers to carry out its far-reaching \nagenda.\n  Second, DOE is too expensive. It has an annual budget of $15.4 \nbillion. Even in the absence of another energy crisis like that which \nled to its creation, DOE's budget has grown 235 percent since 1977.\n  And third, DOE has no real mission. By virtue of its massive size and \nannual cost, it has become inefficient and nearly impossible to manage. \nDue in part to its constant attempts at justifying its own existence, \nDOE has fallen victim to its own sprawling, tangled agenda.\n  DOE's long-documented management problems were highlighted in last \nsummer's report by the GAO. As part of an ongoing management review of \nDOE, the GAO surveyed 37 experts on DOE, including former DOE \nSecretaries, President Carter, and representatives of the private, \nacademic, and public sectors. GAO wanted to know whether DOE was \nmeeting its mission goals, and whether those missions were still \nappropriate functions of the Federal Government in the post-cold war, \nbudget-conscious 1990's.\n  Victor Rezendes of the GAO summed up their findings during a \ncongressional hearing last year:\n\n       DOE suffers from significant management problems, ranging \n     from poor environmental management . . . to major internal \n     inefficiencies. . .. Thus, this agency is ripe for change.\n\n  Although the GAO offered no recommendations as to DOE's future, not \none of the experts surveyed thought that DOE should remain as it is \ntoday. And they raised many questions:\n  Why is the Nation's energy agency maintaining nuclear weapons \nstockpiles and managing the cleanup of weapons production facilities?\n  Why is the Nation's energy agency involved in nonenergy related \nresearch?\n  Why is DOE undertaking such activities as science education and \nindustrial competitiveness?\n  As the GAO concluded in its report:\n\n       It is not clear if the Department and its missions are \n     still needed in their present form or could be implemented \n     more effectively elsewhere in the public or private sectors.\n\n  Unlike the muddled missions offered up by the Department of Energy, \nthe mission of my Senate office is concise and focused, and is \nprecisely summed up in our mission statement. This is how it begins:\n\n       As the Senator and staff of the State of Minnesota, we \n     pledge to lead the fight to reaffirm Congress' oversight \n     responsibilities. By doing so, we will evaluate programs to \n     ensure the wisest use of taxpayer dollars and focus on future \n     streamlining and downsizing of Federal Government.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the mission I was sent here to carry out by \nthe taxpayers of Minnesota--taxpayers who are no longer willing to foot \nthe bill for a bloated and cumbersome agency which is unable to meet \nits obligations and has outlived its usefulness.\n  The Department of Energy needs the immediate attention of Congress. \nIt's time we put this Trojan horse out to pasture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/15/senate-section/article/S2186-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2188-S2189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BALANCED BUDGET DOWNPAYMENT ACT, II\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a moment about the \nbill which is before us, the omnibus appropriations bill, which started \nout $1.8 billion over the spending levels that we considered just a few \nmonths ago in the balanced budget we sent to the President on November \n17 and which he vetoed on December 6.\n  The previous versions of the Commerce, State, Justice, VA-HUD, Labor-\nHHS, and Education bills, all of which are part of the omnibus \nappropriations bill that we are considering now, were all within the \nlimits of the budget at that time needed to get into balance by the \nyear 2002. In other words, all three of those appropriations bills \nsatisfied our requirement to meet each year for the next 7 years the \nobjective of those years, the goal which, at the end of 7 years, would \nhave us achieve a balanced budget.\n  During the consideration of this omnibus appropriations bill, in \naddition to the $1.8 billion that had started out above that level, we \nhave added $2.4 billion as part of an amendment that was primarily for \nthe purpose of more educational spending. That was not paid for by \nlegitimate offsets, in my view, but rather by one-time asset sales \nwhich were already included as offsets in our balanced budget passed on \nNovember 17. In other words, in effect, we are trying to count savings \ntwice.\n  I am on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The provisions of \nthe offset were all developed by our committee as a means of achieving \nsome savings for the next fiscal year or the year after that, depending \nupon when they took effect. They were asset sales, some of which would \nnot realize benefits until 2 years hence.\n  But three of those particular asset sales were used as the offsets \nfor this $2.4 billion increase in expenditure. There are a couple \nthings wrong with it.\n  First, we have already used that money to achieve our balanced \nbudget. So, in effect, it is a double counting.\n  Second, it is a one-time sale of an asset that we will never have \nagain to use. The sales are a good idea, by the way, but these are \nongoing authorizations for activities, educational expenditures, that \nwill occur each year. To pay for them the first year out of an asset \nsale and leave undecided how we are going to pay for them in the \nfuture, in particular when it is in the context of a plan to try to \nbalance the budget over 7 years, is not fiscally responsible.\n  Ongoing expenses, expenses that we know will occur each year, should \nbe paid for out of an ongoing revenue source that we identify can meet \nthose expenses each of those years.\n  If you have a one-time expense, then it makes sense to pay for it \nwith a one-time sale. So, using asset sales to finance these ongoing \njob training and education programs, I think, is not good fiscal \npolicy.\n  So, on one hand, we do not have legitimate offsets. On the other \nhand, we are adding another $2.4 billion on top of the $1.8 billion. In \naddition to that, we are considering right now an amendment that would \nadd another $400 million-plus for a variety of programs, including the \nso-called volunteer AmeriCorps project.\n  AmeriCorps is a program that the GAO says is costing the taxpayer \n$26,654 per volunteer. Let me repeat that, Mr. President. President \nClinton has sold this program to the American people on the basis we \nshould have more volunteers to do worthy projects in our society. I \nwholeheartedly agree with that. We have a lot of volunteers, from grade \nschool kids, high school kids, to people working in the community, \nworking for charities, working for governmental programs, all kinds of \nvolunteer programs.\n  They do this free of charge. But it costs the U.S. taxpayer $26,654 \nper AmeriCorps volunteer, according to the General Accounting Office. \nWe are going to be increasing that program by, I have forgotten the \namount of money, but it is over $100 million. The total cost of the \namendment that is before us currently is over $400 million. We have \nother pending amendments that would also increase the cost of the bill. \nIn addition to that, in addition to all of these things, the bill \nincludes another $4.8 billion in so-called contingency appropriations, \nwhich represents more spending on several of the administration's pet \nprojects.\n  It is true that this additional spending is conditioned on the \nPresident and\n\n[[Page S2189]]\n\nCongress reaching a broader budget agreement, but the fact of the \nmatter is, such an agreement would not represent the tight, fiscally \nresponsible budget requirements that we passed on November 17, but \nrather is beginning to rely, in my opinion, on the same kind of smoke \nand mirrors characterized by previous budget agreements.\n  How many times have we voted--either the House or the Senate--on \nagreements in the past that were going to result in a balanced budget? \nI can remember my colleagues, in 1990, coming to me in support of the \nBush administration agreement that was reached at Andrews Air Force \nBase, saying, ``You have to do this for President Bush.'' And I said, \n``I don't think this is going to result in a balanced budget. I don't \nlike the tax-increase aspect of it.'' ``Oh, yes, it guarantees we're \ngoing to have a balanced budget.''\n  I remember the President's Chief of Staff and his budget officers all \nvisiting with me about that subject--guaranteed to happen. Of course, \nit did not happen. It did not happen on any of the previous occasions, \nand it has not happened on the one subsequent occasion either.\n  The fact of the matter is, we get to a political point in these \nnegotiations where we leave the fiscally responsible way of doing it, \nwhich is what we crafted and what we passed on November 17 and what the \nPresident vetoed on December 6. It becomes so hard to make that stick \nthat we finally begin to compromise, and we reach an agreement which, \nin our heart of hearts, we realize will never really result in a \nbalanced budget. It will make sense for a year or two, but it never \ngets us to the end. In 7 years who cares? That is somebody else's \nproblem.\n  Under the Clinton proposal, which we are largely meeting here, if we \nspend this $4.8 billion-plus, the other billions, it adds up to almost \n$8 billion more. What we are getting is a commitment to make most of \nthe discretionary savings in the last 2 years. And 95 percent of the \ndiscretionary savings in the President's proposal would have to be \nachieved in the last 2 years.\n  Mr. President, you and I both know that is an impossibility. We are \nhaving a hard enough time doing about one-tenth of it in the first \nyear. That is about how much we would be trying to do here in the last \nyears. It is not even one-seventh over 7 years. Even the Republican \nproposal puts more of it in the last 2 years than I think most of us \nwould like.\n  The years 2001 and 2002, the sixth and seventh years, are after Bill \nClinton will have left the Presidency, even if he is reelected to a \nsecond term. It is beyond the time when many of us would still be \nserving in the Congress. ``A problem deferred is a problem solved'' is \nthe slogan of many. It is not the way to ensure a balanced budget.\n  Frankly, I am about to come to the conclusion that if we adopt this \nomnibus appropriations bill, we will be pretending to have achieved a \nbalanced budget in 7 years. The President will pat himself on the back, \nwe will pat ourselves on the back, and in 7 years we will look back on \nthis and say, ``Well, we didn't quite get it done then, did we?'' It \ndid not work out that way.\n  I am simply trying to make the point right now that is the way it \nwill turn out. It may not be the popular thing to say, Mr. President, \nbut I think that is the way it is going to turn out. So I am at this \npoint not inclined to vote for this legislation.\n  The problem is that in making the compromise this first year, having \nthe lack of courage to do what is right even in this first year, we \nwill never have the courage to do what is right in those last couple of \nyears when it will be much more difficult, the choices will be much \nharder to make, because there will be a lot more special interests who \nwill be heard at that time or claim that they are being heard.\n  I believe this bill moves in the wrong direction. I think virtually \nall the amendments that added money move in the wrong direction. My own \nview is we should vote down these amendments that add more money to the \nprogram. The House of Representatives barely passed a bill which is \nmuch more narrow. In conference I do not think we can expect the House \nto accept any of the add-ons that we have done.\n  Yet, the President says he will veto a bill that does not include \nthese add-ons or at least many of them. So it seems to me that we are \nstill at the impasse that we were at shortly after Christmastime, Mr. \nPresident, and that is simply a philosophical difference between the \nPresident who wants to spend about $8 billion more than the Congress \nwants to spend.\n  We moved a long way in his direction during these budget \nnegotiations. But I am not sure we can ever both satisfy him and also \nmeet the requirement of a balanced budget. It may technically meet the \nbalanced budget, but in reality, politically, we know we will never get \nthere. I do not think that is being honest with the American people. \nSo, as it stands right now, I am disinclined to vote for this \nappropriations package, especially if more of these amendments are \nadopted.\n  I guess my own prediction is that either we will have a responsible \nbill, which the President will inevitably veto, or further down the \nroad we will not have a responsible bill in terms of achieving a \nbalanced budget in the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, at this point, I ask unanimous consent to speak for no \nmore than 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the second subject I address today deals with \nthe subject of defense and specifically the threat of missile attack on \nthe United States or our allies or our troops deployed abroad.\n  Today, the Washington Times carried a story reporting on testimony \nthat was given yesterday to the House National Security Committee, the \nequivalent to the Senate Committee on Armed Services. Yesterday, the \nformer CIA Director, James Woolsey, according to this story, told a \nHouse committee that the recent intelligence estimate on the missile \nthreat to the United States was flawed and it should not be used as the \nbasis for defense policy.\n  James Woolsey is an extraordinarily qualified source to speak to \nthis. He served as the CIA Director for 2 years under President \nClinton, and missile defense proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction were one of his primary interests while serving in that \ncapacity.\n  What Mr. Woolsey said, according to this news report, is that the \nconclusions of this recent National Intelligence Estimate, called the \nNIE, that says that no long-range missiles could threaten the 48 \ncontiguous United States for at least 15 years, would be a faulty basis \nupon which to base U.S. policy. He urged that the United States set up \na special team of outside experts to explore just how we should develop \nballistic missiles and defenses to ballistic missiles in response to \nthis threat.\n  He said--and I am quoting from the article:\n\n       I would bet that we would be shocked at what they could \n     show us about available capabilities in ballistic missiles.\n\n  He also is reported to have said that if the President extrapolated a \ngeneral conclusion from the very limited threat assessment of the NIE, \n``I believe that this was a serious error.''\n  That is precisely what happened. Based on this NIE, which a lot of \nexperts have now said appear to have been politically driven--at least \nis not based upon the best intelligence data, or is skewed in its \nconclusion because of the assumptions behind it based on that \ndocument--the administration has drastically revised the spending \npriorities of the Congress and has said simply that it is not going to \nspend money that we have appropriated pursuant to a defense \nauthorization to develop two antiballistic missile systems on the \nschedule that we dictated.\n  We are not talking here even about a national missile system to \nprotect the continental United States, but rather the theater systems \ncalled THAAD and the so-called Navy Upper-Tier Program. In both cases, \nthe administration, through Secretary Perry, has said they are going to \ndelay that spending. I submit that is an unconstitutional action on the \npart of the administration when the Congress has specifically\n\n[[Page S2190]]\n\nauthorized and appropriated the money pursuant to a schedule which \nrequires expenditures to meet certain goals at certain points in time.\n  The administration based that decision on faulty intelligence \nestimates. Why do we say faulty? Not only is CIA Director James Woolsey \nsaying they are faulty, but previous administration spokesmen have \ndisagreed with the assessment. You have to look at it carefully to see \nwhat they are saying. What the assessment may be saying is that no \ncountry is going to begin from scratch and totally indigenously develop \nan intercontinental ballistic missile system that could threaten the 48 \ncontiguous States in less than 15 years. That may be true, but it is \nlargely irrelevant because virtually no state today is attempting to \nindigenously develop a weapon.\n  They are not starting today. Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Syria, China, \nRussia, other countries in the world have used systems developed by \nothers--except for the country of Russia--and have built on those \nsystems by acquiring components from, I am sad to say, Western \ncountries, including the United States. We know Saddam Hussein was \nwithin 18 months of having a nuclear weapon, or close, based on \ncomponents he purchased from Germany, Italy, France, the United States, \nand others. He had the missiles which he had acquired from Russia, so-\ncalled Scuds. He had them modified to carry a payload, a longer range \nthan the original Scud. That is how the countries do it.\n  So if you say no country is starting from scratch today, using a \nstrictly indigenously developed program is going to have an \nintercontinental missile hit the 48 contiguous States may be right, but \nit is irrelevant. You should not change American defense policy based \non that. The 48 contiguous States are not really the relevant factor. \nYou have Alaska and Hawaii, both of which are going to be within range \nof missiles from North Korea in the relatively not-too-distant future.\n  How soon? Well, taking the testimony of Admiral Studeman, the Acting \nDirector of the CIA in between Jim Woolsey and now John Deutch. Last \nApril, he testified that his analysis indicated that the Taepo Dong I \nor Taepo Dong II--the missiles that North Korea is developing--were 3 \nto 5 years away, maybe less. John Deutch himself testified on August \n11, 1994, that the Taepo Dong II may be able to strike U.S. military by \nthe end of the decade. By U.S. territory, we mean including Hawaii or \nAlaska. We are talking now 4 years from now.\n\n  These statements, obviously, were based upon the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity's 1995 missile threat assessment. I leave the point at this: \nOur intelligence community has said that these countries using \ncomponents purchased elsewhere will have missiles that can reach U.S. \nterritory, not necessarily the contiguous 48 States, in the not-too-\ndistant future--3, 4, 5 years--meaning we have to get moving on a \nmissile defense system.\n  None of the administration's actions will achieve that objective. \nThat is why the Congress has said we should get moving with these \nprograms. We focused on the theater threats initially because some of \nthose theater threats could be deployed in such a way as to deal with \nthe threats that are probably most timely, rather than the large \nintercontinental ballistic missile threat against the continental \nUnited States.\n  Navy upper-tier is a program which is deployed using existing \nmissiles and existing radar on Navy Aegis cruisers by deploying the \ncruisers in the appropriate places in the Pacific, and in that vicinity \nof the world, we would be able to help defend against a North Korean \nmissile threat, but not unless we get moving with the program as the \nCongress has directed. That is why the administration's holdup on that \nprogram, based upon a faulty intelligence estimate, is so dangerous, \nboth to the United States, our people, our forces deployed abroad in \nplaces like South Korea and Japan, for example, and also to our allies \nwho might want to depend on our help.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent an article from the Washington \nTimes dated March 15, 1996, be made a part of the Record at the \nconclusion of the remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think the Congress must be much more \nassertive in making certain we have basic policy on correct \nintelligence estimates, that the country proceed with the development \nof an adequate ballistic missile defense program, and that the \nadministration abide by the law passed by the Congress and signed into \nlaw by the President of the United States--that it cannot ignore the \nlaw.\n  Statements based on the U.S. intelligence community's 1995 missile \nthreat assessment concluded:\n  First, the proliferation of ballistic missiles is significant and \ngrowing, both in terms of numbers of missiles and in terms of the \ntechnical capabilities of those missiles;\n  Second, the trends in missile proliferation is toward longer range \nand more sophisticated ballistic missiles;\n  Third, a determined country can acquire an ICBM in the future, and \nwith little warning, by means other than indigenous development; and,\n  Fourth, the North Koreans may deploy an ICBM capable of reaching the \ncontinental United States within 5 years.\n  The new CIA letter was apparently based on the most recent national \nintelligence estimate [NIE] for 1996 which concludes that, while \nseveral countries continue to seek longer range missiles, the North \nKorean ICBM system is now reassessed as having a ``very low'' \nprobability of being operational by the year 2000. In addition, the NIE \nassumes it is extremely unlikely any nation with ICBMs will be willing \nto sell them. Finally, the NIE states that U.S. warning capabilities \nare sufficient to provide notice many years in advance of indigenous \ndevelopment of ICBM's.\n  You might wonder, as I did, what exactly has changed since the 1995 \nassessment? What has changed is, not the facts, but the interpretation \nof the data. Either the intelligence community has adopted a new \nmethodology to determine the extent of a threat, or outside--maybe even \npolitical--influences are at play. In either case, I intend to pursue \nthis matter through the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n  To conclude my first point, I believe that its failure to support a \nviable, sustainable, and sensible ballistic missile defense program \nwill be recorded as one of the major mistakes of the Clinton \nadministration national security strategy. A second major error is the \nfailure to maintain a strong, coherent, nonproliferation policy.\n  I conclude on one other item, Mr. President. Within the last 3 weeks, \nMajority Leader Bob Dole and other Members of this body sent a letter \nto the President complaining about this very matter and indicating to \nhim that if the administration did not proceed with the development of \nthese two missile systems as directed by the Congress and as signed \ninto law, that the Congress would have to take whatever means it could \nto ensure that the law be complied with.\n  There are now mechanisms for forcing compliance with that law under \nconsideration by people in this body. I suspect that we will have to \ntake those actions very soon if the administration does not change its \nposition. I hope that people from the administration will consider this \noffer to try to cooperate so that we do not have to take action that \nthey will find unpalatable.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter to \nthe Secretary of Defense from Majority Leader Bob Dole and other \nMembers of the Senate on this subject.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                              Office of the Republican Leader,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 1996.\n     Hon. William J. Perry,\n     Secretary, Department of Defense, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: We are deeply troubled by your plans to \n     disregard provisions of law related to ballistic missile \n     defense contained in the Fiscal Year 1996 Department of \n     Defense authorization bill. We find this course of action \n     indefensible before the law and the American people.\n       On numerous occasions over the past year, members of the \n     Republican majority have communicated their strong support \n     for ballistic missile defense--most recently in letters sent \n     to you on November 7, 1995 and December 22, 1995. In these \n     letters, we emphasized our deep commitment to providing \n     future funding for these programs identified in\n\n[[Page S2191]]\n\n     sections 216 and 234 of Public Law 104-106, the Fiscal Year \n     1996 defense authorization bill which the President signed \n     into law on February 10, 1996. In particular, we called your \n     attention to the Space and Missile Tracking System, the \n     Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) program, and the \n     Navy Upper Tier program. Therefore, we were dismayed by your \n     February 16 press conference, in which you announced your \n     intention to disregard key provisions of Public Law 104-106 \n     by failing to provide funding sufficient to comply with this \n     law.\n       With each passing day, new facts emerge which highlight the \n     escalating proliferation threat. Your announcement of a \n     decreased ballistic missile defense effort can only serve to \n     strengthen the determination of nations with interests \n     inimical to our own to continue to pursue these weapons of \n     mass destruction and delivery systems which endanger American \n     lives and interests. Conversely, eliminating our \n     vulnerability in this area can only significantly reduce the \n     incentive of rogue nations to pursue nuclear, chemical and \n     biological weapons, as well as ballistic missile delivery \n     systems.\n       The funding level you announced on the 16th of February is \n     insufficient for the THAAD and Navy Upper Tier programs, \n     respectively. We will authorize and appropriate funding in \n     the Fiscal Year 1997 defense bills for these programs--which \n     we believe complement, but cannot replace each other--at the \n     levels necessary to achieve operational capability by the \n     dates now specified in law. While we hope to accommodate as \n     much of your FY '97 budget request as possible, please \n     understand that we will not hesitate to alter the budget \n     request as necessary to bring it into compliance with section \n     234 of Public Law 104-106.\n           Sincerely,\n         John Warner; Richard Shelby; Ted Stevens; Kay Bailey \n           Hutchinson; Jesse Helms; Spencer Abraham; Conrad Burns; \n           Rick Santorum; Bob Smith; Mike DeWine; Paul Coverdell; \n           Connie Mack; Don Nickles.\n         Jon Kyl; Thad Cochran; Jim Inhofe; Larry E.

James Woolsey told Congress \n     yesterday that a recent intelligence estimate on the missile \n     threat to the United States was flawed and should not be used \n     as a basis for defense policies.\n       Appearing before the House National Security Committee, Mr. \n     Woolsey challenged the conclusions of a recent national \n     intelligence estimate (NIE) that said no long-range missiles \n     will threaten the 48 contiguous United States for at least 15 \n     years.\n       Limiting the estimate's focus on the missile threat to the \n     48 states ``can lead to a badly distorted and minimized \n     perception of very serious threats we face from ballistic \n     missiles now and in the very near future--threats to our \n     friends, our allies, our overseas bases and military forces--\n     and some of the 50 states,'' he said.\n       Broad conclusions drawn by policy-makers from the estimate \n     could be ``quite wrong,'' he said, noting that North Korean \n     intermediate-range missiles could threaten Alaska and Hawaii \n     with ``nuclear blackmail'' in ``well under 15 years.''\n       To make policy judgments on missile defense needs from the \n     limited analysis is ``akin to saying that, because we believe \n     that for the next number of years local criminals will not be \n     able to blow up police headquarters in the District of \n     Columbia, there is no serious threat to the safety and \n     security of our police,'' Mr. Woolsey said.\n       The estimate, based on public testimony and statements \n     about it, also is flawed because it underestimates the danger \n     of long-range missiles or technology being acquired \n     internationally by rogue states, or the possibility that \n     friendly states with missiles could turn hostile, he said.\n       A CIA spokesman could not be reached for comment.\n       Mr. Woolsey called for setting up a special team of outside \n     experts to explore how to develop ballistic missiles. ``I \n     would bet that we would be shocked at what they could show us \n     about available capabilities in ballistic missiles,'' he \n     said.\n       Rep. Floyd D. Spence, South Carolina Republican and \n     committee chairman, said that to say the United States is \n     secure from foreign missile threats over the next 15 years is \n     ``dangerously irresponsible'' because of the global turmoil.\n       Mr. Spence has asked the General Accounting Office to \n     investigate whether the 1995 NIE on the missile threat was \n     ``politicized'' to fit Clinton administration opposition to \n     missile defenses.\n       The first statements about the NIE were made public by \n     Senate Democrats during debate on the fiscal 1996 defense \n     authorization bill, which President Clinton vetoed in \n     December because he opposed its provisions requiring \n     deployment of a national missile defense.\n       Mr. Clinton said at the time of the veto that U.S. \n     intelligence did not foresee a missile threat to the United \n     States within the next decade.\n       Mr. Woolsey said that, if the president extrapolated a \n     general conclusion from the very limited threat assessed by \n     the NIE, ``I believe that this was a serious error.''\n       In separate testimony, Richard Perle, assistant defense \n     secretary during the Reagan administration, criticized the \n     Clinton administration's effort to expand the Anti-Ballistic \n     Missile (ABM) Treaty to cover short-range anti-missile \n     defenses.\n       ``To diminish our capacity to deal with these threats in \n     the mistaken belief that it is more important to preserve the \n     ABM treaty unchanged is utter nonsense,'' Mr. Perle said. \n     ``Those who urge this course are hopelessly mired in the tar \n     pits of the Cold War.''\n  Mr. KYL.

A bill to amend the provisions of title 17, United States \nCode, to provide for an exemption of copyright infringement for the \nperformance of nondramatic musical works in small commercial \nestablishments, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                 THE MUSIC LICENSING REFORM ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Music Licensing \nReform Act of 1996: First, to clarify the ``home-style'' exemption \nprovided by the Copyright Act for the public performance of nondramatic \nmusical works; second, to regularize the commercial relations between \nthe performing rights societies, which license such public \nperformances, and their licensees, who are the proprietors of eating, \ndrinking, and retail establishments, and third, to improve in general \nthe oversight of the licensing practices of the two largest performing \nrights societies, the American Society of Composers, Authors, and \nPublishers [ASCAP] and Broadcast Music, Inc. [BMI].\n  Music licensing has been a matter of discussion for many years. There \nare strongly held views among all of those involved. I am committed to \ntrying to resolve this matter, and this bill is a good-faith effort to \ndo so. It is my hope that it can serve as a basis for further \ndiscussion.\n  Commercial establishments, such as restaurants, bars, and retail \nstores, make money off of the public performance of musical works, \nwhether it be from live performances, from sound recordings, or from \nradio and television. Commercial establishments play music or turn on \nradio and TV in order to make the eating, drinking, or shopping \nexperience more pleasant. The ubiquity of these kinds of entertainment \nitself proves that businesses believe that it increases patronage.\n  Recognizing that commercial establishments make money off of the \ncreative output of songwriters, the Copyright Act of 1976 provided \nsongwriters with the exclusive right of public performance, so that \ncreators might share in the added value that their product creates. In \ndoing so, the Copyright Act carries out the philosophy of the copyright \nclause of the Constitution, which sees economic reward as an important \nincentive to artistic creation.\n  Mr. President, the Constitution was right. In 1993, the core \ncopyright industries contributed approximately $238.6 billion to the \nU.S. economy, or 3.74 percent of the total GDP. These same core \ncopyright industries contribute more to the U.S. economy and employ \nmore people than any single manufacturing sector, and the growth rate \nof these industries continues to outpace the growth of the economy as a \nwhole by a 2-to-1 ratio.\n  With domestic sales topping $10 billion each year and annual foreign \nsales totaling over $12 billion, the music industry by itself accounts \nfor a huge percentage of the American economy, and its popularity \nabroad provides a healthy component of the U.S. balance of trade. It is \nreally not an exaggeration to say that American music dominates the \nglobe. In fact, it is estimated that U.S. recorded music accounts for \nsome 60 percent of the world market. Indeed, the United States is \nsecond to none in musical creativity. The prosperity of the music \nindustry and the creative output of American composers and songwriters \nmust be encouraged.\n  At the same time, Mr. President, the Copyright Act recognizes that \nobtaining and paying for a license to play music should not be overly \nburdensome. Some of the burden of obtaining such a license is lessened \nby the performing rights societies, such as ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC. It \nwould be intolerable for a restaurant, bar or store to monitor all the \nmusic that it performs and then search out the individual songwriter, \ncomposer, or publisher who owns the copyright in the music. Instead, a \nproprietor can go to the performing rights societies and purchase a \nblanket license and not worry about what music it plays, since ASCAP, \nBMI, and SESAC account for virtually all of the music that is normally \nplayed in the United States.\n\n\n             exemption for small commercial establishments\n\n  The average cost to restaurants and retail establishments of a \nblanket license from ASCAP for all public performances, whether by \nradio and TV or live, is $575 per year. BMI charges on the average less \nthan $300 per year for eating and drinking establishments for public \nperformance by radio and TV, and its retail establishment license for \nthese performances ranges from $60 to $480 per year. These are not \nlarge sums of money, but they still could be burdensome for some small \ncommercial establishments. So the Copyright Act also provides for an \nexemption, freeing some proprietors from any obligation to compensate \nsongwriters for the use of their music. This exemption is found in \nsection 110(5) of the Copyright Act and it effectively applies to \nestablishments that turn on radio and TV for their customers' \nenjoyment. It is known as the ``homestyle'' exemption, because it \nexempts ``the public reception of the transmission on a single \nreceiving apparatus of a kind commonly used in private homes.'' \nCongress felt--and rightly so--that small commercial establishments \nthat turned on ordinary radio and TV sets would have a de minimis \nimpact on the incentive to create that music licensing fees encourage.\n  Unfortunately, a certain ambiguity was introduced into the exemption \nby the language of the House and conference reports of the Copyright \nAct of 1976, and this ambiguity has been exacerbated by the courts. \nAlthough the language of 110(5) only mentions sophistication of \nequipment, the courts\n\n[[Page S2193]]\n\nhave also considered such factors as the size of the establishment, and \nability to pay for a license.\n  Mr. President, the time has come to clarify the exemption regarding \nnondramatic musical works so that proprietors and performing rights \nsocieties can determine more precisely whether an establishment is \nexempt or not without having to engage in costly litigation.\n  My bill does this by exempting ``small commercial establishment[s].'' \nThis change simply recognizes the existing state of the law. In effect, \nthe courts have looked at a host of relevant factors in order to decide \nwhether an establishment should have the benefit of the exemption. This \nnew bill directs the Register of Copyrights to define ``small \ncommercial establishment'' by regulation, and provides guidance by \nlisting the factors that the courts have considered, as well as other \nfactors that are relevant to the determination.\n  The register is not confined to these factors, however. In our \nrapidly changing technological environment, the expertise of the \nCopyright Office should not be hampered. The sound and video equipment \nthat are common today may be obsolete in the not too distant future. \nThe Copyright Office, unlike Congress, will be able to respond to these \nchanges in the years ahead more quickly, with greater expertise, and \nwith far less cost by engaging in other rule-making proceedings. If \nCongress legislates specific equipment and area requirements, as some \nhave suggested, it will have to revisit this issue time and time again.\n  Changing the language of 110(5) from ``homestyle'' equipment to the \nmore general ``small commercial establishment'' may result in slightly \nexpanding the exemption. The Copyright Office, therefore, must take \ncare that it does not unduly upset the balance between the creative \nincentive on the one hand and concern for the burden on small \nbusinesses on the other.\n  Furthermore, the Copyright Office must bear in mind our international \nobligations, especially the Berne Convention. We cannot very well \ninsist that our musical works be protected outside the United States if \nwe cut too deeply into the protection that musical works enjoy within \nour borders.\n  Both the Register of Copyrights and the Commissioner of Patents and \nTrademarks have written to me that another bill dealing with the \nexemption, S. 1137, introduced by Senators Thomas and Brown, would \nviolate the U.S. obligations under the Berne Convention. The bill that \nI am introducing today prevents this from happening by specifically \nprohibiting the Copyright Office from expanding the scope of the \nexemption beyond that permitted under the international treaty \nobligations of the United States.\n\n\n    commercial relations between proprietors and performing rights \n                               societies\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation addresses two areas of concern in the \ncommercial relations between the proprietors of eating, drinking, and \nretail establishments who must acquire a license publicly to perform \nmusical works and the performing rights societies who grant such \nlicenses as agents for composers, songwriters, and publishers.\n  First, in response to complaints from proprietors that the performing \nrights societies do not readily disclose information about their \nlicensing fees and in response to complaints from the performing rights \nsocieties that proprietors do not readily disclose factual information \nabout their establishments that is essential in charging them the \nappropriate fee, this bill directs the Register of Copyrights to \npromulgate regulations to establish a code of conduct, applicable to \nboth sides, to govern their licensing negotiations and practices.\n  The Copyright Office is in a much better position than Congress is to \nstudy the business practices that prevail in order to identify \nimprovements that would make these practices fairer and more efficient. \nThe Copyright Office is also in a better position to modify these \nregulations as times change.\n  Second, my legislation directs the Copyright Office to promulgate \nregulations to ensure that a performing rights society provides \nreasonable access to its repertoire of songs and other musical \ncompositions. The principle behind this part of the bill is easy to \nunderstand: If a person is going to be asked to pay a performing rights \nsociety in order to perform a work publicly, the payor should be able \neasily to verify whether the work is included in the society's \nrepertoire. A buyer, after all, doesn't want to pay for goods that the \nseller has no right to sell.\n  Complications arise, however, in determining what is reasonable \naccess. Both ASCAP and BMI, for example, have already made their \nrepertoires available on line. Is this sufficient to meet the needs of \ntheir licensees or is some more conventional means also called for? \nSince the copyright owners of musical compositions can cancel their \nagency contracts with the performing rights societies, how up-to-date \nmust the repertoire be? What happens when a song has two authors, each \nof which is represented by a different society?\n\n  Finally, what information needs to be supplied? Since almost all \nlicenses are blanket licenses, giving the licensee the right to play \nall music in a society's repertoire, how important is detailed \ninformation on individual compositions? (Indeed, most persons engaged \nin the business of publicly performing copyrighted music routinely buy \nblanket licenses from ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC, thereby assuring that \nvirtually all copyrighted music is covered.) It would be unwise to \nburden the performing rights societies with expensive obligations to \nprovide information that is really not necessary.\n  Clearly, Mr. President, this problem needs the investigative tools \nand fine-tuning that Congress is ill-equipped to provide. That is why \nthe Register of Copyrights needs to examine the problem and provide \nclear and up-to-date regulations, after input from the relevant \nparties.\n\n\n     general oversight of the licensing practices of ascap and bmi\n\n  As I have already pointed out, Mr. President, a blanket license \npurchased from ASCAP and BMI will give the licensee the right publicly \nto perform virtually all the most popular music in the United States. \nFor proprietors of eating, drinking, and retail establishments who play \nradio and TV for their customers, this is the easiest and most cost-\neffective way to go. This logic also applies to radio and TV \nbroadcasters, who publicly perform countless musical works during their \nprogram days.\n  There are, however, other businesses for whom the blanket license is \nnot as attractive. Religious broadcasters, for example, may play music \nfor a few, select programs, while the rest of their programming is \ndevoted to talk. For these and other broadcasters similarly situated, a \nper program license seems more attractive.\n  Now, a per program license is available from ASCAP and BMI; in fact, \nthe antitrust consent decree under which ASCAP and BMI operate requires \nthat they offer a per program license. The religious broadcasters, \nhowever, are dissatisfied with the price of the license, which, in some \ninstances, costs more than a blanket license. ASCAP argues, however, \nthat the administrative costs of the per program license are higher \nbecause it has to monitor the broadcasters to make sure that its music \nis used only for licensed programs.\n  The religious broadcasters would have Congress determine a pricing \nformula for the per program license and put it in the Copyright Act, as \ncurrently provided in S. 1137. But arriving at a formula requires a \nstudy of the pricing mechanisms and an inquiry into all the factors \nthat go into them. Again, this is something that Congress is ill-\nequipped to do. Moreover, it would simply spark demands by other music \nlicensees to do the same for them.\n  Fortunately, a forum for dealing with this issue already exists in \nthe Rate Court of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nNew York. The Rate Court was set up pursuant to an antitrust consent \ndecree that both ASCAP and BMI are party to, stemming from law suits \nagainst these performing rights societies that were brought many years \nago.\n  Indeed, the religious broadcasters are currently arguing the per \nprogram license pricing issue before the Rate Court in a suit brought \nagainst ASCAP. A decision is expected this year. A previous case \ninvolving ASCAP and the TV broadcasters over the same issue resulted in \na decision favorable to the broadcasters. The religious broadcasters, \ntherefore, have a reasonable\n\n[[Page S2194]]\n\nexpectation that their complaint will be decided in their favor and in \nthe near future.\n  Mr. President, I question the wisdom of having Congress establish a \npricing formula for per program licenses for radio broadcasters.\n  What Congress should be doing is looking at the overall structure and \nefficient functioning of the consent decree to make sure that it is \nworking and that it is accessible to those, such as the religious \nbroadcasters, who do not have the resources to engage in expensive, \nprotracted litigation. This is precisely what the bill that I am \nintroducing today proposes to do. It directs the Copyright Office to \nstudy the administration of the consent decree so that adjudication \nunder the consent decree may be less time-consuming and more cost-\neffective, especially for parties with fewer resources. It may very \nwell be, for example, that a system of local or regional arbitration \nmay be more efficient and not too burdensome for the performing rights \nsocieties. The Judiciary Committee will consider very seriously the \nfindings and recommendations of the Copyright Office.\n  Although I disagree with S. 1137, I want to thank my distinguished \ncolleague from Colorado, Senator Hank Brown, for his indefatigable \nattention to music licensing issues. Senator Brown spent several hours \ntrying to work out a compromise that would be acceptable to the \nproprietors and religious broadcasters on the one hand and to the \nperforming rights societies and the hundreds of composers and \nsongwriters that they represent on the other. I also want to thank my \ndistinguished colleague from South Carolina, Senator Strom Thurmond, \nwho brought the concerns of the religious broadcasters to my attention.\n  I urge them and all others interested in this issue to support the \ncompromise legislation that I have introduced today, the Music \nLicensing Reform Act of 1996.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1619\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 \nto provide for the construction, operation, and maintenance of dredged \nmaterial disposal facilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n             THE ENVIRONMENTAL DREDGE DISPOSAL ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator Boxer in \nintroducing the Environmental Dredge Disposal Act of 1996, a bill to \nestablish a fair cost-sharing formula for the disposal of dredged \nmaterial.\n  Mr. President, under existing law, the Federal Government helps \nassume the cost of the disposal or dumping at sea of dredged material \nassociated with operation and maintenance of Federal channels. However, \nthe Federal Government does not provide similar assistance for other \nmethods of disposal, even when these other methods are more beneficial \nfor the environment. This inconsistency makes no sense, and threatens \nthe economic viability of large and small ports throughout the country.\n  My bill proposes to eliminate this inconsistency, and would ensure \nthat the Federal cost-sharing formula related to disposal of dredged \nmaterial applies regardless of where the dredged material is disposed. \nMore technically, the bill amends the Water Resources Development Act \nof 1986 to make upland, aquatic, and confined aquatic dredged material \ndisposal facilities associated with the construction, operation, and \nmaintenance of a Federal navigation project for a harbor or inland \nharbor a general navigation feature of a project for the purpose of \ncost sharing. The bill includes safeguards to ensure that no single \nport receives a competitive advantage as a result of this bill.\n  Mr. President, in 1824, Congress assigned responsibility for \nimproving navigation in the still-young Nation's waterways to the \nFederal Government. Federal maintenance of a channel system has always \nbeen important for interstate and foreign commerce, and for national \nsecurity. That remains true today. Approximately 95 percent of the \nNation's import-export cargo travels on ships through American ports.\n  Mr. President, dredging the channels of our Nation's ports, \nparticularly the major load centers, or hubs, is not a discretionary \nitem. It is essential. Similarly, it is essential that dredged \nmaterials be disposed of.\n  Unfortunately, many ports are experiencing serious problems with \nrespect to disposal. These problems have plagued Federal channels and \nFederal facilities, such as military marine terminals, as well as local \nand private terminals. Ports that face immediate and near-term disposal \nproblems include Boston, New Jersey-New York, Baltimore, Houston, and \nOakland. Many more ports will face disposal problems in the next \ncentury.\n  Some ports, including New York Harbor, lack adequate disposal \nfacilities, which has created great difficulty in obtaining Corps of \nEngineers and State dredging permits. The disposal capacity of many \nother ports is nearly full. This problem is likely to affect many more \nports in the years ahead.\n  For many ports with inadequate disposal facilities, disposing dredged \nmaterials in the ocean is not a viable option, because of sediments \nthat do not meet ocean disposal standards. Other methods of disposal \nwill have to be pursued. Yet the costs associated with these \nalternatives often are high. Given the national interests at stake, the \nFederal Government needs to share in the costs of all viable \nalternatives.\n  Unfortunately, current law prevents such cost sharing in the case of \nfacilities located on land. There is no real justification for this \nlimitation. And without some modification of this law, many ports may \nwell face a serious disposal crisis in the near future.\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to comment on the environmental \nimplications of this matter. Many ports are located in estuaries and \ncoastal areas that represent significant natural resources. I recognize \nthat some might believe that the protection and enhancement of those \nresources is inconsistent with the operation of a busy port. However, \nthat is not true. In the New York metropolitan region and the bay area \nof northern California, for example, both ports and natural resources \ncoexist, and provide important economic benefits. In my view, Federal \npolicy should seek to promote both port commerce and environmental \nresources. This bill would help, by making possible the construction of \nconfined disposal facilities that would support development in an \nenvironmentally constructive manner.\n  Mr. President, if commerce is to progress in this Nation, if import-\nexport trade is to increase, if our Nation is to benefit from \ninternational trade agreements, our infrastructure must be prepared to \nmake the transportation of goods efficient and cost effective. As \nTransportation Secretary Federico Pena has acknowledged, the port \ndredging problem is a national transportation problem. Secretary Pena \norganized the Interagency Working Group on the Dredging Process to \ndetermine how to improve Federal performance in several areas, \nincluding interagency coordination, the regulatory process, and \ndisposal issues. The final report to the Secretary said:\n\n       Over the past two decades, a number of factors have \n     complicated the development, operation and maintenance of the \n     nation's harbors, particularly in the area of dredged \n     material management. These factors include increases in the \n     demands of commerce, rapid evolution of shipping practices . \n     . ., increasing environmental awareness and mounting \n     environmental problems affecting coastal areas and ocean \n     waters, heavy population shifts to coastal areas and a \n     general increase in non-Federal responsibilities in the \n     development and management of navigation projects. As a \n     result, dredged material management has often become a \n     contentious problem at all stages of harbor development and \n     operation. . . .

John Chafee,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Bud Shuster,\n     Chairman, House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, \n         Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Gentlemen: Our nation's deep-draft commercial \n     navigation system is essential to U.S. trade, economic \n     development and national security objectives. It is critical \n     that Congress enact a Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) \n     in 1996 to ensure the continued capital investment in our \n     ports and waterways which is essential to the safe and \n     efficient movement of cargo in international and domestic \n     trade.\n       Over 95% of U.S. international trade moves through U.S. \n     ports, and trade volumes are expected to triple by the year \n     2010. Shippers increasingly rely on larger vessels and just \n     in time delivery of goods while, at the same time, there is \n     public concern for the safe transit of these vessels. U.S. \n     navigation channels must be improved and maintained to meet \n     these demands.\n       More than 90 percent of our ports require regular \n     maintenance dredging. These ports are diverse--they include \n     our largest container ports, as well as other ports that \n     principally handle such products as petroleum, steel, \n     automobiles and fruit. Because many U.S. export commodities--\n     grain, coal, and forest products, to name a few--face tough \n     competition around the world, even marginal transportation \n     cost increases affect their marketability and consequently, \n     the nation's balance of trade. It is clear that dredging, \n     whether to maintain existing depths or to deepen channels to \n     meet the demand of the next generation of ocean carriers, is \n     as essential to our nation's commerce as maintaining and \n     improving our highways and railroads.\n       However, for the first time since the passage of the Water \n     Resources Development Act of 1986, Congress failed to enact a \n     biennial water resource bill in 1994, and did not live up to \n     its commitment to the federal/port partnership. If a \n     navigation project is economically justified and supported \n     financially by the local project sponsor throughout the \n     arduous planning process, the sponsor must be able to rely \n     on dependable water resource authorization legislation and \n     annual appropriations levels.\n       In addition to project authorization, one important \n     provision that should be included in any WRDA bill would \n     clarify that the cost of dredged material disposal facilities \n     should be cost-shared at the same rate as other navigation \n     project elements. The Senate Environment and Public Works \n     Committee has already approved a WRDA bill, S. 640. The \n     Committee Report on S. 640 noted that: ``With respect to the \n     construction of dredged material disposal facilities, it is \n     apparent that cost-sharing inconsistencies do exist. Federal \n     and non-Federal cost-sharing responsibilities for dredged \n     material disposal vary from project to project, region to \n     region, and port to port depending on when the project was \n     authorized. In addition, current cost-sharing policies favor \n     open water disposal * * * [T]he Committee urges the \n     Administration to report possible solutions to the Congress \n     for consideration.''\n       The Report of the Federal Interagency Working Group on the \n     Dredging Process also recommended this clarification of \n     federal cost sharing for disposal in order to level the \n     playing field in selection of disposal alternatives and to \n     facilitate the implementation of important navigation \n     projects and appropriate disposal options. As the federal \n     government mandates more restrictive environmental regulation \n     of dredged material disposal, it is appropriate that the \n     federal government, where it does not do so already, share \n     the costs to assure compliance with those environmental \n     mandates and to provide for sufficient and safe disposal \n     capacity.\n       The undersigned organizations urge you to make water \n     infrastructure a top priority for your Committees this year. \n     Congress must enact a Water Resources Development Act in 1996 \n     and continue the vital investment in our national water \n     resources and navigation infrastructure.

Today I am joining with Senator Frank R. Lautenberg in \nintroducing legislation that will not only bring balance in the \neconomic burden sharing between our Nation's ports and the Federal \nGovernment but also will provide real improvements to our marine \nenvironments. Or, as one local editorial headline called it: ``Turning \nmush to marsh.''\n  I am talking about providing real economic incentives to make upland \ndisposal of dredged material feasible for our ports. In many cases, \nthis disposal can be used to restore wetlands, particularly for the San \nFrancisco Bay Delta system.\n  The San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary is the largest and most \nsignificant estuary along the entire west coast of the Americas. \nEstuaries are one of the most productive types of ecosystems in the \nworld. At the same time, they are one of the most degraded by human \nactivities. Habitat losses, huge fresh water diversions, and \npollution--more than 60 percent of the entire runoff from the entire \nState of California drains into the estuary--have significantly altered \nthe ecosystem. Bay filling has vastly depleted this habitat resource.\n  The bay area is also the center of a $5.4 billion-a-year economic \nengine providing 100,000 jobs relating to its role as a center of \ninternational maritime commerce.\n  Concern over environmental degradation resulted in ``mudlock'' \nbetween our ports and the environmental community. Sensing the need to \nestablish rational, affordable, and environmentally responsible \ndredging policies, in 1990 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the San Francisco Bay Regional Water \nQuality Control Board, the Bay Conservation and Development Commission \njoined with navigation and fishing interests, the environmental \ncommunity, and the public at-large to establish a comprehensive long-\nterm management strategy for bay area dredged material.\n  One of their successes was the establishment of the Sonoma baylands \ndemonstration project, a congressional authorized dredged disposal site \ncost-shared between the Federal Government and local agencies. This \nformer tidal wetlands was drained for agricultural use during the last \ncentury. The 325-acre site has helped restore needed wetlands in the \nregion and reverse their decline. In addition, it provides habitat for \ntwo endangered species--the California clapper rail and the salt marsh \nharvest mouse.\n  But that was a one-time congressional demonstration project. We need \nto correct the underlying law that leaves local agencies with the full \ncost burden of establishing an upland site for disposal of dredge \nspoil.\n  Every year an average of 6 million cubic yards of sediments must be \ndredged from shipping channels and related navigation facilities \nthroughout the bay area, which is the home of the ports of Oakland, \nRichmond, San Francisco, and Redwood City. The San Francisco Bay \nConservation and Development Commission has concluded that in-bay \ndisposal sites cannot accommodate future dredging and disposal needs.\n  The bay area's maritime industry is expected to need to dispose of \nabout 300 million cubic yards of sediment over the next 50 years. Due \nto the growth of Pacific rim countries, export cargo moving through the \nwest coast ports has doubled in the last 2 years. The entire \nmaintenance dredging and channel deepening program provides the \ncritical link for Pacific rim and world trade which contributes \ndirectly to our regional, State, and national economies.\n  In 1994, the Federal Government permitted an ocean disposal site \nnearly 60 miles off shore and included costly ocean floor monitoring \nprocedures. Annual disposal capacity is limited at this site. Even if \nseemingly a viable option, in some instances weather and wave \nconditions impede access of the barges to this offshore site and \nincreases the cost. Dredge material, some of which could be used to \nrestore wetlands, is lost.\n  The creation of vital wetlands through the beneficial use of dredged \nmaterial has proven to be highly popular in California.\n  Several bay area sites, both publicly and privately owned, studied in \nthe course of the long term management strategy show clear development \npotential for both beneficial use and confined disposal. However, the \nprocess by which the Federal Government and local agencies share the \ncosts and other responsibilities of dredging and disposal projects \ncreates many barriers to completion, because it does not reflect real \nenvironmental and economic realities.\n  The Federal Government does not participate at all in upland \ndisposal, while ocean disposal is cost shared by the Federal and State \nor local agencies. This inconsistency is prejudicial to those ports \nwhich have run out of aquatic disposal options and are forced to use \nupland disposal without any Federal financial assistance.\n  The availability of dredged disposal capacity is a growing concern in \nmany areas of the country. We need consistent Federal-local sponsor \ncost sharing across all dredged material disposal methods. Uplands \ndisposal that promotes environmental restoration should be given \npriority consideration.\n  That is why this bill is important. It would make the provision of \nupland, aquatic and confined aquatic, dredge material disposal \nfacilities associated with the construction, operation, and maintenance \nof Federal navigation projects as a general navigation feature for the \npurpose of cost sharing.\n  A consistent Federal policy that provides for cost-sharing upland \ndisposal facilities is a ``win-win'' for the environment and the \neconomy of California. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation \nand demonstrate that we can save the environment and boost our local, \nregional, and national economies at the same time.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1622. A bill to amend the independent counsel statute to permit \nappointees of an independent counsel to receive travel reimbursements \nfor successive 6-month periods after 1 year of service; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n       amendments to the independent counsel reauthorization act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce an amendment to the \nIndependent Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1994. My legislation would \nprovide travel expense reimbursements to appointees of the Office of \nIndependent Counsel for successive 6-month periods after 1 year of \nservice.\n  This legislation is necessary because the Independent Counsel \nReauthorization Act precludes attorneys and other staff fired by an \nindependent counsel from receiving reimbursements for travel expenses \nthey incur after they have worked for an independent counsel \ninvestigation for 18 months. Currently, the act authorizes only one 6-\nmonth extension for travel reimbursement purposes after 1 year of \nservice.\n  As a result, employees of the Independent Counsel may be forced to \nresign as they approach their 18-month anniversaries in order to avoid \nincurring the additional expense of living away from home for an \nextended period of time. These employees must then be replaced with new \npersonnel having less knowledge and experience, thereby causing harm \nand delay to the Independent Counsel's investigation.\n  The reimbursement limitation will begin to have full effect in the \nnext 2 months, which is a critical time for the Independent Counsel's \ninvestigation. As the decision of the eighth circuit on March 15, 1996, \nreinstating the indictments against Gov. Jim Guy Tucker makes clear, \nthe Independent Counsel's work has been effective in bringing to light \npublic corruption at the highest levels. The trial of United States \nversus McDougal started on March 4, 1996. Seven employees, including \nfour attorneys, will have reached their 18-month anniversaries by the \nend of the trial.\n  Mr. President, Congress included the 18 month limitation to control \nspending and fiscal irresponsibility. But we did not anticipate an \ninvestigation such as this one, in which many individuals have been \ntemporarily relocated to a remote office. The Independent Counsel's \nability to complete the investigation in a timely manner may be \nseriously hindered, and costs may actually increase, if we do not pass \nthis legislation.\n  My legislation will remedy this problem by permitting Independent \nCounsel\n\n[[Page S2198]]\n\nemployees to receive travel reimbursements for successive 6-month \nperiods after their first year of service, provided that such payment \nis certified at the beginning of each 6-month period as being in the \npublic interest to carry out the purposes of the 1994 act. While some \nof us may have reservations about the constitutionality of an \nIndependent Counsel or the current matters being investigated, we \nshould all agree that if we are going to have an Independent Counsel, \nit must be given the necessary resources to do a thorough, complete \njob.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 1623. A bill to establish a National Tourism Board and a National \nTourism Organization, and for other purposes.\n\n\n              THE TRAVEL AND TOURISM PROMOTION ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, many of us do not focus on the \nimpact that the travel and tourism industry has on our economy. Tourism \nmeans jobs in all of our States and tax revenue for our Federal, State, \nand local treasuries.\n  Whether it be our hotels, airlines, restaurants, campgrounds, \namusement parks, or historically significant sights, tourism works for \nAmerica.\n  The U.S. travel and tourism industry is the second leading provider \nof jobs in this Nation and the third largest retail industry giving the \nUnited States a $21.6 billion trade surplus.\n  Just last year, visitors from abroad brought approximately $80 \nbillion to our economy which is one-fifth of the total $400 billion \nprovided to the economy by the travel and tourism industry. It should \nbe an economic powerhouse.\n  However, our lead is slipping. For the past several years the U.S. \nshare of the international travel market has declined. Last year, 2 \nmillion fewer foreign visitors came to the United States, representing \na 19-percent decline. This translated into 177,000 fewer travel-related \njobs.\n  Mr. President, we must reverse this decline. We need to attract more \ninternational tourists and enhance the travel experience for both \ndomestic and international travelers. The United States must remain the \ndestination of choice for world travelers.\n  I am therefore introducing legislation today to create a public-\nprivate partnership between the travel and tourism industry and the \nFederal Government to aggressively market the promotion of \ninternational travel to the United States.\n  With the elimination of the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration, \nthe United States will become the only major developed nation without a \nFederal tourism office. We need a national strategy to maintain and \nincrease our share of the global travel market. Other nations pour \nmoney into marketing attempting to lure tourists to their shores, and \nthey are doing it at our expense. This legislation will provide the \ntools with which the United States can compete with any nation.\n  We can counter these foreign promotion dollars with a combination of \ntechnical assistance from the Federal Government and financial \nassistance from the private sector. This legislation will create a true \npublic-private partnership between the travel and tourism industry and \nthe public sector to effectively promote international travel to the \nUnited States. It supplants the big-government, top-down bureaucracy \nwhich was eliminated with the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration.\n\n  The bill establishes a Federal charter for a National Tourism Board \nand a National Tourism Organization, which will act as a not-for-profit \ncorporation. Members of the National Tourism Board will be appointed by \nthe President with the input of the travel and tourism industry to \nadvise the President and Congress on policies to improve the \ncompetitiveness of the U.S. travel and tourism industry in the global \nmarketplace.\n  The National Tourism Organization will be charged with implementing \nthe tourism promotion strategy proposed by the National Tourism Board. \nThe president of the National Tourism Organization will also serve as a \nmember of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee, which is the \nagency that develops our U.S. export trade promotion and financing \nprograms, thereby further promoting the economic importance of the \ntravel and tourism industry.\n  A primary task of the National Tourism Organization will be the \nestablishment of a travel-tourism data bank to collect international \nmarket data for dissemination to the travel and tourism industry and to \npromote tourism to the United States at international trade shows.\n  No later than 1 year upon enactment of this legislation, the officers \nof the organization will meet to make recommendations for the long-term \nfinancing of the organization. However, no Federal funding is \nassociated with this legislation. This is an industry-funded and \nindustry-directed initiative.\n  Travel industry leaders from around the Nation enthusiastically \nendorsed the plan embodied in this bill when it was introduced at the \njust-completed White House conference on travel and tourism.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) a vibrant and growing small business sector is critical \n     to creating jobs in a dynamic economy;\n       (2) small businesses bear a disproportionate share of \n     regulatory costs and burdens;\n       (3) fundamental changes that are needed in the regulatory \n     and enforcement culture of federal agencies to make agencies \n     more responsive to small business can be made without \n     compromising the statutory missions of the agencies;\n       (4) three of the top recommendations of the White House \n     Conference on Small Business involve reforms to the way \n     government regulations are developed and enforced, and \n     reductions in government paperwork requirements;\n       (5) the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act have \n     too often been ignored by government agencies, resulting in \n     greater regulatory burdens on small entities than \n     necessitated by statute; and\n       (6) small entities should be given the opportunity to seek \n     judicial review of agency actions required by the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this act are--\n       (1) to implement certain recommendations of the 1995 White \n     House Conference on Small Business regarding the development \n     and enforcement of Federal regulations;\n       (2) to provide for judicial review of the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act;\n       (3) to encourage the effective participation of small \n     businesses in the Federal regulatory process;\n       (4) to simplify the language of Federal regulations \n     affecting small businesses;\n       (5) to develop more accessible sources of information on \n     regulatory and reporting requirements for small businesses;\n       (6) to create a more cooperative regulatory environment \n     among agencies and small businesses that is less punitive and \n     more solution-oriented; and\n       (7) to make Federal regulators more accountable for their \n     enforcement actions by providing small entities with a \n     meaningful opportunity for redress of excessive enforcement \n     activities.\n\n     SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall become effective on the date 90 days after \n     enactment, except that the amendments made by title four of \n     this Act shall not apply to interpretive rules for which a \n     notice of proposed rulemaking was published prior to the date \n     of enactment.\n\n             TITLE I--REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SIMPLIFICATION\n\n     SEC. 101.

COMPLIANCE GUIDES.\n\n       (a) Compliance Guide.--For each rule or group of related \n     rules for which an agency is required to prepare a final \n     regulatory flexibility analysis under section 604 of title 5, \n     United States Code, the agency shall publish one or more \n     guides to assist small entities in complying with the rule, \n     and shall designate such publications as ``small entity \n     compliance guides.'' The guides shall explain the actions a \n     small entity is required to take to comply with a rule or \n     group of rules. The agency shall, in its sole discretion, \n     taking into account the subject matter of the rule and the \n     language of relevant statutes, ensure that the guide is \n     written using sufficiently plain language likely to be \n     understood by affected small entities. Agencies may prepare \n     separate guides covering groups or classes of similarly \n     affected small entities, and may cooperate with association \n     of small entities to develop and distribute such guides.\n       (b) Comprehensive Source of Information.--Agencies shall \n     cooperate to make available to small entities through \n     comprehensive sources if information, the small entity \n     compliance guides and all other available information on \n     statutory and regulatory requirement affecting small \n     entities.\n       (c) Limitation on Judicial review.--Any agency's small \n     entity compliance guide shall not be subject to judicial \n     review, except that in any civil or administrative action \n     against a small entity for a violation occurring after the \n     effective date of this section, the content of small entity \n     compliance guide may be considered as evidence of the \n     reasonableness or appropriateness of any proposed fines, \n     penalties or damages.\n\n     SEC. 103.

In any \n     civil or administrative action against a small entity, \n     guidance given by an agency applying the law to facts \n     provided by the small entity may be considered as evidence of \n     the reasonableness or appropriateness of any proposed fines, \n     penalties or damages sought against such small entity.\n       (b) Program.--Each agency regulating the activities of \n     small entities shall establish a program for responding to \n     such inquiries no later than 1 year after enactment of this \n     section, utilizing existing functions and personnel of the \n     agency to the extent practicable.\n\n     SEC. 104.

Where regulations vary among the states, separate \n     guides may be created for separate states in cooperation with \n     state agencies.\n\n                TITLE II--REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT REFORMS\n\n     SEC. 201.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ncivic leader, decorated veteran, adventurer, and extraordinary \nKentuckian. George P. Whittington, who passed away January 27, was all \nof these things, and more.\n  Mr. Whittington, born October 5, 1913, served his country in both \nWorld War II and the Korean war. A graduate of the New Mexico Military \nInstitute, Whittington was awarded the Silver Star, Bronze Star, and \nPurple Heart for service in both the Army and the Marine Corps. During \nthe D-day invasion on June 6, 1944, Whittington commanded Company B of \nthe Fifth Ranger Battalion which landed on Omaha Beach. According to an \naccount of the attack, Whittington led a detachment that punched \nthrough obstacles on the beach, scaled a 100-foot cliff and then \ncrawled under machinegun fire to destroy an enemy position. For his \nleadership, Mr. Whittington was awarded the Distinguished Service \nCross.\n  After the war, Whittington earned a bachelor's degree in journalism \nfrom the University of Missouri. He then returned to active duty to \nserve as a major and battalion commander in the Army during the Korean \nwar. After military service, Whittington returned to Kentucky where he \nserved for more than 25 years on the Henderson City-County Air Board \nand was a member of the Henderson Community College Foundation board. \nDuring the 1970's and 1980's Whittington owned a 1,000-acre cattle \nranch in Costa Rica. He also hunted big game in Africa and was an avid \nprivate pilot.\n  Walt Dear, president of the Gleaner-Journal Publishing Co., said \nWhittington ``was an absolute original. George Whittington was the kind \nof guy you meet once in a lifetime. He was definitely interesting--a \ngreat conversationalist and a great reader.''\n  Survivors include his wife of 40 years, Agnes; two daughters, Janet \nand Elizabeth Whittington; two sons, Charles and Richard Whittington; \nand two grandsons. I would ask that my colleagues join me in honoring \nthis heroic and extraordinary Kentuckian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/15/senate-section/article/S2206-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2206-S2207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CENTENNIAL OF THE JEWISH WAR VETERANS OF THE U.S.A.\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today, March 15, 1996, marks the \n100th anniversary of the founding of the oldest veterans organization \nin this country--the Jewish War Veterans of the U.S.A. Most people \nthink that the American Legion is the oldest veterans group but, in \nfact, it is not.\n  On March 15, 1896, 63 Jewish Civil War veterans gathered in New York \nCity to form the Hebrew Union Veterans as a response to allegations \nthat Jews in 19th century America were not\n\n[[Page S2207]]\n\ninclined ``to stand by the flag as soldiers.'' From this group of 63 \nhas developed the current organization of over 100,000 members.\n  The Jewish War Veterans of the U.S.A. is proud of the history of its \nindividual members in all of America's wars and conflicts. It is also \nproud of its own history as an organization. All of us share in that \npride for it is well-earned. JWV led the effort to end the pogroms \nagainst Eastern European Jews at the beginning of this century. They \nled the national boycott of German goods in the 1930's. And they have \nsupported the state of Israel since its birth in 1948. Moreover, the \nJWV actively supported the civil rights movement of the 1960's and was \nthe only veterans group to support the 1963 march on Washington. It \nalso was the first group to call for the withdrawal of United States \nmilitary forces from Vietnam in 1971.\n  The JWV's 100-year history has kept it in the forefront of groups \nwhich support America's military personnel and our veterans.

Mr. President, on February 8, the President \nsigned into law the Telecommunications Act of 1996. This act has been \nmy highest legislative priority for the 104th Congress. I am very \npleased with the great strides we are making in deregulating and \nfostering competition in this critical field. But our work is not over. \nI ask to have printed in the Record the article I wrote for Roll Call \ndetailing what lies ahead for telecommunications reform.\n  The article follows:\n\n                    [From Roll Call, Mar. 11, 1996]\n\n              Telecom Reform: It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over\n\n                      (By Senator Larry Pressler)\n\n       Historic. Massive. Landmark. Sweeping. Adjectives such as \n     these were often used by journalists and lobbyists alike to \n     describe the recently passed Telecommunications Act of 1996. \n     So often, in fact, I think that some began to wonder if we \n     had placed them in the bill's formal title.\n       The truth is such adjectives got a lot of ink because they \n     captured the scope and direction of the bill. As well they \n     should. Congress had been so long about the business of \n     updating the nation's antiquated communications laws that, \n     when we were finally able to get a bill moving, it had no \n     choice but to be ``historic, massive, and sweeping'' if we \n     were to have any chance of keeping up with the pace of \n     technological development.\n       Passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was my \n     highest legislative priority in the first session of the \n     104th Congress. On Feb. 8, that priority became law.\n       Thanks to my bill, the communications industry will see an \n     explosion in new investment and development. Who are the \n     winners? The consumers. There will be more services and new \n     products at lower costs. All of this economic activity will \n     mean new jobs.\n       Competition is the key for this development. My bill \n     unlocked the regulatory handcuffs restricting the \n     communications industry--now, competition will bring \n     everything from lower costs and new products to better \n     education opportunities to the public.\n       But we are not done. Passage of the act does not mean \n     Congress can now wait another 62 years before looking at \n     telecommunications issues again.\n       On the contrary, we must regard telecommunications reform \n     as a work in progress. Although our legislative calendar may \n     be somewhat attenuated this election year, the list of \n     telecommunications priorities facing the second session of \n     the 104th Congress is as impressive as it is imperative.\n       Among the priorities for the Commerce Committee this year \n     are ensuring that the Federal Communications Commission \n     carries out Congress's intent when it sets the rules to \n     implement the Telecommunications Act; determining federal use \n     and allocation of the full spectrum; and re-examining the \n     rule barring foreign investment in US telecommunications \n     firms.\n\n\n                    Telecommunications Act Oversight\n\n       First and foremost, Congress needs to make sure that what \n     the American consumer won on the legislative battlefield \n     isn't lost on the regulatory drawing board. In other words, \n     we need to make sure that the FCC carries out the intent of \n     Congress as it implements the tenets of the \n     Telecommunications Act.\n       This is no small task. Nor is it frivolous. There were many \n     hard-fought battles by various segments of the industry \n     during the drafting of the Telecommunications Act. Now that \n     the scene shifts from the legislative to the regulatory \n     venue, the temptation to refight lost battles beckons many an \n     interest group.\n       Congress must be vigilant and hold fast against the \n     possibility of regulatory revisionism as the FCC proceeds \n     with its rule-making processes.\n       The battle flags already are flying. For instance, the FCC, \n     in initiating a rule-making intended to accelerate the \n     ability of Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) to offer \n     long-distance service outside their monopoly operating areas, \n     is proposing to require the RBOCs to set up separate \n     subsidiaries to provide such services.\n       As I pointed out in a recent letter to FCC Chairman Reed \n     Hundt, this is totally contrary to provisions in the \n     Telecommunications Act that specifically exempt the RBOCs \n     from having to provide out-of-region, long-distance services \n     under a separate subsidiary.\n       In another potential regulatory overreach, the FCC is \n     considering requiring broadcasters to increase the amount of \n     air time dedicated to public interest programming, as well as \n     possibly requiring more children's programming. Such \n     government-mandated content control would be enforced through \n     the station license renewal process.\n       The issue here is not whether more children's and public \n     interest programming is desirable, but whether these goals \n     should be mandated by the FCC as part of the broadcast \n     license renewal process.\n       In fact, Congress was quite clear about its intentions in \n     the license renewal provisions of the Telecommunications Act. \n     The act requires license simplification, not license \n     complication. The FCC's direction in carrying out this \n     provision seems to be headed in the direction of re-\n     regulation instead of deregulation. It is the latter approach \n     Congress clearly intended.\n       As to the issue of program content, I think the best public \n     policy is to keep the government's involvement to a minimum \n     and let the industry and the public determine the content of \n     programming. I support providing parents with the necessary \n     technological weapons, such as the ``V-chip,'' to help them \n     control what their children see on television. Of course, the \n     ultimate ``V-chip'' already exists on every television set in \n     America--the on/off switch.\n       Currently, a plethora of flexible, quickly evolving, and \n     market-driven parental blocking technologies are available. \n     Some are already incorporated into many televisions and \n     VCR's. Other are sold as separate add-on devices. We must be \n     mindful that government does not dry up the market for such \n     devices by mandating one technology over all others.\n\n\n                               fcc reform\n\n       Another major focus for the committee this year will be to \n     examine the overall performance and needs of the FCC as it \n     carries out its duties. We will look closely at the agency's \n     repeated requests for additional money to implement the \n     Telecommunications Act.\n       As I have told Chairman Hundt, I am concerned about the \n     FCC's alarms over possible budget shortfalls and calls for \n     more personnel and other resources to carry out its mission.\n       The FCC has requested a budget of approximately $224 \n     million for fiscal 1996, supporting some 2,300 employees. \n     This is roughly two-thirds more than the FCC's budget in 1993 \n     ($134 million) and includes an additional 600 employees over \n     the 1993 staffing level (1,700).\n       In fact, since 1992, FCC expenditures have risen at a \n     compounded average annual rate of 15.2 percent, compared with \n     an average of 10.4 percent for the communications industry \n     itself.\n       Should the growth of a federal agency outstrip the very \n     industry it regulates by a margin of three to two? No. \n     Particularly in an era of federal budget austerity in which \n     the watchwords for most other federal agencies are ``smaller \n     but smarter'' government.\n       Clearly, Congress will have to look closely at the FCC \n     during this second session and see what efficiencies can be \n     realized in its operations.\n\n\n                 overview of federal spectrum policies\n\n       Another major task facing Congress this year is a thorough \n     examination of federal policies regarding the use and \n     allocation of the electromagnetic spectrum. The \n     electromagnetic spectrum, generally defined as the range of \n     electromagnetic frequencies between three kilohertz and 300 \n     gigahertz, is one of the nation's most valuable resources.\n       I believe the federal government has a responsibility to \n     ensure that the efficient management of this resource \n     provides adequately for the national defense, the protection \n     of the taxpayer, and the continued maintenance of America's \n     technological leadership.\n       The full committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n     is planning to hold hearings on this complex subject, \n     beginning in March.\n       During these hearings, we will examine the government's \n     management and allocation of the entire spectrum, not just \n     that small portion of it used for radio and television \n     broadcasting. This includes supporting: civilian emergency \n     services; scientific and satellite uses; merchant marine \n     emergency and navigation uses; aviation uses; truck and \n     railroad uses; cellular phone and personal communications \n     services; military and intelligence uses; and specialized \n     data-transmission uses, such as telemedicine services.\n       Much of the focus of this spectrum review naturally will \n     gravitate toward the issue of\n\n[[Page S2208]]\n\n     digital television and how portions of the finite spectrum \n     should be allocated to broadcasters for the development of \n     digital transmission.\n       I have long been a supporter of protecting the taxpayers in \n     allocations of the spectrum by the FCC. In fact, I proposed \n     an auction earlier in the year as part of the budget \n     reconciliation process.\n       While I believe the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was \n     clear in that it did not mandate any giveaway of the digital \n     spectrum, it is important that Congress revisit this issue \n     this year and establish a clear national policy on spectrum \n     assignments to the private sector.\n\n\n                              other issues\n\n       There are a number of other telecommunications issues that \n     will occupy the committee's attention this year, including a \n     look at whether current rules restricting foreign investment \n     in US broadcasting are good for the nation.\n       It may well be that we should allow more foreign investment \n     in US broadcasting, provided US broadcasters have the same \n     investment rights overseas. This could open more foreign \n     markets to US telecommunications products and services. The \n     committee may hold hearings this year on this issue.\n       The committee also will consider reforming the \n     Communications Satellite Act of 1962. When that act was \n     passed, no one thought private companies would launch and \n     operate satellites. Today, we have private companies \n     competing with the international government-owned satellite \n     systems, INTELSAT and INMARSAT. We need to re-evaluate how \n     competition should operate in the international satellite \n     market.\n       The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was a major legislative \n     step forward in modernizing America's ancient \n     telecommunications laws. But we cannot rest on our \n     legislative laurels if Congress is to provide a regulatory \n     infrastructure that helps, rather than hinders, America's \n     telecommunications industry. Our work has just begun.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/15/senate-section/article/S2207-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO THE CREW OF SPECIAL AIR MISSION 3311 TO HAITI IN SEPTEMBER \n                                  1994\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \noutstanding service of the crew of Special Air Mission 3311, which \ntransported former President Jimmy Carter, retired U.S. Army Gen. Colin \nPowell, and myself to and from Haiti in September 1994. This mission \nwas a last chance attempt to achieve a peaceful return to power of \nHaiti's democratically elected government. Although the successful \noutcome of the United States negotiating effort is well known, I want \nto reflect for a moment on the bravery and high level of \nprofessionalism exhibited by the air crew that gave our mission of \npeace the opportunity it needed to succeed.\n  Recently, I had the opportunity to speak with one of the members of \nthis aircrew and I recalled the extraordinarily difficult conditions \nunder which the aircrew members were forced to operate. On the evening \nof September 16, 1994, this aircrew was given less than 8 hours to \nprepare for a 6 a.m. departure for the following day in which neither \nthe destination, nor the passengers of the flight, were known. Only 3 \nhours before the flight's scheduled departure did the aircrew learn of \nits orders to transport General Powell from Andrews Air Force Base to \nRobins Air Force Base in Georgia, where they would pick up former \nPresident Carter and myself, and continue its flight to Port-au-Prince, \nHaiti. Intelligence sources at that time indicated that the runway at \nthe Port-au-Prince airport was unusable. There were large amounts of \ndebris littering the runway, including nails and 8-foot-high metal \ncontainers. Only minutes prior to the landing, as much debris as \npossible was moved to the sides of the runway. Miraculously, and with \nno margin for error, the crew was able to land the aircraft with only \n20 feet of wing-tip clearance. However, the crew's ordeal did not end \nat that point in the mission.\n  On September 18, the aircraft returned for our mission's departure \nfrom Haiti. Delays in our negotiations resulted in the crew having to \nwait for more than ten hours in the plane for the return of our \ndelegation. The crew members endured heat in excess of 120 degrees \nwhile maintaining the aircraft's readiness for an instant departure \nwith minimal support facilities. The crew had to function under the \nadditional stress of knowing that the negotiations were not proceeding \nvery well. When our negotiating team arrived at the aircraft for \ndeparture, the crew had no knowledge concerning the final outcome of \nour discussions or the current status of a United States invasion force \nthat was enroute from Pope Air Force Base to Haiti. Only after a \nsuccessful takeoff under these tense conditions did the crew learn that \nthe negotiations had concluded successfully.\n  Mr. President, the courage, dedication, and professionalism of the \naircrew of Special Air Mission 3311 to Haiti represent the finest \nqualities of the men and women serving in our Nation's Armed Forces. \nFor their dedication, each member of the aircrew was awarded the Air \nMedal. In addition, this extraordinary unit received the 21st Air Force \nAircrew Excellence Award for the third quarter 1994 and was nominated \nfor the Lt. Gen. William H. Tunner Award for Outstanding Air Mobility \nCommand Aircrew. They made a major contribution to our mission to \nHaiti. Today, I want to pay tribute to the excellent job that they \nperformed and I ask that a list of the names of those outstanding \nindividuals who served in Special Air Mission 3311 be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The list follows:\n\n                  The Crew of Special Air Mission 3311\n\n       Major Loail M.

DON SUNDQUIST ON HIS 60TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in this increasingly hectic world, \nwe often don't take the time to recognize the people who make such a \ndifference in our communities and in our lives. But today, on the \noccasion of Tennessee Governor Don Sundquist's 60th birthday, I would \nlike to pause and recognize his lifelong service to the people of the \ngreat State of Tennessee.\n  Fifteen years ago, he announced that he was running against Bob \nClement for the Seventh District Congressional seat. Though many people \nsaid it was a waste of his time to run against one of the biggest \npolitical families in Tennessee, he was determined and his message was \nstrong. When election day rolled around, he had defied the odds and had \nwon. For more than 10 years he kept his word with his constituents in \nCongress, and consistently fought against tax increases and fought to \nreduce the size and scope of the Federal Government.\n  In 1994, he brought that message and the commitment to the entire \nState. That election year, he and I crossed paths many, many times. As \ntwo Republican candidates seeking statewide offices in the biggest year \nso far for Republicans in Tennessee, we were constantly running into \neach other on the campaign trail as we discussed our visions for \nTennessee. During these\n\n[[Page S2210]]\n\ntimes, I was always impressed with his graciousness and composure under \nfire. His vision led him to the Governor's office, and mine led me to \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  Since that historic day when he was elected Governor, he has \ncontinued to practice what he preached for so many years--getting \ngovernment out of the people's business and putting people back into \nthe business of government. Public input is vital to him in drafting \nhis major legislative proposals, and it shows when he invites members \nof the private sector to review his legislative initiatives and \nsolicits their advice on how bills will impact Tennessee communities, \nbusinesses, and citizens. He also consults with citizens, business \nleaders, and State employees to find ways for State government to save \nmoney and abolish waste. The bottom line is that he welcomes innovation \nand he's not afraid to lead.\n  I want to join with the Governor's family and friends today in \nwishing him a happy birthday and let him know that his efforts and his \ncommitment to the people of Tennessee have not gone unrecognized. \nGovernor Sundquist, I wish you the very best, and I thank you for your \ndedication and service to our great State. Happy birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/15/senate-section/article/S2209-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO THE SOUTHEAST OUTLOOK\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nmembers of Southeast Christian Church on the success of their first \nnewspaper, the Southeast Outlook. The Outlook was created because the \nchurch's newsletter could no longer communicate sufficiently to the \n10,000 members of Southeast Christian.\n  The first issue of the paper was published September 1, 1995, and \naverages about 20 to 28 pages a week. The Outlook lets people who are \npart of the congregation get to know each other--which is not easy in a \nchurch that is, as an elder of the church put it, ``larger than most \ntowns in Kentucky.'' The paper focuses on church events, ministries, \nand members of the congregation, as well as issues of State, local, and \nnational interest.\n  The Outlook has profiled everyone from its elders to the chief \ncustodian to a church member who turned to God after a suicide attempt. \nChurch members can also keep informed about the congregation's wall-to-\nwall activities. Publisher and editor Ninie O'Hara has said, ``Now that \nwe have a product, our phone rings off the hook. We have 10,000 people \nat Southeast, and they're all out in the world doing things.''\n  O'Hara has been a newspaper publisher and editor in Kentucky since \n1979. Steve Lowery, who hired O'Hara for her first job in journalism, \nsaid of her, ``She is in my opinion the best writer that we had at our \ncompany and one of the best writers in the State of Kentucky.'' O'Hara \nturned down a better paying job from the Lexington Herald-Leader to \ntake the job at Southeast last summer.\n  O'Hara said of the Outlook:\n\n       [The paper] lets the outside world look into Southeast \n     Christian Church and see hey, these people . . . have the \n     same pressures and stresses as us. But they're dealing with \n     it differently because of the presence of God. If they like \n     what they see . . . maybe they'll come and join us.\n  Mr. President, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in paying \ntribute to the congregation of Southeast Christian Church and \ncongratulating them on the success of their newspaper.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/15/senate-section/article/S2210-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHANGE OF REFERRAL--S. 1412\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of House Joint Resolution 78, \njust received from the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 78) to grant the consent of \n     the Congress to certain additional powers conferred upon the \n     Bi-State Development Agency by the States of Missouri and \n     Illinois.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the joint resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, the joint resolution before us \ntoday confers additional authority upon the Bi-State Development \nAgency, a compact created by the States of Illinois and Missouri. The \nBi-State Agency operates a mass transit system in the St. Louis \nmetropolitan area, which includes Belleville and other areas of \nsouthwestern Illinois.\n  In 1950, Congress approved a joint request from the State of Illinois \nand Missouri to create this Bi-State authority to operate an interstate \nbus system. The Bi-State Development Agency has expanded, and now \noperates a successful light rail system, known as the MetroLink.\n  The original compact, however, that was approved by Congress in 1950, \ndid not empower the Bi-State Development Agency to appoint or employ a \nsecurity force, or to enact rules and regulations governing fare \nevasion and other misconduct on the light rail system. As a result, \nMetroLink passengers currently pay fares through a barrier-free, self-\nservice, proof-of-payment system. this system, while successful, needs \nan enforcement policy and mechanism to ensure compliance.\n  The States of Illinois and Missouri have acted to confer such \nauthority upon the Bi-State Development Agency. As you know, Mr. \nPresident, the Constitution requires that we then approve this request, \nand that is exactly the purpose of the joint resolution before us \ntoday. The House of Representatives approved this joint resolution \nyesterday without objection.\n  Because these two States have asked us, and because local, State, and \nFederal officials from these States support this joint resolution, I \nwould urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of its passage.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the joint \nresolution be deemed read the third time, passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe joint resolution appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 78) was deemed read the third time \nand passed.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/15/senate-section/article/S2210-4", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  WHITEWATER DEVELOPMENT CORP.
