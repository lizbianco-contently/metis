Mr. President, this morning leader time has been reserved. \nThere will be a period for morning business until the hour of 10 a.m.\n  Following morning business, it will be our intention to go to the \nlegislative branch appropriations bill. I hope we can get permission or \nclearance to do that. There will be rollcall votes, I understand, on \nthat. It is also my hope that we can bring up the military construction \nappropriations bill. That would need the consent of our colleagues.\n  We need to do six appropriations bills before the August recess--\nwhenever that starts. This will be very helpful. We will at least \ncomplete action on two of those this week. We still have the matter of \nthe rescissions package, which I am not going to worry about anymore, \nfor the next few days. I had it up to my eyeballs with the rescissions \npackage.\n  Then we have also S. 343. There could be a vote on cloture today on \nregulatory reform. It seems to me we have just about reached--we have \nbeen negotiating, I think, in good faith.\n  We have had people on both sides. I think we are prepared to make \nsome additional changes if that will be helpful. But I do not see much \nmovement on the other side, as far as votes are concerned. It seems to \nme that that vote could come today. I will be visiting with the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, and will make a \njudgment, whether that be today, tomorrow, or next week.\n  I did indicate to the President that I was inclined to accede to his \nrequest for Bosnia, but I want to talk to some of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle who are cosponsors. I certainly want to cooperate \nwith the President where possible. I have indicated to the Democratic \nleader if we could work out some agreement on a vote on that early next \nweek, that we certainly would try to accommodate the President's \nrequest.\n  Beyond that, depending on what happens today, we could be on the Ryan \nWhite measure tomorrow. On Monday, we will be considering gift and \nlobbying reform. On Tuesday, we hope to go to foreign ops and the State \nDepartment authorization bill. That will probably take at least 2 or 3 \ndays.\n  I advise my colleagues, as far as we know at this point, there will \nbe votes throughout today. There will be votes tomorrow. If there \nshould be any change, I will certainly come to the floor and make the \nannouncements so my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will have \nnotice.\n  I reserve the balance of my leader's time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10329-4", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft).

Mr. President, I will manage the minority leader's \ntime. Mr. President, I want to respond to the majority leader in a very \npositive, and by no means personal, way.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I thank the majority leader. He is quite \nright. There have been negotiations that have gone on for some time. I \nbelieve that we would be ready very soon to go forward on the \nrescissions package.\n  There were several issues. The majority leader has now been working \nwith us. We have agreed to have debate on a number of amendments--one \ndealing with the low-income energy assistance, \n\n[[Page S10330]]\nand the second one, which I really want to talk about and hope that \nthere will be some change and restore some of the funding for this \nprogram. The other has to do with the job training and education \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, the only disagreement--and I believe it will be worked \nout--has to do with a counseling program which, I say to my colleague \nfrom Missouri, I would like to talk about for a long time. I will not, \nbecause other colleagues want to speak, and I will get a chance to \nspeak later.\n  This is an interesting program, Mr. President. The ratio, Members \nwill like this, of paid staff to beneficiaries is 1 to 2,000. It is not \ntopped down. It is out in the States. This is a program that is \nextremely important. It is what we are all about. It is basically a few \npaid staff that in turn nurture a lot of volunteers that in turn \nprovide seniors with just basic information about their health care \ncoverage. People sometimes find that bewildering, and sometimes there \nis unfortunately some ripoff when it comes to supplementary Medicare \ncoverage. It is extremely successful.\n  The majority leader said last night, and he is quite correct, that he \nhas now been working with us and actually is helping me to restore the \nfunding to this program. It does not require a lot of resources. We are \ntalking about restoring $5 million. It was a $10 million program. By \nthe way, Mr. President, sometimes these numbers seem small to Members \nbut this program makes a huge and positive impact in the lives of a \ngood many very vulnerable citizens.\n  The only confusion and disagreement was that I was waiting for the \nreprogramming of this. I thank the White House for their help. I \ncertainly would like to thank the minority leader. What I wanted to be \ncareful about, and this just simply had not been worked out yet, is \nthat the reprogramming was not a ``rob Peter to pay Paul.'' I did not \nwant to take this money from another program that was extremely \nhelpful, for example, to seniors.\n  So, Mr. President, the only delay, and I think it is a very slight \ndelay, and I see no reason why we cannot go forward, is to make sure we \nhave a reprogramming done. I also wanted to make sure that my \ncolleagues had some understanding on appropriations. I mean, both the \nmajority chair of the committee, Senator Hatfield, and the minority \nchair, Senator Byrd, I wanted to make sure that they were fully \napprised of where we were going on the reprogramming. That just did not \nhappen last night. That is the one missing piece. It all goes together. \nThere would not be a need for a third amendment if we work that out. I \nthink we will.\n  Mr. President, I will just say what I have said all along, which is--\nI am speaking for myself; I think Senator Moseley-Braun would say the \nsame thing--we really believed that it was important that the bill not \njust go through here without some debate and discussion. We wanted an \nopportunity to have some amendments. We have agreed to a limited time. \nWe are ready to go forward, and I think we can.\n  Again, I say to the majority leader and I say to colleagues, at this \npoint in time we have one piece to work out. I believe that will happen \nthis morning. I see there is no reason why we cannot get the \nreprogramming part taken care of--that will be the piece that the \nmajority leader and I are now working together on, which is of course \nalways the best way to proceed, if you can--and then we will have a \nlimit, time limit on two amendments that will deal with the two other \nareas. Then we will have a vote.\n  Mr. President, I say this morning because I am quite confident that \nwe can move forward and I will be ready to do so when the majority \nleader is ready to do so. We will just wait to work this out on the \nreprogramming part, and then we should be ready to go. That is what we \nhave been aiming for all along.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10329-6", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10330-S10331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE RESCISSIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am encouraged that we could have some \nmovement on the rescissions bill. There are many important issues that \nare facing this body right now. I happen to think that regulatory \nreform is extremely important, not only for small businesses, for \nfarmers, but for the growth of our American economy.\n  But, as we look at these long-range programs, we have a very severe \nshort-term problem. I have the distinction of chairing the Veterans \nAdministration, HUD, and Independent Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee. This so-called rescissions bill is actually an emergency \nand rescissions bill. It is the supplemental emergency bill because the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency is getting very close to running \nout of money. We have had disasters, such as the California earthquakes \nand fires and floods, we have had the bombing in Oklahoma City, we have \nhad floods in the Midwest, and the money available for FEMA is about at \nits end. Nobody expects a disaster to occur and the Feds to say, \n``Sorry, we cannot come. We do not have any money.'' But we are about \nat that point.\n  That is why this bill, the emergency supplemental and emergency \nrescissions bill, is vitally important. That is No. 1.\n  Second, we have had our defense budget drawn down because of police \nactions, responding to needs in various parts of the country. The \ndistinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee will \ntell you, if we do not get this bill through, in September we are going \nto have to shut down operations for ships, for airplanes. That means \nthat American pilots, who have to maintain their currency, will not be \ngetting that currency. It will be dangerous to them.\n  These are the needs for the emergency supplemental. But let me tell \nyou first hand, as one who worries every day about funding the vitally \nimportant functions of assisted housing, of medical care for veterans, \nof EPA, NASA, and others, what is going to happen if we do not pass the \nrescissions bill. This is not a question of reprogramming and we are \ngoing to fine tune things here and there. We have taken a rescission \nhit. We have, in this rescissions bill, given up $8 billion in budget \nauthority. That is money appropriated for the current year but which \nwill not be spent until future years.\n  The reason we had to do that is because HUD, primarily, has been \nspending out of control. And, in HUD, when you appropriate money 1 \nyear, you get the budget authority out there but it starts spending out \nin future years. So 60 percent of the dollars that will be spent next \nyear in the subcommittee that I chair are spent as a result of previous \nyears' appropriations. And our limit, what we can spend in that year, \nis determined by the actual outlays.\n  We have, in all, over $6 billion of budget authority rescinded in HUD \nunder this bill. We have worked with Housing and Urban Development, we \nhave worked with our colleagues on the other side, and while nobody \nlikes to cut budget authority, they have agreed that this is the least \nharmful.\n  Let me tell you what happens if that rescissions bill does not go \nthrough. If that rescissions bill does not go through, we have another \nbillion dollars of outlays in the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment that we cannot control. And that is likely to mean that we \nwill not have the money to continue to provide public housing in \nfederally assisted housing for all of the 4.8 million families that \ndepend upon HUD funding for their housing during the coming fiscal year \nof 1996. We are going to be hard pressed to fund that housing and other \nvitally important programs like CDBG, and HOME, and the work of the \nVeterans Administration and NASA, as it is. I think we can do it if \nthis rescissions bill passes.\n  If this rescissions bill continues to languish as people try to work \nout reprogramming for the last 2\\1/2\\ months of this fiscal year, if we \ndo not get the rescissions bill, those who hold up the rescissions bill \nwill have to go home and explain why some people are going to be thrown \nout, thrown out of federally assisted housing they now occupy.\n  The subcommittee on Labor and HHS has $1.3 billion in outlays that \ndepend upon this bill. This rescissions bill is vitally important. I \nurge my colleagues to move it.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. \n\n[[Page S10331]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this has been a very interesting year in \nCongress with the change in control in both the House and the Senate; \nin some ways refreshing, in some ways very disappointing. This is the \nyear of reform and change. Many of the changes and reforms are useful \nand interesting. Many others are just downright nutty. I will give you \nan example of some.\n  The notion that when the Soviet Union is now gone we should start to \nbuild star wars with money we do not have at a time when this project \nclearly is not necessary. In my judgment, that's a nutty idea.\n  We stick $9 billion into defense that the Department of Defense says \nit does not want or does not need. That makes no sense to me. That is \nnot reform or change.\n  Maybe, as one had suggested, charge admission to tour the U.S. \nCapitol. In other words, charge the American citizens admission to take \ntours in the U.S. Capitol in order to raise money to reduce the \ndeficit? It seems to me that qualifies as a nutty idea.\n  Provide laptop computers for poor kids at a time when you are cutting \nschool lunches? Another nutty idea.\n  I have said there are a lot of goofy ideas. There are some good \nideas, some of which I have supported, one of which is the line-item \nveto. I want to ask some questions about that this morning.\n  On February 6 of this year, this Senate passed a bipartisan proposal \non the line-item veto. I happen to think, and have thought for a long \nwhile, it makes sense for a President to have a line-item veto. Most \nGovernors have it. The President ought to have it.\n  We passed a line-item veto here in the Senate on March 23. The House \npassed it on February 6. It is now over 120 days, and the question is, \nwhere is the line-item veto?\n  Today we are going to start on our first appropriations bill. Soon \nthose appropriations bills will go to the White House. My guess is that \nthose who wrote the Contract With America and included the line-item \nveto in the contract, those who were so urgent about the need for a \nline-item veto as they spoke on the floor of the Senate and the House, \nare now less interested in really having a line-item veto if it means \nthat a Democratic President in the White House has a line-item veto to \nget rid of Republican pork in appropriations bills.\n  I noticed yesterday, in a newspaper, ``Gingrich Gets $200 Million in \nNew Pork,'' it says in the headline. I do not know what this is about. \nIt is just ``pork'' in an appropriations bill-- ``Gingrich Gets $200 \nMillion in New Pork,'' in an appropriations bill.\n  I am going to go to a markup in 10 minutes, in which I know there are \nabout five or six provisions in this authorization bill that represent \nspecial little projects in someone's State.\n  So what happens to the line-item veto? Why do we not have a line-item \nveto moving so that the President might sign the bill and have the \nauthority to remove this pork with a line-item veto in appropriations \nbills this Congress is going to pass?\n  I think I know what has happened to it. The House of Representatives \n120 days later has not even appointed conferees to go to a conference \nwith the Senate on the line-item veto. Why have they not appointed \nconferees? Because I do not think they really want a line-item veto. I \ndo. I voted for it. I voted for it many times in Congress. And I felt \nin March of this year when the Senate passed it, and the month before \nwhen the House passed it, that maybe those who said it was an urgent \npriority on the other side of the aisle were serious. It now appears \nthey were not serious at all. It now appears to me they were much more \ninterested in producing pork than producing a line-item veto bill.\n  If there is a lost and found department in the Congress, I hope \nsomeone will call and ask, where is the line-item veto bill?\n  One of our colleagues has treated us to a big yellow sign every day \nwhich says, ``Where is Bill?''--which is not in my judgment a very \nrespectful reference to the President. But ``Where is Bill?''--asking, \n``Where is the President's budget?''\n  I guess, if I were inclined with that sort of approach, I could bring \na chart here that says, ``Where is the bill?''-- and hang up ``120 \ndays'' on the chart to ask the question, ``Where is the line-item veto \nbill?''\n  We passed it. The House passed it. And there is no conference because \nthe House has not even appointed conferees. Is the reason they have not \nappointed conferees because they want to lard up the appropriations \nbills with pork, $200 million in pork by the Speaker of the House and \nthey do not want a Democratic President to veto the pork out of these \nbills? If that is the reason, they are wallflowers when it comes to \nfighting the deficit.\n  Let us decide to cast this line-item veto bill, get it through \nconference, and get the President to sign it. Let us have a bite at \nthese appropriation bills right now with this deficit. If you care \nabout public policy and about the line-item veto, if you voted for it \nin the Senate, as I did, if you voted for it in the House, as the \nmajority did, I hope they would start asking the question, ``Where is \nthe line-item veto?'' Why do we not expect the Speaker to appoint \nconferees? Why do we not have a conference report, bring it from the \nHouse, have the Senate pass it, and get it back to the President so \nthat he can exercise the line-item veto on these bills?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10331-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10331-S10333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE ORGANIZATION OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to go to one other subject \ntoday briefly. It is one that almost no one knows anything about, \nincluding the Presiding Officer. It is called the Organization of \nEconomic Cooperation and Development or OECD. It is an international \norganization that we pay 25 percent of the total cost. I do not think \nanybody in here really knows much about it. There are a lot of \ninternational organizations.\n  This year the United States will contribute about $62 million to fund \nthe OECD. We are a member of the OECD. I am told that they meet in the \nfinest places in the world and are headquartered in Paris. When they \nhold a meeting, they hold a meeting in a fine, great hotel in one of \nthe great cities of the world. Folks come from all over the world to \nattend OECD meetings, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment.\n  One of the things they did recently is approve a report, a document \nstatement, in which this country participated and signed, that talked \nabout how you apportion the tax burden of international corporations \namong the countries in which they do business.\n  This little document said the OECD, with the United States signing \nthe document, rejects something called global formulary apportionment. \nIt does not mean much to anybody. But what it means to me is this \ncountry signs on a dotted line, along with the other member countries \nof the OECD, saying the United States is willing to give up or forgive \nabout $15 billion a year in taxes that ought to be paid to America that \nwill not be paid.\n  Seventy-three percent of the foreign-based corporations doing \nbusiness in the United States pays zero in Federal income taxes, \ndespite the fact they earn hundreds of billions of dollars here. There \nare companies that sell cars, VCR's, television sets, and other \nproducts--whose names you would recognize instantly--that do business \nhere every day earning billions of dollars and pay zero in U.S. income \ntaxes. Not pay a little bit--pay nothing in Federal income taxes.\n  Why is that? It is because the IRS is stuck with an outdated tax \nenforcement system which the foreign corporations love, and which \nforeign governments love as well. It is called the arm's-length method, \nwhich is used to evaluate transfer pricing that exists between related \ncorporations. Tens of thousands of foreign corporations do business in \nthe United States through U.S. subsidiaries that they own and control. \nThese integrated companies sell things to themselves back and forth, \nand establish their own prices on those transactions. That is why we \nhave examples of tractor tires being sold between corporations that are \nrelated for $7.50 for a tractor tire; a piano \n\n[[Page S10332]]\nfor $50; a safety pin for $29; toothbrushes for $18. Why would \ncorporations price tractor tires at $7.50? Because they are moving \nprofits in or out of countries with corporations they control, and that \nis called transfer pricing.\n  We use a system in taxing called the arm's length methodology which \nis an archaic, buggy-whip system. It is like taking two plates of \nspaghetti and trying to attach the two ends together; taking different \ncorporations and connecting them together to save in a market system. \nIt is a system that is totally unworkable and unenforceable. The result \nis massive tax avoidance. This country is losing to the tune of $15 \nbillion a year, in my judgment, because we have not replaced this \nflawed system with a simple formula approach, as the States have used \nsuccessfully for decades. I might say with respect to domestic \nbusinesses operating in different States that there is a standard \nformula that is used to apportion profits between jurisdictions using \nthe amount of payroll, property, and sales as a guide. But the IRS's \ncontinued use of the arm's length method means we are losing $15 \nbillion every year from the biggest international corporations in the \nworld which do not pay taxes, despite earning huge profits in this \ncountry.\n  Our U.S. representative at the OECD signs on to an agreement that \nsays we reject the use of formulary apportionment.\n  So as a result of that, I wrote to the Secretary of the Treasury and \nthe Secretary of State and said tell me about the OECD. Who is involved \nin these negotiations? Where were the meetings held? What corporations \nwere involved to persuade them to do this? They said we cannot give you \nthat information. It is confidential. You have no right to the working \npapers of the OECD. They are secret.\n  I said, Wait a second. I am part of a group that funds them; about \n$62 million this year from U.S. taxpayers' will go to the OECD. You are \nsaying that we do not have a right to see the information?\n  I asked a series of detailed questions of both the Secretary of the \nTreasury and also of the Secretary of State to try to understand what \nis going on. The fact is you cannot get information. It is secret or \notherwise unavailable, they say. If it is so secret, maybe they do not \nneed our money. Maybe they do not need $62 million.\n  I want to share with my colleagues the money that goes to OECD. At a \ntime when we are saying we do not have enough money to deal with \nproblems in this country, including problems of families who are \nstruggling very hard, a whole range of areas, nutrition, education, and \nso on, here is what has happened to OECD, the Organization of Economic \nCooperation and Development.\n  In 1990, the American taxpayers contributed $36 million to the OECD. \nIn 1995, $62 million--only 5 years later and our share nearly doubled. \nThat is pretty interesting. In fact, from 1994 to 1995 the OECD, this \nlittle number in the State Department goes from a $50 million to a $62 \nmillion contribution.\n  We wrestle and debate on the floor of the Senate about why we have $5 \nmillion here or $10 million there. Mr. President, $62 million now goes \nto OECD, and it is on a steep increase; nearly doubling in the last 5 \nyears.\n  They are off making deals with international corporations, and with \nother countries in a manner that will affect us by, in my judgment, \nshortchanging us probably $15 billion a year in taxes that we ought to \nget that we will not from foreign corporations that make profits here. \nThen they said to us you have no right to see the information.\n  Well, I would say to the Secretary of the Treasury, if you think that \nis going to stand, you are wrong. When the appropriations bill comes to \nthe floor and you want more money, you had better be here with a lot of \ninformation. Otherwise, in my judgment, we are going to have a whole \nseries of votes on the OECD, and you may lose a whole lot of money \nbecause you cannot say to us give us the money for these international \norganizations, but we do not have any interest in telling you about \nwhat these organizations are doing and what the policy implications are \nfor this country.\n  So I would say to the Secretary of the Treasury and to the State \nDepartment, if they are listening, that they will not enjoy the debate \nwe will have when the appropriations bill comes to the floor if they \nthink we should spend $50 million or about $63 million as they have now \nrequested in 1996 for OECD, and still take the position that we have no \nright to the information developed by this organization.\n  This is I know an arcane and difficult issue. And there are not many \npeople that are even very interested in it. When I talk about the \narm's-length method of tax enforcement versus a formulary method of tax \nenforcement, when you talk about transfer profits, transfer pricing, \nand enforcement methods, I understand why people's eyes fog over.\n  But I do not understand why a small business person who starts up a \nbusiness and makes a profit and is required to pay taxes should have to \nwatch as another large international business enters the American \nmarketplace, has $5 billion worth of sales, make three-quarters of a \nbillion dollars in net profit and pays zero in taxes to the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  It is not fair, and it ought to stop. We ought to expect those \nforeign corporations that do business in America to pay their \ncontribution on their profits just as our Main Street businesses do \nevery single day.\n  There is, I know, a web of complexity about all of this. I know that \nthe State Department and the Treasury Department and others view this \nin some respects as a foreign policy issue and in some respects as an \neconomic policy issue--only they understand and no one else is capable \nof understanding.\n  I might say the Senator who is presiding at the moment was recently a \nGovernor of a State. The States faced this problem. They faced it \nbecause we have a lot of businesses that do business in every State in \nthe Union, and the question was, how do we divide their profits? How do \nwe know what part of their profits go to Indiana, Ohio, or North \nDakota?\n  The States grappled with this and came up with a three-factor \nformula, and they said we are going to pass something called UDITPA, \nuniform division of income tax--payroll, property and sales. You make \n$10 million and 1 percent of your payroll, 1 percent of your property, \nand 1 percent of your sales were in that State, then 1 percent of that \nprofit should be allocated as the tax base, and that is the way it \nworked.\n  The fact is the States have led on this issue for decades; they \nsolved this problem. And you look at what the Federal Government is \ndoing with international corporations with exactly the same problem, \nand they are using a buggy-whip approach that is losing billions of \ndollars.\n  More importantly than losing the money, we have created the situation \nwhere we say to foreign corporations, You come in here and do business \nand you will receive a major advantage. You can do business and play a \ngame so that you do not have to pay any taxes, but the American \nbusinesses that stay here at home and do business only here at home \nmust pay certain taxes on their profits.\n  What is the consequence? The consequence is that the American \nbusiness is disadvantaged because the foreign competitor gets by tax \nfree. And that is the problem here.\n  I have alerted by letter and received apparently one giant yawn from \nthe bureaucracy of this problem, and I wanted to alert them that they \nare not going to have a very pleasant August and September with their \nappropriations bills if they think they can tell folks in the Congress \nthat they want $63 million for an international organization which send \nits representatives to the finest hotels in the world to meet for a \nwhile and sign documents that, in my judgment, contravene this \ncountry's interests, and then say to us who appropriate the money, \n``Take a hike'' when we ask them to show us the documents that were \nused and all of the information that was developed in the construct of \nthis policy.\n  Mr. President, it was therapeutic, if nothing else, to be able to \ntalk about this in the Chamber this morning, and we will have a \nlengthier discussion on this subject when their appropriations bills \ncome forward.\n\n\n                             Line-Item Veto\n\n  Mr. President, let me make one final point. I will again be \naddressing the question of a line-item veto in the \n\n[[Page S10333]]\ncoming days because it is time for the House to appoint conferees, time \nfor a conference, time to have a line-item veto. I want to find out who \nis interested in producing a line-item veto versus who is interested in \nproviding pork. If we are interested in the line-item veto, and I am--\nand I guess I voted for it 15 or 20 times in my career--I hoped when I \nvoted for it in March we would not be debating in July whether or not \nwe are going to have a line-item veto. Some apparently have decided to \nmove into slow motion here while there is a Democrat in the White \nHouse. That is not the way the line-item veto works. And while we see \nheadlines that say ``Gingrich Gets $200 Million in New Pork,'' I would \nask, where is the line-item veto?\n  Pork is bipartisan and done on a bipartisan basis. I would like to \nhave a line-item veto in the hands of Democrat or Republican Presidents \nto address it. If someone has some notion of where this bill is or what \nis holding it up, maybe we can find out if we can get a line-item veto \nin the hands of this President before these appropriations bills get to \nthe White House.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, I rise to continue a forum that we \nstarted here as the 11 freshman Republican Members of the 104th \nCongress to talk about the issues that were important to us during the \ncampaign that are now coming to the floor of the Senate and give a \nperspective of those who are more freshly from the hustings to the \nSenate and to the people listening.\n  Today, the issue that we are going to discuss--and I know the \nPresiding Officer, the Senator from Missouri, has been an outstanding \nadvocate in his short tenure in the Senate on this issue--is welfare \nreform. Senator Ashcroft served as the Governor of Missouri for 8 years \nand instituted welfare reform and has been a tremendous advocate for \nreally dramatic reform in the States.\n  Later today, Senator Ashcroft, along with Senator Gramm, Senator \nGrams, and others, is going to have a press conference to discuss a \nversion that we are going to put forward which I believe, of all the \nbills that have been introduced to date, both in the House and the \nSenate, is probably the most dramatic, the most forward looking, the \nmost flexible, and the most meaningful welfare reform package that has \nbeen put forward. When I say meaningful, I mean meaningful to the \npeople who are in the welfare system or who may find themselves at some \nfuture time being caught in that net.\n  We believe this is a dramatic departure from business as usual, and \nit is something I am very excited about. I have worked on the welfare \nreform issue as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee and \nchaired the Republican task force last session of Congress to come up \nwith a Republican welfare reform bill. We worked 9 or 10 months in \nextensive meetings and came up with a bill--it was included as part of \nthe Contract With America--called the Personal Responsibility Act. That \nformed the basis of the bill that was eventually passed, H.R. 4, by the \nHouse, and what we have done really is take that product and taken it \none step further and allowed more State flexibility, more local \nexperimentation.\n  One of the provisions that is in the bill that I am very proud of \nthat the Senator from Missouri was the author of is a provision that \nsays that community organizations, local community organizations, \nnonprofits, churches could actually be the welfare agency in a local \ncommunity, really get back to what we know works. And what we know \nworks in dealing with the problems of poverty are people who are in the \ncommunity, who care about the people that they are serving, not someone \nhired from the State capital to monitor caseload, but someone who lives \nnext door, who goes to the same church as the person who is going \nthrough the difficult time in their life.\n  Those are the kinds of really dramatic reforms that are in the Gramm \nbill that we are going to be introducing today. And I am excited about \nit. I think it is a good mark. It shows where we want to be ultimately \non the issue of welfare reform: Multiple block grants, some flexibility \nwithin those block grants to allow States to deal with emergencies or \nan increase in maybe the number of people who need nutritional \nassistance, so they can move from one fund to another maybe people--\nthere is an increasing surge in day care requirements. The same thing \nallows that kind of flexibility for the State to be able to move funds \naround from account to account. I think that is an important change. \nAgain, the Senator from Missouri was the one that put forward these \nideas. So I am excited about that bill.\n  Let me say that I do not think that is where we are going to end up. \nThat is where I would like to end up. So I am on the bill. That is \nwhere I would like to end up. That is where I would like to see \nsomebody come down and say, this the way we should go, this is the \ndramatic step forward we should take.\n  But just like the House where there were bills that were introduced \nthat were more dramatic than was passed, H.R. 4, I think we will have \nto come up with a more modest approach if we are going to get the 60 \nvotes required to pass a welfare reform bill in this body. And I am \nconfident we can do that.\n  I am, also, at the same time--having worked with Senator Ashcroft, \nSenator Gramm, and others, working with Senator Packwood, Senator Dole, \nand others--trying to come up with a bill that we can form that takes, \nhopefully, a lot from the Gramm bill, but reaches across to try to get \nMembers who may have concern about providing too much State \nflexibility, too much local control and provide some sort of compromise \nthat can get the required votes to pass this Chamber.\n  I think this issue and the opportunity to make dramatic changes is \nhere. And this issue is too important for us to hold out for the \nperfect solution. I think we need it out there as a goal. But at the \nsame time I think we have to be practical and understand that we have \nto get what we can today. And if we can, as will be in the Packwood \nbill, also in the Gramm bill, is a block grant of the AFDC Program to \nallow States the flexibility to put forward their own plan for welfare \nrecipients, to give them the opportunity to get into jobs, to get into \njob training, and put stiff work requirements, put a time limitation--\nthose kinds of things that we know work in getting people off the \nwelfare dependency cycle back into the mainstream of American life. \nThose are the kinds of things that we need to say, ``States, do the \ninnovation, do the work that is necessary for your individual States to \nbe able to transition people off.'' We are going to give that \nflexibility, and in both bills.\n  That is only a small piece of the welfare pie, AFDC, what many \npeople, certainly a lot on the other side, consider to be welfare. I \nthink welfare is a much broader category. They say AFDC is the welfare \nprogram, Aid to Families With Dependent Children. If we can block grant \nthat program, end the entitlement nature, end the dependency that \nresults from someone being guaranteed money for doing things that, \nfrankly, most people would say are not what we want them to do: have \nchildren out of wedlock, do not get a job, do not get job training, do \nnot try to do anything to get yourself out. We will give you more \nmoney. I think that is a very perverse incentive. End that entitlement. \nSay that after a certain period of years, you cannot continue in this \nlife. That we will help you but you must help yourself. It is a \ncontract between those who want to help and those who are to be helped. \nThat piece alone, if we can block grant that piece, send it to the \nStates, give them the opportunity, with a string that says you have a \n5-year limitation, you have to have a work requirement; if we can do \nthat piece alone, I think we will make a major change in the lives of \nmillions of Americans and give them the opportunity that they have not \nseen under this system, which is intended to be \n\n[[Page S10334]]\ncompassionate but is nothing but destructive to millions of lives, \nfamilies, and communities across America.\n  We have that opportunity today. I think we can get 60 or more votes \nfor that provision. We should go as far as we can. We should try to do \nmore. We should do food stamp reforms. I would like to see a block \ngrant for food stamps. I do not know if we can get a block grant for \nthe Food Stamp Program. If we can get major reforms that came out of \nthe Agriculture Committee that require work for people who are on food \nstamps, that get rid of a lot of the waste and fraud that encourage \nelectronic benefits transfer, which is being used just north of here in \nMaryland and other places, in isolated programs, for example, in Berks \nCounty in Pennsylvania, using the debit card as opposed to a food \nstamp. It cuts down tremendously on fraud. We need to encourage that \nfor States to be able to do more of that, to reduce the amount of food \nstamp fraud, which I know is a very sensitive issue among millions of \nAmericans who see the fraud every day at the grocery store.\n  Those are the kinds of things that we can and should debate here on \nthis floor. And I am hopeful that we can bring a bill--I want to doff \nmy cap to the majority leader for his courage in setting forth the last \nweek of the session before the recess to do welfare reform so that we \ncan come here and have a great debate before we get into the \nreconciliation process after we come back, but have a debate focused \nsolely on the issue of welfare reform. Many have encouraged the \nmajority leader to just fold welfare reform into reconciliation and \nconsider it all one big package. I think that is a mistake. I do not \nthink it gives welfare the kind of focus that it deserves in changing \nAmerica.\n  So I appreciate the opportunity to come here and talk about this. I \nwant to again congratulate the Presiding Officer for his tremendous \nwork on this issue. And I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first of all, before my colleague \nleaves, we come here to speak on the floor and we have other \nengagements. Let me just say to him that I think we are totally in \nagreement on the need for a full discussion and debate. Hopefully, it \nwill be one that is done with a considerable amount of substance and \ngrace and dignity on welfare. I do think it would be a mistake to fold \nthis into a reconciliation bill because I think whenever you are \nconsidering such a major departure from public policy--and this is a \nmajor departure of public policy--it is a mistake to fold it into the \nreconciliation bill where you really do not have the opportunity for \nthe debate and discussion.\n  I say to my friend from Missouri that, if he is going to speak in \nmorning business, I would really prefer to let him have the time, so I \nwill just take 2 minutes rather than taking up the rest of the time for \nnow. I do think there are a couple of things that concern me about what \nis called welfare reform.\n  First of all, I want to make sure it is not reformatory as opposed to \nreform. It seems to me real welfare reform enables a family--and in the \nmain we are talking about women and children --to make the transition \nfrom welfare to workfare. Now, we have been talking about that for a \nlong time. Actually, Franklin Delano Roosevelt talked about that in \n1935 when what we now know as the AFDC Program was introduced as a part \nof the Social Security Act.\n  The problem is when we talk about moving to workfare as opposed to \nwelfare, it is very difficult to have any welfare reform unless, in \nfact, there is affordable family child care. I mean, it is very \ndifficult today for a single parent. Almost all of these single parents \nare women. In some ways I wish more were men. And I wish there were \nless single parents, period, No. 1; and, No. 2--and I think the Chair \nand I agree on this--men took more responsibility. But if we are going \nto say to a single parent, ``You need to work,'' there are a couple of \ncritical ingredients to make sure this is real welfare reform and not \nreformatory. One is for especially smaller children, that there is \naffordable child care. That is not done on the cheap.\n  I know that in Minnesota, one of the problems that we have run into--\nand I think we are doing a really good job on welfare reform--is we \nhave long waiting lists. As a result of that, many of the mothers that \nyou talk to cannot make the transition to work because they simply \ncannot afford or find--not custodial--but developmental child care for \ntheir children.\n  A welfare family is not 1 mother and 10 children. We are usually \ntalking about one mother and two children.\n  I will be done because I do not want to take the time away from my \ncolleague from Missouri and we will have plenty of time for debate on \nthis.\n  The second point is the one we talk about all the time, which is we \nhave to somehow figure out where health care reform fits into this, \nbecause all too often what happens is a single parent goes back to \nschool, a mother goes back to school, a community college, maybe then \nfinishes up at the University of Minnesota, then tries to get a job. \nThe Washington Post had a very, very good portrait about this. What \nhappens is, you are no longer receiving Medicaid, you are paying child \ncare, and if you look at the wages that are out there for jobs, you are \nbehind. So we have to make sure that, in fact, families are able to \nmake this transition without punishing families. So I think the health \ncare reform piece is critically important.\n  Finally, I think this is a challenge for all of us. I think it goes \nwell beyond welfare reform policy. We really need to look at the \nfundamental question of standard of living in this country and the \nsqueeze on the vast middle class and what has been going on for the \nlast 15 years, plus--I am not pointing the finger in any party \ndirection--and I think the overwhelming challenge is to have an economy \nthat produces good jobs that people can count on. I think that has to \nbe part of welfare reform as well, so a mother has a job that pays a \nwage, has benefits on which she can support her children. I think we \nneed to look at these much more carefully.\n  I could say more. I will not. My colleague is anxious to speak. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10334-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10334-S10335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RESTORE HOPE AND OPPORTUNITY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is true that there is a broad \nconsensus that people understand what we have attempted to do with our \nwelfare system has been a failure. If you want to see what our current \nWashington-based, one-size-fits-all welfare program has done, to see \nhow the perverse incentives of the welfare system have failed, I guess \nyou could go just a couple blocks from here. There you can see a \ngeneration raised by welfare and fed through food stamps, but literally \nstarved of nurture and hope. You will meet young teens in their third \npregnancy. You will meet children who not only do not have a father, \nbut they do not know any other child with a father. These are tragedies \nof the current system, and these are the realities against which reform \nmust properly be judged.\n  There has been a great deal of reporting recently on divisions in our \ndiscussion on welfare. I would like to make something as clear as I \npossibly can. While it may have taken us some time to reconcile our \ndifferences in terms of the strategy that we have, we have never \nforgotten the horror of our current system, we have never disagreed on \nour fundamental values, and we have never wavered from our central \ncommitment, and that is to end the system of welfare we have now, to \nstrengthen States and communities, to restore hope and opportunity to \nthe millions of Americans for whom such words now are tragically words \nwithout definition or words without meaning.\n  I might add that it is important for us to understand that as well \nmeaning as we might be in Washington in seeking to find a single \nsolution to all of the problems that relate to the needs of people that \nwould move them from dependence to independence, it would be \ninappropriate for us to try and find \n\n[[Page S10335]]\na solution because there are lots of solutions that are going to be \nnecessary, and no one garment will fit all children and no one vehicle \nwill carry all loads and no single system imposed from Washington on \nthis great Nation will be productive in moving people from the web of \ndependency to the opportunity of independence.\n  We really need for the creative capacity of the States, the \ninnovation and the energy of people who are working to develop their \nown systems and the commitment that that investment in their own \nsystems brings, to be allowed in a new system which would give States \nthe opportunity through block grants to develop the strategies which \nwill elicit the response among the citizens of the communities that \nthose States represent.\n  So as we work together, and I am pleased to have had the opportunity \nto work with so many people in this respect, through vigorous \ndiscussions and the discussions I have had have been no more vigorous \nwith anyone than those discussions which I have had with the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania who inhabits the chair at this \nmoment. But it is that kind of discussion, it is that kind of exchange, \nit is that kind of a collusion of ideas that provides the opportunity \nfor the truth to emerge and for the real progress to be made.\n  In the weeks ahead as we debate welfare, it is my hope that this \ndebate will serve as a trial. It should be a trial that will indict the \nabuses, the horrors, the lies of our current Washington-knows-best, \none-size-fits-all perverse, incentive-laden system of welfare. It is my \nintention in the weeks ahead to try and ensure that an understanding of \nthe current system happens so that we can avoid making the mistakes of \nthe past over again. Someone much wiser than I has said appropriately \nthat those who ignore history are destined to repeat it. Let us not be \ndestined to repeat the horror of our welfare system.\n  Today, I just want to begin by talking about an incident that \nprobably all of us remember, because we cannot forget. In February of \n1994 in the process of a routine drug raid in Chicago, police stumbled \nupon 19 young children, some handicapped, living on dirty mattresses in \nan unspeakably filthy six-bedroom apartment infested with roaches and \nsoiled with animal dirt.\n  The Chicago Tribune reported it this way:\n\n       The children of [six] mothers from [six] fractured families \n     * * * [were found] vacantly watching TV * * * [and] fighting \n     over the remains of a chicken bone that the family dog had \n     eaten.\n\n  President Clinton said that the despair and wasted human potential \nwithin that one Chicago apartment was not merely a social problem from \nfar off places like Calcutta, India, but the heart of a very domestic \nproblem occurring in urban centers all around America.\n  Among the adults that lived in that apartment, more than $65,000--\nmore than $65,000--per year was received annually in public assistance, \naid that took the form of cash payments, food stamps, medical care. \nSomehow, some way that money was not having its intended effect.\n  A system designed with the best intentions, unfortunately is leading \nto the destination of the road paved with best intentions; a system \ndesigned with the best intentions is eliciting and encouraging the \nworst behavior; a system which built change of dependency rather than \nbreaking shackles.\n  In that house, there were no fathers to be found, no hope to be found \nfor anyone. This is a tragedy that happens all across America, and it \nis a tragedy of our current system.\n  So as I conclude, let me just say that as we consider welfare reform, \nlet the true measure of our reform never be the dollars that we might \nsave, or the bureaucracy that is cut, or the programs that are reduced. \nBut let our measure of reform be found in the ability to move people \nfrom hopeless governmental dependence to hopeful economic and personal \nindependence, from the grasp of a perverse system of Government \nprograms to the embrace of the loving and caring communities and the \nlimitless opportunities of America.\n  Mr. President, I thank you.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10334-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WELFARE REFORM THE COUNTRY WANTS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I see morning business is about to be \nconcluded. I want to make a couple comments about our subject of the \nday, the welfare reform the country so desperately wants.\n  The postelection survey showed that there are three major elements to \nthe mandate of the election of 1994. They were: We want to do something \nto eliminate the deficits; we want to do something meaningful about \nregulatory reform; and we want real welfare reform.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud that we in this House, the Senate, and \nover in the other body, submitted and adopted a budget resolution that \nis going to end up eliminating the deficit by the year 2002.\n So the President could not veto it, or I am sure he would have. \nNonetheless, I think we are on our way to fulfilling that mandate. \nRegulatory reform--we are working on that right now, and I think we \nwill end up with a product by the end of the week in getting it out.\n\n  Welfare reform is more difficult, because it seems that everybody \ncampaigns on it, until they get here, and then they do not want to do \nanything about it. The two most important points are the exploding \nwelfare costs and the crisis of legitimacy. In 1935, when AFDC was \nenacted, 88 percent of the families who received State cash relief were \nneedy because the fathers had died. Benefits were intended primarily to \nenable the widow to care for her children at home.\n  Today, AFDC serves divorced, deserted, and never-married mothers and \ntheir offspring. Since the beginning of the program in 1965, in the \nlast 30 years, State and Federal Governments have spent $5.4 trillion \non welfare, providing cash, food, housing, medical care, and social \nservices.

Mr. President, I noted that Senator Dole was asked to \ndelay a vote on Bosnia until some time next week, as I understand it. I \nwill support Senator Dole in whatever decision he makes. I understand \nthat when the President of the United States asks for action to be \ntaken that concerns national security, that request must be given great \ncredence, and if Senator Dole decides to delay that vote, I am sure \nthat every Member of this body will support that decision.\n  If Senator Dole decides otherwise because of events that transpire in \n\n\n[[Page S10336]]\nBosnia--and I will point out that the media reports are that Zepa has \nfallen, as well, and events are unraveling there; more U.N. forces are \nbeing threatened with being taken hostage again--then I would support \nthat decision as well.\n  I gave a long speech yesterday on the issue of Bosnia. I also \naddressed the issue of airstrikes. I am deeply concerned about the \nprospect of ``aggressive airstrikes,'' exactly what that means, and \nwhat the rules of engagement are, and if those airstrikes fail, what do \nwe do next? I am convinced that if the Bosnians are assured--as they \nare being assured--that there will never, under any circumstances, be \nany U.S. ground involvement, we will learn a lesson we have learned \nthroughout this century: air power alone is not an ultimate determinant \nin the outcome of a conflict.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10335-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, today I am sending a ``Dear Colleague'' \nletter to all Senators with information concerning S. 878, a bill I \nintroduced to amend the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of \n1992. Specifically, the legislation suspends the so-called reachback \ntax. My letter responds to issues raised about this legislation by my \ndistinguished colleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller. I hope \nthis information will be helpful to all Senators in considering the \nmerits of the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter and the enclosed fact sheet be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, July 19, 1995.  \n       Dear Colleague: In late May, I sent you a letter seeking \n     your support for S. 878--a bill to provide equitable relief \n     for the Reachback companies from the retroactive tax imposed \n     by the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 (Coal \n     Act). You have since received a letter from Senator \n     Rockefeller expressing alarm at S. 878 and concern about \n     attempts to amend the Coal Act.\n       On Thursday, June 22, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee \n     on Oversight held a hearing on the Coal Act. The hearing \n     examined the inequities of the Coal Act, its impact on the \n     Reachback companies, and the current and projected surplus in \n     the Combined Benefit Fund. Last month, a federal district \n     court ruled the Coal Act unconstitutional and enjoined its \n     application to the Unity Real Estate Company.\n       Contrary to the fears expressed by proponents of the Coal \n     Act, I have no intention of jeopardizing in any way the \n     benefits promised to retired miners by the members of the \n     Bituminous Coal Operators Association (BCOA). Nor will S. 878 \n     do that. A fact sheet attached to this letter specifically \n     responds to some of the concerns expressed in Senator \n     Rockefeller's letter regarding S. 878.\n       I am optimistic that, based on the record established in \n     the House hearing together with other information which has \n     been developed, we can move forward to amend the Coal Act in \n     a way which relieves its harsh impact on the Reachback \n     companies, while at the same time insuring the benefits which \n     were in fact promised to the retired miners by the BCOA.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Thad Cochran,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n       Enclosure.\n\n   Reachback Tax Facts--A Primer on the Coal Industry Retiree Health \n                          Benefits Act of 1992\n\n       The Fiction: S. 878 would ``create a new tax break for \n     certain companies. . .''\n       The Fact: Creating a new tax break is the last thing which \n     S. 878 would do. S. 878 would relieve several hundred \n     American companies unjustly subjected to a retroactive tax \n     under the financing mechanism of the Coal Act.\n       The Fiction: S. 878 ``jeopardizes the health benefits of \n     retired miners. . .''\n       The Fact: This is incorrect. Here is what S. 878 does:\n       Provides for any surplus in the United Mine Workers of \n     America (UMWA) Combined Benefit Fund to be used as a premium \n     credit for the Reachback companies unfairly and perhaps \n     illegally taxed by the Coal Act;\n       If there is no surplus in the Combined Benefit Fund, \n     Reachback companies would receive no premium credit;\n       If the fund falls within 10 percent of its operating \n     expenses, Reachback companies would be required to \n     immediately resume premium payments.\n       Trustees of the fund acknowledged, and the GAO confirmed, \n     on October 1, 1994, that the fund had 96,237 beneficiaries \n     receiving coverage for hospitals, physicians, vision, \n     hearing, speech, ambulance, hospice, home health, \n     psychotherapy and group therapy, pregnancy and medically-\n     necessary abortion, drug and alcohol rehabilitation plus \n     prescription drugs and life insurance.\n       Our best information suggests only 29 percent of those \n     beneficiaries are retired bituminous coal miners. Some 85 \n     percent of those covered by this fund already are eligible \n     for Medicare. The fund covers retired miners and spouses, \n     parents, children, grandchildren and other dependents in the \n     home. Not one of those beneficiaries has ever had a claim \n     rejected because the fund was insolvent--much less in \n     jeopardy of insolvency.\n       The Fiction: The Coal Act ``has successfully ensured that \n     the health benefits which were promised by these miners' \n     employers continue.''\n       The Fact: Reachback companies never signed contracts \n     promising to provide lifetime healthcare benefits to former \n     employees, much less to their families. Many of the \n     Reachbacks have been out of the bituminous coal business 10, \n     20, 30 and even 40 years. Others have been non-union \n     operators for decades.\n       The unfortunate truth is the Congress should not have \n     created a new tax against the class of companies now known as \n     Reachbacks. Reachback companies had no legal or moral \n     commitments or promises--and certainly no binding contracts--\n     which obligated them to pay lifetime healthcare benefits and \n     life insurance for former employees and their families. \n     However, those companies which do have such obligations, \n     should fulfill those obligations.\n       The Fiction: ``In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a number \n     of large companies had stopped paying into the employer fund \n     which financed the health benefits of their former workers. \n     This placed the health benefits of the retirees at risk.''\n       The Fact: In truth, the crisis atmosphere was created by \n     the UMWA and the Bituminous Coal Operators' Association \n     (BCOA). The BCOA did not comply with the contract provisions \n     for increased health care benefit contributions. The UMWA did \n     not pursue the legal remedies to enforce the contract \n     guarantee provisions which would have assured the financial \n     health of the funds.\n       Furthermore, it was the BCOA and the UMWA who pooled their \n     resources in 1991 to launch, promote and win passage of a new \n     funding mechanism benefitting both the union and the BCOA. \n     That solution was to reach back across the decades to impose \n     retroactive Federal taxes on private businesses.\n       Under this ill-conceived policy, any company which had ever \n     signed a National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement (NBCWA) \n     between 1950 and 1987 would have to pay $2,349.38 per year, \n     per beneficiary assigned by the Social Security \n     Administration. The annually-adjusted premiums run from 1993 \n     through 2043. The Treasury Department and the Internal \n     Revenue Service also must participate in this overreach of \n     Federal tax authority to impose $100 per day, per beneficiary \n     penalties on any Reachback company which does not pay \n     promptly.\n       The Fiction: ``. . . Many of these companies (the \n     Reachbacks) have been held liable for the lifetime health \n     benefits of their \n\n[[Page S10337]]\n     former employees in a slew of court decisions based on their \n     contractual commitments.''\n       The Fact: This is inaccurate. This complex claim is traced \n     to a clause inserted in the 1978 pension and benefit trust \n     documents. In short, the clause said any employer which ever \n     employed any participant covered by a UMWA benefit plan is \n     obligated to the terms and conditions of the of the National \n     Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of 1978, as amended, and to \n     any successor agreements.\n       The truth is there is nothing in the so-called \n     ``evergreen'' litigation to suggest--much less to hold--that \n     companies are liable to provide lifetime health benefits to \n     their former employees. More importantly, a final decision on \n     the ``evergreen'' theory has yet to be made, as the \n     ``evergreen'' litigation remains pending before at least \n     three different federal judges.\n       Since passage of the Coal Act, the facts have demonstrated \n     that the Reachback companies never authorized or agreed to \n     any obligation which would have perpetually bound them to \n     contribute to UMWA funds, without regard to the terms of \n     their contracts with the UMWA or whether their employees \n     continued to be represented by the union.\n       Furthermore, there is absolutely nothing in the so-called \n     ``evergreen'' clause which would apply to all of the \n     Reachbacks. Consider these two glaring facts, then ask \n     yourself how ``evergreen'' could possibly be linked to the \n     Reachbacks:\n       First, the so-called ``evergreen'' clause did not even \n     appear in any of the trust documents until 1978. Many of the \n     Reachback companies did not sign or agree to the 1978 or \n     later NBCWAs.\n       Second, even among those companies which did sign the 1978 \n     or later agreement, the so-called ``evergreen'' clause could \n     impose no liability on the majority of companies which left \n     the bituminous coal industry. That's because the clause is \n     based on the amount of bituminous coal produced and/or the \n     number of UMWA coal miner hours worked. If there is no \n     bituminous coal produced, there are no tons or miner hours to \n     drop into an equation. Therefore, there is no math here on \n     which to build a case of branding the Reachbacks as party to \n     the retiree healthcare program, the Coal Act or the Combined \n     Benefit Fund.\n       The Fiction: ``Holding Reachback coal companies liable for \n     the healthcare benefits of their former employees was the \n     best way to shore up the health benefits trust fund and \n     simply means expecting that promises are kept.''\n       The Fact: The Reachbacks made no promises to provide \n     lifetime healthcare benefits for industry retirees. These \n     Reachbacks satisfied all of their obligations, including \n     claims from the union, when they left the bituminous coal \n     business or ended their association with the union. Far from \n     ``dumping'' or ``orphaning'' former employees, as some would \n     suggest, the Reachback companies were participating in a \n     multi-employer retiree health benefits system.\n       Historically, as companies chose not to participate in \n     subsequent bituminous coal wage agreements, the remaining \n     signatory companies continued covering the costs of retirees \n     who had worked for others. Companies entering the business \n     which signed a bituminous coal wage agreement paid into the \n     funds on the same basis as companies which had been in the \n     business, although they may not have had any retirees. This \n     approach was the core concept behind the multi-employer \n     retiree health benefits system.\n       When Reachbacks ended their participation in bituminous \n     coal wage agreements, they had contributed many millions of \n     dollars to pay benefits for retired miners from other defunct \n     companies or from companies which had elected not to sign \n     future wage agreements.\n       The Fiction: ``The Cochran bill pretends that a surplus in \n     the health fund exists. That phoney surplus is then used to \n     give a tax break to this favored group of companies.''\n       The Fact: Trustees and managers of the fund itself have \n     confirmed a huge surplus exists. The fund has reported these \n     surpluses in each monthly statement. A telephone call today \n     will confirm this. The General Accounting Office (GAO) \n     estimated last June the surplus would be at $103 million at \n     the end of the fund's first fiscal year, October 1, 1994. The \n     GAO was off by 10 percent. The fund actually reported an \n     almost $115 million surplus on October 1, 1994. Although the \n     magnitude of the surplus was debated by three expert \n     witnesses at the June 22 hearing, it was clear that the fund \n     will continue to sustain a steady surplus into the next \n     century.\n       The Fiction: Reachbacks are ``a favored group of \n     companies.''\n       The Fact: This is incorrect. Congress harmed all of these \n     Reachbacks, devastated many and ruined others. It certainly \n     did not do them any favors. The tax has caused perhaps \n     irreparable damage to many small and family-owned businesses. \n     It has forced the cancellation or postponement of hard-earned \n     raises for hundreds of thousands of innocent working men and \n     women throughout the country.\n       The Fiction: ``Make no mistake about it, the deficit would \n     be increased in order to pay for this tax break. . .''\n       The Fact: The deficit was increased by passage of the \n     Reachback Tax. Repeal of the Reachback Tax would lower the \n     deficit. The Reachback provision of the Coal Act increased \n     the deficit because it immediately appropriated an additional \n     $10 million to the Social Security Administration. Those \n     funds were consumed long ago and Social Security still has a \n     staggering backlog of Reachback appeals.\n       Passage of the Reachback Tax also has forced the Department \n     of Health and Human Services, the Department of Treasury, the \n     Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice and other \n     Federal agencies to spend millions of dollars to administer, \n     monitor, enforce and adjudicate the tax. The Reachback Tax \n     also robbed the Treasury of millions in revenues because the \n     tax was fully deductible to the corporations to pay it.\n       The Congressional Joint Tax Committee has indicated it is \n     likely that Federal tax receipts will increase if the \n     Reachback Tax is repealed. This gain to the Treasury will \n     occur because the contributions to the fund are fully \n     deductible from corporate taxable income.\n       Furthermore, the presence of a private union welfare plan \n     in the budget is, in itself, improper Federal tax policy and \n     budget policy.\n       The Fiction: The Finance Committee held Coal Act hearings.\n       The Fact: No such hearings occurred on the Coal Act. The \n     Senate Finance Subcommittee on Medicare and Long Term Care \n     did hold hearings on the Coal Commission Report on Health \n     Benefits for Retired Coal Miners.\n       The Fiction: The GAO wrote Senator Cochran May 25 ``to \n     inform him there is not a growing surplus in the health \n     fund.''\n       The Fact: Several members of Congress, including me, have \n     asked the GAO to update its audit of the fund. We are waiting \n     for that report, which the GAO said it could not have ready \n     for the June 22 House Ways and Means Subcommittee on \n     Oversight hearing. The GAO has not reported to me that the \n     fund's surplus is shrinking. What the GAO did report is that \n     a private consulting firm, using medical cost trend rates \n     well above accepted national and industry standards, produced \n     a report per scenarios drawn by the union fund managers that \n     showed the fund might show a deficit in the early years of \n     the next century. However, the GAO and another highly-\n     respected private accounting firm previously have suggested \n     the fund will enjoy surpluses in the next century. Towers, \n     Perrin actuaries forecast a $2.6 billion surplus when the \n     fund runs its course in 2043.\n       The Fiction: ``The claimed growing surplus in the fund does \n     not exist and has never existed.''\n       The Fact: This is inaccurate. The reality of a surplus is \n     not subject to interpretation. Trustees and managers of the \n     fund have confirmed to all interested parties that the fund \n     is in surplus and has been in surplus the past two years. The \n     annual and monthly reports published by the fund confirm \n     this.\n       The Fiction: ``There are 341 companies that are currently \n     responsible for paying for health benefits under the act.''\n       The Fact: In a June 8 letter from the fund, the acting \n     executive director reported 473 companies are being billed \n     for premiums. There was no accounting for the over 200 other \n     companies which had signed NBCWA contracts between 1950 and \n     1987 and which were originally published as Reachbacks. That \n     list included such notable American businesses as General \n     Motors, which the fund said was obligated for 90 \n     beneficiaries, or $2,114,442 this year alone.\n       The Fiction: ``Ernst and Young found that the fund is \n     likely to run a $39 million deficit by the year 2003.''\n       The Fact: That's only one scenario Ernst and Young \n     suggested in a set of projections commissioned by the fund. \n     Ernst and Young also found a healthy surplus in the fund in \n     another scenario. The scenarios which suggested a deficit \n     used medical cost trend rate projections which are 3.0 to 4.4 \n     percent higher than nationally accepted industry standards. \n     Interestingly, Ernst and Young uses 5.5 percent medical trend \n     rate calculations to provide retiree healthcare projections \n     to clients who are Reachback companies. Ernst and Young \n     agreed to use 8.1 percent to 9.9 percent medical cost trend \n     rates to figure projections for the UMWA's combined benefit \n     fund.\n       The Fiction: ``The Cochran Dear Colleague says that a court \n     ruling on the constitutionality of the Coal Act is a year \n     away.\n       The Fact: The Federal District Court in Pittsburgh ruled \n     June 7 that the Coal Act was a violation of the Fifth \n     Amendment of the Constitution.

PRESIDENT CHARLES M. VEST--IN SEARCH OF MEDIOCRITY: IS AMERICA \n                        LOSING ITS WILL TO EXCEL\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as the budget process continues, Congress \nis required to define priorities and make difficult choices about \nfunding, particularly funding that will affect educational \nopportunities for our students, the strength of our research base, and \nthe Nation's competitiveness in the global economy in the years ahead. \nIn a recent address to the National Press Club, Charles M. Vest, \npresident of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, described in \ncompelling terms the need to maintain our strong, bipartisan commitment \nto funding university-based reseach. I believe that his address \nentitled, ``In search of Mediocrity: Is America Losing its Will to \nExcel?'' will be of interest to all of us in Congress concerned with \nthese priorities, and I ask unanimous consent that his remarks be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the National Press Club, July 18, 1995]\n\n     In Search of Mediocrity: Is America Losing its Will To Excel?\n\n                          (By Charles M. Vest)\n\n       I appreciate the opportunity to talk with you this \n     afternoon. I note that the company of speakers I join \n     includes, among others, both movie actors and movie subjects. \n     Next week, this Club will hear from Jim Lovell, the astronaut \n     who commanded the Apollo 13 mission. The Apollo 13 drama \n     reminds us that science and technology are an essential part \n     of the human adventure.\n       But science and technology are not just activities for \n     astronauts and academics.\n       Science and technology affect our lives every day and they \n     create immense benefits and opportunities for all of us. \n     Their progress over the past few decades has been as dramatic \n     as the movie that Americans are flocking to see.\n       What are some of these benefits?\n       You would expect me, as a university president, to have a \n     catechism to recite. But listen instead to what the CEOs of \n     16 major U.S. corporations said recently. In an unprecedented \n     joint statement entitled A Moment of Truth for America, they \n     said:\n       ``Imagine life without polio vaccines and heart pacemakers. \n     Or digital computers. Or municipal water purification \n     systems. Or space-based weather forecasting. Or advanced \n     cancer therapies. Or jet airlines. Or disease-resisting \n     grains and vegetables. Or cardiopulmonary resuscitation.''\n       That . . . and much, much, more . . . is what science and \n     technology--and our nation's universities--have made \n     possible.\n       But today, rather than building upon this success, we are \n     about to undermine it.\n       The Congressional budget resolution proposes to reduce the \n     budget for civilian research and development by over 30 \n     percent. The long-term outlook is no better in the \n     Administration's new budget proposal.\n       Do we know what that will mean for the advancement of the \n     knowledge that fuels the American economy and creates a \n     better quality of life? Our budget choices would be simpler \n     if we had such wisdom and foresight!\n       We live in an age in which knowledge holds the key to our \n     security, welfare, and standard of living . . . an age in \n     which technological leadership will determine who wins the \n     next round of global competition . . . and the jobs and \n     profits that come from it . . . an age in which events move \n     so rapidly that almost 80 percent of the computer industry's \n     revenues come from products that did not even exist just two \n     years ago.\n       The cornerstone of our era--the information age--is \n     education. Today, America's system of higher education and \n     research is the best in the world. Period. But will it be the \n     world's standard of excellence ten years from now? If the \n     nation is to be preeminent a decade hence, if we are not only \n     to compete but lead, then we must sustain these unique \n     American institutions.\n       Why? What is so special about our research universities?\n       First, the weaving together of teaching and research in a \n     single organization gives us excellent research, and it gives \n     us superior education. Universities combine research and \n     teaching to create vital learning communities--open \n     communities of scholars that advance our understanding and \n     introduce fresh and innovative young minds into the creation \n     of knowledge *  *  * thereby educating the next generation of \n     scientists and engineers.\n       And second, research universities are the foundation of our \n     entire national research infrastructure. Supporting the \n     advancement of scientific and technical knowledge is an \n     investment. It is an investment in the future of our human \n     capital--people and their ideas. It is an investment in the \n     future quality of life, health, and welfare of the American \n     people.\n       This two-part rationale was articulated 50 years ago this \n     month in a report to President Truman entitled Science--The \n     Endless Frontier. It presented the vision of Vannevar Bush, \n     who had directed the nation's wartime science effort. That \n     vision set a confident America on a search for excellence. \n     And America has benefited beyond measure from this quest.\n       Under current budget scenarios, however, we are in danger \n     of disinvesting in our future. The cost of doing so *  *  * \n     and of drifting toward mediocrity in science, technology, and \n     advanced education is simply too great to pay.\n       We must regain our vision, our confidence, and our will to \n     excel.\n       The Federal government is rightly concerned about the \n     budget deficit. It is making hard choices. We all have to \n     make hard choices. But these decisions have to be based on a \n     vision of the future and on an understanding of what hangs in \n     the balance.\n       Is a one-third reduction in civilian research and \n     development really a savings? Or is it a body blow to our \n     national innovation system, our future competitiveness, and \n     our leadership?\n       In the current debate, many seem unwilling or unable to \n     retain, let alone enhance, our national excellence in science \n     and advanced education. Instead of pursuing our endless \n     opportunities, we are in danger of drifting toward \n     mediocrity.\n       This need not be the case. It must not be the case.\n       It used to be that universities and the federal \n     government--in the White House and on Capitol Hill--and the \n     voting public--had a broadly shared sense of the benefits to \n     be derived from investing in education and research . . . and \n     a shared commitment to the future.\n       This commitment is rapidly fading. Although leaders in both \n     parties and in both branches of government are struggling to \n     retain it, it is fading.\n       Today, the future has no organized political constituency.\n       Since the 1980s, when I began my career as a senior \n     university administrator, I have seen an unraveling of a once \n     fruitful partnership between universities and the government. \n     Its fabric has been frayed by a steady onslaught of policy \n     and budget instability, rule changes, investigations, and \n     deepening distrust.\n       Congressional hearings and media exposes on the \n     reimbursement of the costs of federally sponsored research \n     have tarnished the image of universities. Most of the real \n     issues have long since been addressed, but a residue of \n     misunderstanding and cynicism remains.\n       At the same time, the federal government has steadily asked \n     the universities to take on added missions and requirements \n     without providing the resources to meet them.\n       It is in this strained environment that the nation is now \n     debating the future federal role and responsibility for \n     university research and education in science and technology.\n       The issue before us transcends partisan politics. The issue \n     is whether Washington budgeteers and decision-makers have the \n     political will and the vision to serve society's long-term \n     need for new knowledge, new technologies, and, above all, for \n     superbly educated young men and women.\n       Sometimes the debate sounds strange to the ears of this \n     academic. During an important recent mark-up session, for \n     example, a Congressman actually commented: ``I don't give a \n     damn about the science, but I sure love the politics!''\n       There are those of us who would like to see those \n     sentiments reversed! And this includes the American public. \n     Recent polls show that nearly 70 percent of the American \n     public thinks it is very important for the government to \n     support research, and nine out of ten want the country to \n     maintain its position as a leader in medical research. In \n     fact, 73 percent are willing to pay higher taxes to support \n     more medical research.\n       What we need now is not a partisan political debate. What \n     we need to come together again in the best interests of the \n     next generation.\n       We are all facing pressures to cut costs and become more \n     effective and efficient--in government, academia, and \n     industry.\n       Industry is doing its part . . . by production better, more \n     competitive products, improving processes, reducing cycle \n     times, improving quality, and meeting environmental \n     challenges. The same intense competitive pressures that \n     stimulated these changes, however, have increasingly focused \n     industrial R on short-term objectives. Appropriately so. \n     But research of more general and \n\n[[Page S10339]]\n     longer term value has been scaled back tremendously.\n       Industry's nearly total R focus on rapidly \n     commercializing products, when combined with growing \n     constraints on support of university research, could \n     devastate our national innovation system. It could well leave \n     us without a shared, evolving base of new scientific \n     knowledge and new technology. It could destroy the primary \n     source of tomorrow's products, jobs, and health.\n       Many Americans have long been concerned that we were \n     mortgaging our children's future with ever-increasing federal \n     budget deficits. Rightly so. We must not, however, foreclose \n     on their future by failing to invest in their education . . . \n     and in the research that will be the basis of their progress.\n       We must be wise enough to balance our priorities, with both \n     the present and the future in mind. Such a balance clearly \n     requires our research universities to transform with the \n     times.\n       I certainly recognize this. Our unique qualities do not \n     exempt us from change. We cannot expect a 1945 policy to be \n     applied unchanged in 1995. Nor can we expect to be exempted \n     from intense budgetary pressures. But there are enduring \n     principles that must be sustained. We must strike the right \n     balance between holding to fundamentals and reforming \n     ourselves if we are to continue our journey toward that \n     ``endless frontier.''\n       How are we to do this?\n       First, each member of the education and research \n     partnership must learn how to be efficient, productive and \n     excellent. Industry has learned how to add value, improve \n     quality, and become more cost-effective--and is significantly \n     more competitive as a result. Government is struggling to do \n     the same. Research universities must follow suit.\n       At MIT, we have enlisted private-sector help to reengineer \n     many of our administrative activities in order to improve our \n     effectiveness and reduce our annual costs by $40 million. \n     There will be a corresponding reduction in our staff. Similar \n     efforts are taking place at universities around the country. \n     We also are exploring exciting ways to use new information \n     technologies, like the World Wide Web, to improve teaching \n     and learning. And radical revisions in our engineering and \n     management curricula to meet the needs of a new era are well \n     underway.\n       Increasing effectiveness is one thing we can do. \n     Specialization is another.\n       I believe that each college and university should focus on \n     what it does best. There is not enough money for every \n     institution to do everything. We need institutional \n     differentiation. Each of us--from community colleges to \n     research universities--must focus our attention on where we \n     can make the greatest contribution. Across-the-board \n     reductions may be politically palatable, but they are likely \n     to produce mediocrity.\n       We need to make tough judgment calls and we need to support \n     the most effective programs. This isn't easy. But government \n     at all levels, and industry, must make the decision to \n     support excellence . . . not to engage America's research \n     universities in a war of attrition. Let's not do to our \n     research universities what we've done to our K-12 school \n     system.\n       Improving productivity and changing what needs to be \n     changed are only partial answers to our problem. Even more \n     important is adhering to the two basic principles that have \n     guided us to success over the past half-century.\n       The first principle is understanding that research funding \n     is an investment in our future.\n       A variety of studies put the return on this investment in \n     the range of 25 to 50 percent. A more dramatic assessment is \n     provided by my colleague Michael Dertouzos, who is the \n     director of MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science. He points \n     out that over the last three decades, the Department of \n     Defense has funded university research in information \n     technology to the tune of some $5 billion. These university \n     programs created one-third to one-half of the major \n     breakthroughs for the computer and communications industry. \n     Today, these businesses account for $500 billion of U.S. \n     Gross Domestic Product. That is a return on the investment of \n     at least 3,000 percent.\n       Another measure of return on the investment in university \n     research is jobs. A 1989 study by the Bank of Boston found \n     that MIT graduates and faculty alone had founded over 600 \n     companies in Massachusetts. These companies, with annual \n     sales totaling $40 billion, created jobs for over 300,000 \n     people in the region.\n       Similarly, the Chase Manhattan Bank identified 225 \n     companies in the Silicon Valley founded by MIT students, \n     alumni, and faculty. These companies recorded revenues in \n     excess of $22 billion, accounting for over 150,000 jobs.\n       Similar stories can be told by public and private \n     universities all across the country. Remember this return on \n     investment when you hear talk about the cost of research and \n     education in the national budget debate.\n       In the budget debate, it is important to remember a second \n     principle that also has served us extremely well: federal \n     dollars for university research do double duty. They support \n     the conduct of research and they educate the next generation.\n       Here is how it works: Most graduate students in science and \n     engineering are supported by federal grants and contracts \n     that pay their tuition and enable them to attend the \n     university. In return for this investment in their future, \n     these students\n      perform much of the actual research. And let me tell you, \n     the lights in their laboratories burn late into the night. \n     They are working to pay for their education.\n       Student involvement in research is not confined to the \n     graduate level. At MIT, for example, nearly 80 percent of our \n     undergraduates join faculty research teams. Their learning \n     experience and their substantive contributions to research \n     are simply astounding.\n       This blending of teaching and research is at the heart of \n     America's research universities. For when you think about it, \n     research is the ultimate form of teaching and learning. Fred \n     Terman, a great leader of Stanford University, and a driver \n     in the creation of Silicon Valley, was once asked whether he \n     wanted his university to emphasize teaching or research. \n     Terman's reply was: ``I want this to be a learning \n     university.'' He captured the essence of our institutions.\n       Now, however, this integration of teaching and research is \n     at risk. Why? Because government agencies are paying less and \n     less of the actual costs of the research they sponsor. In \n     order to make up the difference, universities are being \n     forced to tap scarce resources that are not intended for this \n     purpose. This creates enormous pressures to increase \n     tuition--precisely what we do not want to do.\n       In addition, government regulations are increasing--in both \n     magnitude and inflexibility. For example, the latest federal \n     regulations have boosted the cost of our undergraduate \n     research program so dramatically that this innovative \n     educational experience is in jeopardy.\n       The linkage between education and research, the idea of \n     research as an investment rather than as a cost--these are \n     vital principles which we neglect at our peril.\n       There are several other principles as well, including \n     accountability for results in research and education; a \n     commitment to access and opportunity; the free and open \n     competition of ideas; and a dedication to excellence.\n       Those young people with the talent to discover new sources \n     of energy, to unlock the workings of the mind, or to find the \n     cure for AIDS come from all strata of our society. Many \n     require financial assistance. All deserve access to the best \n     education we can provide. Because all of us will depend on \n     their leadership and their innovation in the decades ahead.\n       Who are these young people who will lead us into the \n     future? Let me introduce two of them from MIT.\n       First, meet Jennifer Mills. Jennifer is a physics \n     undergraduate from Portland, Oregon. In the summer of her \n     junior year, she wrote much of the computer code that was \n     used to produce the remarkable images from the Hubble Space \n     Telescope that we all saw on television when the Shoemaker/\n     Levy comet collided with the planet Jupiter.\n       And meet James McLurkin, from Baldwin, New York. James \n     graduated last month with an undergraduate degree in \n     electrical engineering and a minor in mechanical engineering. \n     As a senior, he created a tiny robot that may well \n     revolutionize certain kids of surgery . . . enabling \n     surgeons, for example, to operate inside the body without \n     touching the patient directly.\n       These are the kinds of young men and women in whom we, \n     through the Federal government, must invest if we are to \n     embrace excellence rather than mediocrity.\n       Unfortunately, no organized political constituency protects \n     the interests of our future. No interest groups fund \n     telephone banks and direct mail operations to activate grass \n     roots voters on behalf of investments in tomorrow. No \n     political action committee invests in students like Jennifer \n     or James.\n       But every citizen will suffer if we are short-sighted in \n     the allocation of resources. If we do not invest in research \n     and advanced education, we will not win the battles against \n     polluted air and water, crumbling bridges and highways, \n     infant mortality, Alzheimer's disease, or hunger in the \n     world, to name just a few.\n       We all have the responsibility to become trustees and \n     guardians of our future . . . and the future of our daughters \n     and sons:\n       University faculty must continually enhance the learning \n     process, and we must do a better job of explaining to the \n     public what we do, why we do it, and how it relates to their \n     values and needs.\n       Industry leaders need to explain the benefits to the \n     economy of research and development . . . and their \n     responsibilities to the entire national innovation system.\n       Public policy makers need to take the long view . . . and \n     they will do that if we, the public, insist that they do.\n       And, yes, the media have a critical role to play . . . by \n     discussing the importance of these issues and by elevating \n     the national debate.\n       In many ways, it has been the end of the Cold War that has \n     brought us to this point . . . a point of uncertainty and \n     opportunity.\n       We now must have the foresight and wisdom to turn our \n     intellectual powers to solving the problems of a new age. We \n     must have the will to sustain our economic security, \n     eradicate the scourge of disease, create the jobs of \n     tomorrow, lift the shadow of ignorance, and heal the earth's \n     environment.\n       Meeting these challenges will require vision, confidence, \n     and the will to excel. And it will require us to continue \n     exploring the frontiers of the unknown. For the key to a \n     vibrant future lies more in what we do not know, than in what \n     we do know. We must sustain excellence in research and \n     advanced education.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n[[Page S10340]]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the committee amendments were agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate that we are happy to have \nthe managers here this morning on the first appropriations bill. We \nhope to dispose of six appropriations bills before the August recess. \nThis is certainly an indication that we are on target. We had these \nbills scheduled for tomorrow. We will do them today. Maybe we can do \nsomething else tomorrow. I wish the managers success, and I hope we can \ndo it quickly.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Florida \n[Mr. Mack].\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to present the fiscal year 1996 \nlegislative branch appropriations bill, H.R. 1854, to the Senate. \nSimply put, with this bill the Congress leads the way in fulfilling our \ncommitment to reduce the size, scope, and cost of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  But, of equal importance to keeping our promise to the American \npeople in reducing the size and cost of Congress is making these \nreductions in a thoughtful and responsible manner. The bill we present \ntoday does not compromise the legislative and oversight \nresponsibilities of Congress.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to describe the approach \nthe committee took in arriving at these funding levels. This past \nJanuary, I sent a letter to each of the Senate officers and legislative \nbranch support agencies asking them to undergo a serious programmatic \nreview of each of their activities and services they provide to \nCongress.\n  In doing so, they were asked to take a long and hard look at their \ncore missions and statutory responsibilities. They were asked to \nexplore ways of using technologies to make their operations more \nefficient and productive. They were asked to explore opportunities for \nconsolidation and restructuring of their functions and services. \nFollowing their top to bottom review, the results were incorporated \ninto new budget justifications which were presented in hearings before \nthe subcommittee.\n  I am deeply appreciative to each of the Senate officers and agency \nheads. I want to thank in particular the former Secretary of the \nSenate, Ms. Sheila Burke and her successor, Mr. Kelly Johnston, and the \nSenate Sergeant at Arms, Howard O. Greene, for their cooperation. These \noffices met, and even exceeded their goals of reducing their budgets by \n12.5 percent. Without their commitment and the dedication of their \nrespective staffs the committee would not have been able to produce the \nlegislation that the Senate considers today.\n  Mr. President, as any member of the committee will tell you, these \ndecisions were not easy. But, we have, in great measure, accomplished \nwhat we set out to do, respond to the clear and unmistakable message \nsent by the American people last November--change the way we do \nbusiness here in Washington, reduce spending, and bring runaway \nspending in control and balance the Federal budget. \n\n[[Page S10348]]\n\n  I would like to summarize the highlights of the bill:\n  The total funding for the legislative branch appropriation is \n$2,190,380,000, a reduction of just over $200 million or 8.45 percent \nbelow the fiscal year 1995 level.\n  For the funding of the operations of the Senate the committee's \nrecommendation is $426.9 million a $33.7 million reduction. In \naddition, the committee rescinds $63.5 million of unobligated funds \nfrom previous years.\n  Within the Senate accounts the funding for committees reflects a 15-\npercent reduction. As I have already mentioned, the funding for the \noffices of the Secretary of the Senate and Sergeant at Arms are reduced \nby 12.5 percent.\n  Again, I want to reiterate or make the point that these reductions \nare from this year's level. This is not some reduction from some \narbitrary, inflated baseline. These are reductions from this year's \nexpenditures.\n  Mr. President, in last years bill the Senate passed into law a ban on \nunsolicited mass mailing which has resulted in tens of millions of \ndollars in savings to the taxpayer. Again, this year the committee \nfreezes official mail cost at $11 million.\n  The statutory allowances for Senator's offices are not reduced. The \nrecommended funding for Members' office salaries and expenses should be \nsufficient to cover fiscal year 1996 expenditures.\n  Mr. President, S. 2, the Congressional Accountability Act, which was \npassed into law early this year, mandates that Congress comply with the \nvery same employment and labor laws that private businesses must comply \nwith. And, just like businesses all around the country, there is a cost \nto compliance. This bill includes $2.5 million appropriation for the \nestablishment of the new Office of Compliance. This is a new joint item \nwith the House. Each Member should be aware that the costs associated \nwith the Congressional Accountability Act will require future increases \nin expenditures. The committee has included report language that \ndirects the offices of the Senate to make regular reports to the \ncommittee regarding issues of compliance and associated costs.\n  As to the major support agencies of Congress: the Library of Congress \nhas level funding compared to fiscal year 1995, with the exception of \n$3 million increase for the National Digital Library Program. I want to \ncommend the Librarian of Congress, Dr. James Billington, for his \nefforts in strengthening the Library and the services it provides to \nthe Nation. The digital library effort is one of several forward \nthinking programs initiated by the Library of Congress which will \ninsure the Library's position as one of our leading institutions.\n  We have included a $2.6 million increase for the Congressional Budget \nOffice so that it may perform studies mandated by the Unfunded Mandate \nReform Act.\n  The GAO is reduced 15 percent from fiscal year 1995 levels and we \nhave included an advance appropriation for fiscal year 1997 which will \nresult in a two year reduction of 25 percent.\n  The Office of Technology Assessment is eliminated in the bill. The \ncommittee has included termination costs in fiscal year 1996 which \ntotal $3.6 million.\n  Mr. President, each Member of the Senate should know that this bill \ncomplies with the specifics of the Senate budget resolution which \nprovides a dramatic and necessary outline for balancing the Federal \nbudget by the year 2002. The budget resolution specifies the reductions \nto the General Accounting Office and the elimination of the Office of \nTechnology Assessment.\n  In regards to the two year 25 percent reduction in the funding for \nthe General Accounting Office, I want to thank Senator Roth, chairman \nof the Government Affairs Committee, and his staff for their \ncooperation in identifying and recommending needed changes at GAO. With \ntheir assistance, I am confident that the GAO will be able to perform \nits core statutory mission.\n  Also, I want to thank the Comptroller General, Charles Bowsher, for \nhis help. He will tell you that the funding levels will be difficult \nand will force structural changes, but he is committed to making the \nGeneral Accounting Office the model for the rest of the Federal \nGovernment in productivity and efficiency as we continue to restructure \nand downsize the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, I expect an amendment to be offered that restores \nfunding for the Office of Technology Assessment. I know that there are \nMembers who feel strongly about this issue and we will debate the \nmerits should it be offered. I must point out to the Members of the \nSenate that the Senate budget resolution specifies the elimination of \nOTA, and quite frankly, the services and information that OTA provides \ncan be obtained from a great variety of sources that do not require a \n$21 million dollars expenditure.\n  Mr. President, while this bill accomplishes our stated goal of \nreducing Congressional spending by $200 million, much more needs to be \ndone in the coming year. While the office of the Architect of the \nCapitol is reduced by 10 percent in title I of this bill, the Congress \nwill undertake a much more thorough review of its structure and \norganization by way of a Joint House-Senate Leadership Taskforce. The \ntaskforce will, with the assistance of the Architect of the Capitol, \nidentify services and operations that could be more cost efficiently \nperformed by outside contractors.\n  The committee report also directs the Government Printing Office to \ninitiate a study to analyze the structure and services of the \nSuperintendent of Documents and the Federal Depository Library Program; \nthe program which assures the American people ready and dependable \naccess to government information.\n  While the committee would have preferred to make more substantial \nchanges to the structure and funding of the Architect of the Capitol \nand the Government Printing Office, we clearly need more information \nbefore making these decision. Finally, I want to thank our ranking \nmember, Senator Murray, as well as the other members of the \nsubcommittee, for their hard work and cooperation in crafting this \nmeasure. Additionally, this year's bill builds upon the years of hard \nwork and dedication of Senator Reid, our former chairman. Senator Reid \nextended a great deal of time and cooperation to me as ranking member, \nand I thank him for that.\n  Mr. President, I would yield the floor to our ranking member and \nfloor manager, Senator Murray, for any statement she would wish to \nmake.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the H.R. 1854, the fiscal year \n1996 Legislative branch appropriation bill. I note that this is not the \nfirst year in which the committee has made the effort to constrain the \nspending of the legislative branch. As Senator Mack stated last year in \nhis opening floor remarks on the fiscal year 1995 legislative branch \nappropriation bill, ``This is the fourth year in a row now that we have \nheld funding at or below the previous year's levels in real dollars.'' \nMr. President, that means that this is the fifth year in a row that the \nSenate Appropriations Committee has reported a bill in which we have \nheld funding at or below the previous year's levels--in fact, this year \nthe committee-reported bill is over $200 million below the level \nenacted for fiscal year 1995.\n  The chairman has provided in his remarks a detailed explanation of \nall of the recommendations contained in the committee-reported bill. \nWithout repeating those details, I would simply direct all members to a \nsummary table on pages 65 and 66 of the committee report for the two \ntitles of the bill. For title I, congressional operations, the \ncommittee recommends a total of a little over $1.5 billion. That is a \nreduction of $126 million below the fiscal year 1995 appropriated level \nand $275 million below the total budget estimates for fiscal year 1996 \nfor congressional operations. Title II of the bill, as shown on page 66 \nof the report, provides funding for other agencies for which the \ncommittee recommends a total of $686 million. In total, as is depicted \nin the summary table, the bill as reported by the full committee \nprovides $2.1 billion, a reduction of just over $200 million below the \nfiscal year 1995 enacted bill and a reduction of $427 million below the \nbudget estimates for fiscal year 1996.\n  There are a number of differences between the House-passed bill and \nthe committee's recommendations, several \n\n[[Page S10349]]\nof which I would now like to address. First, for the Architect of the \nCapitol, the House bill did not fund the operations of the Flag Office. \nThe Senate Appropriations Committee chose, instead, to continue that \noffice but with the cost of this operation fully covered by the prices \ncharged to the public for the flags themselves.\n  For certain security functions of the Architect of the Capitol, the \nHouse bill recommended the transfer of staff from the Architect of the \nCapitol to the Capitol Police. The Senate committee-reported bill \ndisagrees with that recommendation and has left that security function \nwithin the Office of the Architect.\n  The committee-reported bill does not agree with the House \nrecommendation that the Botanic Garden be transferred to the Department \nof Agriculture. In addition, the House provided $7 million for the \nrenovation of the Conservatory and capped the total project at $21 \nmillion. The Senate committee-reported bill has deleted all funding for \nthat purpose.\n  Finally, Mr. President, for the Office of Technology Assessment \n(OTA), the House-passed bill included a floor amendment which provided \nfor the continuation of the functions of the OTA within the \nCongressional Research Service at a level of $15 million. H.R. 1854, as \nreported by the Senate Appropriations Committee, includes a total of \njust over $6 million for the OTA. This amount will allow for the \norderly completion and distribution of approximately 30 reports which \nthe OTA is currently undertaking and a maximum of 17 employees is \nprovided for closing the Office. In addition, from within the amount \nappropriated for fiscal year 1996, $150,000 is recommended to remain \navailable until September 30, 1997, to provide for unemployment claims \nthat may arise.\n  I would note, however, that during the committee markup of the bill, \nan amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, \nSenator Hollings, which I supported, would have provided $15 million \nfor the OTA--the cost of which was offset by a 1.08-percent reduction \nof the salaries and expenses of certain of the congressional support \nagencies. That amendment was defeated by a rollcall vote of 11-13.\n  I believe that the OTA provides a valuable service for the Congress \non a bipartisan basis and I will have more to say during this debate \nabout the OTA in support of an amendment which I anticipate may be \noffered to overturn the committee's recommendation.\n  In conclusion, I again compliment the very able chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Mack. I have learned a lot during my first year \nas ranking member of this subcommittee, and I am pleased that we have \nbeen able to do our share in carefully examining the expenditures of \nthe legislative branch to ensure that they are cost-effective and, \nwhere possible, we have recommended reductions in keeping with our \noverall efforts to reduce Federal spending.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, are there committee amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from West \nVirginia that they have been adopted en bloc.\n  Mr. BYRD. The bill, as amended, is open to amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I shall offer an amendment.\n  Mr. President on previous occasions, I have come to the Senate floor \nto speak on the matter of honoraria and outside income earned by the \nmedia. While no overall disclosure policy exists within the \ncommunications industry, there does seem to be more scrutiny being paid \nto the practice of the press in accepting speaking fees.\n  It is an issue of increasing concern to me, and one that I believe \ndeserves closer attention. I suspect that most journalists would agree \nthat they have a unique and often unequaled influence on the American \npublic. There is no match--none--no match for the leverage the media \nhave over the public dissemination of information.\n In order to stay attuned with current events, we all must rely on the \npress' interpretation of each day's occurrences.\n\n  Some members of the press take the position that, as private \ncitizens, they have no obligation--none--to disclose information to the \npublic regarding the acceptance of outside income. Although I can \nappreciate that line of thinking, it represents a defensive position \nthat has little basis in reality. From my point of view, the members of \nthe media need to adopt a position regarding such income, a position \nthat reflects some common sense. Of course, in a perfect world, all of \nus who affect public policy, either through the elective process or \nthrough the interpretation of that process, want to be thought of as \nbeing above reproach. We all want our work to be seen as benefiting the \ncommon good and, as a result, we do not expect our motives to be \nchallenged. Unfortunately, human nature has to be factored into the \nequation. There is no doubt that the American people have a negative \nopinion of elected officials and a negative opinion of the press. Some \nof that attitude is well founded. Let us be honest, there are members \nof both of these professions who have behaved unethically in the past \nand thus have tainted all of us. There is no avoiding this fact, and to \npretend otherwise is not only unrealistic but it is also disingenuous.\n  In response to the public's criticism, Members of Congress adopted \ndisclosure rules that prohibit their acceptance of honoraria. I led the \nfight. This action was seen by some politicians at the time as an \noverreaction to criticism and an unnecessary effort, but the prevailing \nattitude was to let the sunshine in and take away the appearance of \nunethical behavior. In point of fact, the Congress has gone even \nfurther, as I say, by adopting legislation that I sponsored to increase \nthe salaries of Members of Congress, but also to prohibit the \nacceptance of honoraria, prohibit it entirely. That was my amendment.\n  Many members of the press, however, have adopted the position that, \nas private citizens, they should not be subject to this type of \nscrutiny. Though they are not elected officials, nevertheless, in \nreality they do retain a great deal of influence, massive influence \nwithin the political process. It is singularly the media's decision as \nto which topics of information are noteworthy and, as such, which \ntopics should be reported on. As purveyors of the news, the press have \nenormous power, enormous power to persuade--far greater, in fact, than \ndoes any single politician, or group of politicians.\n  Edmund Burke recognized this when he referred to the fourth estate as \nhaving more power than any of the other estates.\n  It is this very power, unchecked and freewheeling, that journalists \ncan no longer ignore and brush aside. There is as much need for the \npress to be made accountable to the public as there is for elected \nofficials to be made accountable to the public. To resist public \ndisclosure--that is all I am asking, just disclose outside earned \nincome--to resist public disclosure as a matter of principle is unwise. \nPrinciple, however, is on the other side of the issue.\n  We all know that nothing gives a greater feeling of credibility than \nthe willingness to show that there is nothing to hide. Lay it out. I \nhave urged the members of the press to recognize their extraordinary \nposition in our system of Government, and to face the inherent \nresponsibility that comes with that position. I believe it is time for \nthe communications industry as a whole to take the bull by the horns \nand develop its own standards. That is what I would like to see happen; \nthe communications industry should develop its own standards with \nrespect to disclosure of outside earned income. Journalists should \nforgo the narrow defense of their individual freedoms and face up to \nthe broader obligation of trust which they bear in our political \nprocess.\n  I am offering an amendment, Mr. President, and it is a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment--today--regarding the disclosure of outside income \nearned by accredited members of the Senate press corps. I am not \ntalking about salaries. This does not infringe on anybody's \nconstitutional rights. It does not infringe upon the freedom of the \npress, as set forth in the American Bill of Rights. There is nothing in \nthat Bill of Rights that says you should not have an accounting to the \npublic of some things. \n\n[[Page S10350]]\n\n  This amendment is intended to provide a ``truth in reporting \nrequirement'' for the media that cover this institution, this Senate. I \nrepeat that I have grown increasingly concerned with the communication \nindustry's inability or unwillingness to adopt ethical standards that \nproperly reflect their role in our system of Government. In this day of \ninstant access, the media's leverage over the dissemination of \ninformation is unequaled. Their power of persuasion goes well beyond \nthe newspaper headlines or the nightly news report or the radio talk \nshow. The members of the media, as the purveyors of our daily news, \nsingularly decide which items are newsworthy and, as such, which items \ndeserve the attention of the public.\n  Today's press, as I have said already, have enormous power, enormous \npower. There is nothing like it anywhere in the world. And it is time \nthat they acknowledge the responsibility that comes with that power. \nCoupled with that fact is the American people's increasing cynicism of \nWashington. At a time when the public's distrust of Members of Congress \nand the public's distrust of journalists is at an all-time high, I \nbelieve it is important to take the necessary steps to instill \nconfidence in the process of Government. Over the years, the press have \nbeen exceedingly critical--and rightly so--of particular elected \nofficials who have abused their positions.\n  In 1991, in an effort to address the appearance of impropriety, the \nCongress passed legislation installing disclosure requirements that \nprohibit any Member from accepting compensation from outside groups. \nThat was a positive step. Though there was resistance to this \nprohibition, the prevailing attitude was, as I said earlier, to let a \nlittle sunshine work its way into the Chamber\n and to take away the appearance of unethical behavior.\n\n  Recently, there have been reports of journalists receiving thousands \nof dollars in speaking fees, thousands of dollars in speaking fees from \nthe very groups that they are covering. Despite this apparent conflict, \nsome members--not all, but some members--of the press take the position \nthat, as a private citizen they have no obligation--no obligation--to \ndisclose information regarding their acceptance of outside earned \nincome. They say, ``That is nobody else's business. I am a private \ncitizen. The public has no business in knowing what I take in speaking \nfees.''\n  The impetus for my amendment is neither an attempt to hamper the \nmedia's ability to do their job nor is it an effort to infringe in any \nway upon their first amendment rights. Instead, the goal of the \namendment is simply to apply a level of credibility to the press that \nreflects the importance of their profession.\n  It is my hope that there can be consensus in the Senate in requiring \nthe media to disclose their earned outside income. And I intend to \noffer a separate Senate resolution that would, hopefully, lead to the \nestablishment of disclosure rules starting with the 104th Congress and \nset into place rules for a yearly filing by reporters who seek \ncredentialing with the Senate Press Gallery.\n  I am not attempting to have any impact upon the House and its rules \nor regulations. But I would anticipate that the Rules Committee in the \nSenate would then hold hearings to ensure a complete airing of all \nviews on the subject. Come one, come all. Let us hear what you have to \nsay. Let us work together.\n  This is not an attempt to sandbag the press or to prevent their input \nor to influence their input. The point of this amendment is to show \nthat it is time for the media to be accountable. I would prefer that \nthey would voluntarily take the steps to make themselves accountable. I \nhope they will do that. But right now--today--their sphere of influence \nis unfettered and unequal.\n  For the press to simply resist public disclosure on a matter of \nprinciple is unwise, and it is unacceptable. I believe that the entire \nindustry must realize its full responsibility--its full \nresponsibility--to its viewers, to its readers, and to its listeners.\n  In light of that, this amendment is a beginning in the effort to \naddress at the very least the perception of a media double standard. \nThe media were right in saying that we elected officials ought to be \naccountable to the public, that we ought to disclose how much this \ngroup pays us for an appearance, or how much this group pays us for \nhaving a cup of coffee downtown at some club. We ought to disclose how \nmuch this or that group pays us for a 10-minute speech or for a 30-\nminute speech. Lay it out.\n  My amendment went further. At first we disclose it. And then my \namendment said we will eliminate entirely the acceptance of honoraria \nfor ourselves and on the part of our staffs. I am not saying the same \nwith respect to the press. I am not saying they should eliminate it. I \nam simply saying they should disclose it. Let the sunshine in. Let \ntheir colleagues, let their coworkers know. Let everybody know. Let the \npublic know.\n  It is time for journalists to forgo, as I say, the narrow defense of \ntheir individual freedoms to face up to the broader obligations of \ntrust in our political process.\n   Mr. President, this is what the amendment says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Senate should \n     consider a resolution in the 104th Congress, 1st Session, \n     that requires an accredited member of any of the Senate press \n     galleries to file an annual public report with the Secretary \n     of the Senate disclosing the identity of the primary employer \n     of the member and of any additional sources of earned outside \n     income received by the member, together with the amounts \n     received from each such source.\n       (b) For purposes of this section, the term ``Senate press \n     galleries'' means--\n       (1) the Senate Press Gallery;\n       (2) the Senate Radio and Television Correspondents Gallery;\n       (3) the Senate Periodical Press Gallery; and\n       (4) the Senate Press Photographers Gallery.\n                           Amendment No. 1802\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Senate should \n consider a resolution requiring each accredited member of the Senate \nPress Gallery to file an annual public report with the Secretary of the \n  Senate disclosing the member's primary employer and any additional \n             sources and amounts of earned outside income)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1802.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) It is the sense of the Senate that the Senate \n     should consider a resolution in the 104th Congress, 1st \n     Session, that requires an accredited member of any of the \n     Senate press galleries to file an annual public report with \n     the Secretary of the Senate disclosing the identity of the \n     primary employer of the member and of any additional sources \n     of earned outside income received by the member, together \n     with the amounts received from each such source.\n       (b) For purposes of this section, the term ``Senate press \n     galleries'' means--\n       (1) the Senate Press Gallery;\n       (2) the Senate Radio and Television Correspondents Gallery;\n       (3) the Senate Periodical Press Gallery; and\n       (4) the Senate Press Photographers Gallery.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record certain published articles pertinent to my remarks.\n  The first is entitled ``Fee Speech,'' by Ken Auletta, from the \nSeptember 12, 1994, New Yorker; the second, ``Take the Money and \nTalk,'' by Alicia C. Shepard, which appeared in American Journalism \nReview; and ``Where the Sun Doesn't Shine,'' by Jamie Stiehm, which \nappeared in the May/June 1995 issue of the Columbia Journalism Review.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the New Yorker magazine, Sept. 12, 1994]\n\n                               Fee Speech\n\n                            (By Ken Auletta)\n\n       The initial hint of anger from twenty-five or so members of \n     the House Democratic leadership came on an hour-and-a-\n     quarter-long bus ride from Washington to Airlie House, in \n     rural Virginia, one morning last January. They had been asked \n     by the Majority Leader, Richard A. Gephardt, of Missouri, to \n     attend \n\n[[Page S10351]]\n     a two-day retreat for the Democratic Message Group, and as the bus \n     rolled southwest the convivial smiles faded. The members of \n     the group began to complain that their message was getting \n     strangled, and they blamed the media. By that afternoon, when \n     the Democrats gathered for the first of five panels composed \n     of both partisans and what were advertised as ``guest \n     analysts, not partisan advisers,'' the complaints were \n     growing louder. The most prominent Democrats in the House--\n     Gephardt; the Majority Whip, David E. Bonior, of Michigan; \n     the current Appropriations Committee chairman, David R. Obey, \n     of Wisconsin; the Democratic Congressional Campaign chairman, \n     Vic Fazio, of California; Rosa L. DeLauro, of Connecticut, \n     who is a friend of President Clinton's; and about twenty \n     others--expressed a common grievance: public figures are \n     victims of a powerful and cynical press corps. A few \n     complained of what they saw as the ethical obtuseness of Sam \n     Donaldson, of ABC, angrily noting that, just four days \n     earlier, ``Prime Time Live,'' the program that Donaldson co-\n     anchors, had attacked the Independent Insurance Agents of \n     America for treating congressional staff people to a Key West \n     junket. Yet several months earlier the same insurance group \n     had paid Donaldson a thirty-thousand-dollar lecture fee.\n       By four-thirty, when the third panel, ostensibly devoted to \n     the changing role of the media, was set to begin, the \n     Democrats could no longer contain their rage, lumping the \n     press into a single, stereotypical category--you--the same \n     way they complained that the press lumped together all \n     members of Congress.\n       They kept returning to Donaldson's lecture fees and his \n     public defense that it was ethically acceptable for him to \n     receive fees because he was a private citizen, not an elected \n     official. The Airlie House meeting was off the record, but in \n     a later interview Representative Obey recalled having said of \n     journalists. ``What I find most offensive lately is that we \n     get the sanctimonious-Sam defense: `We're different because \n     we don't write the laws.' Well, they have a hell of a lot \n     more power than I do to affect the laws written.''\n       Representative Robert G. Torricelli, of New Jersey, \n     recalled have said, ``What startles many people is to hear \n     television commentators make paid speeches to interest groups \n     and then see them on television commenting on those issues. \n     It's kind of a direct conflict of interest. If it happened in \n     government, it would not be permitted.'' Torricelli, who has \n     been criticized for realizing a sixty-nine-thousand-dollar \n     profit on a New Jersey savings-and-loan after its chairman \n     advised him to make a timely investment in its stock, says he \n     doesn't understand why journalists don't receive the same \n     scrutiny that people in Congress do. Torricelli brought up an \n     idea that had been discussed at the retreat and that he \n     wanted to explore: federal regulations requiring members of \n     the press to disclose outside income--and most particularly \n     television journalists whose stations are licensed by the \n     government. He said that he would like to see congressional \n     hearings on the matter, and added. ``You'd get the votes if \n     you did the hearings. I predict that in the next couple of \n     Congresses you'll get the hearings.''\n       Gephardt is dubious about the legality of compelling press \n     disclosure of outside income, but one thing he is sure about \n     is the anger against the media which is rising within \n     Congress. ``Most of us work for more than money,'' he told \n     me. ``We work for self-image. And Congress's self-image has \n     suffered, because, members think, journalistic ethics and \n     standards are not as good as they used to be.''\n       The press panel went on for nearly three hours, long past \n     the designated cocktail hour of six. The congressmen directed \n     their anger at both Brian Lamb, the C-SPAN chairman, and me--\n     we were the two press representatives on the panel--and cited \n     a number of instances of what they considered reportorial \n     abuse. The question that recurred most often was this: Why \n     won't journalists disclose the income they receive from those \n     with special interests?\n       It is a fair question to ask journalists, who often act as \n     judges of others' character. Over the summer, I asked it of \n     more than fifty prominent media people, or perhaps a fifth of \n     what can fairly be called the media elite--those journalists \n     who, largely on account of television appearances, have a \n     kind of fame similar to that of actors. Not surprisingly, \n     most responded to the question at least as defensively as any \n     politician would. Some of them had raised an eyebrow when \n     President Clinton said he couldn't recall ten- or fifteen-\n     year-old details about Whitewater. Yet many of those I spoke \n     to could not remember where they had given a speech just \n     months ago. And many of them, while they were unequivocal in \n     their commentary on public figures and public issues, seemed \n     eager to dwell on the complexities and nuances of their own \n     outside speaking.\n       Sam Donaldson, whose annual earnings at ABC are about two \n     million dollars, was forthcoming about his paid speeches: in \n     June, he said that he had given three paid speeches so far \n     this year and had two more scheduled. He would not confirm a \n     report that he gets a lecture fee of as much as thirty \n     thousand dollars. On being asked to identify the three groups \n     he had spoken to, Donaldson--who on the March 27th edition of \n     the Sunday-morning show ``This Week with David Brinkley'' had \n     ridiculed President Clinton for not remembering that he had \n     once lent twenty thousand dollars to his mother--said he \n     couldn't remember. Then he took a minute to call up the \n     information from his computer. He said that he had spoken at \n     an I.B.M. convention in Palm Springs, to a group of public-\n     information officers, and to the National Association of \n     Retail Druggists. ``If I hadn't consulted my computerized \n     date book, I couldn't have told you that I spoke to the \n     National Association of Retail Druggists,'' he said. ``I \n     don't remember these things.''\n       What would Donaldson say to members of Congress who suggest \n     that, like them, he is not strictly a private individual and \n     should make full disclosure of his income from groups that \n     seek to influence legislation?\n       ``First, I don't make laws that govern an industry,'' he \n     said. ``Second, people hire me because they think of me as a \n     celebrity; they believe their members or the people in the \n     audience will be impressed.'' He went on, ``Can you say the \n     same thing about a member of Congress who doesn't even \n     speak--who is hired, in a sense, to go down and play tennis? \n     What is the motive of the group that pays for that?'' He \n     paused and then answered his own question: ``Their motive, \n     whether they are subtle about it or not, is to make friends \n     with you because they hope that you will be a friend of \n     theirs when it comes time to decide about millions of \n     dollars. Their motive in inviting me is not to make friends \n     with me.''\n       Would he concede that there might be at least an appearance \n     of conflict when he takes money from groups with a stake in, \n     say, health issues?\n       Donaldson said, ``At some point, the issue is: What is the \n     evidence? I believe it's not the appearance of impropriety \n     that's the problem. It's impropriety.'' Still, Donaldson did \n     concede that he was rethinking his position; and he was aware \n     that his bosses at ABC News were reconsidering their relaxed \n     policy.\n       Indeed, one of Donaldson's bosses--Paul Friedman, the \n     executive vice-president for news--told me he agreed with the \n     notion that on-air correspondents are not private citizens. \n     ``People like Sam have influence that far exceeds that of \n     individual congressmen,'' Friedman said, echoing \n     Representative Obey's point. ``We always worry that lobbyists \n     get special `access' to members of government. We should also \n     worry that the public might get the idea that special-\n     interest groups are paying for special `access' to \n     correspondents who talk to millions of Americans.''\n       Unlike Donaldson, who does not duck questions, some \n     commentators chose to say nothing about their lecturing. The \n     syndicated columnist George Will, who appears weekly as a \n     commentator on the Brinkley show, said through an assistant, \n     ``We are just in the middle of book production here. Mr. Will \n     is not talking much to anyone.'' Will is paid twelve thousand \n     five hundred dollars a speech, Alicia C. Shepard reports in a \n     superb article in the May issue of the American Journalism \n     Review.\n       ABC's Cokie Roberts, who, according to an ABC official, \n     earns between five and six hundred thousand dollars annually \n     as a Washington correspondent and is a regular commentator on \n     the Brinkley show in addition to her duties on National \n     Public Radio, also seems to have a third job, as a paid \n     speaker. Among ABC correspondents who regularly moonlight as \n     speakers, Roberts ranks No. 1. A person who is in a position \n     to know estimates that she earned more than three hundred \n     thousand dollars for speaking appearances in 1993. Last \n     winter, a couple of weeks after the Donaldson-``Prime Time'' \n     incident, she asked the Group Health Association of America, \n     before whom she was to speak in mid-February, to donate her \n     reported twenty-thousand-dollar fee to charity. Roberts did \n     not return three phone calls--which suggests that she expects \n     an openness from the Clinton Administration that she rejects \n     for herself. On that March 27th Brinkley show, she described \n     the Administration's behavior concerning Whitewater this way: \n     ``All of this now starts to look like they are covering \n     something up.''\n       Brit Hume, the senior ABC White House correspondent, earns \n     about what Roberts does, and is said to trail only Roberts \n     and Donaldson at ABC in lecture earnings. This could not be \n     confirmed by Hume, for he did not return calls.\n       At CNN, the principal anchor, Bernard Shaw, also declined \n     to be interviewed, and so did three of the loudest critics of \n     Congress and the Clinton Administration; the conservative \n     commentator John McLaughlin, who now takes his ``McLaughlin \n     Group'' on the road to do a rump version of the show live, \n     often before business groups; and the alternating \n     conservative co-hosts of ``Crossfire,'' Pat Buchanan and John \n     Sununu.\n       David Brinkley did respond to questions, but not about his \n     speaking income. Like Donaldson and others, he rejected the \n     notion that he was a public figure. Asked what he would say \n     to the question posed by members of Congress at the retreat, \n     Brinkley replied, ``It's a specious argument. We are private \n     citizens. We work in the private marketplace. They do not.''\n       And if a member of Congress asked about his speaking fee, \n     which is reported to be eighteen thousand dollars?\n       ``I would tell him it's none of his business,'' Brinkley \n     said. ``I don't feel that I have the right to ask him \n     everything he does in his private life.''\n\n[[Page S10352]]\n\n       The syndicated columnist and television regular Robert \n     Novak, who speaks more frequently than Brinkley, also \n     considers himself a private citizen when it comes to the \n     matter of income disclosure. ``I'm not going to tell you how \n     many speeches I do and what my fee is,'' he said politely. \n     Novak, who has been writing a syndicated column for thirty-\n     one years, is highly visible each weekend on CNN as the co-\n     host of the ``Evans & Novak'' interview program and as a \n     regular on ``The Capital Gang.''\n       What would Novak say to a member of Congress who maintained \n     that he was a quasi-public figure and should be willing to \n     disclose his income from speeches?\n       ``I'm a totally private person,'' he said. ``Anyone who \n     doesn't like me doesn't have to read me. These people, in \n     exchange for power--I have none--they have sacrificed \n     privacy.''\n       In fact, Novak does seem to view his privacy as less than \n     total; he won't accept fees from partisan political groups, \n     and, as a frequent critic of the Israeli government, he will \n     not take fees from Arab-American groups, for fear of creating \n     an appearance of a conflict of interest. Unlike most private \n     citizens, Novak, and most other journalists, will not sign \n     petitions, or donate money to political candidates, or join \n     protest marches.\n       Colleagues have criticized Novak and Rowland Evans for \n     organizing twice-a-year forums--as they have since 1971--to \n     which they invite between seventy five and a hundred and \n     twenty-five subscribers to their newsletter, many of whom are \n     business and financial analysts. Those attending pay hundreds \n     of dollars--Novak refuses to say how much--for the privilege \n     of listening to public officials speak and answer questions \n     off the record. ``You talk about conflicts of interest!'' \n     exclaimed Jack Nelson, the Los Angeles Times Washington \n     bureau chief. ``It is wrong to have government officials come \n     to speak to businesses and you make money off of it.''\n       Mark Shields, who writes a syndicated column and is the \n     moderator of ``The Capital Gang'' and a regular commentator \n     on ``The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour,'' is a busy paid lecturer. \n     Asked how much he earned from speeches last year, he said, \n     ``I haven't even totalled it up.'' Shields said he probably \n     gives one paid speech a week, adding, ``I don't want, for \n     personal reasons, to get into specifics.''\n       Michael Kinsley, who is the liberal co-host of \n     ``Crossfire,'' an essayist for The New Republic and Time, and \n     a contributor to The New Yorker, is also reluctant to be \n     specific. ``I'm in the worst of all possible positions,'' he \n     said. ``I do only a little of it. But I can't claim to be a \n     virgin.'' Kinsley said he appeared about once every two \n     months, but he wouldn't say what groups he spoke to or how \n     much he was paid. ``I'm going to do a bit more,'' he said. \n     ``I do staged debates--mini `Crossfire's'--before business \n     groups. If everyone disclosed, I would.''\n       The New Republic's White House correspondent, Fred Barnes, \n     who is a regular on ``The McLaughlin Group'' and appears on \n     ``CBS This Morning'' as a political commentator, speaks more \n     often than Kinsley, giving thirty or forty paid speeches a \n     year, he said, including the ``McLaughlin'' road show. How \n     would Barnes respond to the question posed by members of \n     Congress?\n       ``They're elected officials,'' he said. ``I'm not an \n     elected official. I'm not in government. I don't deal with \n     taxpayers' money.''\n       Barnes's ``McLaughlin'' colleague Morton M. Kondracke is \n     the executive editor of Roll Call, which covers Congress. \n     Kondracke said that he gave about thirty-six paid speeches \n     annually, but he would not identify the sponsors or disclose \n     his fee. He believes that columnists have fewer constraints \n     on their speechmaking than so-called objective reporters, \n     since columnists freely expose their opinions.\n       Gloria Borger, a U.S. News & World Report columnist and \n     frequent ``Washington Week in Review'' panelist, discloses \n     her income from speeches, but only to her employer. Borger \n     said she gave one or two paid speeches a month, but she \n     wouldn't reveal her fee. ``I'm not an elected official,'' she \n     said.\n       Like Borger, Wolf Blitzer, CNN's senior White House \n     correspondent, said that he told his news organization about \n     any speeches he made. How many speeches did he make in the \n     last year?\n       ``I would guess four or five,'' he said, and repeated that \n     each one was cleared through his bureau chief.\n       What would Blitzer say to a member of Congress who asked \n     how much he made speaking and from which groups?\n       ``I would tell him `None of your business,''' Blitzer said.\n       Two other network chief White House correspondents NBC's \n     Andrea Mitchell and CBS's Rira Braver--also do little \n     speaking. ``I make few speeches,'' Mitchell said. ``Maybe ten \n     a year. Maybe six or seven a year. I'm very careful about not \n     speaking to groups that involve issues I cover.'' She \n     declined to say how much she earned. For Braver, the issue \n     was moot. I don't think I did any,'' she said, referring to \n     paid speeches in the past year.\n       ABC's ``Prime Time Live'' correspondent Chris Wallace, who \n     has done several investigative pieces on corporate-sponsored \n     congressional junkets, said he made four or five paid \n     speeches last year. ``I don't know exactly,'' he said. Could \n     he remember his fee?\n       ``I wouldn't say,'' he replied.\n       Did he speak to business groups?\n       ``I'm trying to remember the specific groups,'' he said, \n     and then went on. ``One was the Business Council of Canada. \n     Yes, I do speak to business groups.''\n       So what is the difference between Chris Wallace and members \n     of Congress who accept paid junkets?\n       ``I'm a private citizen,'' he said, ``I have no control \n     over public funds, I don't make public policy.''\n       Why did Wallace think that he was invited to speak before \n     business groups?\n       ``They book me because they feel somehow that it adds a \n     little excitement or luster to their event,'' he said. He has \n     been giving speeches since 1980, he said, and ``never once \n     has any group called me afterward and asked me any favor in \n     coverage.''\n       But isn't that what public officials usually say when \n     Wallace corners them about a junket?\n       Those who underwrite congressional junkets are seeking \n     ``access'' and ``influence,'' he said, but the people who \n     hire him to make a speech are seeking ``entertainment.'' When \n     I mentioned Wallace's remarks to Norman Pearlstine, the \n     former executive editor of the Wall Street Journal, he said, \n     ``By that argument, we ought not to distinguish between news \n     and entertainment, and we ought to merge news into \n     entertainment.''\n       ABC's political and media analyst Jeff Greenfield makes a \n     ``rough guess'' that he gives fifteen paid speeches a year, \n     many in the form of panels he moderates before various media \n     groups--cable conventions, newspaper or magazine groups, \n     broadcasting and marketing associations--that are concerned \n     with subjects he regularly covers. ``It's like `Nightline,' \n     but it's not on the air,'' he said. He would not divulge his \n     fee, or how much he earned in the past twelve months from \n     speeches.\n       Greenfield argued that nearly everything he did could be \n     deemed a potential conflict. ``I cover cable, but I cover it \n     for ABC, which is sometimes in conflict with that industry,'' \n     he said. Could he accept money to write a magazine piece or a \n     book when he might one day report on the magazine publisher \n     or the book industry? He is uneasy with the distinction that \n     newspapers like the Wall Street Journal or the Washington \n     Post make, which is to prohibit daily reporters from giving \n     paid speeches to corporations or trade associations that \n     lobby Congress and have agendas, yet allow paid college \n     speeches. (Even universities have legislative agendas, \n     Greenfield noted.) In trying to escape this ethical maze, \n     Greenfield concluded, ``I finally decided that I can't figure \n     out everything that constitutes a conflict.''\n       Eleanor Clift, of Newsweek, who is cast as the beleaguered \n     liberal on ``The McLaughlin Group,'' said that she made \n     between six and eight appearances a year with the group. Her \n     fee for a speech on the West Coast was five thousand dollars, \n     she said, but she would accept less to appear in Washington. \n     She would not disclose her outside speaking income, and said \n     that if a member of Congress were to ask she would say, ``I \n     do disclose. I disclose to the people I work for. I don't \n     work for the taxpayers.''\n       Christopher Matthews, a nationally syndicated columnist and \n     Washington bureau chief of the San Francisco Examiner, who is \n     a political commentator for ``Good Morning America'' and co-\n     host of a nightly program on America's Talking, a new, NBC-\n     owned cable network, told me last June that he gave between \n     forty and fifty speeches a year. He netted between five and \n     six thousand dollars a speech, he said, or between two and \n     three hundred thousand dollars a year. Like many others, he \n     is represented by the Washington Speakers Bureau, and he said \n     that he placed no limitations on corporate or other groups he \n     would appear before. ``To be honest, I don't spend a lot of \n     time thinking about it,'' he said. ``I give the same \n     speech.''\n       David S. Broder, of the Washington Post, who has a contract \n     to appear regularly on CNN and on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' \n     said that he averaged between twelve and twenty-four paid \n     speeches a year, mostly to colleges, and that the speeches \n     are cleared with his editors at the Post. He did not discuss \n     his fee, but Howard Kurtz, the Post's media reporter, said in \n     his recent book ``Media Circus'' that Broder makes up to \n     seventy-five hundred dollars a speech. Broder said he would \n     support an idea advanced by Albert R. Hunt,the Wall Street \n     Journal's Washington editor, to require disclosure as a \n     condition of receiving a congressional press card. To receive \n     a press card now, David Holmes, the superintendent of the \n     House Press Gallery, told me, journalists are called upon to \n     disclose only if they receive more than five per cent of \n     their income from a single lobbying organization. Hunt said \n     he would like to see the four committees that oversee the \n     issuing of congressional press cards--made up of five to \n     seven journalists each--require full disclosure of any income \n     from groups that lobby Congress. He said he was aware of the \n     bitter battle that was waged in 1988, when one committee \n     issued new application forms for press passes which included \n     space for detailed disclosure of outside income. Irate \n     reporters demanded that the application form be rescinded, \n     and it was. Today, the Journal, along with the Washington \n     Post, is among the publications with the strictest \n     prohibitions on paid speeches. Most journalistic \n     organizations forbid reporters to accept money or invest in \n     the stocks of the industries they cover. But the Journal and \n     the Post have rules against reporters' accepting fees from \n     any groups that lobby Congress or from any for-profit groups.\n \n[[Page S10353]]\n\n       Hunt, who has television contracts with ``The Capital \n     Gang'' and ``Meet the Press,'' said that he averaged three or \n     four speeches a year, mostly to colleges and civic groups, \n     and never to corporations or groups that directly petition \n     Congress, and that he received five thousand dollars for most \n     speeches.\n       William Safire, the Times columnist, who is a regular on \n     ``Meet the Press,'' was willing to disclose his lecture \n     income. ``I do about fifteen speeches a year for twenty \n     thousand dollars a crack,'' he said. ``A little more for \n     overseas and Hawaii.'' Where Safire parts company with Hunt \n     is that he sees nothing wrong with accepting fees from \n     corporations. He said that in recent months he had spoken to \n     A.T. & T., the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of \n     America, and Jewish organizations. Safire said that because \n     he is a columnist his opinions are advertised, not hidden. \n     ``I believe firmly in Samuel Johnson's dictum `No man but a \n     blockhead ever wrote except for money,''' he went on. ``I \n     charge for my lectures. I charge for my books. I charge when \n     I go on television. I feel no compunction about it. It fits \n     nicely into my conservative, capitalist--with a capital `C'--\n     philosophy.''\n       Tim Russert, the host of ``Meet the Press,'' said that he \n     had given ``a handful'' of paid speeches in the past year, \n     including some to for-profit groups. He said that he had no \n     set fee, and that he was wary of arbitrary distinctions that \n     say lecturing is bad but income from stock dividends is fine. \n     Russert also raised the question of journalists' appearing on \n     shows like ``Meet the Press,'' which, of course, have \n     sponsors. ``Is that a conflict? You can drive yourself crazy \n     on this.''\n       Few journalists drive themselves crazy over whether to \n     accept speaking fees from the government they cover. They \n     simply don't. But enticements do come from unusual places. \n     One reporter, who asked to remain anonymous, said that he had \n     recently turned down a ten-thousand dollar speaking fee from \n     the Central Intelligence Agency. A spokesman for the C.I.A., \n     David Christian, explained to me, ``We have an Office of \n     Training and Education, and from time to time we invite \n     knowledgeable non-government experts to talk to our people as \n     part of our training program.'' Does the agency pay for these \n     speeches? ``Sometimes we do, and sometimes we don't,'' he \n     said. Asked for the names of journalists who accepted such \n     fees, Christian said the he was sorry but ``the records are \n     scattered.''\n       Time's Washington columnist, Margaret Carlson, who is a \n     regular on ``The Capital Gang,'' laughed when I asked about \n     her income from speeches and said, ``My view is that I just \n     got on the gravy train, so I don't want it to end.'' Carlson \n     said she gave six speeches last year, at an average of five \n     thousand dollars a speech, including a panel appearance in \n     San Francisco before the American Medical Association (with \n     Michael Kinsley, among others). She made a fair distinction \n     between what she did for a fee and what Treasury Secretary \n     Lloyd Bentsen tried to do in 1987, when, as Senate Finance \n     Committee chairman, he charged lobbyists ten thousand dollars \n     a head for the opportunity to join him for breakfast once a \n     month. ``We are like monkeys who get up onstage,'' Carlson \n     said, echoing Chris Wallace. ``It's mud wrestling for an hour \n     or an hour and a half, and it's over.''\n       There are journalistic luminaries who make speeches but, \n     for the sake of appearances, do not accept fees. They include \n     the three network-news anchors--NBC's Tom Brokaw, ABC's Peter \n     Jennings and CBS' Dan Rather--all of whom say that they don't \n     charge to speak or they donate their fees to charity. ``We \n     don't need the money,'' Brokaw said. ``And we thought it \n     created an appearance of conflict.'' Others who do not accept \n     fees for speaking are Ted Koppel, of ABC's ``Nightline''; Jim \n     Lehrer, of ``The MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour''; Bob Schieffer, \n     CBS' chief Washington correspondent and the host of ``Face \n     the Nation''; and C-SPAN's Brian Lamb.\n       ABC's senior Washington correspondent, James Wooten, \n     explained how, in the mid-eighties, he decided to change his \n     ways after a last lucrative weekend: ``I had a good agent and \n     I got a day off on Friday and flew out Thursday after the \n     news and did Northwestern University Thursday night for six \n     thousand dollars. Then I got a rental car and drove to \n     Milwaukee, and in midmorning I did Marquette for five or six \n     thousand dollars. In the afternoon, I went to the University \n     of Chicago, to a small symposium, for which I got twenty-five \n     hundred to three thousand dollars. Then I got on a plane \n     Friday night and came home. I had made\n      fifteen thousand dollars, paid the agent three thousand, and \n     had maybe two thousand in expenses. So I made about ten \n     thousand dollars for thirty-six hours. I didn't have a set \n     speech, I just talked off the top of my head.'' But his \n     conscience told him it was wrong. ``It's easy money,'' \n     Wooten said.\n       As for me, The New Yorker paid my travel expenses to and \n     from the congressional retreat. In the past twelve months, \n     I've given two paid speeches; the first, at New York's \n     Harmonic Club, was to make an opening presentation and to \n     moderate a panel on the battle for control of Paramount \n     Communications, for which I was paid twelve hundred dollars; \n     the second was a speech on the future of the information \n     superhighway at a Manhattan luncheon sponsored by the \n     Baltimore-based investment firm of Alex, Brown & Sons, for \n     which my fee was seventy-five hundred dollars. I don't accept \n     lecture fees from communications organizations.\n       Like the public figures we cover, journalists would benefit \n     from a system of checks and balances. Journalistic \n     institutions, including The New Yorker, too seldom have \n     rigorous rules requiring journalists to check with an editor \n     or an executive before agreeing to make a paid speech; the \n     rules at various institutions for columnists are often even \n     more permissive. Full disclosure provides a disinfectant--the \n     power of shame. A few journalistic institutions, recently \n     shamed, have been taking a second look at their policies. In \n     mid-June, ABC News issued new rules, which specifically \n     prohibit paid speeches to trade associations or to any ``for-\n     profit business.'' ABC's ban--the same one that is in place \n     at the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post--prompted \n     Roberts, Donaldson, Brinkley, Wallace, and several other ABC \n     correspondents to protest, and they met in early August with \n     senior news executives. They sought a lifting of the ban, \n     which would allow them to get permission on a case-by-case \n     basis. But a ranking ABC official says. ``We can agree to \n     discuss exceptions but not give any. Their basic argument is \n     greed, for Christ's sake!'' Andrew Lack, the president of NBC \n     News, said that he plans to convene a meeting of his \n     executives to shape an entirely new speaking policy.\n      ``My position is that the more we can discourage our people \n     from speaking for a fee, the better,'' he said. And CBS \n     News now stipulates that all speaking requests must be \n     cleared with the president or the vice-president of news. \n     Al Vecchione, the president of MacNeil/Lehrer Productions, \n     admitted in June to having been embarrassed by the \n     American Journalism Review piece. ``We had a loose \n     policy,'' he said. ``I just finished rewriting our company \n     policy.'' Henceforth, those associated with the program \n     will no longer accept fees to speak to corporate groups or \n     trade associations that directly lobby the government. The \n     New Yorker, according to its executive editor, Hendrik \n     Hertzberg, is in the process of reviewing its policies.\n       Those who frequently lecture make a solid point when they \n     say that lecture fees don't buy favorable coverage. But \n     corruption can take subtler forms than the quid pro quo, and \n     the fact that journalists see themselves as selling \n     entertainment rather than influence does not wipe the moral \n     slate clean. The real corruption of ``fee speech,'' perhaps, \n     is not that journalists will do favors for the associations \n     and businesses that pay them speaking fees but that the nexus \n     of television and speaking fees creates what Representative \n     Obey called ``an incentive to be even more flamboyant'' on \n     TV--and, to a lesser extent, on the printed page. The \n     television talk shows value vividness, pithiness, and \n     predictability. They prefer their panelists reliably pro or \n     con, ``liberal'' or ``conservative,'' Too much quirkiness can \n     make a show unbalanced; too much complexity can make it dull. \n     Time's Margaret Carlson told me, not entirely in jest, ``I \n     was a much more thoughtful person before I went on TV. But I \n     was offered speeches only after I went on TV.'' Her Time \n     colleague the columnist Hugh Sidey said that when he stopped \n     appearing regularly on television his lecture income \n     shrivelled. Obey wishes that it would shrivel for the rest of \n     the pundit class as well. An attitude of scorn often \n     substitutes for hard work or hard thought and it's difficult \n     to deny that the over-all result of this dynamic is a \n     coarsening of political discourse.\n       Celebrity journalism and the appearance of conflicts \n     unavoidably erode journalism's claim to public trust. ``My \n     view is that you're going to start having character stories \n     about journalists,'' Jay Rosen, a journalism professor at New \n     York University and the director of the Project on Public \n     Life and the Press, told me recently. ``It's inevitable. If I \n     were a big-name Washington journalist, I'd start getting my \n     accounts together. I don't think journalists are private \n     citizens.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n            [From the American Journalism Review, June 1995]\n\n                        Take the Money and Talk\n\n                         (By Alicia C. Shepard)\n\n       It's speech time and the Broward County Convention Center \n     in Fort Lauderdale.\n       ABC News correspondent and NPR commentator Cokie Roberts \n     takes her brown handbag and notebook off of the ``reserved'' \n     table where she has been sitting, waiting to speak. She steps \n     up to the podium where she is gushingly introduced and \n     greeted with resounding applause.\n       Framed by palm fronds, Roberts begins her speech to 1,600 \n     South Florida businesswomen attending a Junior League-\n     sponsored seminar. Having just flown in from Washington, \n     D.C., Roberts breaks the news of the hours-old arrest of a \n     suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing. She talks of \n     suffragette Susan B. Anthony, of how she misses the late \n     House Speaker Tip O'Neill, of the Republican takeover on \n     Capitol Hill. Then she gives her listeners the inside scoop \n     on the new members of Congress.\n       ``They are very young,'' says Roberts, 52. ``I'm constantly \n     getting it wrong, assuming they are pages. They're darling. \n     They're wildly adept with a blow dryer and I resent them \n     because they call me ma'am.'' The audience laughs.\n       After talking for an hour on ``Women and Politics,'' \n     Roberts answers questions for 20 minutes. One woman asks the \n     veteran correspondent, who has covered Washington \n\n[[Page S10354]]\n     since 1978, when there will be a female president.\n       ``I think we'll have a woman president when a woman is \n     elected vice president and we do in the guy,'' Roberts quips.\n       This crowd loves her. When Roberts finishes, they stand \n     clapping for several minutes. Roberts poses for a few \n     pictures and is whisked out and driven to the Miami airport \n     for her first-class flight back to Washington.\n       For her trouble and her time, the Junior League of Greater \n     Fort Lauderdale gave Roberts a check for $35,000. ``She's \n     high, very high,'' says the League's Linda Carter, who lined \n     up the keynote speakers. The two other keynote speakers \n     received around $10,000 each.\n       The organization sponsored the seminar to raise money for \n     its community projects, using Roberts as a draw. But shelling \n     out $35,000 wouldn't have left much money for, say, the \n     League's foster care or women's substance abuse programs or \n     its efforts to increase organ donors for transplants.\n       Instead, Roberts tab was covered by a corporate sponsor. JM \n     Family Enterprises. The $4.2 billion firm is an umbrella \n     company for the largest independent American distributor of \n     Toyotas. The second-largest privately held company in \n     Florida, it provides Toyotas to 164 dealerships in five \n     southern states and runs 20 other auto-related companies.\n       But Roberts doesn't want to talk about the company that \n     paid her fee. She doesn't like to answer the kind of \n     questions she asks politicians. She won't discuss what she's \n     paid, whom she speaks to, why she does it or how it might \n     affect journalism's credibility when she receives more money \n     in an hour-and-a-half from a large corporation than many \n     journalists earn in a year.\n       ``She feels strongly that it's not something that in any \n     way shape or form should be discussed in public.'' ABC \n     spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said in response to AJR's request \n     for an interview with Roberts.\n       Roberts' ABC colleague Jeff Greenfield, who also speaks for \n     money, doesn't think it's a good idea to duck the issue. ``I \n     think we ought not not talk about it.'' he says. ``I mean \n     that's Cokie's right, obviously,'' he adds, but ``if we want \n     people to answer our questions, then up to a reasonable \n     point, we should answer their questions.''\n       The phenomenon of journalists giving speeches for \n     staggering sums of money continues to dog the profession. \n     Chicago Tribune Washington Bureau Chief James Warren has \n     created a cottage industry criticizing colleagues who speak \n     for fat fees. Washington Post columnist James K. Glassman \n     believes the practice is the ``next great American scandal.'' \n     Iowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley has denounced it on the \n     Senate floor.\n       A number of news organizations have drafted new policies to \n     regulate the practice since debate over the issue flared a \n     year ago (see ``Talk is Expensive,'' May 1994). Time magazine \n     is one of the latest to do so, issuing a flat-out ban on \n     honoraria in April. The Society for Professional Journalists, \n     in the process of revising its ethics code, is wrestling with \n     the divisive issue.\n       The eye-popping sums star journalists receive for their \n     speeches, and the possibility that they may be influenced by \n     them, have drawn heightened attention to the practice, which \n     is largely the province of a relatively small roster of well-\n     paid members of the media elite. Most work for the television \n     networks or the national news weeklies; newspaper reporters, \n     with less public visibility, aren't asked as often.\n       While the crescendo of criticism has resulted in an \n     official crackdown at several news organizations--as well as \n     talk of new hardline policies at others--it's not clear how \n     effective the new policies are, since no public disclosure \n     system is in place.\n       Some well-known journalists, columnists and ``Crossfire'' \n     host Michael Kinsley and U.S. News & World Report's Steven V. \n     Roberts among them, scoff at the criticism. They assert that \n     it's their right as private citizens to offer their services \n     for whatever the market will bear, that new policies won't \n     improve credibility and that the outcry has been blown out of \n     proportion.\n       But the spectacle of journalists taking big bucks for \n     speeches has emerged as one of the high-profile ethical \n     issues in journalism today.\n       ``Clearly some nerve has been touched,'' Warren says. ``A \n     nerve of pure, utter defensiveness on the part of a \n     journalist trying to rationalize taking [honoraria] for the \n     sake of their bank account because the money is so \n     alluring.''\n       A common route to boarding the lecture gravy train is the \n     political talk show. National television exposure raises a \n     journalist's profile dramatically, enhancing the likelihood \n     of receiving lucrative speaking offers.\n       The problem is that modulated, objective analysis is not \n     likely to make you a favorite on ``The Capital Gang'' or \n     ``The McLaughlin Group.'' Instead, reporters who strive for \n     objectivity in their day jobs are often far more opinionated \n     in the TV slugfests.\n       Time Managing Editor James R. Gaines, who issued his \n     magazine's recent ban on accepting honoraria, sees this as \n     another problem for journalists' credibility, one he plans to \n     address in a future policy shift. ``Those journalists say \n     things we wouldn't let them say in the magazine. . . .'' says \n     Gaines, whose columnist Margaret Carlson appears frequently \n     on ``The Capital Gang.'' ``It's great promotion for the \n     magazine and the magazine's journalists. But I wonder about \n     it when the journalists get into that adversarial atmosphere \n     where provocation is the main currency.''\n       Journalists have been ``buckraking'' for years, speaking to \n     trade associations, corporations, charities, academic \n     institutions and social groups. But what's changed is the \n     amount they're paid. In the mid-1970s, the fees peaked at \n     $10,000 to $15,000, say agents for speakers bureaus. Today, \n     ABC's Sam Donaldson can get $30,000, ABC's David Brinkley \n     pulls in $18,000 and the New York Times' William Safire can \n     command up to $20,000.\n       When a $4.2 billion Toyota distributor pays $35,000 for \n     someone like Cokie Roberts, or a trade association pays a \n     high-profile journalist $10,000 or $20,000 for an hour's \n     work, it inevitably raises questions and forces news \n     executives to re-examine their policies.\n       That's what happened last June at ABC. Richard Wald, senior \n     vice president of news, decided to ban paid speeches to trade \n     associations and for-profit corporations--much to the dismay \n     of some of ABC's best-paid correspondents. As at most news \n     organizations, speaking to colleges and nonprofits is \n     allowed.\n       When Wald's policy was circulated to 109 employees at ABC, \n     some correspondents howled (see Free Press, September 1994). \n     Protests last August from Roberts, Donaldson, Brinkley, \n     Greenfield, Brit Hume and others succeeded only in delaying \n     implementation of the new guidelines. Wald agreed to \n     ``grandfather in'' speeches already scheduled through mid-\n     January. After that, if a correspondent speaks to a forbidden \n     group, the money must go to charity.\n       ``Why did we amend it? Fees for speeches are getting to be \n     very large,'' Wald says. ``When we report on matters of \n     national interest, we do not want it to appear that folks who \n     have received a fee are in any way beholden to anybody other \n     than our viewers. Even though I do not believe anybody was \n     every swayed by a speech fee. I do believe that it gives the \n     wrong impression. We deal in impressions.''\n       The new policy has hurt, says ABC White House correspondent \n     Ann Compton. Almost a year in advance, Compton agreed to \n     speak to the American Cotton Council. But this spring, when \n     she spoke to the trade group, she had to turn an honorarium \n     of ``several thousand dollars'' over to charity. Since the \n     policy went into effect, Compton has turned down six \n     engagements that she previously would have accepted.\n       ``The restrictions how have become so tight, it's closed \n     off some groups and industries that I don't feel I have a \n     conflict with,'' says Compton, who's been covering the White \n     House off and on since 1974. ``It's closed off, frankly, the \n     category of organizations that pay the kind of fees I get.'' \n     She declines to say what those fees are.\n       And it has affect her bank account. ``I've got four kids \n     ...'' Compton says. ``It's cut off a significant portion of \n     income for me.''\n       Some speakers bureaus say ABC's new policy and criticism of \n     the practice have had an impact.\n       ``It has affect us, definitely,'' says Lori Fish of Keppler \n     Associates in Arlington, Virginia, which represents about two \n     dozen journalists. ``More journalists are conscious of the \n     fact that they have to be very particular about which groups \n     they accept honoraria from. On our roster there's been a \n     decrease of some journalists accepting engagements of that \n     sort. It's mainly because of media criticism.''\n       Other bureaus, such as the National Speakers Forum and the \n     William Morris Agency, say they haven't noticed a difference. \n     ``I can't say that the criticism has affected us,'' says Lynn \n     Choquette, a partner at the speakers forum.\n       Compton, Donaldson and Greenfield still disagree with \n     Wald's policy but, as they say, he's the boss.\n       ``I believe since all of us signed our contracts with the \n     expectation that the former ABC policy would prevail and took \n     that into account when we agreed to sign our contracts for X \n     amount,'' Donaldson says, ``it was not fair to change the \n     policy midstream.'' Donaldson says he has had to turn down \n     two speech offers.\n       Greenfield believes the restrictions are unnecessary.\n       ``When I go to speak to a group, the idea that it's like \n     renting a politician to get his ear is not correct,'' he \n     says. ``We are being asked to provide a mix of entertainment \n     and information and keep audiences in their seats at whatever \n     convention so they don't go home and say, `Jesus, what a \n     boring two-day whatever that was.'''\n       Most agree it's the size of the honoraria that is fueling \n     debate over the issue. ``If you took a decimal point or two \n     away, nobody would care,'' Greenfield says. ``A lot of us are \n     now offered what seems to many people a lot of money. They \n     are entertainment-size sums rather than journalistic sizes.''\n       And Wald has decided ``entertainment-size sums'' look bad \n     for the network, which has at least a dozen correspondents \n     listed with speakers bureaus. It's not the speeches \n     themselves that trouble Wald. ``You can speak to the American \n     Society of Travel Agents or the Electrical Council.'' he \n     says, ``as long as you don't take money from them.''\n       But are ABC officials enforcing the new policy? ``My \n     suspicion is they're not, that they are chickenshit and Cokie \n     Roberts will do whatever the hell she wants to do and they \n     don't have the balls to do anything,'' says the Chicago \n     Tribune's Warren, whose newspaper allows its staff to make \n     paid speeches only to educational institutions.\n\n[[Page S10355]]\n\n       There's obviously some elasticity in ABC's policy. In \n     April, Greenfield, who covers media and politics, pocketed \n     $12,000 from the National Association of Broadcasters for \n     speaking to 1.000 members and interviewing media giants \n     Rupert Murdoch and Barry Diller for the group. Wald says that \n     was acceptable.\n       He also says it was fine for Roberts to speak to the Junior \n     League-sponsored business conference in Fort Lauderdale, even \n     though the for-profit JM Family Enterprises paid her fee.\n       ``As long as the speech was arranged by a reasonable group \n     and it carried with it no tinct from anybody, it's okay,'' \n     says Wald. ``I don't care where they [the Junior League] get \n     their money.''\n       Even with its loopholes, ABC has the strictest restrictions \n     among the networks. NBC, CBS and CNN allow correspondents to \n     speak for dollars on a case-by-case basis and require them to \n     check with a supervisor first. Last fall, Andrew Lack, \n     president of NBC News, said he planned to come up with a new \n     policy. NBC spokesperson Lynn Gardner says Lack has drafted \n     the guidelines and will issue them this summer. ``The bottom \n     line is that Andrew Lack is generally not in favor of getting \n     high speaking fees,'' she says.\n       New Yorker Executive Editor Hendrik Hertzberg also said \n     last fall that his magazine would review its policy, under \n     which writers are supposed to consult with their editors in \n     ``questionable cases.'' The review is still in progress. \n     Hertzberg says it's likely the magazine will have a new \n     policy by the end of the year.\n       ``There's something aesthetically offensive to my idea of \n     journalism for American journalists to be paid $5,000, \n     $10,000 or $20,000 for some canned remarks simply because of \n     his or her celebrity value,'' Hertzberg says.\n       Rewriting a policy merely to make public the outside income \n     of media personalities guarantees resistance, if not outright \n     hostility. Just ask John Harwood of the Wall Street Journal's \n     Washington bureau. This year, Harwood was a candidate for a \n     slot on the committee that issues congressional press passes \n     to daily print journalists.\n       His platform included a promise to have daily \n     correspondents list outside sources of income--not amounts--\n     on their applications for press credentials. Harwood's goal \n     was fuller disclosure of outside income, including speaking \n     fees.\n       ``I'm not trying to argue in all cases it's wrong,'' says \n     Harwood. ``But we make a big to-do about campaign money and \n     benefits lawmakers get from special interests and I'm struck \n     by how many people in our profession also get money from \n     players in the political process.''\n       Harwood believes it's hypocritical that journalists used to \n     go after members of Congress for taking speech fees when \n     journalists do the same thing. (Members of Congress are no \n     longer permitted to accept honoraria.)\n       ``By disclosing the people who pay us,'' says Harwood, ``we \n     let other people who may have a beef with us draw their own \n     conclusions. I don't see why reporters should be afraid of \n     that.''\n       But apparently they are. Harwood lost the election.\n       ``I'm quite certain that's why John lost,'' says Alan J. \n     Murray, the Journal's Washington bureau chief, who made many \n     phone calls on his reporter's behalf. ``There's clearly a lot \n     of resistance,'' adds Murray, whose newspaper forbids \n     speaking to for-profit companies, political action committees \n     and anyone who lobbies Congress. ``Everybody likes John. But \n     I couldn't believe how many people said--even people who I \n     suspect have very little if any speaking incomes--that it's \n     just nobody's business. I just don't buy that.''\n       His sentiment is shared in the Periodical Press Gallery on \n     Capitol Hill, where magazine reporters applying for press \n     credentials must list sources of outside income. But in the \n     Radio-Television Correspondents Gallery, where the big-name \n     network reporters go for press credentials, the issue of \n     disclosing outside income has never come up, says Kenan \n     Block, a ``MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour'' producer.\n       ``I've never heard anyone mention it here and I've been \n     here going on 11 years,'' says Block, who is also chairman of \n     the Radio-Television Correspondents Executive Committee. ``I \n     basically feel it's not our place to police the credentialed \n     reporters. If you're speaking on the college circuit or to \n     groups not terribly political in nature, I think, If \n     anything, people are impressed and a bit envious. It's like, \n     `More power to them.'''\n       But the issue of journalists' honoraria has been mentioned \n     at Block's program.\n       Al Vecchione, president of McNeil/Lehrer Productions, says \n     he was ``embarrassed'' by AJR's story last year and \n     immediately wrote a new policy. The story reported that \n     Robert MacNeil accepted honoraria, although he often spoke \n     for free; partner Jim Lehrer said he had taken fees in the \n     past but had stopped after his children got out of college.\n       ``We changed [our policy] because in reading the various \n     stories and examining our navel, we decided it was not \n     proper,'' Vecchione says. ``While others may do it, we don't \n     think it's proper. Whether in reality it's a violation or \n     not, the perception is there and the perception of it is bad \n     enough.''\n       MacNeil/Lehrer's new policy is not as restrictive as ABC's, \n     however. It says correspondents ``should avoid accepting \n     money from individuals, companies, trade associations or \n     organizations that lobby the government or otherwise try to \n     influence issues the NewsHour or other special * * * programs \n     may cover.''\n       As is the case with many of the new, stricter policies, \n     each request to speak is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. \n     That's the policy at many newspapers and at U.S. News.\n       Newsweek tightened its policy last June. Instead of simply \n     checking with an editor, staffers now have to fill out a form \n     if they want to speak or write freelance articles and submit \n     it to Ann McDaniel, the magazine's chief of correspondents.\n       ``The only reason we formalized the process is because we \n     thought this was becoming more popular than it was 10 years \n     ago,'' McDaniel says, ``We want to make sure [our staff \n     members] are not involved in accepting compensation from \n     people they are very close to. Not because we suspect they \n     can be bought or that there will be any improper behavior but \n     because we want to protect our credibility.''\n       Time, on the other hand, looked at all the media criticism \n     and decided to simply end the practice. In an April 14 memo. \n     Managing Editor Gaines told his staff, ``The policy is that \n     you may not do it.\n       Gaines says the new policy was prompted by ``a bunch of \n     things that happened all at once.'' He adds that ``a lot of \n     people were doing cruise ships and appearances and have some \n     portion of their income from that, so their ox is gored.''\n       The ban is not overwhelmingly popular with Time staffers. \n     Several, speaking on a not-for-attribution basis, argue that \n     it's too tough and say they hope to change Gaines' mind. He \n     says that won't happen, although he will amend the policy to \n     allow paid speeches before civic groups, universities and \n     groups that are ``clearly not commercial.''\n       ``Academic seminars are fine,'' he says. ``If some college \n     wants to pay expenses and a $150 honorarium, I really don't \n     have a problem with that.''\n       Steve Roberts, a senior writer with U.S. News & World \n     Report and Cokie Roberts' husband, is annoyed that some media \n     organizations are being swayed by negative publicity. He says \n     there's been far too much criticism of what he believes is \n     basically an innocuous practice. Roberts says journalists \n     have a right to earn as much as they can by speaking, as long \n     as they are careful about appearances and live by high \n     ethical standards.\n       ``This whole issue has been terribly over-blown by a few \n     cranks,'' Roberts says. ``As long as journalists behave \n     honorably and use good sense and don't take money from people \n     they cover, I think it's totally legitimate. In fact, my own \n     news organization encourages it.''\n       U.S. News not only encourages it, but its public relations \n     staff helps its writers get speaking engagements.\n       Roberts says U.S. News has not been intimidated by the \n     ``cranks,'' who he believes are in part motivated by \n     jealousy. ``I think a few people have appointed themselves \n     the critics and watchdogs of our profession. I, for one, \n     resent it.''\n       His chief nemesis is Jim Warren, who came to Washington a \n     year-and-a-half ago to take charge of the Chicago Tribune's \n     bureau. Warren, once the Tribune's media writer, writes a \n     Sunday column that's often peppered with news flashes about \n     which journalist is speaking where and for how much. The \n     column includes a ``Cokie Watch.'' named for Steve Roberts' \n     wife of 28 years, a woman Warren has written reams about but \n     has never net.\n       ``Jim Warren is a reprehensible individual who has attacked \n     me and my wife and other people to advance his own visibility \n     and his own reputation,'' Roberts asserts. ``He's on a \n     crusade to make his own reputation by tearing down others.''\n       While Warren may work hard to boost his bureau's reputation \n     for Washington coverage, he is best known for his outspoken \n     criticism of fellow journalists. Some reporters cheer him on \n     and fax him tips for ``Cokie Watch.'' Others are highly \n     critical and ask who crowned Warren chief of the Washington \n     ethics police.\n       Even Warren admits his relentless assault has turned him \n     into a caricature.\n       ``I'm now in the Rolodex as inconoclast, badass Tribune \n     bureau chief who writes about Cokie Roberts all the time,'' \n     says Warren, who in fact doesn't. ``But I do get lots of \n     feedback from rank-and-file journalists saying, `Way to go. \n     You're dead right.' It obviously touches a nerve among \n     readers.''\n       So Warren writes about Cokie and Steve Roberts getting \n     $45,000 from a Chicago bank for a speech and the traveling \n     team of television's ``The Capital Gang'' sharing $25,000 for \n     a show at Walt Disney World. He throws in parenthetically \n     that Capital Gang member Michael Kinsley ``should know \n     better.''\n       Kinsley says he would have agreed a few years ago, but he's \n     changed his tune. He now believes there are no intrinsic \n     ethical problems with taking money for speaking. He does it, \n     he wrote in The New Republic in May, for the money, because \n     it's fun and it boosts his ego.\n       ``Being paid more than you're worth is the American \n     dream,'' he wrote. ``I see a day when we'll all be paid more \n     than we're worth. Meanwhile, though, there's no requirement \n     for journalists, alone among humanity, to deny themselves the \n     occasional fortuitous tastes of this bliss.''\n       To Kinsley, new rules restricting a reporter's right to \n     lecture for largesse don't accomplish much.\n       ``Such rules merely replace the appearance of corruption \n     with the appearance of propriety,'' he wrote. ``What keeps \n     journalists on \n\n[[Page S10356]]\n     the straight and narrow most of the time is not a lot of rules about \n     potential conflicts of interest, but the basic reality of our \n     business that a journalist's product it out there for all to \n     see and evaluate.''\n       The problem, critics say, is that without knowing who \n     besides the employer is paying a journalist, the situation \n     isn't quite that clear-cut.\n       Jonathan Salant, president of the Washington chapter of the \n     Society of Professional Journalists, cites approvingly a \n     remark by former Washington Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee \n     in AJR's March issue: ``If the Insurance Institute of \n     America, if there is such a thing, pays you $10,000 to make a \n     speech, don't tell me you haven't been corrupted. You can say \n     you haven't and you can say you will attack insurance issues \n     in the same way, but you won't. You can't.''\n       Salant thinks SPJ should adopt an absolute ban on speaking \n     fees as it revises its ethics code. Most critics want some \n     kind of public disclosure at the very least.\n       Says the Wall Street Journal's Murray, ``You tell me what \n     is the difference between somebody who works full time for \n     the National Association of Realtors and somebody who takes \n     $40,000 a year in speaking fees from Realtor groups. It's not \n     clear to me there's a big distinction. I'm not saying that \n     because you take $40,000 a year from Realtors that you ought \n     to be thrown out of the profession. But at the very least, \n     you ought to disclose that.''\n       And so Murray is implementing a disclosure policy. By the \n     end of the year, the 40 journalists working in his bureau \n     will be required to list outside income in a report that will \n     be available to the public.\n       ``People are not just cynical about politicians,'' says \n     Murray. ``They are cynical about us. Anything we can do to \n     ease that cynicism is worth doing.''\n       Sen. Grassley applauds the move. Twice he has taken to the \n     floor of the Senate to urge journalists to disclose what they \n     earn on the lecture circuit.\n       ``It's both the amount and doing it,'' he says. ``I say the \n     pay's too much and we want to make sure the fee is disclosed. \n     The average worker in my state gets about $21,000 a year. \n     Imagine what he or she thinks when a journalist gets that \n     much for just one speech?''\n       Public disclosure, says Grassley, would curtail the \n     practice.\n       Disclosure is often touted as the answer. Many journalists, \n     such as Kinsley and Wall Street Journal columnist Al Hunt--a \n     television pundit and Murray's predecessor as bureau chief--\n     have said they will disclose their engagements and fees only \n     if their colleagues do so as well.\n       Other high-priced speakers have equally little enthusiasm \n     for making the information public. ``I don't like the idea,'' \n     says ABC's Greenfield. ``I don't like telling people how much \n     I get paid.''\n       But one ABC correspondent says he has no problem with \n     public scrutiny. John Stossel, a reporter on ``20/20,'' \n     voluntarily agreed to disclose some of the ``absurd'' fees \n     he's earned. Last year and through March of this year Stossel \n     raked in $160,430 for speeches--$135,280 of which was donated \n     to hospital, scholarship and conservation programs.\n       ``I just think secrecy in general is a bad thing,'' says \n     Stossel, who did not object to ABC's new policy. ``We [in the \n     media] do have some power. We do have some influence. That's \n     why I've come to conclude I should disclose, so people can \n     judge whether I can be bought.''\n       (Stossel didn't always embrace this notion so \n     enthusiastically. Last year he told AJR he had received \n     between $2,000 and $10,000 for a luncheon speech, but \n     wouldn't be more precise.)\n       Brian Lamb, founder and chairman of C-SPAN, has a simpler \n     solution, one that also has been adopted by ABC's Peter \n     Jennings, NBC's Tom Brokaw and CBS' Dan Rather and Connie \n     Chung. They speak, but not for money.\n       ``I never have done it,'' Lamb says. ``It sends out one of \n     those messages that's been sent out of this town for the last \n     20 years: Everybody does everything for money. When I go out \n     to speak to somebody I want to have the freedom to say \n     exactly what I think. I don't want to have people suspect \n     that I'm here because I'm being paid for it.''\n       On February 20, according to the printed program, Philip \n     Morris executives from around the world would have a chance \n     to listen to Cokie and Steve Roberts at 7 a.m. while enjoying \n     a continental breakfast. ``Change in Washington: A Media \n     Perspective with Cokie and Steve Roberts,'' was the schedule \n     event at the PGA resort in Palm Beach during Philip Morris' \n     three-day invitational golf tournament.\n       A reporter who sent the program to AJR thought it odd that \n     Cokie Roberts would speak for Philip Morris in light of the \n     network's new policy. Even more surprising, he thought, was \n     that she would speak to a company that's suing ABC for libel \n     over a ``Day One'' segment that alleged Philip Morris adds \n     nicotine to cigarettes to keep smokers addicted. The case is \n     scheduled to go to trial in September.\n       At the last minute, Cokie Roberts was a no-show, says one \n     of the organizers. ``Cokie was sick or something'' says Nancy \n     Schaub of Event Links, which put on the golf tournament for \n     Philip Morris. ``Only Steve Roberts came.''\n       Cokie Roberts won't talk to AJR about why she changed her \n     plans. Perhaps she got Dick Wald's message.\n       ``Of course, it's tempting and it's nice,'' Wald says of \n     hefty honoraria. ``Of course, they [ABC correspondents] have \n     rights as private citizens. It's not an easy road to go down. \n     But there are some things you just shouldn't do and that's \n     one of them.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n          [From the Columbia Journalism Review, May-June 1995]\n\n   Where the Sun Doesn't Shine--Financial Disclosure for Journalists \n                              Doesn't Fly\n\n                           (By Jamie Stiehm)\n\n       Journalists don't like to politick on their own behalf; \n     they'd much rather cover politics as a spectator sport. But \n     every so often a few souls in Washington are asked--if not \n     told--by their bureau chiefs to run for the prestigious \n     Standing Committee of Correspondents in one of the \n     congressional press galleries. In the case of the daily \n     newspaper gallery, this is an inner circle, democratically \n     elected, that makes important logistical decisions affecting \n     coverage of both Congress and the national political \n     conventions. Hence the tendency of the bigger newspapers and \n     wire services to exercise their clout to get their people in \n     there.\n       So this year, chances are that if he had kept quiet, John \n     Harwood of the Wall Street Journal, the only candidate from \n     one of the ``Big Four'' national newspapers, would have won. \n     But instead, Harwood chose to ignite a controversial issue \n     that has divided the journalistic community ever since Ken \n     Auletta's September 12 New Yorker article made it the talk of \n     the town: whether journalists should disclose to their peers \n     and the public their ``outside income''--that is, income \n     earned from speeches and sources other than their day jobs.\n       ``I think it's time we do a better job of disclosing the \n     sort of potential conflicts we so often expose in the case of \n     public officials,'' Harwood wrote to 2,000 colleagues in a \n     campaign letter. In an interview, he adds, ``Given the impact \n     the media have on public policy discussions, we should be \n     willing to subject ourselves to more scrutiny.''\n       This philosophy did not play too well with the masses. As \n     they paid campaign calls around town, Harwood and the \n     Journal's Washington bureau chief, Alan Murray, could hardly \n     help noticing that the disclosure proposal did not excite \n     enthusiasm. ``I was surprised,'' Murray states flatly, ``to \n     find out so many of my colleagues oppose the right thing to \n     do.''\n       Yet only a handful of daily gallery members, the so-called \n     celebrity journalists who make substantial money from \n     speaking engagements, would likely have serious outside \n     income to disclose. (Harwood himself says that he earned only \n     $300 last year from an outside source, for a speech he gave \n     to the World Affairs Council.) The vast majority of the \n     gallery members are beat reporters who might reasonably \n     resent what some see as an invasion of privacy. ``What \n     business of the gallery is it what my income is?'' says \n     Stephen Green, of Copley News Service, who also ran and lost. \n     ``People who are paying your salary should decide whether you \n     have a conflict or not.'' Alan Fram of The Associated Press, \n     the big winner, opposed disclosure partly on the ground that \n     reporters are private citizens, not public officials.\n       Fram and Green see ``philosophical perils,'' as Green put \n     it, in ``licensing'' reporters by requiring them to reveal \n     certain facts and activities. ``That opens up a door we don't \n     want to walk through,'' says Fram. ``What's the next step? \n     Voting registration?''\n       Of the three press galleries that accredit reporters on \n     Capitol Hill--the daily, periodical, and radio-TV galleries--\n     only the periodical press gallery requires members to list \n     all sources of earned income. This rule has always applied to \n     the periodical gallery, largely because it receives more \n     applications from people who might be moonlighting as trade \n     association lobbyists, government consultants, or corporate \n     newsletter writers.\n       Harwood argues that he only wants the daily gallery to do \n     what the periodical gallery already does: put the sources, \n     not the amounts, of outside income on record for any other \n     gallery member to look up. He would go one step further, \n     however, and make records available to the general public, \n     not just journalistic peers: ``Put the judgment out there.''\n       Would writing these things down prevent anything impure \n     from taking place? Maybe: environmental lawyers, for example, \n     have found that the most effective laws are the ``sunshine'' \n     statutes that made certain polluting practices less common \n     simply by requiring companies to report them.\n       Anyway, the results are in. Out of a field of five, Harwood \n     lost narrowly to the three winners: Fram of AP, Sue Kirchhoff \n     of Reuters, and Bill Welch of USA Today, none of whom share \n     his views. Is financial disclosure for journalists an idea \n     whose time has come? If Harwood's loss is a good sounding of \n     the current state of journalistic opinion, the answer is: not \n     yet.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am prepared to accept the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia because it is the beginning, \nnot the end, and it is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that will begin \nthe process for a complete hearing on the matter. As I understand it, \nit is a sense-of-the-\n\n[[Page S10357]]\nSenate resolution that in essence calls for a separate Senate \nresolution to be offered in the future during the 104th Congress that \nwould in essence call for the Rules Committee to begin the process of \ncomplete hearings on the issue.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, while I have indicated that I am prepared to \naccept the amendment, I think it is fair to say that there are \nquestions with respect to the concept as it relates to members of the \nSenate Press Gallery only, as I understand it.\n  Mr. BYRD. It pertains only to the credentialing of members of the \nSenate Press Gallery.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I do believe that several of the points that the \nSenator from West Virginia made during his comments with respect to the \namendment were, in fact, on target, specifically the issue as to the \npower of the press in choosing what to cover. There is a tendency for \nus in public life to hear--and I guess from time to time believe--that \nwe have been inaccurately quoted. My own experience is that has not \nreally been a problem. The issue which I think is important--the issue \nwhich I think the publishers of newspapers have said themselves--is \nthat the power of the press is really to choose what to cover and what \nnot to cover.\n  My point for making this is that the individuals who are members of \nthe Press Gallery in the Senate, frankly, and from my perspective, are \nnot the ones that determine what is going to be covered and what is \nnot.\n  So I think that frankly there will have to be a complete hearing on \nthe issue to make a determination about whether the Senate in fact \nshould move on this concept.\n But at this point, as I said a moment ago, I am prepared to accept the \namendment.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator, the \nmanager of the bill, for his comments and for his support in offering \nto accept the amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the words of \nthe Senator from West Virginia on his sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nand am also willing to accept the amendment on the grounds that I see \nit as the precursor to having a hearing on this so that all sides can \nbe aired. I would want to make sure that we were not precluding \nanyone's ability to be in the Press Gallery with this kind of \namendment. I think those kinds of questions and answers can be \ngathered. I understand that is what this amendment is trying to attain \nand with that would not object to it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the minority manager. I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I commend the Appropriations Committee for \nbringing this bill to the floor. Senator Hatfield, Senator Byrd, \nSenator Mack, and Senator Murray, in my view, have crafted a bill that \nreduces the amount we will spend on the legislative branch by over $200 \nmillion and an amount which is $427 million below the fiscal 1995 \nbudget estimate.\n  This is an excellent piece of legislation. It is certainly not \nperfect, but I, again, congratulate the managers of the bill for an \noutstanding effort to reduce spending on the legislative branch. \nObviously, it is where we must begin if we are going to ask other \nsectors of America to experience spending cuts as well. I thank my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to share with the Senate my \ncongratulations to the subcommittee, in particular the subcommittee \nchairman, Senator Connie Mack, because we started out this year on our \nside of the aisle--and I am very pleased this has become bipartisan--\nwith the suggestion that if we are going to fix the fiscal policy of \nour Nation, we ought to start by fixing our own House, and we ought to \nsave some money for the taxpayers in terms of what we spend on the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I happen to cochair our Republican task force with my friend Connie \nMack. We recommended that we take $200 million out of the Senate's \nexpenditures out of the legislative budget. I am pleased to report that \nwe were taken almost literally by the chairman. He saved $200.041 \nmillion. So if every subcommittee that was charged with reducing the \nexpenditures of our Government looked to the budget resolution for its \nassumptions, or to what my friend, Connie Mack, looked to--it was a \nresolution by the Republicans to take $200 million out--if everybody \ndid their jobs that well, this would be a pretty good year.\n  Frankly, I want to make one other point. I am not saying that the \nbudget resolution assumption should be adopted by any committee because \nI understand the Budget Act said the appropriators will make the final \ndecision. It also said on the entitlement, the committees that write \nthe law change the law. If we do not start getting rid of some agencies \nof our Federal Government, some functions of the Government, some \nprograms of the Government, we are just putting off for another year \nwhat is inevitable. It will just get worse, not better. Good programs \nwill have to be reduced, rather than those that are marginal and \nperhaps not needed.\n  Why do I state that? Because in this appropriations bill, this \nsubcommittee has succeeded in doing away with one of the many service \norganizations that help the U.S. Senate do its work. As I understand \nit, over a 2-year phase, we will eliminate what we recommended in our \nearly resolutions to the subcommittee. We will be getting rid of one of \nthose service organizations, is that not correct?\n  Mr. MACK. That is correct. I just say to the Senator that there \nprobably will \n\n[[Page S10358]]\nbe an amendment proposed later in the morning, or in the early \nafternoon, to restore the Office of Technology Assessment.\n  Again, we did take the direction from both the early resolution by \nour conference but also the budget resolution that said, if we are \ngoing to meet this target, we are going to have to make not only \nreductions, but we are going to have to eliminate some of the agencies, \nand we have done that. I thank the Senator for his help on that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am not prejudging that vote. I am \nspeaking to the bill as it currently is. I was a member of the \nappropriations committee that voted to sustain their work with \nreference to the service organization we say we should get rid of over \n2 years. I hope that the U.S. Senate, every time we have an issue like \nthis--and it will come up today--that we not always think how can we \nsave it and make sure it is still around and look at it again.\n  Sooner or later, you have to make decisions that you do not need \neverything, everything in the budget, and that the Senate does not need \neverything that currently serves the Senate. If you do not start doing \nthat, then I do not believe we have a lot of credibility. I do not \nbelieve the American people are going to buy it for a minute that we \nought to be cutting other programs, and we cannot get rid of one \norganization that helps us do our job.\n  Sooner or later, we have to be examples, and it has to be real, not \nrhetoric. I commend the subcommittee and its chairman. I hope the \ndebate will center around, can we really do with less and still do our \njobs? I believe we can. I do not see any shortage of professional \ntalent helping us around here, scientific or otherwise. We have so many \ngroups of science institutions that can help us, I do not know that we \nneed our own $22 million science service organization. That is what the \nissue will be.\n  I yield the floor and thank the chairman for his work and his ranking \nmember for her diligent work.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1803\n\n (Purpose: Expressing the sense of the Senate that the 104th Congress \n   should consider comprehensive campaign finance reform legislation)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the current system of campaign finance has led to \n     public perceptions that political contributions and their \n     solicitation have unduly influenced the official conduct of \n     elected officials;\n       (2) the failure to limit campaign expenditures in any way \n     has caused individuals elected to the United States Senate to \n     spend an increase portion of their time in office raising \n     campaign funds, interfering with the ability of the Senate to \n     carry out its constitutional responsibilities;\n       (3) the public faith and trust in Congress as an \n     institution has eroded to dangerously low levels and public \n     support for comprehensive congressional reforms is \n     overwhelming; and\n       (4) reforming our election laws should be a high \n     legislative priority of the 104th Congress.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that as soon as possible before the conclusion of the 104th \n     Congress, the United States Senate should consider \n     comprehensive campaign finance reform legislation that will \n     increase the competitiveness and fairness of elections to the \n     United States Senate.\n                Amendment No. 1804 to Amendment No. 1803\n\n     (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate in regard to the \n              consideration of certain legislative issues)\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack], for Mr. McConnell, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1804 to amendment No. 1803.\n       In lieu of the language proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n       It is the sense of the Senate that before the conclusion of \n     the 104th Congress, comprehensive welfare reform, food stamp \n     reform, Medicare reform, Medicaid reform, superfund reform, \n     wetlands reform, reauthorization of the Safe Drinking Water \n     Act, reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act, \n     immigration reform, Davis-Bacon reform, State Department \n     reauthorization, Defense Department reauthorization, Bosnia \n     arms embargo, foreign aid reauthorization, fiscal year 1996 \n     and 1997 Agriculture appropriations, Commerce, Justice, State \n     appropriations, Defense appropriations, District of Columbia \n     appropriations, Energy and Water Development appropriations, \n     Foreign Operations appropriations, Interior appropriations, \n     Labor, Health and Human Services and Education \n     appropriations,----\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. MACK. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will continue reading.\n  The bill clerk continued reading as follows:\n\n     Legislative Branch appropriations, Military Construction \n     appropriations, Transportation appropriations, Treasury and \n     Postal appropriations, and Veterans Affairs, Housing and \n     Urban Development, and Independent Agencies appropriations, \n     reauthorization of the Older Americans Act, reauthorization \n     of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, health \n     care reform, job training reform, child support enforcement \n     reform, tax reform, and a ``Farm Bill'' should be considered.\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nFeingold be recognized to speak for up to 20 minutes on the pending \namendment, No. 1803, to be followed by 20 minutes for debate prior to a \nmotion to table under the control of Senator McCain, and that following \nthe conclusion or yielding back of time, Senator Dole or his designee \nbe recognized to make a motion to table the Feingold amendment, and \nthat no further amendments be in order prior to the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I further ask that once the motion to table \nis made, the amendment be laid aside until 2:30 in order to consider \nother amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Florida for \nhis cooperation. I am working on an agreement on this amendment.\n  I have offered this amendment today concerning the need for campaign \nfinance reform because I firmly believe that there is a broad majority \nof Senators on both sides of the aisle who believe our campaign finance \nlaws are in need of significant repair.\n  My resolution asks the Members of the U.S. Senate whether they \nbelieve we have a seriously flawed system of campaign financing and \nwhether they believe we should consider changing it during the 104th \nCongress.\n  It is a simple proposition, but I think it is a very important one. I \ncould not be more delighted that this resolution has bipartisan support \nin its cosponsorship. It includes the Senator from Arizona [Mr. \nMcCain], the Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], the Senator from \nVermont [Mr. Jeffords], the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], the \nSenator from Illinois [Mr. Simon], the Senator from Vermont \n\n[[Page S10359]]\n[Mr. Leahy], the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley], the Senator \nfrom Delaware [Mr. Biden], the Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], and \nthe Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka].\n  Mr. President, this resolution does not propose any specific reforms. \nIt does not mention spending limits or public financing or PAC \ncontributions or any of the other proposals that have been connected in \nthe past with campaign finance. It merely says that sometime during the \nnext year and a half this Chamber should consider legislation that will \nrestore a greater degree of fairness and competitiveness to the \nelections that are involved to elect people to the Senate.\n  Why is this necessary? It seemed that significant campaign finance \nreform was going to be achieved in the 103d Congress. Unfortunately, \nthe effort fell apart as House and Senate negotiators were unable to \nbridge their differences. I am the first to say there was blame on the \npart of both parties for this falling apart, but I am offering this \nresolution today because there has not been any sort of indication that \nthe Senate will be considering this issue either this year or next \nyear. It is not even mentioned in the Republican contract. It is not on \nthe majority leader's list of items we need to do before the August \nrecess. I am afraid that it might not even be on the list of the things \nwe need to do before the turn of the century if we do not pass some \nkind of resolution.\n  It is clear that the campaign spending in our political system is \nspiraling out of control. The FEC recently released some startling \nnumbers with respect to the level of spending in the 1994 elections. \nAccording to the FEC, the 1994 elections were the most expensive in \nhistory, sporting a price tag of $724 million. That is a 62-percent \nincrease--Mr. President, a 62-percent increase--from aggregate spending \njust 4 years earlier in 1990.\n  The effect of this escalation in spending to me is a sort of politics \nof exclusion as it becomes increasingly difficult for average working \nAmericans to run for public office. It is very distressing that \ncandidates are first and foremost judged on their fundraising ability \nand their personal wealth rather than their merits as candidates. I \nthink most of us would agree that the democratic political system \nshould encourage individuals to run for elective office but that is not \nwhat our current system does.\n  If anything, the current system sends a message that political \ncampaigns are expressly reserved for the very few who have the ability \nto do what the current system requires of them to run an effective \ncampaign, and we all know it. The message we get is that if you cannot \nraise and spend millions of dollars, you are not really an effective or \nviable candidate.\n  If you are a powerful member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nas was my opponent in 1992, and you have the ability to raise nearly $6 \nmillion for a campaign, then the current system, of course, \naccommodates you. If you are independently wealthy and if you decide \nyou would like to use your wealth to run for elective office, as the \ncurrent trend seems to me, then the current system also accommodates \nyou.\n  If you are a schoolteacher and serve part time in the city council \nand decide you would like to run for the U.S. Senate, then the current \nsystem tells you that based on your income level, employment status, \nand other such factors, you are automatically a long-shot candidate. \nYour positions on the issues are at best secondary. Your experience as \na teacher and your record on the city council is secondary. Why? \nBecause you lack substantial campaign funds, or a war chest as it is \ncalled now, that will inhibit you from getting your message across to a \nstatewide electorate. This makes you a long shot, and the thought of \nnot running at all has to cross your mind.\n  This has to change. Unfortunately, despite the nearly universal \nagreement that something needs to be done to curtail campaign spending \nand improve the election process, time and time again Congress fails to \npass the needed legislation. So I offer this resolution today because \nthere needs to be, first of all, a clear statement that campaign \nfinance reform should be on the agenda for this Congress. It is not \neven mentioned, as I said before, in the Republican contract, and we \nneed to figure out a way to get it onto the agenda.\n  The only effort that has been made in the whole Congress this session \non campaign finance reform was to take away the campaign finance system \nwe have that has helped make Presidential elections more fair. \nThankfully, we defeated that effort, and we did it on a bipartisan \nvote. It is now time to refocus our efforts on fixing the congressional \nsystem and to find answers to a disturbing question. That is, how, Mr. \nPresident, can we expect ordinary Americans to run for elected office \nwhen the price tag is literally, literally millions of dollars and the \ncosts escalated at a rate of over 60 percent in the past 4 years?\n  I know recently there was a handshake between the Speaker of the \nother body and the President about a commission. I noticed there was no \nMember of this body who was a party to that agreement, so it did not \nterribly impress me in part for that reason. But the Speaker recently \njust backed off of that anyway, so let us not assume that any sort of \ncommission will even be created let alone believe that it will make a \ndifference.\n  There is no reason at all for this body not to move forward on this. \nWe cannot pretend that this is not a pressing problem, and we cannot \npretend that we do not know how to deal with it. Congress has to \ndemonstrate to the American people that it can act responsibly and \ndecisively and that it can approach this problem in a bipartisan \nmanner.\n  On another front, Mr. President, the set of figures recently released \nby the FEC gives us some telling data, surprising data. For example, \ncontributions by political action committees to all congressional \ncandidates back in 1990 totaled $149 million. Now, this went up \nslightly in 1992 to $178 million but stayed in 1994 at $178 million. \nSo, Mr. President, PAC contributions, even though many people would \nlike to see them eliminated, have been fairly level over the past three \nelection cycles.\n  On the other hand, and this is what really shocked me, contributions \nand loans from candidates themselves--in other words, those who \ncontribute to their own campaigns--increased at a rate of 37 percent \nfrom the 1992 level. So personal contributions to your own campaign is \nnow sort of the new growth industry in the area of campaign financing.\n  That means the greatest increase in campaign financing comes from \ncandidates that finance themselves. That translates into an electoral \nsystem tailored only for those who either have access to a large base \nof campaign contributors or another group, those who have the personal \nwealth and means to afford an expensive political campaign. Either way, \nagain, the schoolteacher that serves on the city council is becoming \nincreasingly less likely to have any chance at all of seeking this \noffice and attaining it.\n  Mr. President, not too long ago, I heard one of the candidates for \nPresident, the Senator from Texas, say something that I found kind of \nfascinating. Announcing his bid for the Republican nomination to the \nWhite House in 1996, the Senator from Texas stated that he had the most \nreliable friend you can have in American politics, and that is ready \nmoney.\n  There was a time when the most reliable friend you could have in \npolitics was a strong record on the issues, substantial grassroots \nsupport, or maybe even the endorsement of a large newspaper in your \nState. But a candidate for the Presidency has indicated that he may be \nthe best candidate in 1996 not because of his stance on the issues, not \nbecause of his popularity with the voters in his party, but because he \nhas the most money, or at least did at that time, of the eligible \ncandidates.\n  Those remarks are simply an accurate portrayal of what our election \nsystem has become. It is not so much about your stance on the issues or \nthe speeches you give on the campaign trail or even the countless \nvolunteers that the Senator from Minnesota and I remember so well from \nour campaigns who usually sit in unairconditioned offices all day \nstuffing envelopes for you.\n  Sadly enough, our election system has become all about money--who has \nit, who can raise the most, and who can spend the most. It is no longer \none person, one vote. It is more $1, one vote, or $1 million, 1 million \nvotes. \n\n[[Page S10360]]\n\n  I was a supporter last year of S. 3, the campaign finance reform \nbill, and that bill was filibustered. I did not believe that it was a \nperfect bill, but on balance I believe it represented a substantial \nimprovement over the current system and it clearly would have installed \na level of fairness back into our campaign system.\n  On the first day of the 104th Congress, I introduced S. 46, another \nattempt to try to reform our campaign system. I do not hold out any \nfalse hopes that my bill will become law in the near future. That is \nwhy I am certainly willing to compromise on this issue and to work with \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to write a bill that will \nsomehow get us off the road we are on of further protecting incumbents \nand encouraging multimillion dollar campaigns.\n  I do, however, in working with the Senator from Arizona, who has been \na tremendous partner in this issue, believe that certain principles \nhave to be included. A good bill has to provide incentives to keep \ncampaign spending down to a reasonable level, and it has to provide \nsome sort of assistance to legitimate but underfunded challengers, so \nthat our elections will indeed be competitive and fair. I also want to \nsee candidates raise more of their funds in their own home States \nrather than constantly crisscrossing the country looking for funding \nfrom the west to the east coast.\n  Mr. President, for the past several months, the Senate has been \ndiverting almost all of its attention to the Republican Contract With \nAmerica. This was the campaign that said, ``Put us in power and we will \nchange the way Washington does business.'' But it is disappointing \nagain that this subject has not really come up. How can you change \n``business as usual'' without suggesting that we need to change the \noutrageous degree of fundraising, the disproportionate influence of \nout-of-State special interests, and the lack of competitive challengers \nto well-placed incumbents?\n  Though it was not part of the contract, I know there are Members on \nthe other side of the aisle who truly are committed to comprehensive \ncampaign finance reform. And I continue to believe that we can have a \nbipartisan reform bill. In fact, Mr. President, just look at very \nrecent history. We have had statements by the Senator from Kentucky \nindicating:\n\n       The 102nd Congress is faced with many challenges, not the \n     least of which is ensuring the credibility of this \n     institution and the electoral process of our Nation. To that \n     end I [Senator McConnell], along with the Senate Republican \n     leader, Senator Dole . . . am introducing the Comprehensive \n     Campaign Finance Reform Act. This bill is the most sweeping \n     legislation ever put forth on this issue. [This reform act] \n     would restore integrity and competitiveness to our electoral \n     process while preserving constitutional rights and our 200-\n     year-old democratic freedoms.\n\n  That is from January 1991, by the Senator from Kentucky.\n  More recently, in January 1993, the now majority leader stated:\n\n       Just as Congress needs reforming, so, too, does the way in \n     which you are elected to Congress. And today, as we have done \n     before, Senate Republicans will be introducing legislation to \n     reform our campaign finance system. . . .\n       Again, this is an area in which I think we are going to \n     need bipartisan effort if we are to have a meaningful \n     campaign finance reform bill. . . .\n       So I hope that we can maybe impose some deadline--30, 60 \n     days--for Democrats and Republicans to work out a bipartisan \n     package.\n\n  The majority leader then went on to say:\n\n       If ever there was an issue that cried out for bipartisan \n     cooperation, it is campaign finance. Senator Boren of \n     Oklahoma and Senator McConnell of Kentucky are this Chamber's \n     acknowledged campaign finance reform experts. Perhaps if \n     Senator Mitchell and I gave them 30 days to get together and \n     hammer out a comprehensive reform proposal, they would \n     succeed.\n\n  And, finally, Mr. President, simply a copy of the front page of S. 7, \nwhich is the legislation by the majority leader and many other Members \non the other side of the aisle calling for Federal campaign finance \nreform.\n  So it is clear that the other side is on record in favor of doing \nthis.\n  Let me simply reserve the remainder of my time at this point and say \nthat this is the amendment which we worked, on a bipartisan basis, to \nput together that can at least start us on the real road to campaign \nfinance reform, not just a resolution, not just a commission, but a \ntrue bipartisan effort that I hope will bear fruit.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator has 6 minutes 8 \nseconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator--may I withhold?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the gentlemen yield 3 minutes to me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 20 minutes under \nthe unanimous-consent agreement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. OK.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself whatever time I may \nconsume.\n  While my friend from Florida is here, I want to talk about two \naspects of this situation. One is what just transpired that brought us \nto this time agreement. As my colleague from Florida knows, I served 12 \nyears in both the House and the Senate in the minority status. And one \nof the things that frustrated me enormously as a member of the minority \nwas that I was unable to get issues that were important to me and my \nconstituents before this body.\n  I will say that the previous majority leader on the other side of the \naisle, on numerous occasions I went to Senator Mitchell and said, \n``Senator Mitchell, I want a vote on this issue. I'll be glad to agree \nto a time agreement. I will be glad to have whatever parameters you \ndecide so as not to interfere with the functioning of this body.'' I \nwill tell you, Mr. President, Senator Mitchell always granted me that \nvote.\n  For us to start in with parliamentary maneuvering not allowing people \nwho have a reasonable amendment with an agreement for a reasonable time \nframe, I think is a betrayal, frankly, of what we were seeking over the \nlast 12 years in my experience in the minority. The Senator from \nWisconsin spent all day yesterday on the floor waiting to be \nrecognized. The Senator from Wisconsin was willing to have a reasonable \ntime agreement so he could get a simple sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nbefore this body with an up-or-down vote on it or a tabling motion.\n  Now, it seems to me--it seems to me--that if we are going to conduct \nbusiness around here with comity, if someone has a reasonable request--\na reasonable request--we should grant that request. Now, this was a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution about a strongly held view by the \nSenator from Wisconsin. And I hope in the future we can avoid this kind \nof thing and sit down and say, OK, what will the arrangements be? If \nnot today, next week or next month or even next year. But filling up \nthe tree with parliamentary maneuvering, I think, is beneath us.\n  I want to make one additional point, Mr. President, if I may. \nCampaign finance reform is something that the American people want. In \n1994 the American people said, ``We do not like the way you do business \nin Washington. We do not like the way you do business.'' And they also \nsaid, ``We do not like the way you get there.'' I know, that message \nwas clear. And I am confident, because I believe in representative \ngovernment, Mr. President, that sooner or later we will address this \nissue, because it is the will of the people. They do not like what is \ngoing on. Now we may make it worse, I do not know. I think we can make \nit better. But no average citizen in America believes that the system \nunder which we elect Presidents of the United States and the system \nunder which we elect representatives to Congress is a fair and \nequitable system, because of the role that money plays in these \ncampaigns.\n  If I could just, as an aside, say to my friend from Wisconsin--just \nan aside--if he is going to quote Republicans now, it would be fair if \nhe quoted the latest deal that people can have that the Democratic \nNational Committee gave if you want to have breakfast with the \nPresident or meetings with the President, all those good deals. Let us \nput some balance in this now. Let us not make it a partisan issue. \nThere are egregious activities on both sides on this issue.\n  But getting back to the fundamental point, I do not believe, Mr. \nPresident, that 1 or 2 or 5 or 10 Senators will be able to block the \nwill of the American people.\n  Now, what the Senator from Wisconsin and I are seeking to do is set \nforth \n\n[[Page S10361]]\na framework, which we will be introducing this week, for campaign \nfinance reform that has the fundamental elements that we believe are \nthe will of the American people. We want to engage in a debate. We \nwant--it is not a perfect document--we want to engage in the kind of \nconsensus building that will lead us to a fundamental reform of the \nsystem that most Americans think is broken. And I think we have that \nobligation. I would like to work with all of my colleagues and any of \nthem on this issue. But I greatly fear that unless we do this, unless \nwe embark on this very difficult effort, the American people will lose \nfurther confidence in us and their system of government and the way we \nselect our leaders, whether it be a Presidential campaign or any other.\n  So, I think it is an important issue, and I think the Senator from \nWisconsin had the right to see at least what the will of the Senate is \nhere. Maybe his motion will be tabled. I do not know. But the fact is \nthat we need to get about addressing this issue, and we proved in the \nlast few years that we cannot do it on a partisan basis. It has to be \non a nonpartisan basis.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and I want to thank whoever \nworked out the agreement for this time agreement and the tabling motion \nto give the Senator from Wisconsin an opportunity to get a vote on this \nissue as to what the will of the Senate is.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator from Arizona yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes; I will be glad to yield to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me, first of all, ask the question and say that I \nfully agree with the Senator from Arizona that it certainly would not \nbe accurate to assign to only one party the blame on this issue. In \nfact, in my comments I indicated that this thing went down last session \nnot just because of a Republican filibuster but also, I think, because \nof substantial Democratic opposition in the other body. That has to be \nsaid. There have been many different analyses of what happened on \nNovember 8, but I ask the Senator from Arizona if he does not think in \npart the problem of the Democrats had to do with the failure to reform \nthis system when they were in control?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree with my colleague on that. But I also think there \nis no doubt that on both sides of the aisle there was such a strong \npreference for the status quo that clearly the issue was not given the \npriority that it deserved, which I think was the primary reason for its \nfailure.\n I will say, it was a bipartisan failure as well.\n\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will take a moment of my time. I want \nto comment, in light of the comments of the Senator from Arizona. I \nhave only been here 2\\1/2\\ years, but I have never seen a greater \ndemonstration of bipartisanship and courage as I have seen on the part \nof the Senator from Arizona in his willingness to try to make sure a \nMember of the minority party and himself have an opportunity to raise \nan issue of this kind.\n  That is exactly the kind of conduct that the American people have \nbeen crying out for, and it has been a tremendous experience for me to \nknow that in this body, that people assume is so partisan, that these \nkinds of experiences do and can occur.\n  So I want to thank him at this point, and I look forward to working \nwith him on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Wisconsin yield the \nfloor?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I do yield and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of this amendment with the Senator from Wisconsin and the \nSenator from Arizona. As I understand the amendment, it really says \nnothing more than we should, during this Congress, take up this issue \nof campaign finance reform. It is an extremely reasonable amendment, \none I think that should engender the support of Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  A very good friend of mine who is going to be leaving the Senate, \nPaul Simon, wrote a book not too long ago, and I had a chance to read a \nrough draft. The first chapter was on campaign finance reform. I said \nto the Senator, ``That should have been the first chapter, because this \nis really the root issue.''\n  I think it is the root issue and really the root problem for several \nreasons. I only have 4 minutes today, but we will be coming back to \nthis over and over again, because I think we are going to insist on \nthis reform during this Congress.\n  First of all, it is a root issue, Mr. President, because I think, in \na way, this mix of money and politics, which really becomes the \nimperative of American politics, if you will, this money chase, it \nundercuts democracy and it undercuts democracy for two reasons.\n  First of all, it undercuts the very idea that each person in \nColorado, Minnesota, Washington, or Florida should count as one and no \nmore than one, because that is not really what is going on any longer \nto the extent that big money has such a dominant influence in politics.\n  Second of all, it undercuts democracy because it represents \ncorruption, but not the corruption of individual officeholders, but \nrather a more systemic type of corruption where too few people have too \nmuch wealth and power. That is what is skeptical, cynical about public \naffairs, and all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, have the \nstrongest possible self-interest in having your citizens really \nbelieving in politics and public affairs. But when people see this \ninfluence of money, they become very cynical.\n  Mr. President, it also has a lot to do, unfortunately, with \nrepresentation or lack of representation. I remember during the \ntelecommunications bill--and I am not trying to pick on any group of \npeople--but the reception room was packed with people. Some people just \nmarch on Washington every day, they are lobbyists or others, they \nrepresent a lot of big money, they make big campaign contributions.\n  I have to say, when we talk about low-income energy assistance, which \nI think we will be talking about, cuts in low-income energy assistance \nor nutrition programs for children, whatever, you never see that mix of \nmoney and politics. Those citizens are just as much citizens as any \ngroup of citizens having the same representation. I think something is \nterribly wrong.\n  So, Mr. President, I have introduced bills in the past, I have \nintroduced a bill this Congress, offered amendments, and have given \nenough speeches about the need for campaign finance reform. I say to \nthe Senator from Wisconsin, I am proud to be part of this effort. I \nthink we ought to pass this bill, and we ought to pass it this \nCongress. I think it is the strongest and most important thing we can \ndo.\n  I also have to tell you, Mr. President, that from my own point of \nview--Mr. President, how much more time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. May I intervene here to say to the Senator from \nMinnesota, if he will yield for a moment, the Senator from Arizona has \nsome additional time which he has indicated he will be willing to yield \nto the Senator from Minnesota, if the Senator wants more time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin. I think probably 5 \nminutes more will be fine.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 5 minutes \nof the time of the Senator from Arizona be given to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Minnesota has 5 minutes of the time of the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  I say to my colleague from Wisconsin, I view all of these reform \nefforts--the gift ban and lobbying disclosure, which we take up on \nMonday, and the campaign finance reform--to be just critical measures, \nbecause I think people have to believe in this process or they are not \ngoing to believe in the products of this process. \n\n[[Page S10362]]\n\n  I think people feel that politics has become a game they cannot play. \nI think people feel like this is a political process that does not \nrepresent them well. I think people feel like only a few people are \nwell represented in politics.\n  We have to make our political process more accountable, more honest, \nmore open, with more integrity, and I cannot think of a better way to \ndo it than to take strong action and pass a comprehensive gift ban and \nlobbying disclosure bill next week--I know we are going to have \nspirited, long, hard, tough debate about that--and, in addition, pass \nthis campaign finance reform bill sometime this Congress. Again, the \nonly thing this amendment says is we should take this up.\n  Mr. President, I will make one final point. I am now up for \nreelection. I was so hoping we could pass a campaign finance reform \nbill. I absolutely hate the system and the way in which we have to \nraise money. I think almost every single Senator does.\n  I said in Minnesota, and for several years, I will only raise $100; \nif nothing changed, I will have to raise money to run against other \npeople. With all the ads on TV, communications becomes the weapon of \nelectoral conflict and all of us end up having to do that.\n  But, quite frankly, all of us ought to get together in a bipartisan \nway once and for all to pass a reform bill that really would, I think, \nmake this political system operate in a much more effective way, not \njust for Democrats and not just for Republicans, but for all the people \nin this country. I think that is critically important.\n  We have gone through this debate before and, quite often, any time \nthere is any kind of campaign finance reform bill, people say, even if \nthere is a minimum amount of public money--maybe we can do without \nany--even if there is a minimum amount, people say this is food stamps \nfor politicians.\n  It is not. The elections do not belong to the politicians, they \nbelong to the people back in our States. I think the Senator from \nArizona is absolutely on the mark when he says that one of the strong \nmessages that has come from people--it came in the 1990 election in \nMinnesota; it came in the 1992 election the Senator from Wisconsin was \ninvolved in; and the 1994 election--is people want to see change, \npeople want to see reform.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that all of my colleagues will vote for \nthis amendment. This amendment just says we make a commitment to bring \nthis question up. We make a commitment, Democrats and Republicans \ntogether, to introduce a bill and to pass this legislation. I think \nthis amendment ought to receive 100 votes because, quite frankly, I \nthink that is the sacred trust we have of people in our country. They \nwant us to make this change. They want more democracy, not less. They \nwant more opportunities for people to run for office. They want more \nopenness in the political process. They yearn for a political process \nthey can believe in. What better thing could we do than to take up \ncampaign finance reform, along with gift ban and lobbying disclosure, \nand pass a reform bill of which all of us can be proud.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that I may be yielded such time \nas I may require, on the time of the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota. He \nand I have worked together on many issues. We sat down, as he \nindicated, in the beginning of this Congress and listed a couple of our \ntop priorities of what we would like to see happen here. At the very \ntop of the list was our shared belief that if there is anything that \nneeds to be changed in this country, it is the way we finance \ncampaigns. Three Members of this body, including the Senator from \nMinnesota, myself, and the Senator from Washington, Senator Murray, did \nget elected even though we were not Members of Congress and were not \npersonally wealthy. But we all know we are the exceptions to the rule.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. How does the Senator know that I am not personally \nwealthy?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I saw the recent reports on the Members of the Senate. \nYou were not high on the list. I regret to say that neither was I.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I stand corrected.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. We all had campaigns that people watched. Do you know \nwhy? Because we were not supposed to win, because of big money. Even \nthough we happen to be sitting here and it is a wonderful thing to have \nthis opportunity, there are thousands and thousands of Americans as \nwell qualified as any one of us who decided not to get into the fray \nbecause of the money, because of the absolutely daunting nature of the \namount of money that is required to run for the U.S. Senate.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I compliment the Senator on his amendment that comes \nbefore us today and for his perseverance on this critically important \ntopic of campaign finance reform.\n  Let me just say that I agree with you. We need more people running \nfor office in this country. We need the best and the brightest. It is \nindeed a sad note that people decide not to run, not to be here, simply \nbecause the daunting task of raising millions of dollars overwhelms \nthem. That is not, to me, what this country is about or what democracy \nis about.\n  Until we reform the campaign finance laws and level the playing \nfield, we are not going to get back to a point that allows everyone to \nbe here and to speak out on the important issues of the day. I commend \nthe Senator for the amendment, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator. As I look at Senator Murray and \nthe Senator from Minnesota, I know we were all serious candidates. But \nwe know that among the things that got attention were things like \nSenator Murray's tennis shoes and I had a blue van with an Elvis \nPresley ``endorsement.'' The Senator from Minnesota had a green bus. I \nthink those were fine and they had to do with a serious process that \nwas connected with it. I do not think it should be necessary for \nsomebody to just happen to hit the right moment and right sense of the \npeople in their State. We ought to be able to get our message out with \nfairness and equality.\n  As I look at the Senators, I want to compliment the Senator from \nWashington in helping us get this agreement. She is trying to get this \nappropriations bill approved. She is managing it for the Democratic \nside. We did want to get this on other bills, as we indicated. We \nthought there were perhaps slightly more appropriate vehicles, such as \nthe telecommunications bill. This is where you get the daunting nature \nof the task and the discouragement of candidates. If you look at the \ncontributions in the report of Common Cause on the telecommunications \nbill, among the levels of contributions to Members of this body from \ngroups involved with that bill, one Senator received $273,000. Many \nothers received in the one hundred ninety thousands and in the one \nhundred seventy thousands. There are over 20 people who got over \n$100,000 in campaign contributions in connection with that issue.\n  We thought that would be a good bill to do it on, but people urged us \nto let that bill alone. Now the regulatory reform bill--that is the one \non which I spent a lot of time here trying to attach it to. I heard one \nSenator in this body say that in the 23 years he has been here, he has \nnever seen the business community more unified on an issue. That is \nsort of good news and bad news. Of course, we all want to be \nprobusiness when we can, but when you have complete unanimity in the \nbusiness community, I think sometimes you have to take a look at the \nother side, and what people who might be affected by it would do. The \nreport of Public Citizen, again, shows enormous levels of \ncontributions, Senators receiving over $300,000 in contributions from \nthe interests in that issue, and many others in the $200,000 or \n$100,000 category. That is just an interest relating to that one \nparticular bill. So we decided to use this bill as a vehicle to make \nthis simple statement. I believe, Mr. President, that this is the \nbeginning.\n  People often say, what is the point of a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution? Well, what we are trying to do, as the Senator from Arizona \nknows, is to try to take the first step. You have to take \n\n[[Page S10363]]\nthe first step, which is to get everybody on record either for or \nagainst the concept of campaign finance reform. It is regrettable that \nwe are a quarter of the way through the 104th Congress and we have not \neven taken that first step.\n  But I hope today, when the tabling motion is made, that the Members \nconsider what the view of the people of this country is. I am confident \nthat whether you are Republican or Democrat, the American people are \ngenerally disgusted with the way these campaigns are financed. Perhaps \nthe California Senate race was the most extreme example. When you tell \nsomeone that a person spent $28 million of his own money trying to get \nelected to the U.S. Senate, they really wonder whether they have \nanything to do with the process at all anymore. How can they possibly \neven dream of running for the U.S. Senate if that is the kind of ante \nthat is required?\n  So, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Chair informs the Senator from Wisconsin that he has 2 minutes 55 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have listened to the debate on this issue. \nThe debate has not changed. I came to the conclusion years ago that we \nare never going to get campaign finance reform if we leave it up to the \ntwo parties, because there is always the case that the party in the \nmajority will obviously try to fix it to suit them and make it a little \nbetter for the majority than members of the minority.\n  That has been true in the past, and I assume it will be true today. \nIn fact, I suggested a number of times that we have a commission of \noutsiders with no ax to grind to take a look at campaign finance \nreform. I guess that is pretty much what Speaker Gingrich and President \nClinton suggested to each other up in New Hampshire.\n  In any event, it seems to me that with all the things we have yet to \ndo in this Congress, and certainly campaign finance reform is \nimportant, we have regulatory reform right now. It means a lot more to \nmost families than campaign finance reform. It costs each family about \n$6,000 per year, and we are about 2 votes short of getting 60 votes to \nmove on regulatory reform. It is much more important than campaign \nfinance reform. We are taking money out of someone's pocket. They may \nnot care a thing about politics and never contributed a nickel to \nanyone. We cannot do that, because we cannot get the votes on the other \nside.\n  We have welfare reform to take up. It will take a long time. I just \nsuggest that this may be a matter of great priority with a few Members \nof the Senate. It does affect all Members. We can all reach down and \nfind some horror stories.\n  In fact, we could go to the White House if we had $100,000--I think \nthat is the going rate to do business with the President--$100,000. \nThey have different packages for different people of different economic \ncircumstances. That does raise eyebrows, when people say, ``I have to \nsee the President. It is $100,000''--I guess that is per couple. That \nis only $50,000 apiece.\n  Maybe that is what the people have in mind here. I assume this would \napply to the executive branch as well as the Congress. There are \nexcesses. There are people who get elected without a lot of money. I am \nfinding out right now in the Presidential race, the worst part of the \njob is trying to raise the money. I do not ask people for money. I will \nnot call people. I will not make telephone calls. I do not like to do \nthat. I do not mind somebody else asking, but I do not like to ask.\n  In any event, this may have some merit, but with all the other things \nwe have on our plate, and with part of the August recess already \nslipping away, I know this says ``by the end of the 104th Congress,'' \nand it seems to me that it will be even more difficult next year \nbecause then we are in an election year, when everybody wants to be \ninvolved in politics, politics becomes the focus of a lot of people.\n  Mr. President I move to table the underlying amendment, No. 1803, and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 1803 \nis set aside until 2:30 p.m. today\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will just conclude, we are making some \nprogress. I think the American people are probably happy that now the \nlaws we impose on them also apply to Congress. We have done that this \nyear. That was a big step in the right direction. It probably means we \nwill not pass so many crazy laws because they now also apply to \nCongress.\n  On Monday, we will take up gift ban reform and lobbying reform. We \nwill overhaul that. We are also considering a constitutional amendment \nlater on this year to limit terms of Members of the House and the \nSenate.\n  It is not that we are not aware that some of these things, I think, \ncry out for action. We are addressing more, in this first year, than we \nhave addressed in the years past. We will continue to try to make \nimprovements, so that the American people understand that. But I think \nalso we need to keep our eye on the ball. A lot of these other issues \ndo not mean a great deal to the American people, too.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1805\n\n    (Purpose: To stop the practice of hiring elevator operators for \n                          automatic elevators)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1805.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 26, add at the end the following, ``The \n     account for the Office of Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper is \n     reduced by $10,000, provided that there shall be no new \n     elevator operators hired to operate automatic elevators.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this budget that is brought to the floor, I \nthink, deserves commendation of all of the Members. This is an \nextraordinary departure from past policies. It involves literally a 16-\npercent cut that the President had requested for funding for Congress, \nand virtually a 9-percent real cut, actually a little over that, 9.13-\npercent real cut, over what we spent in the past year.\n  I am not aware of any Congress that has taken such dramatic action in \nthe history of our country, to reduce its expenditures. Certainly in \nterms of dollars that have been cut from the budget, this has to be the \nall-time record winner. I think the distinguished chairman and the \nranking member deserve a great deal of credit for bringing this kind of \nproposal to the floor.\n  It reflects a sincere and real interest in coping with some of our \nproblems with regard to the budget. It does it in a very important way. \nIt does it by setting an example.\n  It not only talks about reducing spending, but it proposes a budget \nfor the Senate itself that reduces spending. That, I think, is the \ncritical key element, if we are to have credibility in trying to deal \nwith our budget problems. It is no secret to anyone here that this \ncountry has the biggest deficit of any nation in the world. It is no \nsecret here that this country has the biggest trade deficit of any \nnation in the world. It is no secret here that we have one of the \nlowest savings rates of any major industrialized country in the world.\n  The American people believe it is long past time we ought to face up \nto these problems. So this budget that is for the Senate itself sends \nan important message. It sends an important message, not because we are \nthe biggest part of Federal spending, it sends a very important message \nbecause we set an example. You cannot say one thing and do another, and \nthat is what has been the problem with so many past Congresses. They \ntalked about deficit reduction, but each year they increased spending \nand they increased spending on themselves. \n\n[[Page S10364]]\n\n  So I look at this budget with great admiration for the fine people \nwho spent long hours to try to find real savings, and they have done \nit.\n  There is one item that I think deserves attention and it is included \nin the amendment that I brought forward. It does not call for the \ndismissal of any elevator operators, but it does suggest that we should \nnot hire new ones. As elevator operators on the automatic elevators \nretire, this measure contemplates that we would not replace them. I \nthink it is important. Some will say, ``Oh, come on,'' but I believe it \nis very important because we have to set an example. If our efforts to \ndeal with the deficit are to have any credibility at all, we have to be \nwilling in our own House to set the example.\n  How do the American people respond when they hear we hire elevator \noperators to operate automatic elevators? I will tell you, real people \nthink it is nuts. Real people, who work for a living every day, real \npeople who have to pay the tax bills every day, think it is ludicrous \nfor us to have people push the buttons for us.\n  Over the years I have heard almost every kind of excuse for hiring \npatronage employees to operate the elevators. I must tell you, it is my \nperception the major reason this phenomenon occurs is, first, because \npeople did it in the past, and, second, because many of these positions \nare patronage.\n  Over the years, I have heard people talk about how critical it was to \nget here on time for votes and that having the elevator operators was a \nkey element in that. I have no doubt that the people who say that are \nsincere. I must tell you, I think it is bunk. If people want to get \nhere for votes on time, they come. We do not have elevator operators in \nthe office buildings. We do have elevator operators on the elevators \nreserved for Senators, and that may be a different question for a \ndifferent day. But those seem to operate just fine.\n  I have every confidence that every Member of the Senate is capable of \npushing the buttons to move the elevator from the bottom floor to the \nsecond floor in order to arrive here in time for votes. I have every \nconfidence they are able to push the button from the second floor, to \npush the B button to get down to the basement. To suggest Members of \nthis body cannot move through the elevators without elevator operators \non automatic elevators is absurd.\n  But more important, there is a very important point that Members \nshould consider with this. If we are not willing to eliminate elevator \noperators on automatic elevators, what kind of confidence can this \ncountry have if we are going to deal with $200 billion to $300 billion \ndeficits? What kind of belief can they have that we are going to stick \nwith a budget plan that lasts 7 years? If we are not willing to make \neven a modicum of effort to control spending in our own house, on an \nitem as frivolous as this, how can they believe that we intend to \nreduce the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars? The answer is \nthey will not. And the answer is, it is important Americans believe \nthat we have a new Government and new commitment and a new willingness \nto deal with problems.\n  Is this a small item? Of course it is. But the symbolism is terribly \nimportant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida, [Mr. Mack].\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the Senator from Colorado has gained a \ntremendous reputation over the years for his efforts to reduce Federal \nspending, and I compliment him on that. I was interested in his \ncomments about having ``every confidence that Members can push the \nbuttons on the automatic elevators.'' That was an unquestioned level of \nconfidence. It has been a long time since I have heard that level of \nconfidence in our colleagues. But I accept that comment.\n  I would say to the Senator, I am prepared to accept the amendment but \nit does, in fact, go counter to the approach that the committee has \ntaken with respect to reducing the expenditures of the Federal \nGovernment, particularly the Congress, the legislative branch. We had a \nvery significant request, if you will, or directive given to us, to \nreduce the legislative branch budget by over $200 million, which, in \nfact, we have accomplished with about $41,000 to spare. We accomplished \nthat, however, not by having the committee try to find every item \nthroughout the legislative branch that any of us, or either of us, \nthought was important to cut. I will say to my friend and colleague \nthat I think it is more important that we give a direction, or a \ndirective, to the individuals responsible for the various functions of \nthe legislative branch, indicating to them what we think they should do \nas far as a total is concerned, and ask them to, in essence, make the \nbest judgment about how to reach that goal. I believe with our having \ntaken that approach, we have been successful in our effort.\n  The Sergeant at Arms was given a directive of a reduction of 12.5 \npercent. The Sergeant at Arms came back with a little bit over 14 \npercent, and should be complimented for that achievement.\n  But as I indicated a moment ago, even though I have a different \napproach in bringing about significant reductions to the legislative \nbranch, I am prepared to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not note that \nour new Sergeant at Arms has done a very admirable job. He has already \ncut the number of elevator operators from 20 to 10, and saved over \n$118,000 in this fiscal year. So I would not want a moment to pass \nwithout recognizing what I think is a very dramatic change in policy by \nthe new Sergeant at Arms. I think this amendment will help affirm that \nvery significant effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? The Senator from \nWashington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I, too, will not object to accepting this \namendment. Let me just add, I concur with the manager of the amendment, \nSenator Mack, who I think has done an outstanding job working with the \ndifferent departments. The Sergeant at Arms did come back with a 14.5-\npercent cut. They are definitely going to be looking at how they can do \nthat in the coming months when we will see the effect of that. It is, I \nthink, difficult for us to micromanage them from this point, but I am \nwilling to accept this amendment.\n  Let me at this point say, in doing so, I also want to send my \ncompliments to our current elevator operators, whom I think many of us \ndo not take the time to say ``thank you'' to so often. They are always \nkind and courteous and efficient. I appreciate the fact that they find \nme in the crowds. I know that is not a problem that some of the other \nMembers have.\n  But they are always here, they are always smiling, they are on time. \nI think oftentimes when we have amendments like that, it is seen as a \nslam on some people who are doing a very efficient job, and, I think, \none that we do not say ``thank you'' for, often enough.\n  So let me take this opportunity to thank them for the job that they \ndo for all of us.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1805) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1806\n\n (Purpose: Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding war crimes in \n                              the Balkans)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask that it be modified to be put in \nthe form of an amendment to the pending bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1806.\n\n\n[[Page S10365]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following new section:\n       Sec.  . (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) war and human tragedy have reigned in the Balkans since \n     January 1991;\n       (2) the conflict has occasioned the most horrendous war \n     crimes since Nazi Germany and the Third Reich's death camps;\n       (3) these war crimes have been characterized by ``ethnic \n     cleansing'', summary executions, torture, forcible \n     displacement, massive and systematic rape, and attacks on \n     medical and relief personnel committed mostly by Bosnian Serb \n     military, para-military, and police forces;\n       (4) more than 200,000 people, mostly Bosnian Muslims, have \n     been killed or are missing, 2.2 million are refugees, and \n     another 1.8 million have been displaced in Bosnia;\n       (5) the final report of the Commission of Experts on War \n     Crimes in the Former Yugoslavia, submitted to the United \n     Nations Security Council on May 31, 1995, documents more than \n     3500 pages of detailed evidence of war crimes committed in \n     Bosnia;\n       (6) the decisions of the United Nations Security Council \n     have been disregarded with impunity;\n       (7) Bosnian Serb forces have hindered humanitarian and \n     relief efforts by the United Nations High Commissioner for \n     Refugees, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and \n     other relief efforts;\n       (8) Bosnian Serb forces have incessantly shelled relief \n     outposts, hospitals, and Bosnian population centers;\n       (9) the rampage of violence and suffering in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina continues unchecked and the Untied Nations and \n     NATO remain unable or willing to stop it; and\n       (10) the feeble reaction to the Bosnian tragedy is sending \n     a message to the world that barbaric warfare and inhumanity \n     is to be rewarded: Now, therefore, be it\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate hereby--\n       (1) condemns the war crimes and crimes against humanity \n     committed by all sides to the conflict in the Balkans, \n     particularly the Bosnian Serbs; and\n       (2) condemns the policies and actions of Bosnian Serb \n     President Radovan Karadzic and Bosnian Serb military \n     commander Ratko Mladic and urges the Special Prosecutor of \n     the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia \n     to expedite the review of evidence for their indictment for \n     such crimes.\n       (3) It is the sense of the Senate that the Special \n     Prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     Former Yugoslavia should investigate the recent and ongoing \n     violations of international humanitarian law in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina.\n       (4) The Senate urges the President to make all information, \n     including intelligence information, on war crimes and war \n     criminals available to the International Criminal Tribunal \n     for the Former Yugoslavia.\n       (5) It is the sense of the Senate that the President should \n     not terminate economic sanctions, or cooperate in the \n     termination of such sanctions, against the Governments of \n     Serbia and Montenegro unless and until the President \n     determines and certifies to Congress that President Slobodan \n     Milosovic of Serbia is cooperating fully with the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment is being offered so that \nthe Senate will have an opportunity to articulate a forceful \ncondemnation of the war crimes and crimes against humanity, committed \nby all sides in the conflict in the Balkans, particularly the Bosnian \nSerbs, so that the Senate will have an opportunity in the final \nanalysis to condemn the policies and actions of the Bosnian Serb \nPresident, Radovan Karadzic, and the Bosnian Serb military commander, \nRatko Mladic, and urge the special prosecutor in the International \nCriminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to expedite the review of \nevidence for their indictment for such crimes.\n  I had spoken on this subject generally on Tuesday evening following \nthe introduction of the resolution by our distinguished majority leader \ncalling for lifting the arms embargo so that the Bosnian Moslems may \nhave an opportunity to defend themselves.\n  I support the action of the majority leader in urging the adoption of \nthat resolution. It seems to me that the mission of the U.N. forces in \nBosnia has been a mission impossible when they are charged to keep the \npeace when there is no peace to keep. U.N. forces ought to be withdrawn \nso that they can no longer be held hostage and so that then the Bosnian \nMoslems may have an opportunity to defend themselves under article 51 \nof the U.N. Charter, and that there may be appropriate help from the \nUnited Nations, NATO, and the United States by way of massive \nairstrikes. But there has not been a condemnation of the action of the \nBosnian Serbs by this body, and I think that is very important.\n  The conduct of the Bosnian Serbs has been on a level of brutality and \ninhumanity which has been virtually unparalleled at least since World \nWar II, and the nations of the world have stood by and have watched \nthese atrocities and ethnic cleansing go on without a denunciation of \nthis kind of conduct.\n  Hopefully, the International Criminal Tribunal will ultimately bring \nto justice all of those involved up to and including the highest \nlevels. While the Western democracies articulate values of decency and \nhumanity, we have sat back and have watched this atrocious conduct \nunfold.\n  There is little left of dignity and honor or basic human dignity in \nwhat has gone on in Bosnia, and at the very minimum this conduct ought \nto be condemned in the most forceful possible terms, which is what this \nresolution calls for.\n  I have introduced it for that purpose and to speak briefly on some of \nthe underlying factors. I have told the managers of the bill that I \nwould not insist on a rollcall. There is no reason to take an \nadditional 20 minutes of the Senate's time to have what would most \nprobably be a unanimous vote.\n  However, these are matters which ought to be called to the attention \nof the American people and the people of the world as forcefully as \npossible. It is my hope that the President of the United States will \nspeak out on this subject, and that the President of the United States \nwill use the forcefulness of the bully pulpit of the White House to \nacquaint the American people with what is occurring.\n  We have seen confirmed reports of the Bosnian Serbs rounding up young \nmen, 11 and 12 years of age, and slitting their throats and placing \nthem in heaps. We have seen the photographs in the public press of \nyoung Moslem women from Bosnia going into the fields and hanging \nthemselves because that kind of suicide is preferable to the kind of \nbrutality which is being inflicted by the Bosnian Serbs. We have seen \nthe active reports from the safe havens of the United Nations which \nhave been invaded by the Bosnian Serbs, taking away elderly women, \ntaking away elderly men, committing the most atrocious kind of conduct.\n  I am not going to take a great deal of time here today, with the \npendency of the other legislation. But I would cite just a couple of \nexamples which are illustrative:\n  The Bosnian Serbs going to a Moslem victim and cutting off two \nfingers of each victim's hand so as to make the sign of the cross; and \nthen they cut the prisoner's nose and ears off; and finally cut their \nthroats, causing death.\n  Another example, a woman hiding in a barn with her husband and two \nyoung daughters, ages 13 and 7. Five Chetniks, Serbian paramilitaries, \nfind them, beckon the father over, and in the sight of his two young \ndaughters and wife, brutally murder him with a gun without his having \nuttered a word.\n  In the presence of an elderly woman, the husband is accosted by \nBosnian Serbs, as they were fleeing, slicing his throat right in front \nof her, causing death.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that examples be admitted into \nthe Record, without going through them in detail at this moment which \nchronicles and specifies the kinds of blatant atrocities which are \nbeing perpetrated by the Bosnian Serbs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Examples of War Crimes or Crimes Against Humanity in the Former \n                               Yugoslavia\n\n\n                               example 1\n\n       The Final Report of the Commission of Experts to \n     Investigate War Crimes in the Former Yugoslavia reveals the \n     existence of 150 mass graves containing between 5 and 3,000 \n     bodies and over 700 detention facilities in which, up until \n     March 1994, an estimated 500,000 persons were imprisoned, \n     murdered, tortured, and raped.\n       The estimated number of tortured persons is over 50,000.\n       The estimated number of raped women is over 20,000.\n\n[[Page S10366]]\n\n       The Serb policy of ethnic cleansing included total forceful \n     transfer of civilian populations from Serb controlled areas \n     in flagrant violation of international humanitarian law as \n     well as the destruction of public and private property, \n     including religious and cultural heritage.\n       All of the above constitute war crimes and crimes against \n     humanity and could even rise to the level of genocide.\n\n\n                               example 2\n\n       The camp commanders.--Zeljko Meakic:\n       A.

Held individually responsible for the crimes committed \n     by his close subordinates (deputies and shift commanders) and \n     by the guards who regularly and openly killed, raped, \n     tortured, beat and otherwise subjected prisoners to \n     conditions of constant humiliation, degradation, and fear of \n     death.\n       C. Personally beat the prisoners upon arrival with batons \n     and other weapons\n       D.

After one of the four \n     prisoners was beaten, two other prisoners were called on and \n     ordered by a member of the group to lick his buttocks and \n     genitals, and then to sexually mutilate him; one of the two \n     covered the prisoner's mouth to silence his screams, and the \n     other bit off the prisoner's testicle. This prisoner and two \n     other died from the attack; the fourth one, who was severely \n     injured, was thrown onto the back of a truck with the dead \n     and driven away.\n\n\n                               example 5\n\n       Most recently, in the wake of the fall of Srebrenica, there \n     are numerous accounts of new Serbian cruelty: throats slit, \n     women raped before women and children were packed on buses \n     for a mass ethnic deportation.\n       Twenty-year-old woman made her way into a grove of trees \n     near the refugee camp at night and hung herself.\n       Hundreds of men were reportedly killed by Serbs and \n     thousands taken away for investigation of ``possible war \n     crimes.''\n       One refugee reported that the buses carrying the Muslims \n     were stopped outside Srebrenica and Serbs took young men and \n     women off. ``They made us watch while they cut the men's \n     throats and raped the women.'' (New York Times, 15 July)\n                               example 6\n\n       In Potocari, where there was a U.N. base to which many \n     refugees fled, there were accounts of Bosnian Serb soldiers \n     coming into the factories were refugees where spending the \n     night.\n       ``They took some young boys with them, kids who were \n     probably between 12 and 17 years old. Later we heard \n     screaming outside. . . . On Wednesday morning we went \n     outside. . . . I saw seven of the boys with their throats \n     cut, and two others hanging from a tree.''\n       The same night, Serb soldiers reportedly abducted three \n     women, ages 12, 14, and 23. When the three returned several \n     hours later, they were naked and covered with scratches and \n     bruises, and the two youngest were bleeding from the assault. \n     At dawn, the 14 year-old ``slipped off to the side. She took \n     a scarf she had with her, tied it around her neck and hanged \n     herself from a beam.''\n       Wednesday morning, the Serbs ``took about 15 women. When \n     the women started to scream, the Chetniks [Serb soldiers] \n     covered their mouths and dragged them away. We left the \n     factory on buses a few hours later and by the time we left \n     none of the women had come back.''

(Gazette-Montreal, July 18, 1995)\n       Another U.N. official relayed the following account: ``One \n     woman told us that her husband was grabbed by the Bosnian \n     Serbs as they were fleeing Srebrenica and they slit his \n     throat right in front of her. She said she saw the bodies of \n     at least eight other men whose throats had also been cut.\n\n\n                               example 8\n\n       A report from the Bosnian War Crimes Commission in 1992 \n     claimed that since the beginning of the war, at least 260,000 \n     people had passed through concentration camps and prisons set \n     up by the Serbs while 10,000 people had been killed in them.\n\n\n                               example 9\n\n       The Report described the mutilation and torture of men, \n     women and children by Serbs: ``One account . . . claims that \n     Serbian fighters burned alive elderly people who refused to \n     leave their homes and forced mothers to drink the blood of \n     their murdered children.''

Ratko Mladic, \n     the commander of Serbian forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. \n     Mladic was the Yugoslav Army commander in the Serbian-\n     controlled area of Knin in Croatia before being transferred \n     to Bosnia to head army forces there. Following the army's \n     nominal withdrawal from Bosnia, he stayed on as Serbian \n     commander and was overheard on Serbian radio frequencies \n     disregarding subordinates who questioned artillery attacks on \n     the residential neighborhood of Velesice in Sarajevo because \n     of the number of Serbian residents there. ``Burn it all,'' \n     Mladic instructed his troops, ordering them to shell the area \n     with the heaviest weapons in the Serbian arsenal: 155-\n     millimeter howitzers. (The Nation, August 31, 1992)\n\n\n                               example 11\n\n       Zerina Hodzic's account of what happened to her husband is \n     typical: I was hiding in the barn with my husband Rifet age \n     35 and our two daughters ages 13 and 7. Five Chetniks Serbian \n     paramilitaries found us and pointed their index fingers at my \n     husband and beckoned him toward them. One of the Chetniks \n     shot him without ever having uttered a word.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. A summary, Mr. President, was contained in the final \nreport of the Commission of Experts to Investigate War Crimes in the \nFormer Yugoslavia. That report specifies the existence of some 150 mass \ngraves containing between 5,000 and 3,000 bodies each, and 700 \ndetention facilities where up to 300,000 persons were imprisoned, \nmurdered, tortured, and raped; with tortures estimated at some 50,000, \nand rapes estimated at some 20,000.\n  And I will further call attention, Mr. President, to the fact that in \nthe proceedings in the international criminal tribunal for the former \nYugoslavia, that Bosnian Serb commanders are being held responsible for \natrocities. In the case of two of the commanders, they were held \nresponsible for the acts of their subordinates, which gives rise to an \nexpectation that officials at the highest level may be held responsible \nin the International Criminal Tribunal.\n  Mr. President, it is a difficult matter as to how far the United \nStates and NATO can go in assisting the Bosnian Moslems. I have said on \nthis floor that I am opposed to the use of ground forces in that arena. \nIt is an open question as to whether other support can be given, such \nas heavy bombing, which could perhaps bring about a balance of power \nbetween the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Moslems, giving the Bosnian \nMoslems an opportunity to defend themselves. But there are a wide range \nof options.\n  I believe that if the people of this country understood the intensity \nof the barbarism which is going on, when you have acts like cutting off \nears and cutting off noses, slicing the throats of young boys, and have \nthe brutal conduct leading young women to hang themselves rather than \nbe subjected to the atrocities from the Bosnian Serbs, there might well \nbe a different public reaction. And there might well be a different \nleadership reaction if the President would speak out to the Nation as a \nwhole, using the force of his bully pulpit. Some people watch C-SPAN 2 \nand some people hear and see what we are doing. But it is too hard for \npeople to follow the atrocities that are occurring, too hard for people \nto follow the fine print in all the newspapers to see exactly what is \ngoing on. But if the people of America were aware of what is going on, \nI think there would be widespread public outrage, just as outrage has \nbeen expressed by this Senator and others on this Senate floor.\n  So it is minimal, but I think the least that we can do, to express \nour outrage and to have the voice of the Senate speak out in condemning \nthe action of the Bosnian Serbs, condemning the action of the Serbian \nPresident Radovan Karadzic and the Serbian military leader Slobodan \nMilosevic, and asking the special prosecutor of \n\n[[Page S10367]]\nthe tribunal to review the issue of indictment, that if we will not act \ndirectly in a military sense, that at least we will put those people on \nnotice that what they are doing will not be ignored, and will be \nsubject for criminal prosecution at a later date, by analogy to the \nNuremberg war trials. The day of reckoning may come, and those leaders \nand all those that can be identified will face the death penalty in a \ncourt of law for their acts of brutality in Bosnia today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I was unaware that the Senate did not yet \nissue a statement of the denunciation of these kinds of atrocities. I \nagree with him absolutely that it is time we did so.

Mr. President, if I may be allowed a moment or two to \nspeak personally, I would like to refer to events that took place in \nthe Senate yesterday and tie them back to my campaign, which is fast \nfading into memory, but some portions of which are pretty firmly etched \nin my memory as I am sure is the case with everyone here.\n  During the campaign, one of the issues that was raised continually by \nmy constituents was the issue of term limits, because they said they \nhad the feeling that the system was so unresponsive back here in \nWashington that something had to be done structurally to shake it up. \nKnowing a little bit about the Senate and the way it worked, I \nsuggested to some of my constituents that while we debated the overall \nissue of term limits, which probably will require a constitutional \namendment, there was something else that could be done quickly without \na constitutional amendment that could change the character and perhaps \nfree up the way things are done in the Senate. Specifically, I \nsuggested to my constituents that it would be a good thing if we \nlimited the terms of committee chairs in this body so that someone who \nassumed a committee chair would not assume the posture of divine right \nin that circumstance and then stay there forever and ever, dispensing \nwhatever favors or power goes along with that assignment.\n  My constituents liked that and indeed many of them said to me as they \ncame to me in the closing days of the campaign, ``We are going to vote \nfor you but we want your personal pledge when you get there you really \nwill work for significant change in the way business is done.''\n  Of course, as you do in a political campaign, when somebody says that \nto you, you say, ``Why, of course you have my pledge that I really will \nwork to see that that is done.''\n  When I arrived here in January of 1993 and suggested term limits for \ncommittee chairs, I found a very interesting circumstance. Among my \nfellow freshmen Senators, one of whom is on the floor here today, there \nwas great sympathy, there was great agreement: Yes, we need to limit \nterm limits, if you will, the time of committee chairs. Among the \nfreshmen Republicans, we had unanimity on that issue. But there were \nonly six of us. And we were told when you have been here a little \nlonger, when you understand how the system works a little better, you \nwill not be quite so zealous to call for the term limits of committee \nchairs.\n  Well, when I went back home, I found myself hoping people did not ask \nme, ``What have you done to carry out your campaign pledge to see to it \nthat there would be some structural reform in the way the Senate does \nits business?''\n  When I did get asked, I would say, ``I am trying.'' And then when \nthey pressed for details, I would say, ``Well, I am in concert with all \nmy fellow freshmen''--the\n Republican six, as we became finally, with the addition of Kay Bailey \nHutchison--``We are working hard.'' And my constituents would begin to \nget that look on their face that says, ``Yeah, we heard that before. \nYou're going to try to do something but, in fact, nothing is really \ngoing to change, and the longer you are back there, the more you are \ngoing to become part of the system and everything is going to stay the \nway it's always been.''\n\n  There was another election that took place. The distinguished \noccupant of the chair was part of that, and instead of 6 Republican \nfreshmen, all of a sudden we had 11 Republican freshmen. And added to \nthe 6, that gave us 17, which constituted a sufficient block of the \nRepublican conference that all of a sudden we were being listened to in \nways we had not been when there were just 6 of us.\n  Mr. President, as you well know, yesterday the Republicans had a \nmarathon session talking about the way things should be structured in \nthe Republican conference. And out of that session came an action which \nI applaud wholly; that is, the Republicans have agreed to term limit \nthe chairmanship of a Senate standing committee. I wish we could amend \nthe rules of the Senate itself so that it was written into the Senate \nrules and had the protection of the two-thirds requirement so that it \ncould not be altered, except by a subsequent vote of 67 Senators. I do \nnot think we can do that. I do not think the votes are on the floor to \ndo that.\n  But I can now, with a clear conscience and a smile on my face, say to \nmy constituents: ``I may not have been able to work successfully to \nchange the rules of the Senate, but I have joined with my colleagues in \nan effort, successfully, to term limit chairmen, at least those who are \nRepublicans.''\n  If I may be allowed a slightly partisan note, Mr. President, I hope \nthat will be the case for many years to come; that is, that all of the \nchairs of all of the committees will be Republicans for at least as \nlong as I serve in the body. In that case, our failure to change the \nSenate rules will not make any difference.\n  I think the Republican conference needs to be congratulated for \ntaking this step. It demonstrates a willingness to allow those of us \nwho are newcomers more of an opportunity to hold positions of \nresponsibility perhaps sooner than would otherwise be the case. It \nallows for fresh ideas and fresh approaches to come into the system \nmore openly than would have been the case if we had stayed with the old \nrule.\n  There is still much that I would like to do in the name of \ncongressional reform. If I could sit down and write the rules all by \nmyself, I would change a lot of the rules around here, and I have \nintroduced a bill to do that. At the moment, it has only attracted a \nsingle cosponsor. That is one of my fellow freshmen. Maybe I could work \nto get another 10 names or so on it, but I recognize the reality of \nthis place. It is going to take a little more time and maybe, Mr. \nPresident, another election or two before we start some of the \nfundamental restructuring of the Senate rules that I would like to see \nhappen.\n  But I am delighted that we have not waited for those elections to \ntake place and for that time to come. In the Republican conference, we \nhave moved with dispatch and, I may say, a large majority. I do not \nwant to leave the impression that the decision to term limit committee \nchairs was a close one and that those of us who are freshmen or \nsophomores had a difficult time winning a very narrow victory. As we \nmade our case, our more senior brethren, and on occasion sister or two, \ndecided we were right and the vote was not close. The vote was 38 to 15 \nsaying we will, in fact, recognize the call that is out there among the \nAmerican people to bring the procedures in this body up to date with \nmodern approaches and opening it up so that those who do not want to \nmake a full-time career out of service in the Senate but simply come \nhere for a term or two, will, in fact, still have the opportunity to \nreceive leadership assignments and represent their constituents in that \ncircumstance.\n  When people talk to me about the overall issue of term limits, I tell \nthem in my case, you do not have to worry about it. At my age, term \nlimits are built in. Some say to me, ``Well, look at the senior Senator \nfrom South Carolina. Maybe you will be here 20 or 30 years.'' If that \nis the case, I will be in my nineties, and I think I would rather \n\n[[Page S10368]]\ndo something else than serve in the Senate at that age.\n  So, Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of the Senate in \nallowing me to make this comment, allowing me, if you will, to crow a \nlittle to my constituents back home over the fact that we have taken \nthis first step that I did pledge to work toward while I was in the \nelection, and express my satisfaction and gratitude to my fellow \nmembers of the Republican conference for this decision.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10367-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10368-S10369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE 1994 ELECTION MANDATE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I sat presiding in the chair listening \nintently as the Senator from Utah talked about the mandate, as he \nunderstood it, when he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992.\n  As one who was elected 2 years later, in 1994, that mandate was not \nquite the same. It was interesting that those individuals who are \ntalking about term limits did not really address the fact that we have \na problem, in that we have the same leadership within each party in the \nU.S. Senate, as they were concerned about the term limits of \nindividuals serving in the House and in the Senate.\n  Maybe it is unique to my State of Oklahoma that we had such an \nintense interest in the fact that people should come here as citizens, \nserve for a period of time, and then go home and serve under the laws \nthat they passed. It seems as if the term limits debate has become very \nsilent now. I have decided that one reason is that they felt if we had \nsuch a turnover, as we had in both Houses of Congress this last time, \nmaybe people do not think that there is a need for term limitation \nanymore. But I saw a poll that was taken yesterday. I saw the poll that \nwas taken last week, and I was shocked to find out that 72 percent of \nthe American people have very strong feelings about limiting the terms \nin which Members of the House and Members of the Senate can serve.\n  I did not expect this because I have heard so many people around the \nbeltway--which is not really real America--say we do not need it \nanymore because we know now that we can flesh things out and get new \nblood.\n  I think that the poll, as it was interpreted, says that people like \nwhat happened on November 8, 1994, but they are not real sure that they \nwant to wait 20 years for the same thing to happen again. We are, \nindeed, better off to have people here who have been in the real world.\n  I got to thinking about the arguments, since I was the one who \nproposed term limits many, many years ago. When I was running for \noffice, I stated I would do everything I could--the same as the Senator \nfrom Utah said he would do everything he could--to see to it that the \nterms of leadership would be limited. I made that same commitment to \ncontinue the effort to limit terms.\n  I observed something when I was first elected to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. I have to say, Mr. President, that I am a truly \nblessed individual. I decided 35 years ago, when all my kids were grown \nand the runt of my litter was out of college and off doing her thing, \nthat I would do what I always wanted to do and run for Congress. That \nhappened in 1986.\n  When I arrived in Congress, I found something that shocked me. That \nis, that the prevailing ideas and mentality of those who are in power \nin Congress was totally alien to what people outside the beltway \nthought.\n  For example, I categorize the thinking of Congress, the majority of \nCongress who are making the decisions, who are setting the agenda, who \nare carrying on the debate, into four categories, what they really \nbelieve. First, in terms of crime, they really believed that punishment \nwas not a deterrent to crime. In the second area, they believed that \ngovernment, in concert with Congress, can run the lives of the people \nof America better than people could in the private sector. They believe \nthat the cold war is coming to an end. Of course, subsequently it was \nended, and therefore it is not necessary to put more money in our \nNation's defense. That money should go into social programs. They felt \nthat deficit spending is not bad public policy.\n  When we stop to think about those four areas, almost everything, at \nleast that this Member, former Member of the House experienced, found \nvery offensive, fell into one of those four categories. People felt, as \nfar as the deficit is concerned, they said, ``Well, we are all right on \nthe deficit. We are not concerned about that. After all, we owe it to \nourselves,'' without realizing everything we are spending today we are \nborrowing not from anyone who is here in this Chamber today or in the \ngallery, or even those who may be watching, but the future generations, \nsuch as my three grandchildren. They are the ones who will pay for all \nthis fun we are having up here.\n  Every time we try to cut some of the fat out of government, cut a \nsocial program, the people stand up with bleeding hearts and talk about \nhow can we do this to those poor people who need these programs. Right \nnow, we are in the middle of, and we are reminded that all we are \ntrying to do is take the profit out of illegitimacy, and get people \nmore responsible for their own acts.\n  Insofar as the defense is concerned, I am embarrassed to stand here \nand say we are operating with a budget right now that is less than the \nbudget that we are spending on social welfare programs, when we combine \nState and Federal programs. We are operating on a defense budget that \nis less than it was in 1980, when we had hollow forces, when we could \nnot afford spare parts. We all remember. It is all in the history. Yet, \nsome believe that the threat that is out there today is greater than \nthe threat that we were facing during the cold war.\n  At least during the cold war, Mr. President, we could identify who \nthe enemy was. There were two superpowers. So we knew who it was.\n  Right now, in accordance with comments made not by conservative \nRepublicans, like I am, but by Democrats, Jim Woolsey, who is the Chief \nSecurity Adviser to the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, \nsaid that we know there are between 20 and 25 nations that have \ndeveloped or are developing weapons of mass destruction. They are all \ndeveloping the means to deliver those weapons of mass destruction. We \nhave the Saddam Hussein's and the Qadhafi's, and those out there able \nand willing to buy technology that is on the market.\n  Here we are, with a group of people who really believe that there was \nnot any threat out there, when the vast majority of the people of \nAmerica who voted in the elections in November of 1994 said, ``Yes, we \nneed a strong national defense.''\n  Government and its relationship to our lives in 1987, when I first \ngot to the U.S. Congress, the majority of people in leadership really \nbelieved that the only thing wrong with America was we did not have \nenough government regulation. We needed more government regulation. \nWhen, in fact, that is exactly what is the problem.\n  Why did these individuals believe these things? They believed these \nthings because many of them had come straight from the fraternity house \nto Congress--never been out in the real world, never exposed to real \npeople. So they completely lost touch.\n  That is what precipitated what I refer to as the revolution of \nNovember 8, 1994, when we had the greatest turnover in contemporary \nhistory. People finally decided, whether they are Democrats or \nRepublicans, back in the real world, that they wanted to make major \nchanges in government as we know it.\n  Here we are with the reregulation bill that is right now kind of on \nhigh center. All we are trying to do is say to the people who voted in \nnew people in Congress, ``Yes, we heard you, loud and clear. We are \ngoing to get rid of this overregulated society.''\n  Someone on a radio talk show not long ago, in fact, the No. 1 radio \ntalk show in America, the host said if you want to compete with the \nJapanese, export our regulations to Japan and we will be competitive \nwith the Japanese. \n\n[[Page S10369]]\n\n  We truly are an overregulated society. I have told this story many \ntimes, people that I know back in my State of Oklahoma. A guy name \nKeith Carter, in Skiatook, OK, invented a spray that you put on horses, \nand apparently it works. Whatever it does, it must work, because he had \nfour employees, and a couple years ago they moved to a larger place \ndown the street from his house, still in Skiatook, OK. He called me up, \n4 days before Christmas--this was 2 years ago--and he said, \n``Congressman Inhofe''--at that time I was in the House of \nRepresentatives--he said, ``The EPA came along and put me out of \nbusiness.'' I said, ``What did you do wrong?''\n  ``When I moved down the street 2 years ago, I forgot to notify \nWashington and the EPA that I had moved.'' I said, ``You mean they did \nnot know where you were?'' He said, ``I notified the regional office, \nbut they did not tell Washington.''\n  So we got it taken care of. He called back a little later, and he \nsaid, ``I appreciate all you did for me, and you got me back in \nbusiness, but now I have another problem. I have $25,000 worth of \nbottled spray produced during the 2 weeks I was revoked that they say I \ncannot use.''\n  This is the type of overregulation we have in society today. I think \nthe re-regulation bill is going to come out. I think the people of \nAmerica will have to speak up again and let them know, let Members \nknow, that they are still interested in reducing the abusive role of \ngovernment as we have come to know it today.\n  Mr. President, term limits is a very real thing today, and just \nbecause we made some major turnovers does not mean that we should not \ncontinue the good thing that happened in 1994. A lot of people say, \n``Well, you cannot do that; you are taking away my constitutional right \nto vote for someone as I see fit.'' It was not very long ago when we \nhad to impose term limits on the President of the United States. And it \nhas worked very well since then.\n  We could use the same arguments. Well, you have taken away my right \nto vote for someone who has already served two complete terms. Almost \nevery State in the Union right now has term limits on its Governors. \nThe vast majority of the States that have the petition process, the \ninitiative process, were able to either vote in or through an \ninitiative and impose term limits on themselves. However, the U.S. \nSupreme Court came along and said, ``No, you cannot do that.'' So it \ncan only be done, to be effective and endure the future generations, is \nto do it with the constitutional amendment.\n  I intend to continue in that fight. I believe that the message is \nloud and clear. There are a lot of messages that came out of the \nelections.\n  I mentioned that the majority of people who had been operating \nwithout term limits and have been here since they graduated from \ncollege and did not have experience in the real world, that they \nhonestly did not believe that punishment was a deterrent to crime.\n  Senator Richard Shelby, from Alabama, and I introduced a bill that \nwould change our prison system and put the work requirements back in. \nPeople say, ``How cruel can you be, because these people are poor \nproducts of society, and it is not their fault they did something that \nis wrong.\n You should not be punishing them.''\n\n  There is an article, Mr. President, you ought to read. It was in last \nNovember's Readers Digest. It says, ``Why Must Our Prisons Be \nResorts?'' And it talks about the new golf courses that they are \nputting in next to the polo field, or next to the boccie courts. \nWhatever that is. And how we are going to have to take care of--they do \nnot even call them prisoners anymore in some prisons, they call them \nclients, because they do not want to offend them.\n  I may be old fashioned in my thinking. I think punishment has \ndeterred crime. I think history showed that. When we passed the soft-\non-crime bill, the omnibus crime bill of 1994, that was the midnight \nbasketball and dancing lessons and all that, the American people were \noffended by that and those individuals who voted for that bill, most of \nthem, were voted out of office in November 1994. It was just another \none of those areas where, if you had been inside the beltway listening \nto people around here, you forget what the real people at home are \nthinking. Because it is a different mentality here in Washington, DC.\n  I do not think that Oklahoma is unique in that respect. I will share \nan experience that will offend, I think, some of the people here. But \nit is something that happened to me.\n  The State of Oklahoma is, by registration, a very strong Democrat \nState. But the Democrats in the State of Oklahoma are very \nconservative. They are unlike the Democrats that we have here in \nWashington. I had an experience down in McCurtain County. McCurtain \nCounty in Oklahoma, Mr. President, is what we call severe little Dixie. \nThere are not any Republicans. They are all Democrats. I remember being \ndown there in the campaign and my opponent was an incumbent, the same \nas I was, an incumbent from the House, both running for the Senate, so \nwe each had records.\n  I remember someone standing up in a meeting of about 45 people in \nMcCurtain County. I was the only Republican who was in that room that \nday, including a New York Times reporter who was following me around. \nSomeone stood up in far southeastern Oklahoma, where there are not any \nRepublicans, and said ``Inhofe, you are going to be the first \nRepublican to carry McCurtain County since statehood, the State of \nOklahoma statehood in 1907.'' I said, ``Why is that?'' He said, \n``Because of the three G's.'' He said, ``God, gays, and guns.''\n  Let us look at what they were really saying. He said school prayer \nwas an issue in southeastern Oklahoma--school prayer, gays in the \nmilitary was an issue, and gun control was an issue. During deer \nseason, they closed schools. These are real people. These are not the \nkind of people you find around the beltway. And this gets right back to \nthe whole idea of term limits.\n  I really, honestly, believe in my heart that we would not have a lot \nof the problems that we have had since the 1960's about the role of \nGovernment in our lives, we would not have the huge deficits we find \nourselves with--if we do not change our spending behavior, a person who \nis born today is going to have to spend 82 percent of his or her \nlifetime income just to service Government. And this is what we are \ngoing to change.\n  So I believe the term limit debate is going to be revived again, even \nif I am the one who has to revive it, because I think the vast majority \nof Americans honestly and sincerely in their hearts believe that those \nof us in Congress should someday have to go out and make a living under \nthe laws we passed. The only way to ensure that is if we have \nlimitation of terms.\n  Early in this country's history it was not necessary. We had people \nwho came in and they could only afford to be here for a short period of \ntime. They did their patriotic duty and they went back and lived with \nthe laws they passed. I think that is exactly what is coming back to \nAmerica and it is going to serve my grandchildren and all of America \nvery well.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nproceed for 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10368-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10369-S10373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE REGULATORY REFORM BILL\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I want to give my colleagues a report on \nthe regulatory reform bill as I see it. As of last night, those of us \nwho were in favor of regulatory reform had presented a list of four \namendments which we were willing to concede to. In my judgment, they \nwent further than I would have liked to have gone. One dealt with that \nissue of least cost. In the current Dole-Johnston amendment, least cost \nis not the test. We have made that repeatedly clear. However, we have \noffered an alternative that is \n\n[[Page S10370]]\nframed in terms of the language that the opponents of regulatory reform \nwished, and we have heard nothing back from that, at this point, \ntogether with three other amendments we were willing to go along with.\n  As I understand it, those who are opposed to the Dole-Johnston \nproposal are urging people not to vote for cloture on the grounds that \nthere is this great negotiation going on that is getting close. If \nthere is such a negotiation going on, I am not aware of it. We are \nwaiting for an answer and not receiving one.\n  I do not know whether the majority leader is going to call for \nanother cloture vote or not. At this point, I must say, it appears we \ndo not have the votes for cloture, which means the regulatory reform \nbill will go down to defeat. The majority leader, of course, is in \ncharge of the schedule, but I am advised that is a busy schedule.\n  Unfortunately, there are members of the other party who would like \nthe issue of regulatory reform not to pass, to have the issue. There \nare Members on this side of the aisle, I think, who would like the \nissue for the opposite reason. And many of us are in the middle, who \nfervently believe we ought to have regulatory reform, that it is one of \nthe most wasteful operations of Government that we now have, that we \nhave an opportunity, really to do something important, something that \nwill really make sense out of the regulatory problems we have today.\n  I very strongly believe that. I have very strongly believed in \nregulatory reform for 2 years now, since the Senate initially passed, \nlast year, by a vote of 94 to 4, a risk-assessment proposal. Now, when \nwe are on the threshold of being able to get it done, unfortunately it \nappears it is going down the drain, mainly by arguments against the \nDole-Johnston bill which are simply not correct; some of which, by the \nadministration, are made disingenuously, in my view.\n  To say the test is least-cost under the Dole-Johnston bill is just \nnot true. It is there in very plain language, very plain language. \nNevertheless, I think we will probably, if I read the majority leader \ncorrectly, have another cloture vote; and failing in that, which I \nguess we will, it will be farewell to regulatory reform. That is a real \nshame. And I do not understand the opposition to this bill.\n  If there are amendments that need to be made, let us know about them. \nThere is nothing, nothing, zero, going on, in terms of trying to \nresolve this question. It looks as if it is a lost cause, and I regret \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I want to take this occasion to commend \nthe Senator from Louisiana for his leadership on this issue, and assure \nhim that this is one Senator who agrees. I do not want it held as an \nissue. I want it as an accomplishment.\n  I think we would all be better off if we went home and campaigned on \nour accomplishments than on our rhetoric and on our demagoguery on \nthese issues.\n  I know the Senator from Louisiana has labored long and hard on this \nissue. He has shown his usual patience. I served as a member of a \ncommittee which he chaired and discovered that patience in a variety of \ncircumstances.\n  I am grateful to him for his statement here today, and want to align \nmyself with his plea, for whatever we will do on my side of the aisle, \nto say let us not hold this as an issue, let us do the very best we can \nto bring it to a head, get cloture and get this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was interested. As the Senator from \nLouisiana began speaking he talked about speaking on behalf of those \nwho want regulatory reform. I do want to say I think the Senator from \nLouisiana is one of the best Members of the U.S. Senate, is one of the \nmost thoughtful, bright, and interesting Members of the U.S. Senate.\n  I will say to him, however, that I do not think there is a division \nin this body between those who want regulatory reform and those who do \nnot. I am someone who supports the Glenn-Chafee substitute. It is in my \njudgment a legitimate, serious substitute that will in and of itself \ncreate substantial regulatory reform.\n  So I really do not think this is a question of a group of people who \nwant things just the way they are, and who love the status quo with all \ncurrent regulations. It is not the case. Most Members of the Senate, I \nbelieve, feel very strongly that there are some Government regulations \nthat are silly, that are intrusive, that are totally inappropriate, and \nthat simply overwhelm for no good cause a lot of Americans who are \ntrying to run small businesses, or big business for that matter. We \nwant to change that.\n  But we also care very much about important, good regulations that \nwork. I know the Senator from Louisiana does as well. He has heard me \ndescribe before the circumstances with respect to the Clean Air Act. \nThe Senator was describing the other day circumstances in which I \nbelieve it was EPA was describing the kind of approaches here on \nregulations as a result of popular public opinion or public opinion \npolls. I understood what the Senator was saying.\n  On the other hand, in the 1970's America woke up and decided as a \nresult of a new consciousness with Earth Day and other things that we \ncannot keep spoiling the nest we are living in, that we have to stop \npolluting the air and start cleaning the air, that we have to stop \npolluting the water and start cleaning our water. If that was the \npublic will, I applaud EPA, and others, and applaud the Congress for \nsaying this is the public will, to let us decide to hitch up and do it.\n  Twenty years later, as the Senator from Louisiana well knows, we now \nuse twice as much energy in America and have cleaner air. Is it perfect \nair? No. We still have some air quality problems. But instead of the \ndoomsday scenario that a lot of folks felt we were heading toward with \ncontinually degrading our airshed, we have over the last 20 years, even \nas we have substantially increased our use of energy, cleaned America's \nair. We have cleaner air and less smog. I happen to feel very proud of \nthat. I think that is an enormous success story.\n  Not many people even know it. No one will talk about it, because \nsuccess does not sell. Failure and scandal sells. Success does not. We \nhave fewer problems with acid rain. We have cleaner rivers, cleaner \nstreams and cleaner lakes in America now than we had 20 years ago. That \nis quite a remarkable accomplishment and achievement once our country \ndecided we were going to do things the right way. I am enormously proud \nof that.\n  I just do not think under any condition we want to retreat on those \nfundamental principles. We are fighting for clean air, we are fighting \nfor clean water, and we are fighting to maintain a safe food supply. \nAll of those things are important.\n  I join the Senator in his concern about trying to streamline \nregulations with regulatory reform. The desire for regulatory reform, I \nthink, is shared by virtually every Member of this body. The division \nat the moment is a division between those of us who want to do this in \nthe manner described in the Glenn-Chafee substitute versus those who \nwant to do it in the manner described in the Dole-Johnston substitute.\n  I just took the floor in order to say that I think there is a uniform \ndesire here to do the right thing with respect to regulations. We do \nnot in any event want to roll back the regulations that have allowed us \nto achieve significant victories in the last 20 years with respect to \nclean air, clean water, and safe food. That is what I think the real \ndebate is about.\n  So I appreciate the thoughts of the Senator from Louisiana. I wanted \nto rise to make that point.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I will stand corrected--this is not \nagainst those who are against the bill as opposed to those who are for \nit. I think the Senator from North Dakota correctly states that it is \nthose who are for the Glenn-Chafee bill and those who are for Dole-\nJohnston bill. The difference is that many of us regard the Glenn-\nChafee bill as being a permissive bill; that is, it permits the \nagencies to engage in regulatory reform but it does not require them to \ndo so. Whereas, \n\n[[Page S10371]]\nDole-Johnston does. We are operating under an Executive order now that \non its face requires it, but actually does not require it. And if we \nare talking about a permissive kind of bill, in my view, that is what \nwe have now.\n  To be sure, it has resulted in great advances forward. Look, all of \nthe laws for which we voted--I voted for all of these, the Clean Air \nAct, the Clean Water Act, et cetera--have made some great advances. And \nif you want to keep the present status quo, I would say the thing to do \nis vote for Glenn-Chafee. Glenn-Chafee will not pass, in my view. I \njust think it is unfortunate that this is being painted as an ongoing \nnegotiation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. It is the last comment previously made on the floor that \nhelped bring me to the floor, and I thank my friend from North Dakota \nfor already responding to some degree, and I know the Senator from Ohio \nis now here. Let me just respond to that.\n  We are perfectly prepared to sit down, and we have been on an ongoing \nbasis. Yesterday afternoon, I believe, I got in written form a response \nto the most recent suggestions that we made with respect to the bill. \nThe principal sponsor of the bill is on the floor now. I know he will \nsay that he is not stuck in the mud or cement or anything with respect \nto the fact that the Glenn-Chafee bill in and of itself, in its \nentirety, is somehow presumed to be the only vehicle to pass. We \nunderstand that full well. Nor are we in a position that is embracing a \nno-bill strategy. We have a lot of folks on our side of the aisle, \nmyself included, who would like to vote for regulatory reform, number \none, and who are prepared--in fact, more than prepared --we are already \nagreed in our negotiations to arrive at new decisional criteria.\n  There are some outside who do not want that. But we have agreed that \ncost evaluation and risk assessment are appropriate things in a modern \nsociety to do to make a judgment about whether or not you are spending \nmore money than the benefit you are getting.\n  The problems that remain, however, are significant. When you have 48 \nSenators, obviously going to diminish by 1, 2, 3--we all understand how \nit works around here. But when you have a sufficient number of Senators \nstill saying this bill is a problem, and much more importantly, I say \nto my friend, when you have the President of the United States and his \nfull Cabinet saying in its current form this bill will be vetoed, then \nthere ought to be a legitimate effort here by all of us to legislate in \na way that precludes that veto or try to reach a reasonableness where \nthe best effort has been made to do so.\n  With all due respect, we still have a problem where we are still \nfighting and the Senator knows what it is about. It is about these 88 \ndifferent standards, new standards for litigation, and the fact we do \nnot feel we have sufficiently made this a bill which will, indeed, be \nreform. Our fear is that this bill in its current form is going to \nresult in the agency being so swamped with petitions and having to \nrespond to so much judicial review that they simply cannot do what they \nwere intended to do, which is protect the health, the safety, and the \nenvironmental concerns of Americans.\n  Now, I do not know how many times we have to say it. There are stupid \nagency rules in existence. I am confident that people of good faith can \nsit down and identify them. There are excesses where agencies have even \nreached beyond the stated intent of a statute.\n  That is not what we are here to do. I am confident if we sit down \nfurther and continue to be able to try to reach somewhere between what \nSenator Glenn and Senator Chafee have put forward and what the Dole-\nJohnston bill represents, there ought to be a meeting of the minds.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator will yield, we submitted four major \nproposals and have asked can we clear those. Every time there is an \nargument--yesterday we had an argument about whether this is least \ncost. My friend from Michigan said no because there is this word \n``nonquantifiable.'' I said, ``I have an amendment here to take it out. \nWould you permit me to do so?\"\n  ``Not now.''\n  Then there were other speeches back to back. We could not take it \nout. Now, we offered four amendments yesterday which I thought were \nagreeable amendments. Can we at least have agreement to take those out, \nto try to improve the bill on matters that we agree on, does not seem \nto be possible.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my friend----\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has the time.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I will yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. I was surprised in my office to hear practically the death \nknell being rung over our efforts to get regulatory reform. The Senator \nis aware that he sent us a fax last night, and we are working out the \nanswer to that. Meanwhile, each one of the cloture votes that we have \nhad have allowed us to make some progress. We have made a lot of \nprogress on this regulatory reform bill. They have offered to \nsubstitute ``least cost'' for ``greater net benefits''--this is an \nimprovement and if we can write it up properly, we may be able to agree \nto their proposal. ``Net benefits'', as I understand it, is in the \nExecutive order language. They want to use that language in the \ndecisional criteria, and we are willing to consider their proposals. We \nare making progress.\n  We have also made progress on litigation opportunities and judicial \nreview, as I understand it. I believe we agree that the final rule will \nbe what is challengeable. We do still have a problem with the many new \npetition process. We are working on that. I think the Senator from \nLouisiana agreed a couple days ago at least on reasonable alternatives. \nWhere it says ``reasonable alternatives,'' I believe his suggestion is \nto limit those alternatives that the agency has to consider to three or \nfour. This is a major issue. We have not all agreed on that yet, but I \nthink we can make major steps forward.\n  Now, on automatic repeal of a schedule for some rules, I think we are \npretty close on that. We still do not agree on a third area, though--on \nspecial interests, such as including the toxics release inventory in \nthis bill.\n  That is a major concern. We have made substantial progress in a \nnumber of areas here, and we have three or four more to go. But the \nSenator from Louisiana states that we have not gotten back with an \nanswer yet to a proposal last evening. I am sure the Senator from \nLouisiana will agree this is very complex legislation. We have been \nworking on it all morning and are going to meet on it this afternoon.\n  So I hope we still continue in good-faith negotiations. I think we \nhave made a lot of progress, and this is probably as complex a bill and \nas far-reaching for every man, woman and child in this country as \nanything we will consider in this Congress.\n  I think we are making progress here. We are about to go to a meeting \nwhere we are going to talk about some of these very complex issues. We \nare supposed to meet at 2:15. And we are negotiating in good faith. I \ncertainly do not read into our processes here anything except good \nfaith on both sides.\n  So I was a little bit surprised to hear the doom and gloom that I \nheard in my office a little while ago, and that is the reason I came \nover to the floor. I think we are making good progress on this. There \nare a number of areas that I think we can agree on, and I hope we can \nhave more before the afternoon is over.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I wish I could share the optimism of my \nfriend from Ohio. He and the Senator from Massachusetts are both my \ngood friends. I have great respect for their good faith, for their \nsagacity in all of these matters. But, Mr. President, it was my \nunderstanding that today we were going to have our final cloture vote \nand nothing seems to be happening. It seems, at least it is my view, \nthat the requests for amendments are in sort of an expanding file; you \nget one and you agree to it, and then 2 or 3 days later it comes back \nto you as a criticism of the bill because somehow you did it wrong.\n  It is a complicated bill. It is not that complicated. It is fairly \nstraightforward. Some of these four amendments were strike amendments, \nto \n\n[[Page S10372]]\nstrike provisions that people disagreed with. Now, we ought to do that. \nWe ought to say, ``I ask unanimous consent that we strike this.'' We \ncannot get agreement even to strike the language that is used against \nus. And the reason is I think because it improves the bill and helps \nget toward cloture.\n  I hope that there is hope, but I do not share that hope.\n  When it comes down to the final vote, whenever that is, and this bill \ngoes down, there will be those who say, ``Oh, we were so close.'' I, \nfor one, would just like to say I do not believe we are that close. To \nsay that there are 88 ways to appeal or to attack on appeal, using that \nlogic there are billions of ways because there is only one appeal and \none standard for appeal. That is, is the final agency action arbitrary \nand capricious?\n  Now, you can use an unlimited number of arguments making sense or not \nmaking sense, but those 88 standards are not standards for appeal. They \nare simply things that somebody can argue. Why not make it 1,000? It is \nlimitless what you can argue to a court. There is no limit. But there \nis one standard: Was the final agency action arbitrary and capricious?\n  That is the standard--only one--and only one appeal.\n  This came out of the Justice Department. They produced this long list \nof 88. If that is the kind of logic that we have to face from the \nJustice Department, there is no hope on this bill, because it defies \nlogic. One appeal and one standard.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me just answer my friend, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. This is an example of how close but in a sense how far \nbecause the 88 standards that are here are not currently in the law. In \nthe current law for rulemaking there is one page that describes what an \nagency has to do to make a rule.\n  You talk about what this grassroots revolution is all about in an \neffort to kind of get the process closer to America and less \ngovernment; one page is the current law.\n This bill creates 66 new pages of requirements. That is more \nGovernment.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. KERRY. I would like to finish the point. I will be happy to yield \nfor a question on that, sure.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes. I was going to say in the Glenn-Chafee amendment, \ndoes it not also have standards? If so, how many new standards?\n  Mr. KERRY. It does not have the same structure, no. It leaves \ndiscretion to the agency. It does not create 66 new pages of exactly \nhow the rulemaking is going to take place. Let me be more precise to my \nfriend. The struggle we are having is over a couple of words which will \nclarify the stated intent of the Senator from Louisiana, but not the \nwritten intent. The stated intent of the Senator from Louisiana was \naccurately just portrayed. And I agree with him.\n  The Senator just said, ``All you can do is make a judgment about the \nfinal rule as to whether or not the final rule is arbitrary and \ncapricious.'' I agree with him. That is the standard we want. That is \nwhat he says he wants. That is what he says the bill does. We disagree. \nWe believe that because of the lack of clarification in one paragraph \nthat in fact the Senator inadvertently is opening up all of the \nprocedural standards to review. If we will simply make clear in the \ntext with the language we have sought that it is indeed as he says, not \nas to the procedure, but exclusively as to the final rule only, without \nregard to the procedure except as it fits into the whole record, we \nwill solve that problem.\n  Now, I ask the President or anybody listening if that really sounds \nso unreasonable. And the problem is that every time we get to the point \nof saying, ``Why cannot we codify your intent,'' we run into a stone \nwall. So it makes us feel, ``Well, gee whiz, if we cannot codify with \nspecificity the stated intent, which does not serve us anything when \nyou go to court afterwards, something is wrong here.''\n  Now, I say to my friend, he is a very good lawyer. He knows exactly \nwhat will happen. If you go to page 52, line 4, paragraph 633, there is \na requirement here: The agency must use the best reasonably available \nscientific data and scientific understanding. If a claimant wants to \ncome in with a good lawyer and say the agency did not use the best \nreasonably available scientific data, and therefore their decision was \narbitrary and capricious, you have opened up each procedural section \nhere to that kind of individual appeal.\n  And, in addition to that, you have procedural requirements that \namount to that. All we are saying is if you do not intend each of these \nsubsections to become the basis of that appeal, let us just say it. If \nwe say it, we have solved our problem.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Well, Mr. President, if I may reply to that, what we \nintend, what we say very clearly, is that it is the final agency action \nthat is judged by the standard of arbitrary and capricious, that the \nrisk assessment and the cost-benefit analysis will be part of the \nrecord. And that any violations may be used solely--we use the word \n``solely'' advisedly to determine whether that final agency action is \narbitrary and capricious.\n  Now, the standard that the Senator just read, did you use the best \nscience, may or may not bear on the question of the final rule being \narbitrary and capricious. If it is one of these rules where the issue \nis the quality of the science, and if they did not use proper science, \nbut rather subjected the American public to billions of dollars in \nregulation, which flies in the face of good science, then, yes, that \nviolation could be conceivably arbitrary and capricious, make the final \nagency action arbitrary and capricious. In most instances, it would not \nbe.\n  But the very idea of having risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis \nis to find out what the cost is and to make the agency focus on science \nand use good science. Because, Mr. President, the reason I brought up \nrisk assessment almost 2 years ago was that I found, in the committee I \nchaired at that time, that they were not using good science, that they \nwere ignoring their own scientists, that they did not have the foggiest \nnotion what the regulations were going to cost.\n  In one particular case, it was $2.3 billion dealing with a \nnonexistent risk, and they did not know what it was going to cost. They \nhad ignored their own scientists. Now, that goes on--not every day, not \nin every regulation. And, yes, we make some great progress on a lot of \nthese environmental laws. And I voted for virtually every one.\n  But do not ever think, Mr. President, because the air is cleaner and \nthe water is cleaner and all of that, that there are not great excesses \nin our environmental regulation system. If you just want to make it \npermissive, you know, say these are good employees of the Government \nand they are doing their job well and the air is cleaner, well, that is \nfine. If that is what you believe, then you know, business as usual is \ngood. It is making progress in one sense.\n  I do not believe that is so, Mr. President. I think I can prove it. I \nthink I have proven it.\n  Mr. KERRY. I do not disagree with what the Senator just said. But he \ndid not in effect answer the problem that I posed. Now we have language \nthat we have given to the Senator. The Senator has accepted one form of \nlanguage, but the Justice Department tells us that we have not cured \nthe problem we are talking about. We have given him new language which \nwe think cures it.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. What is the new language that is----\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me point to another kind of problem just to kind of \narticulate, I think, the good faith with which we are framing some of \nthese issues. There is a rulemaking petition process. I have agreed, \nSenator Glenn has agreed, and Senator Levin has agreed that all of us \nthink any American entity, a corporation, some kind of environmental \ngroup, that feels aggrieved by a decision ought to have some means of \nredress for that sense of grievance. They ought to be able to come into \nthe agency and say, ``Hey, wait a minute. This is a crazy rule. We want \nyou to be able to review this rule.''\n  We agree with that. I am sure most of us would say that is \nreasonable. We do not want Americans running around, companies or \nindividuals, feeling as if there is no path to a legitimate review.\n  What we do not want, Mr. President, is an unlimited Pandora's box for \ngaming the system, where one company \n\n[[Page S10373]]\ncan come in and bring a petition, then their cohort friend company \ncould come in and bring a petition, then another company associated in \nthe same industry but not the same could come in and bring a petition. \nUnder the requirements of the bill--I say to my friend in the chair and \nothers--this is not going to reduce Government. This is not going to \nstreamline the agency process. This is not going to lift the burden of \nregulation. It is going to create far more gridlock than we have had \nbefore because you are going to take a fixed number of employees with a \nshrinking budget, give them greater responsibility to answer petitions, \ngreater responsibility to go to court, to the judiciary, greater \nresponsibility to do risk assessment, greater responsibility to do cost \nevaluation. And there will be less people to do it.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. KERRY. This is an unfunded mandate. My friend from Ohio said \nthis: ``This is the mother of all unfunded mandates.''\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, if my friend will yield, I have two \nquestions. First of all, I have not seen the judicial review language. \nIf it has been done, there may be some progress.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the problem with this is, we are trying to \nwrite one of the most complicated pieces of legislation in none of the \ncommittees to which the jurisdiction falls. The committee to which the \njurisdiction fell was the Governmental Affairs Committee. They sent us \nthe Glenn-Roth bill at the time. It came out to us 15 to 0. So we did \nhave a bipartisan consensus about how to approach this.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Not on the Glenn-Chafee bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. No, not Glenn-Chafee. I said Glenn-Roth. I said Glenn-\nRoth. And the only change between Glenn-Roth and Glenn-Chafee, I \nbelieve fundamentally, is the fact that the sunset is out and there is \na minor change or two. But the other committee, the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee that has jurisdiction, was completely bypassed. \nThe Judiciary Committee, as everybody knows from the report, barely had \nan opportunity to legislate.\n  Now, what did we get? We got a bill written in back rooms, \ncloakrooms--who knows where--offices. It comes to the floor, and now we \nare trying to write legislation. So it is difficult when you are \nweighing the impact of each of these words to do it in an afternoon, \nwith a Whitewater hearing and a Bosnia debate and all the other \nmeetings that we go to. It is not a question of bad faith.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let us look at the rulemaking petition process. Here is \nwhat it says:\n\n       Each agency shall give an interested person the right to \n     petition.\n\n  So we are opening up to everybody in America the right to petition.\n\n       For the issuance, amendment or repeal of a rule, for the \n     amendment or repeal of an interpretive rule or general \n     statement of policy or guidance, and for an interpretation \n     regarding the meaning of a rule, interpretive rule, general \n     statement of policy or guidance.\n\n  There are 14 different things that somebody can come in and just \npetition, ``I want this changed.''\n\n       The agency is then required to grant or deny a petition and \n     give written notice of its determination to the petitioner \n     with reasonable promptness but, in no event, later than 18 \n     months afterwards.\n\n  So all of these requests could come in. You have a fixed period of \ntime to provide the answer. You have no additional personnel to do it.\n\n       The written notice of the agency's determination will \n     include an explanation of the determination and a response--\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10369-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10373-S10386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n               Vote on Motion to Table Amendment No. 1803\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I had earlier offered a second-degree \n\n[[Page S10374]]\n  amendment which listed a variety of issues that the new Republican \nmajority feels should be addressed in this Congress. Then there was a \nmotion made to table the underlying Feingold amendment, which was \ndefeated.\n  I point out there were 41 votes in favor of the motion to table, \ntherefore against the Feingold amendment. I think it is reasonable to \nassume that, if there were an effort to force this Democratic agenda \nitem onto this----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. The Senate will be \nin order.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think it is reasonable to assume, \ngiven the outcome of the Feingold sense-of-the-Senate resolution, that \nany effort to, essentially, muscle this Democratic agenda item onto the \nRepublican Senate would likely be greeted with a filibuster. But of \ncourse that was just a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I suppose people \ncan read into it whatever they choose.\n  The second-degree that the Republican leader has forwarded to the \ndesk simply adds campaign finance to the whole litany of other issues. \nIt listed a whole variety of things the Senate ought to be addressing \nand simply adds campaign finance to it. Those who feel campaign finance \nought to be on the agenda of the 104th Congress surely ought to have no \nobjection to the amendment now before us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? The Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1854, the \nlegislative branch appropriations bill for fiscal year 1996.\n  The bill, as reported provides $2.1 billion in new budget authority \nand $2 billion in outlays for the Congress and other legislative branch \nagencies, including the Library of Congress, the General Accounting \nOffice, and the Government Printing Office, among others.\n  When outlays from prior year appropriations and other adjustments are \ntaken into account, the bill totals $2.2 billion in budget authority \nand $2.3 billion in outlays. The bill is under the subcommittee's \n602(b) allocation by $38 million in budget authority and less than \n$500,000 in outlays.\n  I want to commend the distinguished chairman and ranking member of \nthe legislative branch subcommittee for producing a bill that is \nsubstantially within their 602(b) allocation.\n  I am pleased that this bill incorporates most of the changes endorsed \nby the Republican Conference last December and achieves the goal of \nreducing legislative branch spending by $200 million from the 1995 \nlevel. It is important that the Congress set an example for the rest of \nthe country by cutting its own spending first.\n  Another important feature of this bill is that it provides an \nincrease of $2.6 million over the 1995 level for the Congressional \nBudget Office to enable that agency to meet the new requirements that \nwere created in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act passed earlier this \nyear.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this bill and to avoid offering amendment \nwhich would cause the subcommittee to violate its 602(b) allocation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table relating to spending totals be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                     LEGISLATIVE BRANCH SUBCOMMITTEE                    \n [Spending totals--Senate-reported bill; fiscal year 1996 in millions of\n                                dollars]                                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                        Budget          \n                      Category                        authority  Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed........................................  .........      206\n  H.R. 1854, as reported to the Senate..............      2,130    1,981\n  Scorekeeping adjustment...........................  .........  .......\n                                                     -------------------\n    Subtotal nondefense discretionary...............      2,130    2,188\nMandatory:                                                              \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed........................................         92       92\n  H.R. 1854, as reported to the Senate..............  .........  .......\n  Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                         \n   Budget Resolution assumptions....................         -2       -2\n                                                     -------------------\n      Subtotal mandatory............................         90       90\n                                                     ===================\n      Adjusted bill total...........................      2,220    2,278\n                                                     ===================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n    Nondefense discreationary.......................      2,168    2,188\n    Mandatory.......................................         90       90\n                                                     -------------------\n      Total allocation..............................      2,258    2,278\n                                                     ===================\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate Subcommittee                     \n 602(b) allocation:                                                     \n    Nondefense discretionary........................        -38       -0\n    Mandatory.......................................  .........  .......\n                                                     -------------------\n      Total allocation..............................        -38       -0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H.R. \n1854, the legislative branch appropriations bill. I especially want to \nthank Senator Mack, the subcommittee chairman, for his commitment to \nfund the Congressional Budget Office at a level which will allow the \nCBO to carry out the duties given them under the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act of 1995. The $2.6 million appropriation included in this \nbill for CBO provides the necessary funding and staffing to allow them \nto perform the cost estimates required under the Mandates Reform Act \nwithout inhibiting their ability to perform their primary \nresponsibilities. As the committee report stated, failure to do so \nwould create an unfunded mandate within the Congress itself.\n  The Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995 passed both Houses of \nCongress with the support of more than 90 per- cent of the Members in \neach body and it deserves a commensurate level of fiscal support to \nfulfill its mission. It is important legislation that forms the \ncornerstone for the congressional reform that is taking place in the \n104th Congress. Senator Mack was an early cosponsor of my mandate \nrelief legislation and he never waived from his commitment to see it \nenacted into law.\n                      amendment no. 1804 withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n1804 be withdrawn and the vote occur at 4 p.m. on amendment No. 1807.\n  So the amendment (No. 1804) was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. That will accommodate one of our colleagues on the other \nside and also permit the Senator from South Carolina to proceed with \nhis amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1808\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to offer an amendment to \nthe bill itself or to the pending amendment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If there is no objection, to the bill itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe temporarily set aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for \n     himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Robb, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n     Wellstone, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1808.\n       Strike page 29, line 6, through page 30, line 20, and \n     insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       For salaries and expenses necessary to carry out the \n     provisions of the Technology Assessment Act of 1972 (Public \n     law 92-484), including official reception and representation \n     expenses (not to exceed $5,500 from the Trust Fund), \n     $15,000,000: Provided, That the Librarian of Congress shall \n     report to Congress within 120 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act with recommendations on how to \n     consolidate the duties and functions of the Office of \n     Technology Assessment, the General Accounting Office, and the \n     Government Printing Office into an Office of Congressional \n     Services within the Library of Congress by the year 2002: \n     Provided further, That notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, each of the following accounts is reduced by 1.12 \n     percent from the amounts provided elsewhere in this Act: \n     ``salaries, Office of the Architect of the Capitol, Architect \n     of the Capitol''; ``Capitol buildings, Architect of the \n     Capitol''; ``Capitol grounds, Architect of the Capitol''; \n     ``Senate office buildings, Architect of the Capitol''; \n     ``Capitol power plant, Architect of the Capitol''; ``library \n     buildings and grounds, Architect of the Capitol''; and \n     ``salaries and expenses, Office of the Superintendent of \n     Documents, Government Printing Office'': Provided further, \n     That notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the \n     amounts provided elsewhere in this Act for ``salaries and \n     expenses, \n\n[[Page S10375]]\n     General Accounting Office,'' are reduced by 1.92 percent.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for just a \nmoment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent that I may yield to my \ncolleague from Wisconsin without losing the right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nSouth Carolina very much.\n  I just want to briefly comment on what we just resolved with regard \nto the campaign finance reform issue.\n  I am very gratified by the bipartisan vote, very strong vote, \nincluding 11 Members on the opposite side of the aisle, against tabling \nthe sense-of-the-Senate resolution with regard to the issue of bringing \nup and considering campaign finance reform during the 104th Congress. \nIt is one of the strongest bipartisan votes we have had on this floor \nduring this 104th Congress.\n  Now the majority leader has suggested that as a perfecting amendment. \nIn addition to a number of items that were originally in the Mack \nsubstitute that did not include campaign finance reform, they have now \noffered to include in that list--for the first time--campaign finance \nreform. It is something that should be considered during the 104th \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, this is precisely what we had hoped for, a vote by the \nSenate. I hope, given the fact that it is the majority leader's \nintention to support his own proposal, that we will have very, very \nstrong bipartisan support to add that to the list.\n  This is a shift from earlier in the day when the proposal by the \nSenator from Florida listed many important items but did not include--\nin fact excluded--campaign finance reform.\n  So we are extremely pleased that we will have the vote, another vote \nin addition to the other one that we had, with the vote which was very \nstrong, to indicate that before we leave here in the 104th Congress on \na bipartisan basis we should reform this terrible system.\n  I again thank the Senator from South Carolina for his courtesy.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished colleague. I \nthank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is one to retain the Office of \nTechnology Assessment. It first occurred over on the House side. The \nbill came out of the committee abolishing the Office of Technology \nAssessment but on the floor the House added $15 million for its \ncontinuance, taking it out of the hide of the Library of Congress.\n  On yesterday, Mr. President, at the full appropriations committee \nmarkup, I offered an amendment. I was not quite prepared then, and I \nshould be better prepared at this moment. Yesterday, I was not quite \nprepared because I wanted to present the amendment without cutting the \nLibrary of Congress. The fact of the matter is we had a very close \nvote, and if I had had the proxies of absent Members, this amendment \nwould not be necessary today. It would have been adopted in committee \nand on the bill at the moment.\n  Be that as it may, Mr. President, I have now clarified the provisions \nof this $15 million. The President's budget for the Office of \nTechnology Assessment is some $22 million, and this continues OTA but \nlevels a 30-percent cut, at a level of $15 million, to be obtained from \na 1.12-percent cut from the various legislative accounts--the Office of \nthe Architect of the Capitol, the Capitol Building, Capitol Grounds, \nSenate office buildings, the Capitol Power Plant, the salaries and \nexpenses of the Superintendent of Documents, the Government Printing \nOffice, and a 1.92-percent cut out of the GAO. We thought, twofold; \none, we could make that a little over 1-percent cut across the board, \nobtain the $15 million, keep OTA in harness, and otherwise, Mr. \nPresident, have a study recommendation made by the distinguished \ncolleague from Alaska, who is no longer but served with distinction as \nthe chairman of the Office of Technology Assessment. His suggestion was \nthat we have a study on how best to consolidate the various legislative \nor congressional services within this segment of the budget and save \nmoney.\n  There is no question that this amendment not only saves OTA, but it \nsaves money. It is bipartisan. I offer this amendment for myself, Mr. \nHatch, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Robb, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nWellstone, and others who support this legislation. We have now solved \nthe problem relative to the Library of Congress; Dr. Billington--and he \nis a good friend and an outstanding librarian--has been doing his \nhomework.\n  Mr. President, I do not have charts or prepared statements. I agreed \nto limit my comments without charts so let me get right to the heart of \nthe matter.\n  Back in the Nixon administration, they abolished the Office of \nScience Adviser, and at that particular time the various committees \nwere crowding in saying we have to learn about this, we have to know \nabout that. We always referred it to the Office of Science Adviser. We \ncould depend on it; it had credibility.\n  They said, let us get together in a bipartisan fashion, which we did, \nwith alternating between the House and the Senate as chairman, \nalternating between Democrats and Republicans. We have had quite a \nsuccessful administration at the Office of Technology Assessment.\n  One way it saves us money is by having these distinguished boards, \nadvisory panels, counseling the Office of Technology Assessment. They \nare comprised of college presidents, heads of the science departments \nfrom the institutes of technology, and others around the country who \ngive outstanding assistance free of charge, counseling on the various \ntechnological questions.\n  If we go right to it, I think one of the principal objections is that \nthe needs for these studies will not go away. If each committee crowds \nin on the technological needs for information from the General \nAccounting Office, obviously the General Accounting Office will go out \nand hire all of these people and meet themselves coming around the \ncorner having in all probability expended more money.\n  Now, what is wrong? This crowd--and I guess I am in on it, too, \nbecause I get frustrated on figuring out where you try to save money. I \nhave been through the exercise of freezes, the cuts of Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings, a value-added tax allocated to the deficit and all the other \nattempts made to get us in the black. Unfortunately, in today's \npolitical climate, individual chairmen come around and say, ``Well, I \nhave got to eliminate something.'' And more or less, if this amendment \npasses, it would take away a Brownie point from their political resume.\n  It is easy to go campaign next year and say, ``I am for economy, and \nI got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment. That is saving $15 \nmillion.'' Come on. Two nights ago ABC reported on a particular \nmisguided missile, $4 billion. You never heard this crowd that is \nfussing about $15 million--we took almost 2 hours in the Appropriations \nCommittee trying to save $15 million or trying to sustain the need to \nknow of the Members of this Congress. But they do not talk about that \n$4 billion.\n  Now, that is where the Congress ought to really be working. Do not \ncome around here to get a Brownie point on a political resume about how \nwe saved and got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment. That is \ngood in the 20-second bite. They will not just say how much they saved \nand everything else of that kind. But instead they cry in frustration, \n``Well, if we can't cut this, where can we cut?\"\n  I can give them a list. I voted this morning against the space \nstation. I was former chairman of Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation. I do not like to vote against the space station, but I \nam trying to maintain the space program. And you see, you learn from \nexperience. They came forward with the space station at $8 billion. The \nnext thing you know it was at $17 billion. The next thing you know it \nwas $30 billion. We have had four revisions of cutting it back until \nall I think we are going to get is the booster or the thruster up in \nspace and we'll call it a station before we get through.\n  Now they have a new angle--that it is a matter of comity with the \nSoviets and everything else. Fine business. If we were fat, rich, and \nhappy, a space station could well be in order. But we are broke. This \nCongress and Government around here for 15 years now has been spending \non an average of $200 billion more than we are taking in. So we \n\n[[Page S10376]]\nare not paying our way, and we have to not just cut; we have to forgo.\n  Another one, AmeriCorps. I believe in voluntarism, but I expect it. \nWe had it when we had Hurricane Hugo. I stood in the rain that weekend, \nand we counted up volunteers from 38 States that had come around to \nhelp us. The first plane that landed in Hurricane Andrew or whatever it \nwas down there at Homestead was our plane that carried generators, \nclean water, and personnel. We had Spanish-speaking police officers, \nand you saw them at Hurricane Andrew in the recovery. No cost to \nFlorida, we sent them down from Charleston.\n  The people of America believe in volunteering, and they will continue \nto work to help their neighborhoods. Oh, it is good to say on your \nresume I believe in voluntarism and I voted for AmeriCorps. But \ninstead, I withheld my vote. So I have been saving the money.\n  So do not come around here saying, ``Oh, if we cannot get rid of \nthis.'' You are not getting rid of it. The need is there. What you are \ndoing is eliminating the most economical approach, the most \ntechnologically adept approach to this technological need.\n  Now, that is the best statement I can make. I note that some of the \nother Senators want to talk, but I can mention some of the examples of \nwhere we save the Government not just millions but billions.\n  The distinguished Senator from Alaska, I do not know whether he can \napproach the floor. On yesterday, we talked about the spectrum auction, \nand that came out of the Office of Technology Assessment. And we put it \nup, and in the last 2 years now we have brought to the Government $12 \nbillion--not $15 million, $12 billion--from those auctions. So here is \na money-making entity.\n  Those who are frustrated and say, ``If I cannot cut this, where can I \ncut?'' I cannot understand those who are committed to ignorance.\n We are trying to find out. We are trying to learn. We, who have been \ndealing with the Office of Technology Assessment, study very closely \nand look at their particular commitments. We just do not take anything \nand everything.\n\n  In fact, all of the requests made are bipartisan. They come from the \nchairmen and the ranking members of the committees themselves. We get \nway more requests than we respond to and cannot take on each and every \nquestion that would come. So it comes with a real need from the \nCongress itself. OTA has responded. It has done a professional job. \nThere is no criticism in this debate about the quality of work.\n  I am not going to try to overwhelm you and bring all the studies and \neverything else. But we can get into a few of them. I am pleased--I \nhave checked this amendment through with our distinguished ranking \nmember, the Senator from Washington, and I will be glad to adjust it.\n  Do not tell me that we can give everything to GAO; we know GAO can do \nit. That is not true. I worked closely for years as chairman of the \nLegislative Appropriations Subcommittee, working with Elmer Staats and \neverything else. What we had to do was cut out all the term papers that \nwere being made for high school graduates and everything over there. \nThey will take on anything to keep the work going. Let us not do that. \nLet us keep the Office of Technology Assessment at an economical price \nand continue it and not abolish it in the political urge to get rid of \nsomething here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is no one in the Senate I have more \nrespect for than the junior Senator from the State of South Carolina. \nBut having said that, I am not sure who would have won in the \nAppropriations Committee if all the proxies had been given. That is \nsomething we do not know. The fact of the matter is, this amendment was \nbrought up before the Appropriations Committee in an effort to remove \nthis, and that amendment lost.\n  Mr. President, I, for 6 years, served as chairman in the Legislative \nBranch Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. And we went \nthrough some very rough times. In prior years, there was quite a bit of \nmoney to pass around in the legislative branch. There came a time when \nthere had been cutbacks in Washington generally, and no place has it \nbeen focused more than in the legislative branch. So for my friend from \nSouth Carolina to talk about going into the black box where all these \nsecret things are, or the A-12, we all know that we cannot do that here \ntoday. We are bound by what is in the Legislative Branch Subcommittee \nof Appropriations. That is all we can deal with. We cannot deal with A-\n12's, space stations, or black box matters. We have to deal with what \nwe have in this very tiny little Appropriations subcommittee.\n  And what we have is the fact that we have to cut $200 million from \nthis subcommittee. This amendment will cut approximately--this--what \nhas been done on the subcommittee level takes approximately $22 \nmillion. It is a tremendous step forward to arriving at the goals we \nhave to meet.\n  Mr. President, the Office of Technology Assessment is a luxury. It is \nsomething that would be nice to have if we had lots of money like we \nused to have. But we do not have the money that we used to have, and we \nhave to look someplace to make cuts. The amendment offered in the \nAppropriations Committee took the money from the Library of Congress. \nWell, it is obvious that that has not sold very well. And now, there is \nan across-the-board cut, cutting things like the General Accounting \nOffice.\n  Mr. President, if there has been one entity that has been hit hard in \nthe legislative branch for the past 6 years, it has been the General \nAccounting Office. Last year, the General Accounting Office was hit \nwith $69 million in cuts. This next year, it is $45 million in cuts. It \nhas been cut back about 25 percent, and that is a significant cut for \nthe watchdog of Congress. The General Accounting Office has saved this \ncountry billions and billions and billions of dollars. And they are now \ncut back to the point where they have significantly cut back on the \nwork that they can do, the requests that we make to them that they can \nmeet. The Office of Technology Assessment did 50 major reports last \nyear, 50 major reports for $22 million. Now, Mr. President, CRS, where \nthe money was originally to be taken, an example of a different \nworkload, CRS did 11,000 reports last year.\n  The work the OTA does can be done by other agencies. I have had the \nOTA do work for me. They do fine work. But we do not have the ability \nto have in our garage three Cadillacs. We have to start cutting back \nuntil we wind up with maybe two Chevrolets, or I should say a Ford and \na Chevrolet, or maybe a Ford and a Chrysler, however you want to \ncombine it. But, Mr. President, we cannot have three luxury automobiles \nanymore. All we can have is the General Accounting Office and all we \ncan have is the Congressional Research Service, which the congressional \nstaff depends on around here to meet the requests of constituents at \nhome and Members of the Senate. Our staffs depend on the Congressional \nResearch Service. They did not depend on the Office of Technology \nAssessment.\n  Now, Mr. President, I say that the work of the OTA can be done by \nother agencies. The General Accounting Office can do their work. They \nare not a bunch of accountants. They have scientists there. They call \nin scientific panels all the time. We have been told in this debate \nthat they have distinguished boards, advisory panels. Well, that is not \nhard to copy. That is not hard to do. The General Accounting Office \ndoes the same thing.\n  It is interesting to note, in one of the most scientific matters we \nhave had before this body in a decade, namely, the superconducting \nsuper collider, we did not see a word from the Office of Technology \nAssessment on the superconducting super collider--one of the most \nscientific measures brought before this body in the last decade. OTA \ndid not write a report on it.\n  I repeat the words of the Senator from South Carolina: If we cannot \ncut funding for this agency, then we cannot cut funding for anything. \nIf this is not fat and something that we do not need, then there is not \nanything we can do--$22 million in this very tiny little subcommittee.\n  The proposed amendment attempts to keep OTA alive. We do not kill \nthings around here; we just kind of choke them to death. What we are \n\n[[Page S10377]]\ngoing to wind up doing with all these budget cuts is having a \nsignificant number of entities, none of which work very well--OTA \ncutting at 25 percent. I respectfully submit to this body that the \nbudgets in this Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee are \nstretched to the near breaking point.\n  We have heard a lot about the Library of Congress and we should hear \na lot about the Library of Congress. We have worked very hard to \nmaintain the structure of the Library of Congress. The Senator from \nSouth Carolina indicated what they have done in the House is they said, \n``Well, we are not going to cut OTA. We will have the Library of \nCongress do it.'' What kind of way is that to do business; $16 million \nout of the Library's budget? That is what they are going to go to \nconference on. That is the House's position. That is not the way to run \nGovernment. It is certainly not the way to run a business.\n  Mr. President, we cannot, in my opinion, having worked on this \nsubcommittee for 6 years, continually cut these entities that make up \nthis Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee: The General \nAccounting Office, cut to the very core. The Government Printing Office \ncut, cut. We have significant security needs. We are doing our best to \nmaintain those. This amendment will take from that.\n  I just do not think it is right that we have an entity that did 50 \nreports last year--CRS did 11,000, the General Accounting Office did \nhundreds and hundreds of reports. We all recognize there is no agency \nthat we depend on more than the Congressional Research Service.\n  Mr. President, I respectfully submit, I repeat, that the time has \ncome when we as Members of Congress have to make some decisions. We \ncannot have everything as we used to. We have to make some cuts. And we \ncan only work with what we have. I repeat: We cannot go out and look at \nA-12 airplanes, black box matters. We cannot look at space stations. We \ncan only look at what the law allows us to look at. That is this \nAppropriations subcommittee that deals with the things that run the \nlegislative branch.\n  I call upon my colleagues to defeat this amendment. In the gesture of \nwhat we are trying to do around here, to make a more efficient \nGovernment, to save money, we are going to have to eliminate programs, \nwe are going to have to eliminate entities and agencies around here. \nThat is the only way we can do it. We cannot keep everything and take a \nlittle bit here and a little bit there. We have to start making major \ndecisions. This is a major decision. This involves almost $22 million a \nyear.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I speak in support of the amendment of \nthe Senator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings. I am also expressing \nmy support for preserving the Office of Technology Assessment. I am not \nhere to make a case that it be preserved with a certain amount of \ndollars. I am not here to make a case that we maintain the status quo. \nI am not here to say that OTA can not function with less people. I am \nnot even here to say that you ought to maintain the Office of \nTechnology Assessment Board, and I am a member of that board.\n  I am here to say that OTA ought to continue or at least its function \nas a congressional aid ought to be maintained. We need OTA because it \nprovides information so that we can identify existing and probable \nimpacts of technological application. The application of technology \nimpacts upon a lot of public policy that we make in the Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  We need to have a great deal of confidence in the information that is \navailable for changes in public policy or the creation of public \npolicy.\n  Before I ever came to Congress, Congress saw the need for this sort \nof information. By statute, OTA must secure unbiased information \nregarding the impact of technological application.\n  OTA is one of the few truly neutral sources of information for the \nCongress. In a very real sense, OTA is our source of objective counsel \nwhen it comes to science and technology and its interaction with public \npolicy decision making.\n  There are plenty of places for information in this town, but so many \nof these sources of information come from the private sector--and there \nis nothing wrong with the private sector; there is nothing wrong with \norganizations protecting their own interests, even if it is in the area \nof science and technology. But if we do not have an unbiased source of \ninformation, then we have to rely on organizations with a stake in \nkeeping alive programs that benefit their interests.\n  Special interests can fund research, that goes without saying. But it \nseems to me that Congress ought to have an independent source of \ninformation representing all interests in science and technology. \nPretty much the same way that the subcommittee has made a determination \nthat a lot of other agencies that it funds ought to exist because of \ntheir independence. The General Accounting Office is an example. The \nsubcommittee this year decided that the General Accounting Office \nshould get less money next year than this year and it that it ought to \nbe streamlined and have staff reductions. But that respected \norganization is being maintained because the subcommittee felt that a \npostaudit agent, that is responsible to the Congress, should continue \nto exist.\n  It is not any different for science and technology. We ought to have \nan independent source of information, unbiased, not tied to any special \ninterest. The information that OTA provides comes to us and we use it \nto determine public policy that has a scientific or technological \nbasis.\n  It goes without saying that except for a few professionals here and \nthere, like a medical doctor or an engineer, there are not very many \nMembers of Congress who are experts in technical and scientific issues. \nOf course, we have our personal staff and we have committee staff. But \nour committee staffs lack the time and the expertise to do in-depth \nanalysis of these issues. OTA can do that.\n  Congress is not made up of a wide range of professional backgrounds. \nTwo-thirds of the Senators are lawyers. Half the House of \nRepresentatives, I believe, is made up from the profession of law.\n  As I remind you so often, there are only a few of us in this Congress \nwho are farmers. But I would not rely on my judgment on highly \ntechnical and highly scientific agriculture issues the same way that I \ncan rely upon OTA when they do studies in these areas that are so \nessential to agriculture. It puts me in a much better position, and my \ncolleagues in a much better position, to make decisions on agricultural \npolicy based on science and technological based information.\n  Neither the Federal Government nor the private sector can do analysis \ngeared to the particular interests of congressional committees. OTA can \ndo just that. And it is the smallest and the least expensive \ncongressional agency.\n  OTA is intimately interfaced with Congress through its bipartisan \nTechnology Assessment Board. I am a member of that board and know \nsomething about the operation of it. The board does not need to exist \njust because I am a member of it.\n  It does not matter whether Chuck Grassley is a member of that board \nor not; you can eliminate the Board, if you want, but still keep OTA's \nfunction. There might be better ways to get the job done than the way \nit was originally set up.\n  OTA works closely with Congress through its bipartisan Technology \nAssessment Board. The Board is equally made up of Democrats and \nRepublicans. I have served on this board since 1987 and I can certify \nthe Board ensures compliance with statutory and procedural requirements \nfor each OTA project. This is a unique governance for oversight \npurposes. Other agencies--like GAO--do not have this special bipartisan \ngroup overseeing their operation.\n  I want to assure all my colleagues that OTA resources are carefully \nmanaged in this bipartisan way, and I can certify that the OTA board \ncarefully screens for--and most importantly, does not allow duplicate \nwork. Projects are not self-generated; they are initiated at the \nrequest of congressional committees. The committees that have \n\n[[Page S10378]]\nrequested the most studies are the Senate Commerce, Science and \nTransportation; Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee; Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee; Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee; Senate Agricultural, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee; \nSenate Armed Services Committee; Senate Finance Committee; Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee; and the Senate Committee on Indian \naffairs.\n  A few of my colleagues have said that the GAO can do the work that \nOTA currently does. I disagree. I do not show any disrespect for the \nGeneral Accounting Office in regard to that. In fact, I have been a \nrequester of help from the General Accounting Office and they do a good \njob. But the General Accounting Office is not equipped to do the highly \ntechnical and scientific work that is done by OTA.\n  Let me explain the backgrounds of the staff of the particular \nagencies. The General Accounting Office's staff, process, and \ntraditions are primarily those of an audit and program evaluation unit. \nOnly four percent of the GAO staff have Ph.D's, and few of these \ndoctorates are in science and engineering. In contrast, 58 percent of \nOTA's staff has Ph.D's in these areas, and half of those hold degrees \nin hard sciences. The GAO has relied on prior or concurrent work of the \nOTA for scientific and technical aspects of the study.\n  It seems to me that speaks more to the point raised about what GAO \ncan do and not do in this area than anything I can say. GAO relies on \nOTA for highly scientific and technological information.\n  As we continue moving into a highly technical world, we must ensure \nthat we know how public policy impacts future trends and the reverse of \nthat. OTA provides a very high level of expertise to help us understand \nthese trends, while balancing the views of opponents and proponents of \nvarious courses of action.\n  OTA translates modern technical material for legislative and \noversight purposes and gives us a heads up on important but complicated \nscience and technology issues in areas like space, defense, and energy.\n  OTA's studies on energy crops, for example, are particularly \nimportant for farm States such as mine. Their study on the ``Potential \nEnvironmental Impact of Bioenergy Crops'' showed that energy crops, \nsuch as switch grass, could have net environmental benefits, rebutting \nthe concerns of certain environmentalists.\n  This study and other studies they have done are going to be very \nhelpful as we debate the farm bill and as we look for new crops to \nmaintain the viability of the farm community. As the domestic supplies \nof oil and gas diminish and dependence upon foreign sources continues \nto increase, we will be looking for new ways, even beyond ethanol, for \ninstance, to use farm products to fuel our machines and vehicles. That \nis also an issue regarding the energy independence of our country, for \nnational security purposes. OTA is doing very good work on renewable \nbioenergy fuels for transportation which can help us address our \neconomic issues in rural America.\n  In addition, OTA helps the Congress make decisions that save the U.S. \nGovernment money.\n  I have some examples of where OTA actually helped us save money. \nOTA's study of the Social Security Administration plan to purchase \ncomputers saved $368 million. OTA's cautions--a while back now, I might \nsay--about the Synthetic Fuel Corporation helped to secure $60 billion \nof savings.\n  Let me explain that to you. Many thought that it would take $80 \nbillion to do the work of the Synthetic Fuel Corporation. OTA testified \nthat $80 billion was an overestimate. In the final analysis, Congress \nput up only $20 billion for the Synthetic Fuel Corporation. This saved \nthe taxpayers $60 billion.\n  OTA's studies of preventive services for Medicare have assisted \nlegislative decisions for the past 15 years. Studies of pneumonia \nvaccines and pap smears that showed Medicare would save money by paying \nfor these medical services for the elderly, and Medicare patients would \nsave money. Both proposals passed as legislation.\n  OTA's work on nuclear power plants has played a central role in \neliminating poorly conceived and burdensome regulations on the U.S. \npower industry.\n  I urge you to look very closely at the amount of money that is being \nspent on OTA. I urge you to look very closely at whether the number of \npeople employed is the right number. I urge you to look at the \nadministrative setup. I even urge you to consider abolishing the board \nof the Office of Technology Assessment, if you want. But I also urge \nyou to look at the product of the OTA, and you will come to the same \nconclusions in 1995 that Congress came to when it was set up: that we \nneed independent sources of information, particularly in science and \ntechnology, which we did not have and we will not have after this day \nif this is abolished.\n  I firmly believe, Mr. President, that OTA offers a unique and \nessential service for Congress, and I am very impressed with OTA's \ncredible analyses of the developments in technology and related public \npolicy issues. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment that \npreserves the functions of the Office of Technology Assessment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, ``What's Good from Government.'' Now there \nis a topic you do not see often these days. Yet on May 15, 1994, this \nwas the title of an article that appeared in Library Journal discussing \nthe sixty-three finest government publications in 1993. Out of the 20 \nselected federal government publications that were honored, three of \nthese reports were issued by the congressional Office of Technology \nAssessment, including one called, ``Proliferation of Weapons of Mass \nDestruction: Assessing the Risks.''\n  Here is what Keay Davidson, a reviewer in the San Francisco Chronicle \nhad to say about the report on April 7, 1995:\n\n       For years, OTA has generated some of the most readable and \n     useful reports imaginable about US research and its impact on \n     social, political, military and economic policy. I always \n     look forward to its reports, which are extraordinarily clear, \n     thoughtful and well-illustrated--extraordinary considering \n     that they come from a government agency. When's the last time \n     you actually enjoyed reading a government document? Not long \n     ago I was on a plane flight, completely absorbed by an OTA \n     report on US efforts to control nuclear weapons and other \n     ``technologies of mass destruction.''\n\n  The distinguished journal, Foreign Affairs reviewed another report in \na recent series of OTA studies on nonproliferation and came to the \nfollowing conclusion: ``The Office of Technology Assessment does some \nof the best writing on security-related technical issues in the United \nStates, as evidenced by this excellent volume.''\n  Of course, this is not the first time that OTA has been recognized \nfor excellence. The June 1989 issue of Washington Monthly featured a \nstory on OTA, holding it up as a model for the rest of the government--\nover a picture of the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument, and \nthe Capitol, the cover of this journal declared, ``At Last! A \nGovernment Agency That Works.'' Indeed, in the last 4 years, 24 OTA \nreports have been selected in national competitions as among the best \ngovernment publications nationwide, even worldwide.\n  None of this acclaim surprises me. OTA has had a long and \ndistinguished track record of publishing informative studies on \nnonproliferation issues. In 1977, OTA issued a 270-page book on Nuclear \nProliferation and Safeguards that is still valuable reading. In a \nhearing on April 4, 1977, of the Subcommittee on Energy, Nuclear \nProliferation, and Federal Services of the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs, I called this study a ``landmark document'' that ``will make a \nsubstantial contribution to everyone's understanding of this highly \ncomplex and emotionally charged issue.''\n  Highly complex indeed--I can say without doubt that halting the \nglobal spread of weapons of mass destruction is one of the most vexing \nproblems that either the Executive or Congress has had to confront in \nmodern times. The political and diplomatic problems of addressing this \nthreat are bad enough. But the technological aspects of this problem \nare so complex that many public officials and citizens around the \ncountry have just given up--they need help to sort out the issues, \nweigh the stakes, and outline courses of action.\n  The OTA has responded to this need in a manner which brings credit \nnot just to the agency, but to our system of government: I am proud \nthat the U.S. Congress recognized the need for such \n\n[[Page S10379]]\nan agency 23 years ago. My purpose today, however, is to praise OTA for \nthe specific work over the last few years on the subject of weapons \nproliferation. I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate and the House, \neven those who have called OTA ``a luxury we cannot afford,'' to sample \nsome of the following reports on weapons proliferation issues.\n  First, ``Nuclear Safeguards and the International Atomic Energy \nAgency'' OTA-ISS-615, June 1995, 147 pages (released this month; also \navailable in a 22-page summary).\n  This report reviews the origins of the IAEA, describes its safeguards \nsystem in terms that non-specialists can easily understand, discusses \nnumerous options for strengthening the IAEA safeguards system, and \noutlines other possible initiatives to strengthen the global nuclear \nnonproliferation regime.\n  Second, ``Proliferation and the Former Soviet Union''; OTA-ISS-605, \nSeptember 1994, 92 pages.\n  This report is essential reading for all who are concerned about twin \nproblems of ``loose nukes'' and the ``brain drain'' following the \nbreakup of the Soviet Union. The report documents specific problems \nwith respect to weaknesses in national systems of nuclear accounting, \ncontrols over exports, and the ability to police borders.\n  Third, ``Export Controls and Nonproliferation Policy''; OTA-ISS-596, \nMay 1994, 82 pages.\n  Here the OTA addresses the contributions and limitations of export \ncontrols as a tool of nonproliferation policy. The study offers \ninsights and technical details about the export licensing process, in \nparticular measures to make this process more efficient and effective \nin achieving nonproliferation objectives.\n  Fourth, ``Technologies Underlying Weapons of Mass Destruction''; OTA-\nBP-ISC-115, December 1993, 263 pages.\n  This report is a basic primer about the fabrication and effects of \nweapons of mass destruction. It is essential reading for anybody both \nfor those who have official responsibilities to tackle this problem, \nand those who are simply curious about what all the fuss is about \nconcerning these deadly weapons.\n  Fifth, ``Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction: Assessing the \nRisks''; OTA-ISC-559, August 1993, 123 pages.\n  I have already discussed this award-winning above. If a reader has no \nbackground on proliferation issues and wants to read just one report \nfor the clearest possible introduction to the subject, this is the \nreport to read.\n  Sixth, ``The Chemical Weapons Convention: Effects on the U.S. \nChemical Industry''; OTA-BP-ISC-106, August 1993, 69 pages.\n  The Senate will take up ratification of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention later this year. An important topic in this process will be \nthe costs to US industry from complying with this Convention. Given \nthat the treaty will cover controls over chemicals that are either \nproduced or used throughout the nation, this study should be of great \ninterest indeed.\n  If the publication of six major studies in less than two years is not \nenough to illustrate the productivity of this agency, critics might \nconsider that OTA is well underway on yet another report in this \nseries, this time on assessing US responses to proliferation after it \nhas occurred.\n  Congress established OTA in 1972 after determining that, although the \napplications of technology are ``increasingly extensive, pervasive, and \ncritical in their impact,'' no Executive or Legislative branch agencies \nwere capable of providing Congress with ``adequate and timely \ninformation, independently developed, relating to [their] potential \nimpact.'' In its 23 years, OTA has filled that need--and in an age when \ncost/benefit analyses will figure so prominently in evaluating Federal \nactions, I can think of no more greater need in Congress than for the \ntypes of skills and services that OTA offers today.\n  This is why the presidents of the National Academy of Sciences, the \nNational Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine have \nwarned that closing OTA will diminish the quality of advice to \nCongress. Representing the interests of over 240,000 electrical \nengineers nationwide, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics \nEngineers calls OTA a ``highly regarded and respected institution'' \nthat serves as an ``irreplaceable asset'' to Congress. The world's \nlargest scientific organization, the American Association for the \nAdvancement of Science, says that abolishing OTA would be a ``strategic \nerror for Congress'' that would seriously harm the national interest.\n  OTA does not only prepare formal high-quality reports--Congress has \nrepeatedly drawn upon the agency's in-house expertise to provide short-\nnotice testimony, briefings, and replies to congressional questions on \nmany high technology subjects on the policy agenda. Following the nerve \ngas attacks in Tokyo and the bombing of the federal building in \nOklahoma City, for example, OTA staff were able to respond both \npromptly and comprehensively to repeated congressional questions.\n  To whom will Congress turn if the next explosion in an American city \ninvolves a weapon of mass destruction? Though the Executive can \noccasionally be helpful in providing information, there is no \nsubstitute for Congress having an independent, bipartisan source of \nexpertise on exactly such technically-complex issues. I can assure my \ncolleagues, I know where I would like to turn in the years ahead, to \nthe Office of Technology Assessment.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting OTA for having performed \nits mission with dignity and professional excellence. This is not an \nagency Congress can do without.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President. I am in support of the effort to preserve \nthe Congressional Office of Technology Assessment. The OTA, on whose \nboard I currently sit, has been of profound and indispensable use to \nthe Congress in the carrying out of its function of an independent \nsource of complex, unbiased analysis of the technology issues facing \nour country today. I firmly believe that it would be short-sighted and \nunwise for us to eliminate entirely this agency, even as we strive to \neffectuate budget savings with the Legislative Branch.\n  The OTA was created in 1972 as a result of a far-sighted, bipartisan \neffort led by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations then ranking \nMember, Senator Clifford Chase of New Jersey. It evolved from the need \nto have objective, expert analysis to assist the Congress in assessing \nthe potential effects of a nuclear war on the United States. Again in \nthe late 1970's, the OTA conducted a more comprehensive and detailed \nstudy on the same issue. These two studies were among the first \ncomprehensive unclassified efforts to provide realistic assessments of \njust what nuclear war might mean for the citizens of this and other \ncountry's. They proved to be extremely valuable in helping inform the \nCongress as we developed national policy in this area.\n  Since those studies, the OTA has proved itself time and again in \nhundreds of studies across the board spectrum of technology assessment. \nThroughout its tenure, it has become recognized around the world of its \ncogent, professional, and unbiased work. It would be foolhardy to \nshelve that expertise now in a blind effort to simply slash budgets.\n  I am thankful that under the amendment, another revered and \ninvaluable congressional institution, the Library of Congress, will not \nbe subject to budget cuts in order to spare the OTA. Both of these \norganization have an exemplary record of in their service to the \nCongress and I am glad that a mean has been found to adequately \npreserve the functions of both.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me in this effort to \npreserve a scaled-back OTA and in doing so, insure that the Congress \nwill continue to be able to make informed, reasoned decisions regarding \nthe complex technology issues that it will inevitably face in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we are in an interesting time. I say that \nreminded me of the old Chinese curse, ``May you live in interesting \ntimes.'' I have been through this kind of time in my private life, and \nI would like to share with you some observations there, as I then \naddressed the question of what to do about the Office of Technology \nAssessment.\n  I remember visiting with a CEO of a fairly large corporation, and he \ntold me \n\n[[Page S10380]]\nof a very difficult experience that he had just been through in his \ncompany. He said, ``I have just gone through the whole company, looked \nat everything, and ended up cutting back here, cutting back there, \nleaving a lot of blood on the floor, if you will, as I have had to \nclean up the company. And then I said to all of the employees who \nsurvived this exercise, this is it, this is as deep as we are going to \ncut, and you can all relax now because you have passed the test, and we \nhave seen to it that everything that is excess, everything that is \nwasteful has been taken care of.''\n  Then, he said to me, ``I quietly in my own office went to my \ncalendar, flipped the pages forward about 3 years, and wrote down, `Do \nit again,' because I realized no matter how zealous we were in trying \nto keep from getting duplication and creating redundant services and \ngetting too fat, no matter how hard we worked at it, in about 3 years \ntime in our company we would suddenly wake up and discover we had too \nmany people doing the same thing, and I would have this same kind of \ncircumstance again.''\n  We do not do that in the Federal Government. That is, we do not go 3 \nyears ahead and write down, ``Do it again.'' Instead, once something \ngets started, it continues, regardless of whether or not it has \noutlived its usefulness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have a previous order to vote at 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1807\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). Under a previous order, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment numbered 1807, offered by the \nmajority leader, to the amendment numbered 1803. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 91, nays 8, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 314 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--91\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--8\n\n     Breaux\n     Bumpers\n     Dodd\n     Hollings\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n      \n     Inouye\n      \n  So the amendment (No. 1807) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1808\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise simply for the purpose of \nexpressing the appreciation of this Senator--and I think I can speak \nfor the Joint Committee on the Library--that the proposal pending by \nthe distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina will not affect \nthe Library of Congress. It has taken very severe budget cuts and \nbudget freezes over the years. Its world function, its national role, \nand its indispensable service to the U.S. Congress would be in jeopardy \nwere more to take place.\n  Our distinguished Librarian, Dr. James Billington, has made this \nclear in forceful, in cogent, and in concise terms. His argument has \nclearly prevailed.\n  I want to express my appreciation to the Senator for this purpose, \nand to state just incidentally my agreement--I am sure most of us will \nalso agree that the Office of Technology Assessment has an important \nrole. It has been here a quarter century. It was established for a role \nand it ought to continue. I simply want to make those comments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me just indicate what I am doing here.\n  I am trying to determine whether or not we will go to S. 343, which \nis regulatory reform, which I had a right to do under the order. That \nis why I do not want to get bogged down with some other amendment \nbecause I need to give an hour or so, or some advance notice to the \nminority leader, Senator Daschle. Then there would be 1 hour of debate \nand then there would be a vote on cloture on S. 343.\n  Following that, we would, if cloture is not invoked, either move on \nto something else, or I assume somehow we get back to this bill, which \nI thought would take 2 hours. We started at 10 o'clock.\n  I want to accommodate the Senator if I can. Does he want to speak for \n10 minutes or 15 minutes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Less than that. I know the Senator from Utah was \naddressing this issue as well. I am more than glad to either proceed or \nwait until after the Senator from Utah, and then at a time that the \nleader wants to gain control of the floor to make a request, I would \nwithhold.\n  Mr. DOLE. If I could request that I be recognized at 5 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wanted to speak briefly----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. But I understood from the Senator from Florida that the \nSenator from Utah was in the middle of a statement. I will be glad to \nwait until after he concludes.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor, but before doing so, I ask \nunanimous consent that when the Senator from Utah concludes, I might be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his courtesy.\n  It is true I was in the middle of a statement when the regular order \nintervened and we had the vote. I do not have much more to say, but I \nwas in the middle of making the point that every organization \ninevitably ends up growing more than it really needs to. There is an \ninertia--it is almost organic--in organizations that says we start \nthis, which is a good thing, and it grows a little, and then we start \nanother, which is a good thing, and it grows a little. And just like a \nplant, organizations need to be pruned back every once in a while. I \nhave done it in my business. I know there are others here who have \nbusiness experiences who have had to do this. \n\n[[Page S10381]]\n\n  As we address this OTA circumstance, it is my feeling that this is \nwhat we have here. OTA in my belief has been a good agency. It has done \ngood work. I hear the Senators talk about its work, and I agree. If you \nlook at just the OTA, you would come to the conclusion that it deserves \nto remain.\n  At the same time, Mr. President, that OTA was doing its work, the \nLibrary of Congress was building a capacity to deal with technology \nissues. At the same time, the GAO was looking into many issues that \nwere the same kinds of issues as OTA. And as we looked at this within \nthe committee, I came to the conclusion that we have simply \nproliferated capacity in this area throughout the Government, that it \nis time to prune the bush.\n  Now, I am sorry personally for those who are connected with OTA that \nthey are the ones who have felt the pruning shears and that the \nfunction will be transferred, if we continue with the actions \nrecommended by the subcommittee, to other agencies. This is always a \nwrench for the individuals involved, and they say, with some degree of \nfairness, ``Why me? I have done a good job. I have done what the \nCongress has asked me to do. I have produced a report that is of sound \nvalue. Why are you cutting back on me?''\n  Those of us who are in this position must look at the entire \nGovernment, not just one agency at a time. When we do that, we have to \nsay to those who are feeling the effect of the pruning shears, if it \nwere not you, it would have to be someone else because there is \nredundancy here.\n  We have the responsibility in the overall budget circumstance to do \nas the CEO I was referring to in my beginning remarks, go through and \nclean out the duplication and sharpen up the organization.\n  I realize this is not an exact analogy, but nonetheless it \nillustrates the point. I read a column recently where the columnist was \ntalking about a television station that went off the air because of \nfinancial difficulties. They did not want to lose their license, so \nthey said we in fact will keep broadcasting a signal while we work out \nour financial difficulties. They put on the air the picture of fish, \ntropical fish, and broadcast that 24 hours a day to keep their place. \nWhen they solved their problems financially, and they could go back to \nregular programming, they took the fish off the air and put on the \nregular programming. And what happened, Mr. President? They were \ndeluged with phone calls complaining about the fact that they had \ncanceled the fish.\n  It seems that once something gets started, it develops a constituency \nregardless of whether or not there are other options.\n  Now, I am not, as I say, suggesting in any way that the OTA is simply \nbroadcasting of the fish, but they have developed a constituency that \nis appropriately calling for their preservation in an atmosphere when \nthere are other facilities capable of doing this.\n  So painful as it is, Mr. President, difficult as it is to explain to \nthe individuals who are doing a good job, I have come to the conclusion \nthat as a total Government we have the capacity elsewhere to do what we \nhave been doing in the OTA. It has become redundant because of what we \nhave funded in the Library of Congress and in the General Accounting \nOffice, and I support the subcommittee's report that says this is the \nplace we shall prune.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know that there are other Members who \nwant to speak, so I shall not take much time.\n  Mr. President, I wish to just review for the Senate where we are on \nthis issue of OTA. The issue no longer is the size of the budget. That \nissue has been basically agreed to. So this is not something that is in \naddition. This is not something that we are adding. The total amounts \nin terms of the budget have effectively been agreed to and that really \nis not before the Senate.\n  The issue that is before the Senate is whether we are going to retain \nthe capability of OTA to deal with technological issues which can be \nhelpful to the Congress and to the American people generally. That is \nonly the issue.\n  So we have to evaluate now whether that can be done with the existing \nagencies, the Congressional Research Service, or other agencies, or \nwhether it is best to try to hold together the capability that has been \ndeveloped in OTA, to be able to give advice, counsel, and judgment to \nthe Congress on matters of technology that we are going to face in \nterms of the future.\n  That is basically the issue. Now, I say to my good friend from Utah, \nthe fact is we have had the expression of the American Academy of \nSciences, the Institutes of Medicine, American Academy of Energy, and \nscience advisers to Republican and Democrat Presidents alike. All are \nin agreement that this function ought to be maintained. They had an \nopportunity to say no, let us separate out OTA and let it go to CRS or \nlet it go to other agencies; we do not believe that it will really make \nmuch difference in the ability of Congress to get this information.\n  They were asked that very question, and the most important, \nprestigious institutes that deal with the most complex issues of \ntechnology and new technology and advanced technology have recognized \nand respected OTA for being the center of excellence for technology, to \nadvise us in the Congress and Senate.\n  So if the issue of the budget is out of the way, we have to ask \nourselves what is in the best interests really of the Congress \ngenerally, the House and the Senate, and even the executive and the \npublic because these studies are made available to the public, and what \nis really the best way to do it, because you have to face the fact that \nwe in the Congress are going to be faced with these technology issues \ninto the future of this country--increasing technology, cutting edge \ntechnology, technology that is going to be at the heart of the American \neconomy after the turn of the century and in many respects is there \neven now.\n  I can see in my own State with biotechnology, telecommunications, \nfiber optics, the wide range of new kinds of technology. And the \nquestion is, how does that impact the lives of the American people? And \nhow will it affect that?\n  We do have a resource that is special, that has been recognized, not \njust by Members of Congress, but by the most prestigious, important and \nsignificant institutes that are dealing with these issues, that have \nmade their judgment. And so whether it has been in those institutes or \nwhether it is the CEO's of the top companies in this country that are \ndevoting the greatest amount of their own resources in terms of \ntechnology that respect this expertise, whether it is the former \nscience advisers under Republicans and Democrats alike, they have all \ncome virtually to this conclusion: It is important to maintain OTA as \nan institute. Where it is going to sit and within the various framework \nof existing agencies is a matter of administration. And I think that \ncould be worked out by reasonable individuals in the course of the \nconference with the House of Representatives.\n  But what we should not lose is that capability, that capacity, that \nkind of integrity which has been of value to this Congress on issues \ninvolving DNA, on new technologies in education, on the issues of \npolygraph. Their recommendations that they made to the Congress were \nlater taken and put into law by Senator Hatch and myself. On instance \nafter instance so many areas of important technology, OTA has been \nthere. I have agreed with some of their conclusions, differed with \nothers. I think every Member of the Congress realizes it really \nrepresents an extraordinary degree of knowledge and awareness and \nbackground and experience and really the best in terms of bringing \nevaluations of technology. It is an asset that we cannot afford to \nlose. And I hope very much that the amendment will be accepted.\n  I strongly support the amendment to maintain the Office of Technology \nAssessment as a valuable and needed arm of Congress.\n  OTA was created 23 years ago by the Technology Assessment Act of \n1972. In the years since then, OTA has become a world-renowned source \nof information and analysis on current technology issues. It plays an \ninvaluable role in helping Congress assess and apply scientific and \ntechnological advances for the benefit of the American people. \n\n[[Page S10382]]\n\n  OTA's budget is currently $22 million. Clearly, OTA is prepared to \ntighten its belt substantially along with the rest of the Federal \nGovernment. In fact, under the able leadership of Dr. Roger Herdman, \nOTA has already taken major cost-cutting measures on its own \ninitiative.\n  But regrettably, the bill before us proposes to eliminate this needed \nand unique agency.\n  Each year, OTA prepares dozens of formal assessments, background \npapers and case studies on subjects ranging from adolescent health to \nnuclear disarmament. OTA's well-researched and carefully reasoned \nreports are must-reading in the committees of Congress that address \nscientific issues, and in the executive branch and private industry as \nwell.\n  OTA enjoys the full support of the scientific community. The American \nAssociation for the Advancement of Science has called it:\n\n       Unique and highly respected ... [a] model for legislative \n     bodies around the world ... Its demise would have serious \n     negative impacts on Congress' ability to do its job well, and \n     on the national interest.\n\n  The prospect that OTA might be abolished has also brought expressions \nof alarm from the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of \nMedicine, and the National Academy of Engineering. It would be \ndifficult to find any serious scientific organization that is not \ndeeply concerned about the impact of this proposal on the quality of \ntechnology-related legislation.\n  The chief executive officers of Monsanto, Eastman Kodak, and many \nother Fortune 500 companies have expressed support for the agency. \nScience advisers to Republican and Democratic Presidents alike have \nendorsed OTA's preservation. These are not the reviews one would expect \nfor an irrelevant or superfluous or unneeded organization. The experts \noutside the beltway know that modest funding for OTA is a wise \ninvestment for Congress and an excellent bargain for the Nation.\n  OTA's large impact on the legislative process is out of proportion to \nits relatively small size. Let me offer just a few examples:\n  In the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, Congress debated a bill \npromoting technologies to help prevent terrorism and enhancing the \nability of law enforcement agencies to apprehend those who commit such \ncrimes. OTA had already laid the groundwork for this discussion. In \nJuly 1991 and in January 1992, OTA issued a pair of reports that \nevaluate technology for bomb detection and target hardening, airline \npassenger profiling, and other antiterrorism strategies. Not only were \nthese reports helpful to those drafting counterterrorism legislation, \nbut within days of the Oklahoma City bombing, OTA staff conducted \nindepth briefings on the subjects for Members of Congress and their \nstaffs.\n  During the floor debate on medical malpractice 2 months ago, OTA's \nlandmark studies on medical negligence and defensive medicine seemed to \nbe in the hands of every Member. Senators Kyl, McConnell, and others \nmade much of OTA's conclusion that ``the one reform consistently shown \nto reduce malpractice cost indicators is caps on damages.'' I was on \nthe other side of that debate, but I had no cause to challenge OTA's \ncredibility or impartiality.\n  OTA's study in the 1980's on polygraph testing is also a landmark \ndocument. It is recognized as the definitive review of scientific \nresearch on this topic. The report was used and cited extensively by \nthe Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, then chaired by \nSenator Hatch, during the legislative process that led to enactment of \nthe Employee Polygraph Protection Act. That bill was signed into law by \nPresident Reagan in 1988.\n  OTA has been in the forefront of efforts to evaluate the cost \neffectiveness of medical technologies. It produced the first report \ndocumenting the health and economic benefits of vaccinating the elderly \nagainst influenza. Based directly on these findings, Congress included \ncoverage for these vaccinations in Medicare, a step that has prevented \nthousands of deaths and saved millions of dollars that Medicare would \notherwise have spent on hospital costs.\n  On the other hand, OTA documented in 1989 that cholesterol screening \nof the elderly would not be cost effective. That report was a major \nfactor in the decision not to cover this screening under Medicare, \nsaving the program substantial amounts.\n  In the late 1970's research on recombinant DNA was considered \npotentially dangerous and had aroused widespread public concern. More \nthan a dozen bills had been introduced in Congress to halt genetic \nresearch. But OTA's 1981 analysis, ``Impacts of Applied Genetics,'' \nhelped to convince key Members of Congress of the economic potential of \nthis emerging science. Today, biotechnology has expanded the boundaries \nof medicine, agriculture and commerce. The United States leads the \nworld in this field, and OTA deserves a share of the credit.\n  In its report, ``Building Future Security: Strategies for \nRestructuring the U.S. Defense Industry,'' OTA conducted a \ncomprehensive analysis of defense technology and the Nation's \nindustrial base. It proposed a major restructuring of the military \nindustrial complex, in order to maintain defense capabilities during \nthe transition to the post-cold-war economy, while meeting pressing \ndomestic needs. The report has greatly assisted deliberations on this \nsubject in both the legislative and executive branches.\n  There are many other fields in which OTA's influence has been \nsubstantiated. Its work on computer technology in the classroom has \nhelped to shape important legislation on education. Over a period of \nmany years, OTA has been deeply involved in Congress' evaluation of the \nClean Air Act. When the Exxon Valdez disaster occurred off the coast of \nAlaska in 1989, OTA's suggestions on maritime precautions were \nincorporated in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.\n  These are just a few examples of timely and incisive OTA reports that \nhave improved the quality of legislation.\n  Some contend that OTA's work can be handled by other congressional \nsupport agencies. I have the utmost respect for the Congressional \nResearch Service and the General Accounting Office, but neither agency \nis equipped to take on the exceptionally challenging and specialized \ntasks of OTA. Although CRS and GAO existed 23 years ago, we recognized \nthe need at that time for a smaller but expert agency with the specific \nmission of advising Congress on science and technology. That need is \neven greater today. It would be a tragic mistake to drain the reservoir \nof expertise that OTA has developed over the past 23 years, and try to \nreinvent it in some other congressional support agency.\n  Let's be clear. This is not a budgetary issue. The amendment proposes \nno new expenditure of funds, only that a very small portion of the \nmoney already allotted for the support agencies under this bill be used \nto preserve OTA. The sole question now is structural--whether we should \nkeep OTA's expertise intact and centralized, or whether we should \ndisperse OTA's responsibilities among the other support agencies and \nsuffer the consequences.\n  One way or another, the work of technology assessment must go \nforward. It is simply a matter of common sense to keep intact the one \nagency that already knows how to do this job and meet the needs of \nCongress in this highly specialized field. Breaking up OTA in the name \nof streamlining Congress makes no sense.\n  It should also be emphasized that this amendment involves no cut in \nfunds for the Library of Congress. The concerns of Library supporters \nhave been completely addressed--the Library will not be cut.\n  In the years ahead, as we move into the 21st century, there will be \neven greater need to rely on OTA for impartial assessment of \ntechnology-related policies. The world of science and its impact on \npublic policy are becoming more complex, not less. Technology is \ncentral to every aspect of American life, from biotechnology to law \nenforcement, from agriculture to education. It would be a serious \nmistake to limit our ability as a legislature to evaluate and respond \nto the scientific and technological challenges facing Congress, the \nAdministration, and the Nation.\n  The Office of Technology Assessment has performed the task we \nassigned to it superbly. It continues to serve an indispensable role. \nIt should bear its fair share of the current budget crisis--but it \nshould not be abolished.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n \n[[Page S10383]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah,\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been listening to my colleague from \nMassachusetts. As everybody in this body knows, we do not always agree. \nIn fact, there are some that think we disagree quite often.\n  But I have to say he is right on this issue. I have watched what OTA \nhas done for the whole time I have been in the Congress. And I have to \ntell you, if you are going to shift that burden to CRS or some other \nsupport group, you are going to spend more money than you spend on OTA \nand you are not going to have the congressional benefits that come to \nCongress as a whole that you get from OTA. As a matter of fact, we have \nall kinds of Ph.D.'s at OTA. Over half, 58 percent of OTA staff hold \ndoctorates. And all of the support people that are volunteers from \noutside are the greatest scientists in the world--at least from this \ncountry--who also support OTA. And that is a benefit you cannot \nquantify because if we had to pay for all that what it is really worth, \nwe could not afford to pay for it.\n  So there is a lot to this. I do not think we should make the mistake \nof cutting OTA yet. I am the first to admit that we have to make \ncutbacks here. I think OTA has to suffer its fair share. So I am not \narguing for 100 percent of OTA's budget. I wish we could because I \nthink it is working over the long run, because this is the one arm of \nCongress that does give us, to the best of their ability, unbiased, \nscientific and technical expertise that we could not otherwise get \nwhere most everybody has confidence in what they do.\n  Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by Senator Hollings to \nrestore some funding for the Office of Technology Assessment [OTA] \nduring the next fiscal year.\n  Mr. President, my support for this amendment should not be confused \nwith a failure to recognize the very difficult task the Legislative \nBranch Subcommittee is faced with this year in making its share of \nbudget reductions. There is no question that Congress must contribute \nits share to deficit reduction, especially in light of the budget \nresolution we have just passed. I commend the managers of this bill on \nwhat they have been able to bring to the floor.\n  However, I am concerned about one of the rationales used to justify \nthe elimination of OTA. I do not agree that there is no longer a need \nfor OTA. On the contrary, I believe that Congress' need for technical \nscientific analysis will increase.\n  As our economy becomes increasingly complex and technologically \noriented, Congress will require, more than ever, an ability to \neffectively analyze technology in making policy decisions. The question \nis, Mr. President, can another support agency do the work for which OTA \nhas become recognized? Some of our colleagues believe the answer is a \nsimple yes.\n  I respectfully disagree.\n  Fifty-eight percent of OTA's staff hold Ph.D., half of which are in \nthe hard sciences. No other agency can make this claim. Nor can any \nother agency make the claim that it has the ability to call upon a \nnetwork of in excess of 5,000 technical experts from all over the \ncountry who provide the best information available on science- and \ntechnology-related topics. Nor is there the level of scrutiny and \nreview placed upon any other support agency from the time a request is \nmade to the time the product is officially released in final form.\n  The product expected from OTA and the type of review that this small, \nspecialized agency is mandated to undergo produces what I believe \neveryone in this body would agree is desirable: thorough, objective, \nand accurate analysis.\n  Relying on other, existing agencies to fulfill this mission asks \nthese organizations, whose specialty is a highly specific quick \nturnaround study, to expand capability to do more comprehensive \nassessments in areas for which they may not even have in-house \nexpertise.\n  Let me state this another way: The primary mission of OTA is not to \ndo studies for immediate use by the Congress. OTA's charter is to be \nmore forward-looking, more comprehensive, and more technical.\n  With fewer than 5 percent of Congress' membership having technical \ntraining, we cannot afford not to have this capability. Needless to \nsay, I would not be making this argument if the proposal were for a \nlegal research office.\n  This brings me to the budget implications of this amendment. And, let \nme state strongly for the record that I absolutely agree that \nreductions have to be made everywhere. I do not advocate that OTA be \nrestored to 100 percent of its current level. OTA, like all other \nfederally funded agencies and programs has to absorb its share of the \nnecessary reductions.\n  My distinguished colleague from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, has \ndone an excellent job in finding the necessary offsets so as not to \ndisrupt the overall budgetary outlays already contained in this bill \nand in the budget resolution. He has gone the extra mile to make sure \nthat these offsets are germane, that they are fair, that they are \ncognizant of the concerns that have been expressed by the affected \nagencies whose budgets will further be reduced by this amendment.\n  But I have to say, for example, under the House proposal, the \nCongressional Research Service would be required to provide the entire \n$15 million outlay for the continuance of OTA's functions, a burden \nthat is understandably quite overwhelming and, quite frankly, unfair to \nthe Library of Congress. CRS's burden under the House proposal takes on \nadded significance when you know time has been taken to ensure that the \nstructural changes required by the provision will maintain the \nintegrity of both support agencies.\n  In contrast, the Hollings amendment not only maintains OTA's \nindependence, but it does not require any additional budget outlays be \ntaken from the Library of Congress, as stipulated in the chairman's \nmark. This provision also eliminates the additional need to make the \nHouse-required structural adjustments that would create an even greater \nburden upon the Library of Congress.\n  Now, we recognize the reality that the structural adjustments will be \nnecessary as overall budget outlays shrink over the next several years. \nThe Hollings amendment stipulates that the Library of Congress undergo \nan evaluation of how the services of GAO, OTA, GPO, and CRS can be \nconsolidated by the year 2002. This is a responsible approach under the \ncircumstances. That will allow us time to ensure that the services \nprovided by OTA can be most effectively maintained over the long term \nwhile recognizing that inevitable structural and budgetary changes will \ncontinue to be necessary for the years to come.\n  All I can say is that, as a conservative who believes that we have to \ncut back, who believes we need to reach that balanced budget by the \nyear 2002, having served with OTA and understanding the interworkings \nof OTA and having watched what they have done for all the 19 years I \nhave been in the Congress, I have to say it would be a tragedy for us \nto cut it out completely. And I do not think you could find any other \narea of Government that will provide the services that we need that OTA \nprovides. And Heaven knows, in this very complex world, this complex \npresent time, we in Congress have got to have that kind of equity at \nour beck and call. OTA has provided it for us. And I hope that folks \nwill vote for the Hollings amendment.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I commend Senator Hollings for his \nleadership on this amendment, of which I am pleased to be a cosponsor.\n  I encourage all of my Senate colleagues to support this important \nmeasure.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I served on the Office of Technology \nAssessment Board from January of 1974 to January 1992. Since it was \nestablished, OTA has completed 721 studies to date. During the period I \nwas there, 18 years, I obtained board approval for four studies that \naddressed Alaska's needs.\n  For instance, we had one study that addressed our rural village \nsanitation problem in Alaska. We had another that addressed the \ntechnical feasibility of transporting some of our very abundant fresh \nwater from Alaska to California, which had been suggested to alleviate \nwater shortages there. It did not prove to be economically feasible. \n\n[[Page S10384]]\n We had another one concerning the technological considerations of \ngenerating power in very remote arctic villages. And another was the \nreview of oil production challenges in an arctic environment.\n  There were three others that touched my State in that period of time. \nOne addressed the Exxon Valdez disaster; one for oil and gas \ndevelopment in deep water, and in arctic waters in particular; and \nanother one, addressing nuclear waste in the former Soviet Union. They \nwere not particularly at my request, but I did support them.\n  I want the Senate to know that in my time on this board I became \nconvinced that this is a shared staff. And I have often referred here \non the floor of the Senate to the benefits derived from this shared \nstaff in the Office of Technology Assessment. Not only do we share \nstaff, but by virtue of the professional staff we have in the Office of \nTechnology Assessment, they attract onto Washington boards and panels \nthe leading experts of our Nation, if not the world, in the development \nof new technology.\n  I think that without this OTA, what will happen is--and now I am \nspeaking in my role as the chairman of the Rules Committee--that we \nwill face increasing demands from individual committees for funds to \nhire people to do the same thing that the OTA does. The only difference \nis we will have, as we did before OTA, several committees exploring the \nsame subject with people who are not the experts of the country and \nwithout the basic experience of the OTA in framing the issues for \nreview by Congress.\n  As I came over here today, I picked up from the edge of my desk some \nof the OTA reports that I have reviewed over the years. This is \n``Critical Connections, Communications for the Future, A Summary,'' \nprepared for the Congress in January 1990. It addressed, as my friend \nfrom South Carolina mentioned, the frequency spectrum problem. It was \nthis summary that got me thinking about frequency spectrums. And for \nthree Congresses, I asked Congress to change the policy of dealing with \nthe spectrum that the FCC has under its jurisdiction in our airwaves.\n  They used to have a policy of having a lottery when a block of \nfrequencies from the spectrum was available. It was announced, and \npeople filed an application. It was literally a lottery. There was a \ndrawing. And for $20 you got a slice of the spectrum that could be \nworth anything from nothing to $1 billion.\n  I felt that this summary would convince anybody that this system of \ndisposing of a very valuable commodity, if maintained in the future, \nwas wrong. It led to, as the Senator from South Carolina has stated, \naction finally in 1993 by the Congress. Last year we received $12 \nbillion for the sale of units of the spectrum. We have OTA to thank. At \nleast the people who have paid any attention to what is done with OTA's \nwork understand where the credit belongs.\n  Here is another one, March 1992, ``Global Standards, Building Blocks \nfor the Future.'' I keep that on my desk and find it interesting.\n  ``Finding a Balance: Computer Software, Intellectual Property and the \nChallenge of Technological Change.''\n  They have another one that I keep and I think other Senators might be \ninterested in it. It is dated June 1993: ``Advanced Network \nTechnology.''\n  They went into another background paper at our request: \n``Accessibility and Integrity of Network Information Collections.'' \nThat was later in 1993.\n  Incidentally, one of OTA's members referred me to this. It was a \ncover story of the fall issue of Up Link. Anyone who wants to catch up \nwith what we are talking about should read ``Digitally Speaking,'' a \nvery interesting article.\n  All I am telling you is, Mr. President, and Members of the Senate, \nthat this entity has led us to become aware of and become interested in \nand to try to utilize developing technology to meet the needs of the \nUnited States. I know of no other way we can get that except through \nshared staff.\n  The House has access to OTA. The Senate has access to it. We have \nequal representation on this body, Republicans and Democrats, and we \nalways have, since its inception, without regard to which party \ncontrolled the House or the Senate.\n  Now we face a challenge to the very existence of OTA, and I am \ncompelled to rise and say I think that OTA is a misguided target. I do \nbelieve, as the Senator from Utah said, we can make reductions in the \nexpenditures by OTA. We have made a 15-percent reduction in the staffs \nof every committee in the Senate. There is no reason why we could not \nmake a 15-percent reduction in OTA, and that was the intent.\n  But now we face a question of obliteration of the OTA. I want to tell \nthe Senate that I believe the studies that I have seen by OTA have been \nat the request of a Senate committee or a House committee or by \nindividual Senators, but none of them goes through without approval of \nthe OTA board. None of them go through without a majority of the vote \nof three Members of each party from each House.\n  This is a very restrained board in terms of committing money of the \nUnited States. I have not agreed with some of the studies, and the \nrecord will show I voted against some of them. I voted against some of \nthem because I did not think they involved the assessment of \ntechnology. They involved trying to pursue the application of \ntechnology. But if we keep to the subject and restrict the OTA to what \nit was intended to do, it is one of the most valuable entities I have \nfound in the Senate to get access to material that is current about \ntechnology.\n  We are entering an era now of technology expanding at an explosive \nrate, the likes of which the world has never seen. We are going to see \ndevelopments--and I saw Amo sitting here a while ago, our good friend \nMr. Houghton from the House. Talk to him sometime about fiber optics \nand how it came about that we have that concept now in the world.\n  We are looking at technology. We are at the edge of a precipice, Mr. \nPresident. The precipice is one that we can fall down into a chasm or \nwe can analyze the way to get across that chasm into a future that is \nso bright you can hardly imagine it.\n  I was talking to some of my interns today, and they asked me about \nwhat we are going to do in my State when the oil runs out, what happens \nto our State, supported primarily by oil revenues. I remarked to them \nabout Mr. Houghton's company. Who would have thought in the days gone \nby we would take grains of sand from a beach and turn it into the most \ncapable means of conveyance of communications known to man.\n  When it comes down to it, we have used technology in this country to \nstay ahead militarily, to stay ahead economically, to meet the needs of \nour people, and yet here we are about ready to do away with the one \nentity in the Congress that tries to collate and analyze and deliver to \nMembers of Congress credible, timely reports on the development of \ntechnology.\n  I believe, more than most people realize, that we are changing the \ncourse of history in this Congress, but this is not one of the \nhallmarks of that change. This entity ought to be out in the forefront \nof that change, and it will not be unless it is properly funded and \nmaintained. I support this amendment.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the recognition \nof Senator Dole at 5 p.m. be postponed for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of retaining the Office \nof Technology Assessment. I support the agency and hope that my \ncolleagues will consider it favorably.\n  OTA is a unique and valuable asset of the Congress. For many years it \nwas also unique to the United States; but within the past few years, it \nhas been used as a model by many democratic nations for establishing \ntheir own technology assessment organizations.\n  OTA is a small agency with 143 permanent employees and an annual \nbudget of $22 million. The agency analyzes science and technology \nissues in depth for the Congress. It provides Congress with objective, \nnonpartisan reports and offers options for Members in dealing with \nrelated public policy issues. Its \n\n[[Page S10385]]\nstudies are initiated by full committees of the Senate and/or House and \nare approved by the Technology Assessment Board, TAB, which oversees \nthe agency. That Board consists of six Senators and six \nRepresentatives, equally divided by party.\n  OTA is a first rate scientific organization. Its retention has been \nsupported by the National Academy of Sciences, the American Association \nfor the Advancement of Science, the American Physical Society, Dr. \nSally Ride, and a host of important companies, such as TRW.\n  OTA is unique on the Hill because of the bipartisan Technology \nAssessment Board. No other support agency has such a mechanism to \nensure balance between the interests of both Houses and of both \nparties. This structure is instrumental in keeping the work objective \nand balanced, as well as acting as a priority-setting mechanism for the \nwork that is conducted, ensuring that it has broad interest. It enables \nCongress to leverage OTA's limited resources to greatest effect.\n  OTA works almost entirely on a bipartisan basis, doing major projects \nrequested by both chairmen and ranking minority members. Since 1980, 79 \npercent of OTA reports have been requested on a bipartisan basis.\n  OTA is unique to the Hill in that no such bipartisan organization \ncould exist in the executive branch. For many years, the party holding \nthe majority in Congress did not control the White House. That is again \nthe case. Many of us find OTA's independent, bipartisan analysis very \nhelpful under these circumstances; we do not have to rely on the \ninformation and analysis supplied by the executive agencies. \nFurthermore, over the years, OTA has developed an excellent working \nrelationship with executive agencies--based in part on their \nbipartisanship, in part on their impartiality, and in part on their \nprofessionalism. No other congressional entity elicits this type of \ncooperation from Federal agencies.\n  I want to illustrate this with an anecdote. A few years ago the \nNational Institute of Justice at the Justice Department was at odds \nwith industry over standards and testing for police body armor, known \nas bullet-proof vests. They consulted with Republican and Democratic \nstaffs of the Senate Judiciary Committee to try to break the impasse,\n but the committee realized it was dealing with technical issues beyond \nits depth. Finally, the NIJ suggested--and the committee readily \nconcurred--that the problem should be turned to OTA. OTA's reputation \nfor impartiality would give it the credibility to solve the problem, \nwhich it did.\n\n  OTA leverages its core staff by making extensive use of outside \nadvisory groups, workshops, contractors, reviewers, drawn from both \nGovernment and the private sector, here and abroad. Unlike many other \nagencies, the OTA process ensures that OTA gets extensive input from \noutside the beltway. Every year, over 5,000 experts help us better \nunderstand the complex issues that we need to understand to legislate \neffectively. But unlike some executive agencies or institutes like the \nNational Academy of Science, OTA does not impanel groups that get \ntogether to deliver wisdom while the staff merely writes what they say.\n  In OTA assessments, it is the staff that writes the reports. They \nlisten to advice, get outside review, and eventually pass products \nthrough the TAB to certify that they are unbiased. Outside experts and \nstakeholders do not write the reports. They provide guidance and advice \nand collective expertise often well beyond OTA's. But OTA staff filters \nand assimilates this, uses it in conducting analyses, and seeks further \nreview.\n  OTA's work differs from other congressional support agencies because \nits work is based only in the science and technology area; the \ninformation is not readily available for look-up in the immediate \nscientific literature; it is not an audit of a current issue or a \nproject of costs. The indepth process and review of the issues is \nunique only to OTA, and the scientific and technological expertise of \nOTA's staff facilitates this approach. With the budget reductions other \ncongressional support agencies are making, it is unrealistic to assume \nthey could pick up OTA's work.\n  I come from a region that understands that high technology is the \narea of the future that will provide us the jobs and information that \nwe need. That is what OTA is all about. It does not get information \nfrom here. It goes all the way across the Nation to my State to help \nestablish the policies and procedures we need in this Senate. It has \nbeen highly reliable, and I think it would be a grave mistake for this \nCongress to lose it.\n  I did hear one of my colleagues say that we need to consolidate. Who \nwould not agree in this time of budget cuts? But I remind my colleagues \nthat in the Hollings amendment he requires the Librarian of Congress to \nreport to Congress within 120 days on how they could consolidate the \nOTA, GPO, and GAO. I think that amendment looks to their \nrecommendations, which I think is reliable. We need the agencies to \ntell us how they can be efficient and reach those goals. I remind my \ncolleagues, also, that I have heard some say, ``If we cannot cut here, \nwhere can we cut?''\n  This bill in front of us cuts $200 million. It shows where \neffectively we can cut. I remind everyone that OTA is cut by 25 percent \nin this amendment. This is a very important agency to me. I hope we do \nnot lose it this year, because I think we will see what the future \nbrings us, and that technology and science is even more critical in the \nyears to come.\n  Mr. MACK. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe until 5:15, which is approximately \n10 or 11 minutes.\n  Mr. MACK. I ask the Senator from South Carolina how much additional \ntime he would need?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. As the distinguished Senator from Florida knows, I do \nnot need very much time. I am trying to respond to a request that we \nhave on this side to vote around 5:45. Is that agreeable?\n  Mr. MACK. I must say to the Senator that I was under the impression \nthat he and I would be the last to speak on this issue, and I had asked \nfor a delay of recognition of Senator Dole until 5:15, with the \nintention of having a vote at 5:15. I understand that it would be the \nintention of the Senator to delay his vote until 5:45.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I have a request on this side by the leader here.\n  Mr. MACK. Then at this point, I will suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, this debate has gone on for some time now \nwith respect to OTA. I will attempt to make my comments brief. While it \nwas mentioned a moment ago that OTA is unique to the Hill, or to the \nSenate, it is not unique, though, in what has happened to it.\n  The Office of Technology Assessment was begun, I believe, in 1972. \nThe idea was that it would be a small cadre of individuals, to make \nsome decisions, would gather information together as to what scientific \nand technical data is available and provide that to Members of the \nCongress.\n  We now have an Office of Technology Assessment that has 203 people, \nwith an expenditure of over $23 million annually. Again, those folks \nhave said that we need a counterbalance to the administration. Well, it \nis interesting that the administration has something like just under $5 \nmillion in its budget for its science advisor, with 39 people.\n  Another point I will make is that I was called by a number of people \nasking me to reconsider the proposal to eliminate the Office of \nTechnology Assessment. One of those individuals that called me said, \n``Frankly, after I found out what was going on at OTA, I thought it was \na small cadre of individuals, a small tight-knit group that would get \nthis information out to Members of the Congress, and I found they had \n$23 million for their budget.'' He said, ``That should not be.''\n  There is a sense that if we eliminate OTA, somehow science and \ntechnology in America will come to a crashing halt. Again, earlier \ntoday we heard about the significance of a grain of sand, if you will. \nA grain of sand has \n\n[[Page S10386]]\nturned out to be a very significant item on this planet, which is, in \nessence, responsible for the computer. Is it not interesting that the \ncomputers we deal with today, somehow or another, magically occurred \nwithout the Office of Technology Assessment in the Congress of the \nUnited States?\n  During our committee hearings, we had testimony and review of a \nnumber of documents. Again, this is the Office of Technology \nAssessment. Here is a report entitled ``Understanding Estimates of \nNational Health Expenditures Under Health Reform.''\n  I make the claim that, frankly, that has very little to do with the \nOffice of Technology Assessment.\n  There is study after study where there is duplication, where we \nbasically--when I say duplication, I mean duplication in the sense of \nthe outside, where we can turn to America and ask them for information \nthat is available. We do not need to spend $23 million in a year in \norder to bring that about.\n  Another point: I think that probably one of the most significant \nscientific debates or debates about technology that we have had in the \nCongress in years is the issue of the super collider. Interestingly \nenough, there was no report from OTA on the super collider, again, one \nof the most significant new technologies that the Congress was \nconsidering.\n  There are those who say that now that we have the budget battle out \nof the way, this is really not an issue about whether we will cut $200 \nmillion; it is a question of where.\n  Mr. President, I refer to a chart behind me showing the history of \nGAO's full-time equivalent. We began the process in 1993 to reduce the \nstaff and the size of GAO. It has gone from 5,150 down to 3,865 as \nproposed under this bill. It is going to go further as a result of what \nwe do in 1997, and what is proposed in this bill as well. This \namendment says we ought to go further.\n  Chuck Bowsher, the Comptroller General of the United States, was not \nhappy to learn that over a 2-year period we would reduce his budget by \n25 percent, but he worked with us. We asked him the best way to go \nabout it, and we worked out a plan. We will cut $68 million from GAO \nthis year. Now, with this amendment, GAO will be asked to cut an \nadditional $7 million out of their budget.\n  This is the wrong way to do it. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues \nto vote against this amendment. This is only the beginning of the \ndebate. Imagine, here it is, the first appropriations bill, we have \nsuggested eliminating the OTA, an agency, in essence, which we believe \nis not necessary because we believe we can get the information from a \nwhole series of sources. And we are hearing stories here on the floor \nof the Senate that basically say if we eliminate OTA, we will end the \ntechnology revolution in America. Mr. President, that is impossible \nbecause the technology revolution in America is driven in the private \nsector, not in Government. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I understand we are trying to terminate \ndebate on this particular amendment and then the leader wishes a vote \non another matter.\n  Let me thank Members for the bipartisan support and the experts that \nwe have heard in the debate, especially the distinguished ranking \nmember of our committee, who has studied it closely. We made the cuts. \nWe were using a $22 million figure. The distinguished chairman now of \nthat subcommittee says it is $23 million, so now it amounts to more \nthan a 30-percent cut that we are cutting the Office of Technology \nAssessment.\n  When he talks of the number of employees, Mr. President, there are \n4,707 employees over there at GAO. I think we perhaps ought to \nconsolidate it a little bit more.\n  These arguments that we have heard out of the whole cloth, never have \nI heard that the Office of Technology Assessment never studied one of \nthe greatest advancements in science and technology, the super \ncollider. They certainly did not, because they have to be asked by \nthese committees, and the committee chairmen were already in favor of \nit, and they did not want that study. Now, if we had that studied, and \nthey asked, we would have had it, and we might have done away with the \nsuper collider a lot quicker, which perhaps the Senator from Florida \nand I and the Senator from Nevada and I agree on. It is $36 billion in \nresearch and studies and development over in the Pentagon--billions. \nThe distinguished Senator from Nevada says we have to economize. But \nthen the Senator from Utah says, ``Wait a minute. We have to look at \nthe entire Government.''\n  I do not know how to satisfy these arguments. We have worked to \nprotect the Library of Congress in this amendment and hope that our \ncolleagues will support us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Under the previous order, the \nhour of 5:15 having arrived, it is time to recognize the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I move to table the Hollings amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Before we start the vote, I will enter a unanimous-consent \nrequest. I am waiting for Senator Daschle. In that request will be \nthat, regardless of the outcome of the cloture vote, notwithstanding \nrule XXII, immediately following the cloture vote, Senator Mack be \nrecognized to move to table the Hollings amendment. He has done that. \nSo the vote will occur on the motion to table the amendment No. 1808.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as I understand it, the unanimous-consent \nagreement just propounded by the majority leader would then require two \nrecorded votes beginning at 6:15.\n  Mr. DOLE. I did not propound it. I wanted to wait until the Senator \nwas on the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10373-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA SELF-DEFENSE ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I think we have an agreement on Bosnia. \n\n[[Page S10387]]\n\n  Let me indicate, as I said last night, I did have a phone visit with \nthe President of the United States, and obviously I want to cooperate \nwith the President. I think we now have an agreement that does that. I \nthank the Democratic leader.\n  I ask unanimous consent that S. 21 be temporarily laid aside; that on \nTuesday, July 25, the majority leader, after notification of the \nminority leader, may resume consideration of S. 21, the Bosnia Self-\nDefense Act, and the following amendments be the only first-degree \namendments in order to the Dole substitute, and they be subject to \nrelevant second degrees, following a failed motion to table: There be a \nNunn amendment, relevant; Nunn amendment, U.S. participation; Nunn \namendment, multilateral embargo; Nunn amendment, relevant. Two Nunn \nrelevant amendments. Four amendments by the distinguished Democratic \nleader or his designee, relevant amendments; a Byrd amendment, \nrelevant; Kerry of Massachusetts amendment, relevant.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that, following the disposition of \nthe above-listed amendments, the Senate proceed to vote on the Dole \nsubstitute, as amended, if amended, to be followed by third reading, \nand there be 4 hours of debate equally divided between Senator Dole and \nSenator Nunn, and then final passage of S. 21 as amended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. So, Mr. President, now we have the 1-hour debate before the \ncloture vote. Senator Johnston is here, Senator Roth is here, and there \nwill be a cloture vote and then we will be back on the legislative \nappropriations bill. Hopefully we can finish that tonight.\n  Then, we will have the debate, hopefully, on the rescissions bill \ntonight. I will be talking with the Democratic leader about that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think the two unanimous-consent \nagreements are ones we feel very, very encouraged by. I think there is \nlittle likelihood that all of the amendments that were listed in the \nunanimous-consent agreement dealing with Bosnia will be utilized, but I \nthink it does allow for whatever extenuating circumstances may occur as \na result of the ongoing meetings. But I certainly appreciate the \ncooperation and the sensitivity demonstrated by the majority leader on \nthis issue. I hope at some point next week we can finalize our work on \nthis resolution, however it may turn out. So tonight, I hope we can \nhave a good debate on the cloture motion and also complete our work on \nthe rescissions bill so we leave nothing other than the votes tomorrow \nmorning on the rescissions package.\n  There is a good deal of work we can do tonight. I hope Members are \nall aware that there will be additional votes, at least two additional \nvotes tonight and perhaps more, subject to whatever else may be brought \nup as a result of legislative appropriations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield me 10 \nminutes?\n  Mr. HATCH. Could the Senator take 5 now and if he needs more I will \nbe happy to?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, it is like that tennis match I saw the \nother night, where the games were even and they were in the tie \nbreaker. It is 6-all, in the tie breaker, and there is 1 point that is \ngoing to make the difference. And it is this vote. The question is, \nDoes regulatory reform survive or not? Mr. President, it will survive \nif this cloture vote is granted.\n  We have been told that there is ongoing negotiation. I can tell you, \nthere are at least three points which are not solvable, and upon which \nnegotiation is not getting closer but is getting further away. Let me \nexplain those three points.\n  First, can you review existing rules? All of those rules out there \nwhich have been adopted, some without consideration of science, some \nwithout the foggiest notion as to what they would cost, some defying \nlogic, some being adopted in opposition to what their own scientists \nhave said--can you review those existing rules?\n  In the Dole-Johnston substitute, you can review those existing rules. \nIn the Glenn substitute, there is no right to review existing rules.\n  Second, the question of what we call decisional criteria. That is a \nvery minimum, commonsense rule that says in order to have a rule you \nhave to be able to certify that the benefits justify the cost. Mr. \nPresident, you would think that would be not only common sense but that \nwould be a rule of logic, a rule of proceeding as to which all Federal \nbureaucrats would adhere. But there is a gulf between the two sides in \nthis dispute. We have decisional criteria. The Glenn substitutes have \nwhat you might call standards for discussion. That is, you can discuss \nwhether or not the benefits justify the cost, but it is not a test and \nit is not going to be used by anybody in determining the reasonableness \nor the arbitrariness of that regulation.\n  Finally, there is a question of whether the court can review the risk \nassessment, or the cost-benefit ratio for determining whether or not \nthat rule is arbitrary and capricious. I will read the latest draft.\n\n       The adequacy of compliance or failure to comply shall not \n     be grounds for remanding or invalidating a final agency \n     action.\n       The adequacy of compliance or the failure to comply shall \n     not be grounds for remanding or invalidating a final agency \n     action.\n\n  In other words, it does not matter how bad this risk assessment is; \nit does not matter how central the science is to the question to be \ndone; it does not matter whether it is junk science that uses all \nscientists on one side of a question; it does not matter how \nunreasonable, how outrageous the failure is to comply with the risk \nassessment or cost-benefit analysis--the court may not remand that case \nto cure that error. That is exactly what we are asked to do.\n  Mr. President, we are getting nowhere fast. In my view, it is a \nquestion of whether you want real regulatory reform or whether you want \nsham regulatory reform. If you want sham, really if you want business \nas usual, then vote no on cloture, because that is what you will get \nand you will be able to go around and say how great these bureaucrats \nare and what a good job they are doing, because they are going \n\n[[Page S10388]]\nto continue to do exactly what they are doing now.\n  If cloture is voted, and I hope and trust it will be, there are a lot \nof amendments we are perfectly willing to consider.\n  But there has to be an end to this process. We cannot have amendments \nout of the expanding file where they keep coming and they keep coming.\n  Mr. President, the things that we have solved here--judicial review, \nwe thought we had solved that; supermandate, we accepted their \nlanguage; we thought we had solved decisional criteria; we thought we \nhad solved agency overload, had taken Sally Katzen's own concept; we \ndropped the Tucker Act; we dropped the chevron language; we upped the \nthreshold from $50 million to $100 million; we gave new language on \nTRI; we are willing to do more; we are willing to discuss the Delaney \nrule; we did away with Superfund. Mr. President, we have done a lot. I \nthink we have solved all the problems. Sally Katzen gave a list of nine \nfaults with the original Johnston proposal. And I think we have solved \nall nine of them.\n  Now we have found that some of our solutions use the words of the \nopponents--conceding to them. They used those very words against us \nwhich they admitted, which they confected. They used those words \nagainst us. Mr. President, I do not think it is reasonable.\n  I hope my colleagues will bring this debate to an end so we can get \non with the amendment process, and so we can pass a bill. Otherwise, it \nis R.I.P. It is so long to risk assessment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I do not really recognize what has happened \nhere by the description we just heard on the floor. We have been \nnegotiating in good faith. There has been a lot of progress made. We \nstarted out with decisional criteria. They wanted a least-cost. We \nwanted cost-benefit. The compromise was made that we go to greater net \nbenefits.\n  Some of the departments still have some problems with that. We are \nworking some of those things out. So we have made progress in that \narea.\n  Judicial review--it went to the final rule. But one of the real \nkillers in this is the fact that we still have unlimited new petition \nprocesses. That is just a way of saying that anybody that has an \ninterest in killing any particular legislation or any particular \nregulation will have the opportunity by the possibility of not just a \nfew but hundreds and hundreds of potential routes in the petition \nprocess by which they can prevent legislation or prevent regulations \nbeing written that might benefit all of America. Yet, they can stop it \nwith this particular bill with those petition processes. That is a \nkiller. We made some proposals on that.\n  It was my understanding, in talking to the majority leader on the \nfloor about an hour and a half ago, that maybe there was some give in \nthat area and perhaps we would be willing to talk about the petition \nprocess, which they were not willing to do before.\n  Another one that is a killer on this is going to require that when an \nagency reviews the rule that all reasonable alternatives have to be \nconsidered. That is an infinite direction. That is a direction to do \nsomething that is probably not possible to do, to take all reasonable \nalternatives. We wanted to do what the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana proposed back several days ago, and that was limit that to \nperhaps just three or four. We were willing to do that. That is fine.\n  The sunset provision on this, we made progress in that particular \narea.\n  On the special interest section, there were proposals made on that \nthat they were willing to discuss. The toxics release inventory, we \nwant to do that.\n  At each step along the way what has happened is when we have gotten a \nletter, a proposal that listed the real answers to some questions we \nhad, we have responded. We are in that same position right now. We are \nresponding. A letter will go back which we worked on early today and \nearlier this afternoon. That letter is going back right now proposing \nsome give and take in these particular areas.\n  Why we have to go to a cloture vote now I do not know. My own \npersonal bottom line on these things has narrowed down through all of \nthis process over the last 2 weeks to the no new petition process, to \nlimiting the reasonable alternatives to three or four, as was already \nagreed to, and to striking that section on special interests. That is \nthe one that is a real killer as far as health and safety goes because \nit leaves the toxics release inventory. It takes it out. It takes out \nDelaney which needs modification but not just elimination. And food \nsafety, health, things like that go by the board.\n  So I just disagree strongly that we have not made considerable \nprogress on this bill.\n  Now let me start with some truths in this debate. We have heard lots \nof horror stories about bad regulations on the floor from the \nproponents of S. 343. I do not have to hear those on the floor. I get \nenough of them when I go back home. Many of the stories brought out on \nthe floor here were just plain false. I gave the rebuttal to some of \nthose things on the floor here where we think they went too far. Some \nof the ones were completely valid. We have pointed them out on the \nfloor too.\n  Let me respond to several of the accusations that the Senator from \nLouisiana has made about the Glenn-Chafee bill.\n  He says our lookback provisions for review of existing rules has ``no \nteeth.'' That is wrong. We do have judicial review of the agency \nrequirements to review rules, but we do not let special interests \npetition to put rules on the list. Instead, we provide a process where \ninterest groups can appeal to Congress to have a rule reviewed. And \nthat makes more sense. It is more fair.\n  He says our judicial review language allows more avenues into \nreviewing parts of cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment than the \nDole-Johnston bill. I do not feel that is true. In fact, I think it is \nnot true. We state explicitly in our language that ``the court shall \nnot review to determine whether the analysis or assessment conformed to \nthe particular requirements'' of cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment. We would like them to do the same. I think we are making \nprogress in that area, too.\n  Senator Johnston wrote a letter to me, Senator Biden and Senator \nBaucus in March of this year stating all of his concerns with the Dole \nbill as it was then. Many of the issues he raised --like too much \njudicial review and the petition process--are still valid problems in \nthe Dole-Johnston bill. In fact, he stated explicitly in his letter \nthat he did not agree with a petition process for the review of rules. \nNow he is calling the Glenn-Chafee bill weak for not having such a \nprocess.\n  No. 3, many have accused us of not really being serious about \nregulatory reform. Let me give you a little background on our good-\nfaith effort to put together a viable regulatory reform package.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee reported out a strong regulatory \nreform bill with full bipartisan support 15 to nothing, coming out of \ncommittee with 8 Republicans and 7 Democrats. This bill formed the \nbasis for the Glenn-Chafee substitute. It is a strong, a balanced \napproach to regulatory reform. It will relieve the regulatory burden on \nbusinesses as well as protect the environment, the health, and the \nsafety of the American people.\n  On the other hand, the Judiciary Committee, on which the Dole-\nJohnston bill is based, had a very divisive debate on this bill, and \nthey ended up reporting out the bill without amendment.\n  Before bringing the Dole-Johnston bill to the floor, we sat down with \nthe supporters of S. 343 and had very serious negotiations on two \ndifferent occasions. We outlined our concerns; we provided written \nchanges to their language. And for the most part our concerns were \ndismissed out of hand.\n  Now, after a strong vote on the Glenn-Chafee substitute and two \nlosing cloture votes, they wanted us to come back to the table and \nnegotiate one more time. And we did that yesterday because we want \nregulatory reform.\n  I am as dedicated to regulatory reform as anybody in this body. We \nneed it. But we want commonsense reform. We do not want regulatory \nrollback that is disguised in the rhetoric of regulatory reform. We \ncannot tie the agencies up in unneeded bureaucratic \n\n[[Page S10389]]\nsteps for a variety of new lawsuits. That is not regulatory reform. \nThat is what this bill does.\n  We gave Senator Hatch a list of changes that were necessary before we \ncould consider supporting the Dole-Johnston bill. They appear to be \nmoving on a few important issues. Today they are proposing to:\n  First, change--this was yesterday--change the ``least cost'' language \nin decisional criteria and replaced it with ``greater net benefits.''\n  Second, modify a few parts of their judicial review language, \nincluding getting rid of ``interlocutory review,'' which is \nencouraging. However, there are still some questions in this area.\n  Third, they would possibly adopt the sunset language in the Glenn-\nChafee bill.\n  Fourth, they said they would discuss the toxics release inventory.\n  But these are not definite changes, and, even so, this bill still has \nsignificant problems. First, it has six new petition processes. All, \nexcept one, are judicially reviewable and must be granted or denied by \nan agency within a certain period. This is just a formula to tie up the \nagencies and prevent them from doing their jobs effectively.\n  They do not change the effective date of this bill. That means that \nas soon as this bill becomes law everything on that date must \nimmediately comply with the many rigorous requirements of this bill. \nThis captures all the rules that are out there in the pipeline right \nnow, and will send agencies back to square one on some regulations \ndelaying them unnecessarily.\n  This is a poor use of Government resources.\n  Third, they still have special interest fixes. They say they are \nwilling to discuss TRI, and we want to talk about that. But making a \ncloture vote now does not permit that to happen right now. We think \nthese provisions simply do not belong in a regulatory reform bill. The \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and the Judiciary Committee have held no \nhearings on these issues. In effect, we are taking jurisdiction away \nfrom the committees of normal jurisdiction in these areas. These are \nspecial interest fixes, clear and simple.\n  Fourth, they still have major changes to the Administrative Procedure \nAct, including adding new petitions. These are unnecessary. They will \nonly add to litigation.\n  Fifth, too many rules are covered, given the Nunn amendment that \nsweeps in any rule that has a significant impact on small businesses. \nThese are just some of the major issues still outstanding.\n  Now, we still want to work in good faith with Senator Hatch, Senator \nDole, Senator Johnston, and others, but we do not want medicine that is \nworse than the disease itself. And we need sensible, balanced, \nregulatory reform. The bill as it is now would permit any interest \ngroup to tie up in legislation anything for an indefinite period of \ntime that they did not want to see go through. That is not reg reform. \nThat is regulatory favoritism for the favored few. I do not see that \nthat does anything for the American people.\n  Under the Glenn-Chafee bill----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 10 minutes has elapsed.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield myself another 2 minutes.\n  What we do in that bill is try to hit a balance. We provide redress \nfor reg reform that has gone too far. We provide review over a period \nof time for every single law, every single rule and reg that is out \nthere now. At the same time, we do not dump all of the health and \nsafety regulations that have been built up over the last 25 years, just \ntoss them out or have the possibility by the processes we are providing \nin this law of throwing them out.\n  That would be a mistake. We do not want to throw out the baby with \nthe bath water. What we set up in our bill, the Glenn-Chafee bill, was \nan even-handed approach to this thing. All you can say when you are \nsetting up a bill like the Dole-Johnston bill that provides means by \nwhich any interested party can prevent a rule or regulation from going \ninto effect for an indefinite period of time--and that is exactly what \nthis bill does--it cannot be termed anything except regulatory \nfavoritism. That is not in the best interests of the American people.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I would like to compliment my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Hatch, from Utah and also Senator Roth, \nfrom Delaware, for their patience in working on this bill. I will admit \nthat they have shown greater patience than myself. They have, I think, \ndone an outstanding job in managing this bill. It is a very difficult \nbill. I also want to compliment the majority leader of the Senate, Mr. \nDole.\n  I will tell you, we are going to have this third cloture vote, and I \nthink this is the vote. I have heard some of my colleagues say, well, \nwe need to make some more adjustments. We have made I think over 100 \nadjustments to this bill. I might go through a list, or maybe put a \nlist in the Record, of some of the changes we made.\n  I remember 10 days ago they said we need to increase the threshold \nfrom $50 to $100 million. That has been done. We need to eliminate the \nprovisions dealing with Superfund. That has been done. We need to \nclarify that it does not jeopardize health and safety. We have done \nthat as well. We have had many people mention that it does have a \nsupermandate in it. We said, no, it does not have a supermandate. It \ndoes not override the law.\n  Mr. President, my point is that we have bent over backwards to \nnegotiate with our friends and colleagues who have different views, but \nwe have to draw this thing to a closure. We have to have it come to a \nconclusion. We need to have, unfortunately, cloture. I say \nunfortunately; I do not like cloture. But if we are going to end this \nbill, we have to have cloture. We have over 250 amendments filed--250 \namendments--many of which are very arbitrary. Some are serious.\n  I wish to compliment my friend and colleague, Senator Johnston from \nLouisiana, because he has worked tirelessly to put this package \ntogether. Is it perfect? No. But is it a giant step toward reining in \nunnecessary and overly expensive regulations? Yes, it is. And it needs \nto pass. The cost of regulations today exceeds $6,000 per family. And \nthat is growing out of control. We need to rein it in. This is the bill \nto do it.\n  We cannot do it if we do not get cloture. I do not think we are going \nto have another cloture vote. I think this is it. If we do not get \ncloture today, my guess is we are killing this bill for this Congress, \nand a lot of people have worked too hard for that to happen. For all my \ncolleagues who say they want regulatory reform, if they want it, they \nneed to vote for cloture. We will have the opportunity to make some \nadjustments to improve the bill if that is necessary.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and let us pass a positive \nbill that will rein in unnecessary regulations.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am going to vote for cloture on the next \nvote, this vote coming up. If regulatory reform means rules that are \nmore cost effective and based on better science and information, then I \nam for regulatory reform. I continue to believe that the Senate can \nproduce a good regulatory reform bill. So I will vote for debate on \nthis bill to go forward.\n  Now, I do not think this bill is perfect. There are over 200 \namendments pending to this bill. Some of these amendments, if enacted, \nwould roll back the progress that has been made to protect health and \nthe environment over the past 25 years. Every Senator will be reserving \njudgment on that final vote to see the final package when the day is \ndone. In other words, this is no commitment on my part to vote for the \nfinal bill. We will see what it looks like.\n  If cloture succeeds, I will be working to improve this bill. I have \nspoken to Senators Hatch and Roth about provisions that continue to \ncause me concern, and they have agreed with some of those concerns and \npromised to work with me on those items.\n  Let me say I am grateful to the majority leader and to the Senator \nfrom \n\n[[Page S10390]]\nUtah Mr. [Hatch] and the Senator from Delaware, Mr. [Roth] for their \nwillingness to address the concerns that I have expressed. We have put \ntogether a package of amendments that will be offered later. They have \npromised support for those amendments. They will make several changes \nto this bill that will resolve some of my major concerns.\n  This package of amendments will strike the provision in the bill that \nrequires agencies to pick the least costly regulatory option. That will \nno longer be required. They will not be required to pick the least \ncostly option. Instead, they are to select the option that provides the \ngreatest net benefit. Now, this is a very significant change.\n  This package that we are talking about makes several changes to the \njudicial review provisions, including deletion of the item that would \nhave required substantial support in the record for all the facts on \nwhich the rule is based. That is deleted.\n  The package also deletes the automatic sunset of existing rules. It \nscales back the large number of petitions that could be filed under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act. These amendments will definitely improve \nthis bill.\n  It is time, in my judgment, to complete work on this and move on to \nother important business in the Senate. We have a lot before us. If we \nwork hard, we can get a good regulatory reform bill.\n  Mr. President, I will certainly be striving to achieve that.\n  Mr. COHEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would.\n  Mr. COHEN. I would like to associate myself with the Senator's \nremarks and indicate that I wish to commend him for the effort he has \nmade to try to persuade our colleagues to move closer to the position \nof the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. President, I have been engaged in the debate over regulatory \nreform since February when the Government Affairs Committee held a \nseries of hearing on the issue. I was involved in the negotiations over \nthe bill that emerged from the committee and held a field hearing in \nApril where Mainers had an opportunity to express both support for and \nopposition to regulatory reform.\n  I have also carefully watched the debate that has transpired on the \nSenate floor over the past 2 weeks. Tuesday there was a vigorous debate \non the Glenn-Chafee substitute, which, to my disappointment, was \nnarrowly defeated.\n  I believe that there has been sufficient time for all views to be \naired and that extended debate has let to substantive improvements in \nDole-Johnson bill. S. 343 has changed a great deal since its \nintroduction. Its supermandate has been significantly modified, its \npetition process has been narrowed, and the scope of judicial review \nhas been reduced. Due to an amendment on the floor, the threshold for \nrules to qualify for cost-benefit analysis has been raised from $50 to \n$100 million, a change that will help agencies target resources at \nremedying rules that impose the greatest burden on the economy.\n  Additional negotiations have taken place during this week, since the \nfirst cloture petition failed, and some additional concessions have \nbeen made to opponents of the bill. I believe that both sides have \nnegotiated in good faith, and I applaud Senators Hatch and others \ninvolved in the process for accepting a number of reasonable changes to \nthe underlying bill.\n  While these changes do not go far enough to ameliorate the concerns I \nhave previously expressed about the bill, there comes a time when the \nmajority must be permitted to impose its will. I believe that time has \nnow come.\n  I would prefer to see a bill that relied more on Congress to improve \nthe regulatory system than the courts, and I would like to try more \nincremental reform instead of flooding our agencies with such \nburdensome analytical requirements that their effectiveness may be \nhampered.\n  Yesterday I had occasion to discuss this legislation with Philip \nHoward, author of the book that has been cited dozens of time during \nthe course of this debate, ``The Death of Common Sense.'' To summarize \nhis views, the man who wrote the book about common sense believes that \nthe bill, in its current form, does not make sense. Its over reliance \non litigation and Rube-Goldbergesque petition process will complicate \nthe regulatory process instead of streamlining it. We might well do \nbetter to start all over again and try to come up with a bill that is \nless complicated, but would achieve the goal of meaningful regulatory \nreform.\n  Even though I have been unable to convince my colleagues on these \nissues, I will not stand in the way of permitting an up or down vote on \nthe approach that they support. But if cloture is obtained, I will vote \nagainst the bill.\n  Even if the bill passes the Senate, there remains a long way to go \nbefore the bill becomes law. The legislation that passed the House is \nclearly unacceptable. By voting for cloture today, I am not suggesting \nthat I will vote for cloture on a conference report that contains the \nsame defects as the House bill or exacerbates the weaknesses of the \nSenate bill.\n  But the time has come for the process to move forward. I still hold \nout hope that the bill will continue to be improved and a bipartisan \nregulatory reform bill will be enacted into law during this session of \nCongress.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I think we share those concerns. We do not \nhave any idea what will emerge from conference, and we are not sure \nwhat is going to happen to these amendments that are before us that \nwill be taken up. So my commitment is to vote for cloture. That \ncompletes my commitment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield 7 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think most Members of this body want a \nstrong regulatory reform bill. I hope most Members of this body also \nwant to make sure that we preserve important health, safety, and \nenvironmental protections. The problem with the current version, the \nmost recent version of the bill before us, is that it fails both tests. \nThe bill before us has such procedural complications, so many grounds \nfor litigation, so many appeals to court, that it will not cure the \npatient. And this patient is sick. It is going to choke this patient \nwith litigation that for the first time will be permitted on just about \nevery request that is made to an agency. Under this bill, for the first \ntime, if you make a request to an agency for an interpretation of a \ngeneral statement of policy, then the letter that you get back from the \nagency--and there are tens of thousands of these letters--is subject to \njudicial review.\n  We have not had judicial review of agency letters giving guidance, \nstatements of policy, or interpretations of interpretive rules. For the \nfirst time; for the first time.\n  Probably 90 percent of the paper that comes out of an agency in terms \nof giving guidance to small business people is going to be subject to \nlitigation. This is not curing the patient, this is killing the \npatient. This is choking the patient to death instead of giving \ncorrective surgery. Now, that is the current version, the current \nversion of the Dole-Johnston bill.\n  Now, we understand there are going to be some changes that will be \noffered in this as a result of negotiations, and that is fine, if, in \nfact, those changes are agreed to by the Senate, and if there is a \nchance to debate and review these things to see whether or not, in \nfact, it has happened. But we have just been informed of this in the \nlast few minutes. In the last few minutes, we are now informed there is \ngoing to be a whole bunch of additional changes that are going to be \nmade in the Dole-Johnston bill, and changes are needed.\n  The problem is, there are a lot of additional changes which are \nneeded, as well. There are amendments at the desk which are relevant, \nwhich will be precluded from being offered if cloture is invoked. That \nis a critical distinction, because cloture will prevent the sponsors of \nrelevant amendments which are not technically germane from offering \nthose amendments. And may I say, that is also going to be true of \nchanges in the proposals which are going to be offered by the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island. That language has not been offered yet. Amendments \nto that language presumably are not going to be in order because that \nlanguage was \n\n[[Page S10391]]\nnot even in the bill at the time the cloture motion was filed.\n  Yet, if cloture is invoked, amendments which are relevant to the bill \nwhich was on file when cloture was filed will be precluded, as well as \namendments to these new changes which have been discussed in the last \nfew minutes.\n  Now, we have made too much progress to legislate this way. We have \nhad negotiations which have been fruitful. We have made progress which \nI think is reflected by the fact that the Senator from Rhode Island is \nnow saying that many of his concerns have been addressed. That \nrepresents progress because many of the Senator's concerns are the same \nconcerns that this Senator has and many other Senators have.\n  But there are other concerns which we can address if we will continue \na process which has made some progress. To suddenly terminate these \nnegotiations by voting cloture and to rule out probably dozens of \nrelevant amendments that many of us have filed in this bill is not the \nway to address regulatory reform.\n  Mr. President, whether or not cloture succeeds--and I hope it fails--\nthese negotiations should continue. I think all of us that have been \ninvolved in these negotiations, as long and as time consuming as they \nhave been, at times as frustrating as they have been, can honestly say \nwe have made substantial progress. The last thing that we did was to \nsubmit a package proposal, and as far as I know, we have not yet \nreceived a package response.\n  But rather than get involved in the debate over what the last item of \nnegotiation was, let me simply say that we have made significant \nprogress during these negotiations and that will be suddenly terminated \nand upset if cloture is invoked, which prevents relevant amendments \nfrom being offered. And amendments to language which has not even yet \nbeen seen, but which presumably will be accepted, according to the \nSenator from Rhode Island, are also going to be precluded, because that \nlanguage which is going to be presumably accepted was not part of the \nbill at the time that the cloture motion was filed.\n  I do not know of anyone who has worked harder for regulatory reform \nin this body than the Senator from Ohio. As long as I have been here, \nhe has fought for regulatory reform, including cost-benefit analysis, \nrisk assessment, and other changes. The bill which he sponsored, along \nwith the Republican chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, got \nunanimous, bipartisan support in Governmental Affairs. That bill \nrepresented significant progress. That bill got 48 votes, basically, in \nthis body a few days ago.\n  There is, I believe, again, almost a consensus that we must do things \ndifferently in the regulatory area. The Senator from Ohio has been a \nstalwart fighter for regulatory reform. I think it is a mistake to \nderail the process which we now have, which is to negotiate a strong \nregulatory reform package, but one that does not choke the patient in \nthe name of reforming regulations. We can have clean air, clean water, \na safe environment, and we also can get rid of the abuses of the \nregulatory process. We cannot have both.\n  The version that I have last seen, at least--the last version that we \nhave--does not yet achieve those goals. Therefore, I hope that cloture \nwill not be invoked, and that we will then pick up that negotiating \nprocess and conclude it. It was moving along quite well until this \ncloture motion was filed. I am afraid that this cloture motion, instead \nof advancing the goal which we all share of strong regulatory reform, \nwill derail those negotiations. And that would be too bad.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager of this \nbill. He has done an excellent job with respect to the negotiations. \nThey have been going on since February. We have been working on this \nbill for over a month. The last package that was presented to us by the \nother side actually gutted the provisions that small business needs in \nregulatory flexibility. They took out three other main provisions that \nsmall business wants.\n  As I have said on this floor before, small business has made \nregulatory reform a top priority. The number three item of the \ndelegates to the White House Conference on Small Business was making \nregulatory flexibility work for small business. We have just \nsuccessfully negotiated with the distinguished chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee, a commonsense \nchange in regulatory flexibility that harmonizes it with the provisions \nin cost-benefit. So you have cost-benefit and regulatory flexibility \nfor small business. So they work together.\n  Mr. President, we have gotten down to what we call in Missouri ``Show \nme time.'' We have had a lot of talk, a lot of nice words. But the time \nhas come to show me whether you are for small business or against it. \nSmall business and agriculture, working men and women in America today \nwant reasonable, commonsense regulations. We have had good input from \nboth sides in this body. We now have a bill that ought to move forward. \nWe are in a position to do so.\n  So I urge my colleagues to invoke cloture, to cut off the filibuster. \nLet us get about the job of reforming regulations and see that we can \nhave the commonsense protections that regulations give us without \nunnecessary burdens.\n  I thank my colleague from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to begin by sharing with our \ncolleagues a statement by the Vice President this afternoon:\n\n       This afternoon, the Senate will consider shutting off \n     debate on the Dole regulatory reform bill. I urge Senators to \n     reject the motion and continue debate. The bill sells out to \n     special interests and puts the health and safety of all \n     Americans at risk. It creates more bureaucracy and more \n     loopholes for lawyers and lobbyists to challenge and weaken \n     health and safety standards. In essence, it threatens the \n     progress we have made over the past 25 years to protect us \n     from unsafe drinking water, contaminated meat and dangerous \n     workplaces.\n       The American people expect and deserve better. The \n     President supports passage of true regulatory reform \n     legislation. However, this bill fails to achieve it. It \n     should be opposed if it cannot be changed, and should it come \n     to the President's desk, he would veto it.\n\n  So the choice here, Mr. President, is whether we go through an \nexercise which will end up in a Presidential veto or whether we \nrecognize what is really the choice here. The Senator from Louisiana \nsuggested the choice is whether you want regulatory reform or not. That \nis not the choice before the U.S. Senate.\n  The choice is whether you want to have a bill that, in the guise of \nregulatory reform, tears at the capacity of the regulatory process to \nwork and undoes years of progress with respect to the health and safety \nand environment on behalf of special interests, or whether you want to \ncontinue to negotiate in an effort to come up with a bill that is fair \nand reasonable.\n  Let me answer the questions of the Senator from Louisiana himself. He \nsuggested to the Senate the question, can you review existing rules, \nand said, under Dole-Johnston, you can, but under Glenn you cannot. \nThat is not true. That is just not true.\n  Under the Glenn bill, you have the ability to get on to the schedule \nthrough the agency, and even if the agency turns you down you have the \nability to have judicial review, and if judicial review turns you down, \nyou have the ability to come before the U.S. Congress and have the \nCongress put you on the list. That is review: Congressional review, \njudicial review, and agency review.\n  The Senator suggested that on decisional criteria, there is somehow a \ngulf between both sides. He said that in Dole-Johnston there is \ndecisional criteria, but in Glenn-Chafee there is not. But the truth \nis, we have come to a point of compromise on decisional criteria, and \nwe have given by accepting something that is not even in the Glenn-\nChafee bill. We put into our \n\n[[Page S10392]]\ncompromise an acceptance of the concept of decisional criteria so that \nyou will, for the first time, have risk assessment and cost evaluation. \nThat is a giving by both sides, which is reflective of what the \ncompromise process ought to be.\n  The last question the Senator asked was whether or not you can review \nin the end. He suggested that somehow we are trying to set up a process \nthat will preclude review of the cost evaluation or the risk \nassessment. I say to my friend, that is not accurate. We are prepared \nto accept, and have accepted, the concept of cost analysis review taken \ninto the whole record and judged for arbitrariness and capriciousness, \nand we have accepted the notion of risk assessment being reviewed as \npart of the whole record and taken into consideration for arbitrariness \nand capriciousness.\n  What we disagree on to this day is whether or not the language set \nout in the Dole-Johnston bill sufficiently precludes the procedural \naspects from being thrown into the mix in a way that increases more \nregulatory process.\n  Mr. President, I have shown this before. I show it again because it \nis not heard. If Philip Howard's book about the death of commonsense \nsuggested that the current regulatory process represents that death, \nthis bill is the funeral, not just for commonsense but for the progress \nwe have made on the health and safety and the environment, because it \ncreates 88 different standards, formal standards, which will become \npart of the record which will then be subject to the review that the \nSenator will not assist us in guaranteeing will draw the distinction \nbetween procedure and the overall record.\n  I respectfully say to my colleagues, this is not a vote about whether \nyou want regulatory reform or not. It is a vote about whether or not we \nare going to continue to put this bill in a position to become a \nsensible bill that represents the resurrection of commonsense as \nopposed to its death.\n  This bill, in its current form, has more petition processes than any \nagency could conceivably live under. If you are in favor of \nstreamlining Government, if you are in favor of reducing bureaucracy, \nif you are in favor of taking the maddening chase of Washington out of \nthe process, then you should not vote for cloture, because the fact is \nthat this bill has such a tier of petitioning processes with so many \nrequirements for evaluation, with so many time periods of a fixed \ncertain time that you are going to have this bureaucracy tangled up on \ntop of each other without the ability to serve the American people, \nwhich is their purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I hope our colleagues will allow us to try \nto continue and to negotiate a reasonable bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to say that I am pleased we are \nmaking, I think, constructive progress on this bill. I have watched the \nbill as it has progressed, and I have not supported cloture up to this \npoint, because I felt it was necessary to keep pressure on to make sure \nthat constructive progress was made.\n  I have seen things with respect to cost benefit, to net benefit and \nmatters of change relative to judicial review and substantial other \nimprovements. There are also other amendments pending which I believe \ncan improve this bill. Whether they will improve this bill to the point \nthat I could vote for it, I am not at all sure. But I will watch the \nprogress as we go along.\n  The filibuster should not be used purely to prevent passage of bills, \nbut it should be used in a meaningful way to ensure that an opportunity \nis made for constructive change and constructive passage of a piece of \nlegislation.\n  So although I have not supported cloture in the past, it is my view \nthat it is time to allow us to continue, recognizing that by granting \ncloture does not mean the debate closes, but rather that we will have \namendments which are already filed and are relevant to be taken up.\n  So I look forward to seeing what kind of progress we have made, what \nthe bill looks like and, therefore, it is my intention to vote for \ncloture this time, whereas I have withheld my vote in the past two \nattempts.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator from Vermont. I yield 3 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to come \ntogether to support the ongoing effort to reform the regulatory \nprocess. We want to make regulations both more efficient and more \neffective. We want to protect health, safety, and the environment in a \nmore effective way, and we want to reduce the cumulative regulatory \nburden that impacts on all of us as consumers, wage earners and \ntaxpayers.\n  This is a call for progress, not retreat. Since the beginning of this \nsession, I have stated repeatedly that regulatory reform should be a \nbipartisan issue and virtually everyone who has examined the regulatory \nprocess, regardless of their political bent, has concluded that it \nneeds to be reformed.\n  Let me just take a moment to share some revealing statements.\n  President Clinton, in the preamble to Executive Order 12866 on \nregulatory planning and review, stated:\n\n       The American people deserve a regulatory system that works \n     for them, not against them: a regulatory system that protects \n     and improves their health, safety, environment, and well-\n     being and improves the performance of the economy without \n     imposing unacceptable or unreasonable costs on society; \n     regulatory policies that recognize that the private sector \n     and private markets are the best engine for economic growth; \n     regulatory approaches that respect the role of State, local, \n     and tribal governments; and regulations that are effective, \n     consistent, sensible, and understandable.\n\n  The Executive order then concludes that ``We do not have such a \nregulatory system today.''\n  In a seminal report, ``Risk and the Environment,'' a bipartisan, blue \nribbon panel of the Carnegie Commission has emphasized:\n\n       The economic burden of regulation is so great, and the time \n     and money available to address the many genuine environmental \n     and health threats so limited, that hard resource allocation \n     choices are imperative.\n\n  Justice Stephen Breyer, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by \nPresident Clinton, has testified:\n\n       Our regulatory system badly prioritizes the health and \n     environmental risks we face.\n\n  Paul Portney, vice president of Resources for the Future, has \nobserved that ``Much good can come from a careful rethinking of the way \nwe assess risks to health and the environment and the role we accord to \neconomic costs in setting regulatory goals.''\n  All of these quotes show quite clearly that there is a very real and \npressing problem with Federal regulation. This is not about rolling \nback environmental, health, and safety standards. This is about \nreforming the regulatory process so we can achieve more good with our \nlimited resources. This is not a one-party issue.\n  Mr. President, let me point out that today, the managers of S. 343, \nagain, have agreed to many changes to accommodate the concerns of our \ncolleagues. I doubt that our distinguished Vice President has had the \nopportunity to review these changes. But I hope he will, because I \nthink if he did, he would see that this legislation that we are \nproposing today means real reform to a system that is badly out of \nkilter.\n  Let me point out that we have agreed, for example, to add new \nlanguage to make perfectly clear that S. 343 does not contain a \nsupermandate. We have also agreed to amend the cost-benefit decisional \ncriteria of section 624 to replace the least-cost test with a greater \nnet benefits test. Moreover, we have agreed to streamline the petition \nprovision to section 553; to delete interlocutory appeals; to replace \nthe automatic sunset in section 623 with a provision in the Glenn-\nChafee substitute providing for a rulemaking to repeal a rule; and to \ndelete the requirement that a rule have substantial support in the \nrulemaking files.\n  Mr. President, these changes show clearly that we are acting in good \nfaith to meet the concerns of our colleagues who want regulatory \nreform. I now call upon those who want to help this effort to step \nforward and support cloture. We must reform the regulatory process in a \nmeaningful way, and the Dole-Johnston compromise would provide the \nreform we need. It would be a terrible waste to destroy this unique \nopportunity to reform the regulatory process.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n \n[[Page S10393]]\n\n\n\n                       CLEAN WATER ACT PENALTIES\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, it is my intent to offer an amendment to \nlift the unfair burden of excessive regulatory penalties from the backs \nof local governments that are working in good faith to comply with the \nClean Water Act.\n  Mr. President, the goal of the underlying legislation is to bring \ncommon sense to the regulatory process. That is the goal of my \namendment.\n  Under current law, civil penalties begin to accumulate the moment a \nlocal government violates the Clean Water Act. Once this happens, the \nlaw requires that the local government present a municipal compliance \nplan for approval by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency [EPA], or the Secretary of the Army in cases of section 404 \nviolations. However, even after a compliance plan has been approved, \npenalties continue to accumulate. In effect, existing law gives the EPA \nthe authority to continue punishing local governments while they are \ntrying to comply with the law.\n  When I talk with South Dakotans, few topics raise their blood \npressure faster than their frustrating dealings with the Federal \nbureaucracy. Government is supposed to work for us, not against us. Mr. \nPresident, this is clearly a case where the Government is working \nagainst cities and towns that are trying to comply in good faith with \nthe Clean Water Act.\n  In South Dakota, the city of Watertown's innovative/alternative \ntechnology wastewater treatment facility was built as a joint \npartnership with the EPA, the city, and the State of South Dakota in \n1982. The plant was constructed with the understanding that the EPA \nwould provide assistance in the event the new technology failed. The \nfacility was modified and rebuilt in 1991 when it was unable to comply \nwith Clean Water Act discharge requirements. Unfortunately, the newly \nreconstructed plant still was found to violate Federal regulations. The \ncity now faces a possible lawsuit by the Federal Government and is \nincurring fines of up to $25,000 per day.\n  The city of Watertown has entered into a municipal compliance plan \nwith the EPA. Under the agreed plan, Watertown should achieve \ncompliance by December 1996. However, that plan does not address the \nissue of the civil and administrative penalties that continue to \naccumulate against the city.\n  Under the law, Watertown could accumulate an additional $14 million \nin penalties before the treatment facility is able to comply with the \nClean Water Act requirements.\n  Mr. President, I do not know of any cities in South Dakota that can \nafford those kinds of penalties.\n  My amendment would offer relief to cities like Watertown. Under my \namendment, local governments would stop accumulating civil and \nadministrative penalties once a municipal compliance plan has been \nnegotiated and the locality is acting in good faith to carry out the \nplan. Further, my amendment would act as an incentive to encourage \ngovernments to move quickly to achieve compliance with the Clean Water \nAct.\n  This amendment simply is designed to address an issue of fairness. \nLocal governments must operate with a limited pool of resources. \nLocalities should not have to devote their tax revenue both to \npenalties and programs designed to comply with the law. It defies \ncommon sense for the EPA to be punishing a local government at the same \ntime it is working in good faith to comply with the law. My amendment \nrestores common sense and fairness to local governments. By \ndiscontinuing burdensome penalties, local governments can better \nconcentrate their resources to meet the intent of the law in protecting \nour water resources from pollution.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee on the floor. I know my colleague is aware \nof my amendment, and that it would affect the Environmental Protection \nAgency, which is within the jurisdiction of his committee.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator from South Dakota. The Senator raises \nsome understandable concerns regarding the imposition of civil and \nadministrative penalties on municipalities working to comply with the \nClean Water Act.\n  As my colleague knows, my committee will soon begin consideration of \nthe reauthorization of the Clean Water Act. I believe the Senator's \nproposed amendment is worth considering as part of the Clean Water Act. \nIn fact, in August, I intend to hold a hearing to discuss changes to \nthe Clean Water Act.\n  Rather than offer the amendment to the pending legislation, I invite \nthe Senator from South Dakota to testify at this hearing on the very \nissue addressed in his amendment. Further, the Senator from South \nDakota has my assurance that the Environment and Public Works Committee \nwill give his proposal full consideration during its deliberation of \nthe Clean Water Act.\n  Would that be satisfactory to the Senator?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. The suggestions of the Senator from Rhode Island indeed \nare satisfactory. I look forward to testifying before his committee on \nthe issue of allowing the waiver of civil and administrative penalties \nfor municipalities working toward compliance with the Clean Water Act.\n  I would like to emphasize that the National League of Cities, the \nNational Association of Counties, and the South Dakota Department of \nEnvironment and Natural Resources have expressed strong support for my \nproposed amendment. In addition, my amendment is supported by the \nDemocratic leader and by the chairman of the Subcommittee on Drinking \nWater, Fisheries and Wildlife.\n  My chief concern in seeking to enact this measure is to prevent \nWatertown, SD, from being forced to pay penalties that are accumulating \nwhile the city is devoting its limited resources to compliance with the \nlaw.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I understand the distinguished Senator's concerns. I \nrecognize that his measure already has bipartisan support and the \nbacking of a number of local government organizations. I also recognize \nthe strong desire of the Senator from South Dakota to assist the people \nof Watertown. For those reasons, I intend to work with my friend from \nSouth Dakota and give his proposal full consideration in my committee.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank my friend from Rhode Island for his willingness \nto consider this important measure. I look forward to working with him \nto ensure that local governments are treated fairly under the Clean \nWater Act.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, within the last 48 hours, I heard a \nstory I want to share with the Senate. Two businessmen, who, 15 years \nago, were working people, got into a business. They worked hard. The \nbanks lent them some money. In both cases, they are very wealthy today, \nand they have families. They struggled through 15 to 18 years of hard \nwork in businesses.\n  One of the most deplorable statements I have ever heard is that these \ntwo men have both said openly and publicly, ``I do not want my sons to \ngo into business. Business is not worth it anymore.'' That is what we \nare talking about here. They did not say that because business was too \nhard for them, but because Government had made it too hard for them, \nand it did not justify their hard work and dedication sufficiently for \nthem to want their sons to join and go into the private sector as young \nbusinessmen and struggle in the American regulatory environment of \ntoday.\n  That is what this evening is about. We are choking that kind of \nenthusiasm. And I can tell you--I do not know if it is widespread, but \nI am frightened to hear it. If it becomes widespread in America, it \nwill choke what America needs most--risk-takers, small business people \nwho are thrilled enough about it, that they would love to have their \nkids join them and go into business.\n  So if we wonder who we are working for--the Vice President's letter \nsays ``special interests.'' Whenever there is nothing else to talk \nabout, the Vice President or somebody in the White House says, \n``special interests.'' Our special interest is the small business men \nand women in America, who create the jobs, create the wealth. They \ncannot stand it anymore. How much longer do we have to stay on the \nfloor before we send them a little hope that \n\n[[Page S10394]]\nwhat we are doing is not going to continue as it has been? You know, I \ndo not think they would believe us anyway. The more they watch what is \ngoing on here on the floor, I am confident that if any of them did, \nthey are even more sure that we do not know whether we are ever going \nto help them or how we are going to help them.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10387-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10394-S10399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCACY AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President. I am pleased the Senate has accepted my \nsmall business advocacy amendment to the regulatory reform bill. \nSeveral issues have been raised relative to this amendment that I \nbelieve warrant clarification.\n  First, a concern has been raised about the issue of timing; that \nsmall businesses will have input into the regulatory process prior to a \nnotice of proposed rulemaking is issued and that other affected \ninterests do not have this special treatment. In response to this \nconcern, let me quote several findings from the July 1994 ``Small \nBusiness Forum on Regulatory Reform--Findings and Recommendations of \nthe Industry Working Group:''\n\n       The work groups clearly felt that early communication and \n     input from small business owners and other stakeholders would \n     be key ingredients in the achievement of the dual objectives \n     of participation and partnership. . . . Many agencies track \n     in-house, by computer, the progress of all proposed \n     regulations which have reached the drafting stage. Each \n     agency presently prepares and submits to OIRA a regulatory \n     agenda every six months which includes all regulations \n     proposed by the agency.\n       Much discussion and deliberation took place in the work \n     groups regarding the earliest date at which input should or \n     could be solicited from stakeholders affected by a proposed \n     regulation. At any given moment in time, there may be \n     hundreds of ideas and concepts afloat in an agency. To \n     solicit input at the very inception of the idea would impose \n     too much of a burden upon the agency and the small business \n     community. Often one, two or even more years pass while a \n     regulation is in the development stage, supporting \n     information is being gathered and analyses are being made. At \n     the same time, waiting until a regulation has been drafted, \n     and a notice of proposed rulemaking [NPRM] has been published \n     in the Federal Register, may result in the loss of the \n     opportunity for stakeholders to provide meaningful input \n     early enough in the process.\n\n  Let me emphasize, the working groups--which included participants \nfrom the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Labor--\nmet in multiple sessions over a 3 month period of time. A total of 70 \nGovernment representatives participated in the work sessions. The \nreport stated that although the interagency groups worked \nindependently, their reports reached similar conclusions:\n\n       Their similarity suggests that the problems facing both \n     small business owners and the agencies in the regulatory \n     process may be universal, extending across industry and \n     agency lines. The groups all agreed that a comprehensive, \n     multi-agency strategy, with improved public involvement, is \n     likely to be the most cost-effective way to improve the \n     quality of regulations and to enhance regulatory compliance.\n\n  As the working groups noted:\n\n     . . .waiting until a regulation has been drafted, and a \n     notice of proposed rulemaking [NPRM] has been published in \n     the Federal Register, may result in the loss of the \n     opportunity for stakeholders to provide meaningful input \n     early enough in the process.\n\n  The working groups explored various ways to address the need for \nearly input, suggesting an Electronic Regulatory Information Center \n[ERIC] or electronic dockets to advise the most interested parties of \nforthcoming regulatory initatives. These suggestions have considerable \nmerit, not only for small businesses but for any others who are \ninterested in the impending regulations.\n  It is absolutely true that the small business advocacy amendment has \nsingled out small businesses as important entities deserving early \nparticipation in the regulatory process. I believe the specific \nrequirements for input, as articulated in the amendment, are wholly \nconsistent with existing statutes, various Executive orders, and \ncountless studies and reports that require or recommend small business \ncollaboration in the process. And, as evidenced by the agency working \ngroups in the small business forum on regulatory reform, early \nparticipation has a beneficial impact on the relationship of the \nstakeholders and the Federal Government.\n  I believe I speak for millions of small business men and women when I \nsay that a ``partnership'' with their government is what they are \nafter, not the present ``adversarial'' relationship. Let us not be \nafraid to change the present system--we know it is not working at its \noptimum. If we need to change the entire system so other affected \nmembers of the public have a means of voicing their particular concerns \nearly in the process, then let us do it. Let us not, however, be \nfearful that early input or early participation by small businesses is \ndetrimental to the process or gives them an unfair advantage. Early \nparticipation is already supported as one of the best ways to address \npotential problems.\n  It was my intent, and the intent of those who cosponsored this \nmeasure, to provide a much-needed mechanism for two federal agencies to \nbe able to address what they, themselves, have already recognized as a \ndeficiency in the present system: The need for early input for \ninformation and discussion purposes to make the process more efficient \nand effective.\n  I am pleased that this principle of reaching out to affected citizens \nis one with which we seem to all agree. I suggest, therefore, that if \nthis mechanism works as we all believe it will, that it may just have a \npositive impact on the way all regulations are developed in the future, \nfor all of our citizens who wish to make things work more efficiently \nand effectively. The bottom line is that the regulatory process should \nbe a collaborative effort between the public and the Federal \nGovernment.\n  As important, small businesses should not be seen as autonomous, \nfaceless, inhuman entities trying to skirt the health, safety and well-\nbeing of their fellow citizens. These are men and women--and in my \nState, the majority of new businesses are small businesses, and the \nmajority of those are women-owned businesses--who are trying to make a \nliving, with fairness and good business practices. They may hang out \ntheir shingle as a CPA firm, establish a women's magazine for the local \ncommunity, set up a hardware or supply company, or make salsa to sell \nat the local museum--they all fit the definition of small businesses. \nWhen there is criticism that the workers may be shortchanged in a new \nregulatory process, I suggest we should consider changing our \ndefinition of workers. These men and women are workers, and their \nvoices are as critical to the process as are, for example, the voices \nof a 20,000-plus member labor union.\n  The second issue I want to clarify is that a post-regulation survey \nmay be a burden on an agency. I strongly support efforts to reduce the \npaperwork burden on all Americans, including our federal agencies. \nRelative to this survey, I cannot believe that agencies are \ndisinterested in how their regulations are working. We, in Congress, \ncertainly receive enough inquiries requesting revisions to various \nregulations to know that some regulations need changes. And, we \ncertainly know that small businesses find complying with multiple \nregulations imposes an incredible burden on them because a company of \n25 employees must comply with most of the same regulations as a company \nof 1000 employees: this costs time and money a small company often does \nnot have.\n  To better understand the impact of a major regulation on small \nentities, a survey will provide vital information as to how well it is \nworking and whether there are ways to adjust the regulation to meet \nchanging circumstances or needs. Why should such a survey be a burden \nor incur a frightening scenario to an agency? The agency does not have \nto be involved with the survey --it will hire a firm to conduct the \nsurvey and provide its findings. And, there is nothing in this \namendment that mandates a small business must respond to a survey or \nthat the agency must adhere to any of its findings. In fact, from all \nof the information I have received from the New Mexico Small Business \nAdvocacy Council--which I established 2 years ago--and other small \nbusiness suggestions, small businesses would love the opportunity to \nprovide an assessment of how a regulation is working, either pro or \ncon.\n  Mr. President, I and others have been listening to the men and women \nin our \n\n[[Page S10395]]\nStates who have said there is a problem with the regulatory process. In \neffect they have been telling us in every possible way they can that \nthey need to be a participant in this process; they would like to offer \nsuggestions that will make regulations work better; that they have some \ncommon sense suggestions that can make the regulatory process a \nparticipatory one. But, there is no mechanism that provides an informal \nway of getting their message out. Everything is complicated. Everything \nis rigid. And, nobody cares.\n  We are offering a possible solution so that the voices of millions of \nmen and women-owned small businesses can be heard. We are offering a \nmechanism for a question and answer survey to be conducted that may \nprovide some meaningful insights as to how regulations, including, for \nexample, how health and safety standards can be better implemented.\n  I am proud of this amendment. I do not believe the majority of \nAmericans are fearful of this approach; it is an inventive one that we \nhope is responsive to legitimate concerns.\n  I believe the revisions worked out prior to the amendment's \nacceptance helped clarify its intent. I hope we can wholeheartedly \nembrace this innovative approach to ``hearing'' from our American men- \nand women-owned small businesses. Their voices--their counsel and \nadvice--can help make our regulatory process more responsive and \nworkable. Everyone will benefit.\n                   sound science and risk assessment\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to register a small \nhistorical footnote during the debate on the regulatory reform bill. \nDuring consideration of the Clean Air Act Amendments in 1990, Senator \nDole and I started to ask questions about how the Environmental \nProtection Agency did risk assessments and what those risk assessments \nmeant.\n  We and many of our colleagues were surprised, and somewhat \nincredulous, as we learned that these risk assessments involved \nunrealistic assumptions about human exposure and overly conservative \nassumptions multiplied by other overly conservative assumptions. I \nstill refer with wonderment--and I know Senator Dole does this as \nwell--at the so-called mythical man standing at the fenceline breathing \na pollutant continuously for 70 years, never bothering to leave for \nwork or to raise a family--or even move 20 feet away.\n  As a result of this inquiry, we established under the Clean Air Act a \nCommission on Risk Assessment and Management to advise the Congress and \nthe administration on appropriate principles of risk before the \nresidual risk section of the air law takes effect. We also commissioned \nthe National Academy of Sciences to do a report on current risk \nassessment practices. That report, entitled ``Science and Judgment in \nRisk Assessment,'' was issued last year, and contained a number of \ncriticisms in the way that the Environmental Protection Agency \npresently conducts its risk assessments during rule promulgation.\n  As a result of this activity, I sought and got an amendment during \nreauthorization of the Safe Drinking Water Act last year that would \nhave required regulations issued under that act to be based on the best \navailable peer-reviewed science. Such good science was clearly needed \nwith regard to the operation of the Safe Drinking Water Act. For \nexample, EPA has consistently proposed a minimum contaminant standard \nfor radon in drinking water which could cost water systems upward of \n$12 billion in capital cost alone, even though EPA's own Science \nAdvisory Board criticized that standard for not focusing limited \nresources on more important risks.\n  My good science amendment was a specific remedy in one law. But I \nbelieve that there is an urgent need for realistic and plausible \nexposure scenarios and sound science in all risk assessments. I am \npleased, therefore, that the Dole bill requires that risk assessments \nbe based only on the best available science, a basic requirement which \nhas been sorely needed for far too long.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah controls 8 minutes. The \nSenator from Ohio has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield me 2 minutes?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would like to yield the last 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana, if I can. First, I will yield \nmyself all but the last 2 minutes. I would like to have notice when 6 \nminutes is used.\n  I really have to say that I am very upset right now with some of the \narguments that I have heard from the other side, because they could not \nhave read this bill, could not understand the concessions that we have \nmade time after time, day after day, meeting after meeting, hour after \nhour, and make the statements that were made today.\n  Some on the other side are so worried about subjecting the \nbureaucracy to too many ``hoops,'' that they forget the American public \nout there and how many hoops they have to jump through.\n  Let me tell you, we are being regulated to death in this country. \nWhat about the hoops that the American citizens have to jump through \nbecause of a bureaucracy inside this beltway that does not consider \ntheir needs and enacts silly, stupid, dumb regulations that are \nwrecking our country. On this bill, we have had it with some in the \nmedia, who continue to completely misrepresent, in the most despicable \nway, what this bill means.\n  I assure you that we would not have some of these Senators voting for \ncloture today if they thought for a minute that some of these \nrepresentations were true. Now, we do not believe that the latest \nKerry-Glenn proposals are right. They not only do not address our \noffers made on Tuesday, which were made to meet both side's concerns, \nin words that we thought we had agreed on in the meetings; but then \ntheir counteroffer significantly expands the areas of disagreement by \nadding new issues. That is what we have been going through the whole \ntime. We get to where we think we have it, and the next thing you know, \n10 more issues are on the table.\n  Let us worry a little more about the American people. This bill takes \ncare of providing that the best science will be applied, and that the \nright decisions will be made, and that the bureaucracy will have to be \naccountable for the first time in the history of this country. This is \none of the most important bills in the history of this country because \nit means getting the status quo, the overwhelming, unthinking \nbureaucracy, off of our backs and makes them become more responsible to \nissue good regulations, rather than bad, based upon the best science \navailable.\n  It gets the American public from underneath the horrendous burden of \nunnecessary, silly, and dumb regulations. If there is a funeral, to use \nthe metaphor used by one of my colleagues, it is ``a funeral for common \nsense'' if we do not pass this bill. If there is a funeral on the other \nside of that quotation, then it is the celebration of the status quo. I \nwould have to say that most of the opponents of this bill have not even \nread it.\n They could not have read it and made some of the comments that they \nmade.\n\n  We have tried and we have worked very, very hard to bring people \ntogether. We have been criticized--Senator Roth and I, in particular--\nwe have been criticized by people on both sides of the aisle. Our goal \nis to bring together the best bill we can, that will stop some of the \noverregulatory killing that is happening in this country today.\n  We think we are there. That does not mean if we invoke cloture that \nwe will not continue to work to try and satisfy our sincere colleagues \non the other side, not the least of whom is Senator Glenn, who has \nworked very hard to try and resolve this. I know he is very dedicated, \nand sincerely so, to resolve these problems. There are a number of \nothers who are as well, and I want to pay tribute to them.\n  This is a key vote for small business. Every small businessman in the \ncountry has to be watching this vote. I have to say even harmonized reg \nflex has cost-benefit criteria. We have done so much to try and make \nthis bill acceptable to both sides. I think it should be acceptable. We \nwill continue to work, but I think we need to invoke cloture. It seems \nto me the time is now. We have waited long enough. Frankly, it is time \nto do this.\n\n[[Page S10396]]\n\n  The other side is so worried about subjecting the bureaucracy to too \nmany hoops. What about the American public? What about the hoops that \nthe American public has to go through to satisfy the horrendous burden \nof regulation?\n  If this is a funeral for common sense and a celebration of the status \nquo, most of the opponents of this bill have never read it.\n  We believe that the latest Kerry-Glenn-Levin proposals not only do \nnot address our offer made Tuesday in good faith to meet that side's \nconcerns, but significantly expands the areas of disagreement by adding \nnew issues.\n  First and foremost, the proposal to strike the decisional criteria \nsection and replace it with a certification process is unsatisfactory. \nThe decisional criteria section is at the heart of Dole-Johnston \nbecause it is the mechanism that both sets the standard for cost-\nbenefit analysis and assures that the analysis is done by the agencies. \nWe believed that their side had agreed to the concept of a decisional \ncriteria section, but that the language of the standard needed to be \nnegotiated. Their proposal to strike this section constitutes the most \nsignificant area of disagreement.\n  Other significant areas of disagreement include their proposal to \nlimit the reasonable alternatives that an agency must disclose in a \nrulemaking to three or four. While the number of options for a \nparticular rulemaking may be small, in certain circumstances it may be \ngreater, and disclosure of all relevant options is necessary for \neffective public participation in the rulemaking process and for \njudicial review.\n  We also object to the elimination of the petition processes. The \nright of the American people to petition their government is a \nfundamental constitutional right. We believe that Congress has a duty \nto assure the efficacy of this right. Consequently, we object to the \ndeletion of these provisions from S. 343. As to eliminating the \npetition for review of a major rule, we believed that we had already \nreached an agreement to keep this provision as part of the agency \nreview of rules section and are disappointed and somewhat surprised at \nyour suggestion to eliminate it. As to the section 553(l) petition \nprocess for nonmajor rules, the suggestion to strike this subsection \nwill render this longstanding APA petition process virtually useless. \nThis is because the section 553(l), for the first time, establishes an \n18-month time limit for agencies to answer the petitions. The lack of a \ntime limit has rendered the present APA petitions moribund.\n  Other significant areas of disagreement with their most recent \nproposal includes striking TRI, the Delaney Clause reformation, and the \nsection 707, the consent decree reform provision.\n  Furthermore, new issues have been raised for the first time which \nmakes closure even more difficult. These include weakening the \nregulatory flexibility judicial decisional criteria, and, as stated \nabove, the limiting of the reasonable alternative requirement to a few \noptions. The raising of these new issues contravenes our understanding \nthat we had just a limited universe of four items--decisional criteria, \njudicial review, sunset, and petitions--to negotiate. Obviously, we \ncannot continue these negotiations forever; we have already in good \nfaith made over 100 significant and technical changes to the bill.\n                   changes we are proposing to s. 343\n\n  First, judicial review. Language is changed in section 625 to clarify \nthat there is no independent review of the procedures of the bill, but \nthat judicial review will be of the rulemaking file as a whole under an \n``arbitrary and capricious'' test.\n  Second, decisional criteria. Further language is suggested to clarify \nthat there is no supermandate in the decisional criteria section; and \nadopt the greater-net-benefits test.\n  Third, section 553(1) petition. Strike language providing for \npetition of interpretive rules and guidance documents.\n  Fourth, section 623 petition--agency review. Add requirement that the \ncourt, to the extent practicable, shall consolidate petition review in \none proceeding.\n  Fifth, reg flex. Amend section 604, subsection (c) of title 5 to \nchange the standard to one of compliance burdens.\n  Sixth, substantial support test. Strike substantial support test in \nsection 706.\n  Seventh, sunset. Adopt language of Glenn-Chafee substitute on sunset.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter and \nattachment on this subject.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Governmental Affairs, Hart Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. J. Bennett Johnston,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \n         Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Orrin, Bill and Bennett: We have received your letters \n     dated July 19, and are pleased to see progress on several of \n     the key regulatory reform issues. As you know, however, our \n     July 18 list of major issues was a package, and several of \n     our key issues were not addressed in your letters.\n       Attached is a list of amendments we need included in our \n     package of amendments. This list represents a revision of our \n     July 19 proposed amendments. The major issues are as follows:\n       First, we cannot accept a bill that provides new \n     opportunities for litigation, or delays or stops needed \n     health, safety, or environmental protections. We have always \n     opposed the new judicially reviewable petition processes \n     contained in Dole/Johnston, which will result in bureaucratic \n     gridlock and excessive litigation. Glenn/Chafee contains a \n     workable review process. In the interest of compromise, the \n     attached amendments would modify the Glenn/Chafee review \n     process in order to provide for judicial review of the agency \n     schedule and for review of major free-standing risk \n     assessments. Your proposal to accept the Glenn/Chafee action-\n     forcing rulemaking provision, as opposed to an automatic \n     sunset, is an important, positive step. It does not, however, \n     address our concerns about the new petitions and the review \n     process.\n       Second, our July 19 offer included cost-benefit analysis, \n     but not a new and inflexible decisional criteria. While your \n     counteroffer proposed a revision to the decisional criteria \n     that we are willing to consider, continuing concern about the \n     effect of decisional criteria recommend that we discuss this \n     issue further before making any final decisions.\n       Third, with regard to judicial review and unwarranted \n     litigation, we propose a variation on standards for judicial \n     review. The elimination of the interlocutory review language \n     in Dole/Johnston sec. 625(e) is a good step, and we assume \n     this includes the elimination of the Reg Flex interlocutory \n     appeal provisions. Also, the elimination of the ``substantial \n     support'' language in Dole/Johnston sec. 706(a)(2)(F) is a \n     welcome change.\n       Fourth, on the subject of special interest issues, while we \n     continue to believe that it should not be included in the \n     legislation, we are certainly willing to discuss the Toxic \n     Release Inventory. We remain equally concerned with the other \n     special provisions we have identified, as well.\n       Finally, important issues not addressed in your July 19 \n     letters include a limitation on ``reasonable alternatives,'' \n     a future effective date, a limitation on extension of \n     deadlines, the number and scope of rules covered under the \n     law, and revisions to the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The \n     specific language and/or filed amendments for each of these \n     issues is contained in the Attachment.\n       While we are pleased to see progress on key regulatory \n     reform issues, each of these issues is part of a package. We \n     are not able to accept proceeding with any of these as \n     individual amendments without addressing the package as a \n     whole.

The Senator from Michigan came here, and his No. 1 item was to \nsee if we could not get into regulatory reform. He was president of the \ncity council in Detroit and had so many programs, and he has been \nworking on it since he has been here.\n  I yield to him for a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I make the parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President, that if \ncloture were invoked, are amendments which are relevant, according to \nthe unanimous consent, in order or out of order, if, while they are \nrelevant, are not technically germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The relevant standard is considerably broader \nthan the germaneness standard, so they would not be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 3 minutes and 16 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. May I make a parliamentary inquiry on my time? Is it not \ntrue that both sides can agree post-cloture and add language to the \nbill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Only by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we all want sensible regulatory reform. I \nwant regulatory reform as badly as anybody here. We have worked on it \nfor years in our committee, the Governmental Affairs Committee, but I \nwant balanced regulatory reform, not regulatory reform slanted so much \nthat anybody that objects to a particular regulation coming out could \ntie it up in courts in judicial review for almost an unlimited period \nof time.\n  We have negotiated in good faith on this, back and forth, and I am \nsorry we have to go to another cloture vote on this because contrary to \nwhat has been said here, we have made a lot of progress. We did not \nhave time enough to go through all of it.\n  Mr. President, S. 343, the Dole-Johnston bill, does not fix the \nproblem. It was quoted a moment ago that President Clinton said the \nAmerican people deserve a system that works for them. We do not have \nsuch a system today. I submit that S. 343 does not give that balanced \nsystem either.\n  The President has taken initiatives on this and already cut out 1,200 \npages of regulation out of 13,000 pages reviewed. So they are working \nhard at making corrections. We do not need a bill that does nothing but \nprovide regulatory favoritism. That is all we can call this, when they \ninsist on keeping in such things as provisions gutting the toxics \nrelease inventory that protects people around plants, and so on. That \nis just not right that we pass something like that.\n  We, in good faith, submitted another proposal this afternoon. We \ngradually, one by one, as proposals have been sent back and forth \nbetween the two sides, have worked out a lot of our differences, and \nthis is one of the most complicated bills, one of the most complicated \npieces of legislation that we can have, because it refers to so many \naspects of law. It affects every man, woman, and child in this country.\n  In that respect, I ask unanimous consent that the article out of this \nweek's issue of Newsweek called ``Of Helmets and Hamburger'' be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Of Helmets and Hamburger\n\n\n              congress: deciding what you eat and breathe\n\n       Soon after Lori Maddy moved into her Sedgwick County, \n     Kans., farmhouse in 1982, she noticed that wind blowing from \n     the direction of the nearby Vulcan Chemicals plant carried a \n     smell like ``the inside of an inner tube.'' So Maddy joined \n     with neighbors to ask Vulcan what, exactly, it was venting. \n     None of your business, Vulcan replied. Then came a 1986 law \n     requiring companies to report--not stop, just report--their \n     toxic releases. Vulcan turned out to be spewing 50 percent of \n     Sedgwick's total emissions, including carcinogens. Spurred by \n     local outrage, Vulcan voluntarily reduced its pollution by 90 \n     percent. ``We felt obligated,'' says plant manager Paul \n     Tobias, ``to win back the public's trust.''\n       The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) seems to be a smart way \n     to reduce pollution, but Congress has put TRI and every other \n     federal health, safety and environment rule in the \n     crosshairs. The House passed a strong regulatory-rollback \n     bill in February. Last week the Senate fought over whether \n     it, too, would (pick one) ``wage a full frontal assault on \n     the American people and their environment,'' as Environmental \n     Protection Agency chief Carol Browner put it, or ``take the \n     heavy hand of the federal government out of people's lives,'' \n     as GOP Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine said.\n       Washington is already well down the road to deregulation. \n     Congress is moving to free the states to raise speed limits \n     and eliminate the requirement that motorcyclists wear helmets \n     (table). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wants to exempt \n     small-property owners from the Endangered Species Act so they \n     can build on their land even if that damages the habitat of a \n     rare breed. EPA and the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration no longer fine first offenders. But the \n     House's antireg bill, and now the leading Senate version, are \n     much broader, affecting anyone who eats meat, drinks water or \n     breathes:\n       Meat: Bob Dole, sponsor of the Senate bill, wants to \n     deliver regulatory relief this year. But smack in the middle \n     of the Senate debate came news that five children in \n     Tennessee had gotten E. coli poisoning, which comes from \n     contaminated hamburger. Such outbreaks, say consumer groups, \n     will become even more common if Dole gets his way. In its \n     current form, they charge, the\n      Dole bill requires federal agencies to prove by extensive \n     analysis that any proposed rule--including better meat \n     inspection--is the cheapest way to protect the public. \n     Showing that the rule's benefits (avoiding 4,000 deaths, 5 \n     million illnesses and up to $3.7 billion in medical costs \n     a year) are greater than its cost to industry ($245 \n     million a year) wouldn't automatically be good enough. \n     Dole disputes this, but there's no doubt that under his \n     plan industry could sue to overturn the rules on much \n     weaker grounds than current law allows. Dole, says Adam \n     Babich of the Environmental Law Institute, is trying to \n     solve ``the problem of too much bureaucracy by adding \n     bureaucracy. It would flunk its own cost-benefit test.''\n       Air and water pollution: If the GOP proposals had been law \n     in the 1970s, some regulations on air and water quality might \n     never have made it. The cost-benefit analysis of banning lead \n     in gasoline, for example didn't clearly show that it would \n     spare children \n\n[[Page S10398]]\n     much neurological damage. EPA went ahead anyway, and subsequent \n     research shows that the lead phaseout cut blood lead levels \n     far more than EPA expected. The GOP's new plan would also \n     affect existing regs on how much pesticide and fecal bacteria \n     can be in drinking water. Rules would automatically expire \n     every five to 10 years unless an agency reanalyzed (and, \n     possibly, relitigated) them.\n       Republicans respond with horror stories of regulators run \n     amok. Some are hyped, but many are not. Limits on how much \n     chloroform from paper mills may pollute drinking water, they \n     say, cost $99 billion per year-of-life saved. Even Clinton \n     has a bit of regulation-cutting religion; he's eliminated \n     hundreds of silly federal rules. But more rollback seems \n     inevitable. Ironically, it's coming at a time when GOP budget \n     cutting--EPA is look at a 40 percent hit--will make it even \n     tougher for agencies to meet the stiffer requirements for \n     justifying rules. But maybe that's the idea.\n                      regulations go on the block\n\n       Washington appears determined to review, and in some cases \n     dismantle, health and safety rules. The results will affect \n     everything from beef to how fast you can drive.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Status quo                GOP plan            Democratic retort  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInspectors ``poke and    The Senate bill would    The GOP plan would    \n sniff'' for spoilage,    require the USDA to      delay reasonable     \n but 4,000 people a       prove that the           reforms that would   \n year die anyway.

Mr. President, it details some of the problems involved, \nand I wish we had time to read it in the Record. It puts it very well, \nthat what we are doing here is not only providing regulatory reform if \nwe pass the Dole-Johnston bill, we are providing the possibility of \nrolling back health and safety laws developed over the last 25 years \nthat have proven invaluable, have provided for better health, have \nprovided for better safety for our own citizens. We do not want to take \na chance of rolling that back.\n  The bill that I proposed, known as the Glenn-Chafee bill, was one \nthat hit a real balance. We provided redress for these regulatory \nexcesses, and we all agree that there are regulatory excesses. They are \nall over the place. We hear about these every time we go back home.\n  We correct them, but we correct them in the right way, providing a \nprocess that cannot be used to override the system, cannot be used to \noverflow the system, cannot be used to swamp the system.\n  That is what S. 343 has the potential of doing. We want regulatory \nreform. We want regulatory reform as badly as anybody. I am sorry we \ncannot continue this negotiation today. I hope our colleagues will not \nlet cloture be invoked and will vote against it so we can continue with \nthese negotiations.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, just to make one point, if we invoke \ncloture tonight, this Senator is going to work with the other side. I \nknow the Senator from Delaware will. I know the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana will.\n  On all relevant amendments, we will work on those with them, and what \nwe can agree on we will put in by unanimous consent. I just want people \nto understand that.\n  This cloture vote is very, very important. It has a lot to do with \nwhether we will ever get regulatory reform.\n  I yield the balance of my time to my colleague from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has 2 minutes and \n20 seconds.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, we have had a lot of talk here on the \nfloor about good faith and negotiation, and there has, in fact, been \ngood faith and good negotiation by both sides.\n  Believe me, Mr. President, the majority leader has yielded and \nyielded and yielded, and I have given a list of those things he has \nyielded. There was some progress made on the bill.\n  Mr. President, ultimately there are a few basic differences. Really, \nthree in number. A lot of small ones, but three basic differences on \nthis bill that constitute a wide chasm and a wide gulf.\n  Now, the first is whether we can question existing rules. I have \nheard it said you could. Mr. President, let me read what the Glenn \nsubstitute says. The Glenn substitute says, ``The head of the agency, \nin his sole discretion, picks what is to be reviewed.'' In his sole \ndiscretion. When you get around to a review, it says, ``judicial review \nof the agency action taken pursuant to these requirements shall be \nlimited to review of compliance or noncompliance with this section.'' \nYou review at the sole discretion of the head of the agency.\n  Now, Mr. President, if that is a right to challenge an existing \nregulation, then I am not a U.S. Senator, because, Mr. President, it is \nno right at all. It is business as usual.\n  The head of the agency has that discretion right now. If you want to \nkeep things exactly as they are, then vote against cloture. I say vote \nfor the Glenn amendment. We have already voted for the Glenn amendment \nonce and it went down. It constitutes the bureaucrats preservation act, \nbecause it keeps things exactly as they are.\n  Mr. President, we can make more progress in negotiation if cloture is \nvoted, but unless we have an end to this process, Mr. President, there \nis an end to this bill. I believe strongly in this bill. I hope we will \nget cloture. I hope we can get an act passed.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I understand that all time has expired, \nso I will use part of my leader time to comment briefly on the pending \nresolution.\n  I note that my colleagues have made the case very well. Those who \nhave preceded me in opposition to this cloture motion, I think, have \nmade the case that I would simply like to summarize prior to the time \nwe come to a vote.\n  The first and most important point is that this vote is unnecessary. \nThere is no effort to filibuster. No one is delaying final passage on \nthis bill. No one is trying to stop us from coming to a conclusion on \nthis legislation. There has been a sincere attempt, by virtually every \nSenator involved in this debate, now for several weeks, to try to \nimprove the legislation and accommodate the very difficult points that \nhave been raised and in many cases resolved as a result of those \nnegotiations. So that is point No. 1; no filibuster.\n  Point No. 2, there has been, as my colleagues have indicated, \nsubstantial progress since the day we began this effort several weeks \nago; substantial progress. Senator Kerry, Senator Chafee, Senator \nGlenn, Senator Levin, and Senator Johnston on our side have all \nindicated that progress, as a result of these negotiations, has been \nreal. And I think the latest testament to the fact that progress is \nbeing made is what the Senator from Rhode Island has just announced. As \na result of the efforts in the last 24 hours, he, too, has been able to \nget additional concessions as a result of these negotiations, \nconcessions that would not have been made were we not at this point in \nthis deliberative process, concessions that we have been talking about \nnow for some time. So, with each stage in the development of this \ndebate, additional progress has been made up until this very afternoon.\n  Point No. 3, from the outset we have laid out some principles that we \nsay are essential to a good bill. They are very simple.\n  First and foremost, we have to have a bill that does not roll back \nlaws that have provided cleaner air, purer water, and safer food.\n  Second, we will not support a bill loaded with special interest \nfixes.\n  Third, we will not have a bill that results in an avalanche of \nlitigation from hundreds and hundreds of lawyers.\n  That is it. Those are our principles. We are guided by those and it \nis in that effort to maintain our allegiance to those principles that \nwe continue to negotiate in good faith. I believe those concerns have \nnot yet been adequately addressed. I believe equally as strongly, \nthough, that we can get there. I believe the Glenn-Chafee bill would \nhave gotten us there, and 48 Senators agreed with us on that matter. \nBut most important in the statement, I want to emphasize right this \nminute: We are willing to continue to go into that room, continue to \nwork, continue to work out the differences, as has been the case now \nfor several days.\n  Finally, let me make a point about the issue raised by the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan. If, indeed, we are going to come \nto closure on this \n\n[[Page S10399]]\nbill, one of the most important things we have to do is ensure that \nthose Senators who have amendments that are relevant but not germane \ncan be protected. Regardless of whether or not we come to closure in \nthe next couple of days on this bill, it is very important that those \nwho want to make additional contributions to this legislation, to try \nto improve the bill with or without negotiations that may or may not \ncome to any fruitful conclusion, they ought to be protected in their \nright to offer those amendments and have them successfully debated and \nultimately voted on. A vote against cloture ensures that they will have \nthat right, and I think it is very, very important that everyone \nunderstand that.\n  So, I think, in essence, the message is very simple. A vote against \ncloture is a vote for progress, progress that has been demonstrated \nover and over again as we have resolved these differences and as we \ncontinue to work for final passage, as we continue to guarantee that \nthe principles we laid out at the very beginning can be protected.\n  I am optimistic that we can achieve that. I believe we can continue \nto work in good faith to accomplish what remains. And I believe voting \nagainst cloture today is the fastest way to get there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will just take a minute or two because I \nknow we have had a lot of debate here and we have had a lot of \nnegotiations. In fact, we have been negotiating since April. This is \nabout the 10th day now on this bill.\n  I think what we have forgotten--we keep talking about we have to \nsatisfy this Senator, that Senator--somewhere out there some small \nbusiness man or woman or farmer is saying, what are these people doing \nin the U.S. Senate? We have been on this bill 10 days. We had about 2 \nweeks of negotiation before that. We have made over 100 changes. When \ndo we stop? When we satisfy every liberal Senator on the other side of \nthe aisle? Then you could not find the rest of us voting for it.\n  I note in the latest offer they made they say, ``We are not able to \naccept proceeding with any of these as individual amendments without \naddressing the package as a whole.'' So you take this package, then \ntomorrow you will have another package, oh, just four or five more \nthings we thought of or the staff thought of or the administration \nthought of or the bureaucrats thought of.\n  It is one thing to say we are for regulatory reform. But we are not \ngoing to have it unless we have cloture. So the moment of truth is \nabout to arrive. The moment of truth is about to arrive. I have heard \nall the speeches. I have listened to the speeches. I suppose everybody \nwants some vague regulatory reform. But by the time we adopt every \namendment we have had proposed by some of my colleagues, we would not \nhave regulatory reform. We would satisfy the bureaucracy, which is \napparently what some wish to do. The Senator from Louisiana just read a \npiece of the Glenn bill, ``in sole discretion.'' They make the \ndetermination.\n  So I hope my colleagues will understand, we have a lot of work to do \nthis year. In fact, we just voted earlier today on an amendment, I \nthink it had regulatory reform in it. I think the vote was 91 to 8--91 \npeople voted for this broad bill that had regulatory reform, tax \nreform, grazing reform, all the reforms we could think of; 91 to 8 \nvoted for it. So there ought to be 91 votes for cloture.\n  I just hope my colleagues--we have made a lot of progress. Every \nRepublican will now vote for cloture. That is up from about 49; now it \nis 54. But we cannot get there alone. I tell the American people, we \ncannot have regulatory reform without at least a half dozen on the \nother side. It is not possible to satisfy the concerns of some. It is \nnever possible in any legislation.\n  I do not know what a filibuster is, but it seems like after a couple \nof weeks we ought to make some decisions. There are a lot of amendments \nfiled, relevant, germane. There are still opportunities to improve this \nbill after cloture is invoked. Some of these things, in my view, we \nought to just say, ``If we cannot reach an agreement, there ought to be \nan up-or-down vote.'' We would win some, the other side would win some, \nbut at least we would have some resolution.\n  So I urge my colleague, particularly on the other side of the aisle--\nand I know you are under extreme pressure. I know the little sweatshop \nis working right outside the corridor here. I know there are a lot of \npeople coming out there with arms that are hurting. Some have slings.

The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I want to thank my Republican colleagues and \nfour of our colleagues on the other side who voted for regulatory \nreform and congratulate those who stuck together to bury it. It seems \nto me they have been successful.\n  I will just say, we thought we made a good effort. There is always \nmore and more and more, and maybe this is all a way to keep the bill \nfrom going to the White House where the President indicates he would \nveto it.\n  We have had months of negotiation, hundreds of changes, 10 days of \nconsideration, and then we are told, ``Oh, we just need more time.'' \nEither we are for regulatory reform or we are not. We cannot satisfy \neverybody in the Chamber, and those people made their choices.\n  After the vote, people said, ``Oh, we just need to negotiate more. \nLet's just have some more negotiations.''\n  The truth is that our bill largely tracks President Clinton's \nExecutive order but has one important difference. This bill will ensure \nthe requirements are actually carried out.\n  I particularly want to commend Senator Johnston for his work, and his \ntireless efforts. He came to me--it seems like months ago now, but I \nguess it was just weeks--and he said, ``We are not going to get \nanywhere unless we make some changes in this bill.'' So we set about to \nmake changes. Today, all across America--I do not have a copy--we are \nbeing flooded with statements by the Democratic National Committee on \nthis vote about how Senator Domenici is for dirty meat, and Senator \nWarner and somebody else is for dirty meat. They mixed it up a little, \ndepending on where you live. It has a little cartoon there with our \npictures in the middle. Very nicely done.\n  I think that has been the purpose right along--to try to get a \ncampaign issue. Forget about the farmers and ranchers in Montana, or \nKansas, or Virginia, or somewhere else. Forget about the small \nbusinessmen and women all across America. We have to protect the \nbureaucracy. We cannot have the bureaucracy overworked in Washington, \nDC. That is what we have heard for the last 3 days.\n  Not many people in Russell, Kansas, are worried too much about the \nbureaucracy in Washington, DC. They have never seen it, most of them. \nThey have felt it in their wallets, and they feel it when they open up \ntheir little business, and they feel it when they go out of business, \nand they feel it on the farm, and they feel it on the ranch, and they \nfeel it all across America. But they cannot have regulatory reform \nbecause we cannot get the cooperation. Everything in this Senate needs \n60 votes. To get 60 votes, you end up with nothing. I do not believe \nthat is what the American people expect us to do.\n  We can hold our heads high, those of us who voted for cloture. We can \nlook the small businessman in the eye, and we can look the rancher in \nMontana in the eye, or wherever he may live, and say we did our best, \nwe tried once, twice, three times. We were told, oh, nobody is delaying \nthis bill; we do not want to delay this bill, and we are all for \nregulatory reform--until a vote came.\n  Mr. President, I do not know--I think I know what the final outcome \nis. I do not want to cause any anxiety for my friends on the other \nside, but I thank Senator Breaux and Senator Heflin and Senator Nunn \nfor their votes, because I know the pressure was great, intense, and \nsteady.\n  I assume we could have put together a package that would have gotten \n100 votes. It would not have been worth anything, but we could have \nsaid we all voted for regulatory reform. Particularly, Senator Roth and \nSenator Hatch, and others on this side, have worked so hard to try to \nbring it together. But I think there is a little bit of principle left \nin this argument. We would like to think that we have at least 58 \nvotes. That is 58 percent of the Senate that would like to have \nregulatory reform. Eighty-eight percent of the American people would \nlike to have it. But we cannot get it because we are short 2 percent. \nTwo percent of the Senate is denying about 85 or 90 percent of the \nAmerican people regulatory reform.\n  That is a right we all have. We have all been through it. Some of us \nhave been on the other side. I do not know of any more important bill \nthan this one. But I think the dye has been cast. I am willing to \nentertain any legitimate concerns, but no more of these four or five \npages that say at the end, ``we are not able to accept proceeding with \nany of these individual amendments without addressing the package as a \nwhole.'' Then I assume that if this were addressed, there would be \nanother one ready. They are endless.\n  So I regret that we have failed the American people--again. But there \nwill be other opportunities. I, again, thank my colleagues on this side \nof the aisle \n\n[[Page S10401]]\nfor being 100 percent for regulatory reform. One hundred percent. You \ncannot get any better than that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I listened with great care to the \ncomments made by the distinguished majority leader. I hope that he will \nnot be discouraged. I hope that, given all the progress we have made so \nfar, we go right back and make some more. I do not think there is a \nSenator here who would deny that we need regulatory reform. But I also \nthink that virtually every Senator who has examined this issue has \nconcluded that indeed it was one of the most far-reaching, most complex \nissues we are going to address this year.\n  We have all been around this place. We all know that when it comes to \nissues with the magnitude we are talking about now, it is not something \nyou pass on a Tuesday afternoon. I can recall having come here several \nyears ago and spending more than a month on the Clean Air Act. We spent \na month. We negotiated and we said we do not know that there is ever \ngoing to be a chance to make anymore progress. Lo and behold, we stuck \nto it because the leaders on both sides said we had to, and what do you \nknow, we did it.\n  I remember Senators on the other side last year talking about how we \nreally want health care, but it is just not yet exactly what we want, \nso let us keep negotiating. We talked until we never got health care, \nunfortunately. I remember talking about the need for campaign finance \nreform, and vote after vote on cloture, and people on the other side \nsaid we have to have campaign finance reform, but this is not the bill. \nI do not know what their motivation was in voting against cloture on \nthose occasions. I know a lot on that side did not want health care \nreform, and that is a legitimate position. A lot did not want campaign \nfinance reform, and that is a legitimate position. But a lot of people \non this side want regulatory reform. We are continuing to work on this \nbill because we are not in agreement yet.\n  I believe that we can reach agreement. I believe that there is a \nlegitimate desire on the part of more and more people to try to resolve \nthese outstanding differences, to get a bill very soon. I just remind \nall of our colleagues, the bill that was defeated 48 to 52 passed \nunanimously; Republicans and Democrats voted unanimously for the bill \nin the Governmental Affairs Committee. If it was so bad then, why did \nevery single Republican vote for it?\n  I also remind my colleagues, of the 41 votes cast so far, 27 of them \nhave been offered by Senators on the other side. Only 14 amendments \nhave been offered on our side. So I do not want to delay this thing. I \ndo not want to find anymore reasons to delay final passage. Senators on \nour side are as frustrated as those on the other side. But it is \nthrough that frustration that we must work to accomplish what I believe \nwe all truly want--a good bill, a bill that can bring us an ultimate \nresolution on something that we all recognize we need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, of the 27 amendments on this side, many of \nthem were offered to accommodate requests on the other side, to make \nthe bill ``better.''\n  I do not believe the vote on the Glenn amendment reflected the vote \nthat came out of the committee unanimously. As I recall listening to \nthe Senator from Delaware, that is not the case. It is a different bill \nentirely. I ask the Senator from Delaware, am I accurate, or have I \nmisstated the problem?\n  Mr. ROTH. I say to the distinguished majority leader that what we \nvoted for in Committee was entirely different from what was voted for \non the floor in the Glenn substitute. The Glenn substitute was \ntoothless. Take, for example, the lookback. The lookback was purely \ndiscretionary on the part of the agency head. In our legislation, every \nrule had to be reviewed in 10 years, or it expired, terminated.\n  So it is totally false to say that it was the same legislation.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, what I just heard here just does not happen \nto be the truth. It does not square with the facts.\n  What we brought to the floor was basically the Roth-Glenn bill. It is \nthe same bill with three major changes--A strict definition of a major \nrule, $100 million a year, no automatic sunset review, and simplified \nrisk assessment, which was what the National Academy of Science \nrecommended. Outside of those three things, I think--and I can be \ncorrected--I believe it is largely word for word the same thing we \nbrought out of committee unanimously.\n  Only those three major items were added to the bill that came out of \ncommittee. If anyone can show me different, get up on this floor and \nsay that. To say that I misstated and that I misrepresented the Glenn-\nChafee bill is just flat not right. It is basically word for word the \nsame as the Roth-Glenn bill that came out of committee, with those \nthree changes I just mentioned.\n  I want to correct that so we make sure all Members know that.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I do not want to extend the debate on this, \nbut I do want to make it perfectly clear that there were significant \ndifferences between the Glenn substitute offered on this floor and what \npassed out of the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  It is a fact that, as far as cost-benefit analysis was concerned, the \nuse of it was totally discretionary in the bill proposed by Senator \nGlenn; whereas, in the Governmental Affairs Committee, it had to be \nreviewed and included as part of the review.\n  When it came to the lookback of rules, it was discretionary, totally \ndiscretionary on the part of the agency head as to whether there would \nbe any rule on the schedule. Whereas, in contrast, in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee bill, every rule had to be reviewed in a 10-year \nperiod or it was terminated.\n  So, while a lot of the language was the same, the fact was the thrust \nwas different, because in one case there were requirements that cost-\nbenefit be done, and the other there was not.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we will make an analysis and enter in the \nRecord tomorrow what the exact changes were. I do not believe that is a \nfair representation of the bill. We will make the entry in the Record \ntomorrow after we have had a chance to analyze both bills, side by \nside.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10400-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10401-S10402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1825\n\n(Purpose: To ensure equal opportunity and merit selection in the award \n                         of Federal contracts)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Mr. President, since I have the floor, I lost the floor at \nthe discretion of the Chair, and I do not wish to delay this matter a \ngreat deal, but I do think that the discussion that has taken place \nbetween the majority leader, the minority leader, and others----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator seeking to object to the \nreading being dispensed with?\n  Mr. EXON. I believe I was recognized by the Chair in my own right, \nwas I not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the reading of the \namendment to proceed.\n  The Chair recognized the Senator from Nebraska on the assumption that \nhe might request the reading not proceed. But if the Senator does not \nrise for that purpose----\n  Mr. EXON. Would the Chair kindly explain the rules to the Senator? I \nbelieve the rules say that when an amendment is offered, if the Chair \nchooses to recognize someone else, that is within the authority of the \nChair. Is that not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, if the amendment has been \nread in its entirety. The amendment was being read when the Senator \nfrom Nebraska sought recognition. Recognition is often sought for the \npurposes of \n\n[[Page S10402]]\nasking unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed with, and the \nSenator from Nebraska was recognized with that in mind.\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, I understand now we are on the affirmative \naction matter. Before we go into that, I will make a few brief remarks \nwith regard to the exchange between the majority leader, the minority \nleader, and others, with regard to the bill that just failed with the \nthird cloture vote.\n  I encourage the majority leader to recognize the fact that there are \nmany, if not all Members on this side of the aisle, that are just as \nmuch concerned about regulatory reform as those on the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  I was, frankly, rather amused to hear the majority leader say it \ntakes 60 votes to get anything done around here. Does anyone remember \nlast year? Does anyone remember last year, when we had to have 60 votes \nto do anything, with the possible exception of adjournment?\n  Now, the facts of the matter are, as one Senator who has been on many \nsides of many issues on this floor, I simply say that I was with the \nmajority leader on a very close vote not too long ago with regard to \nhow we are going to balance the Federal budget, and a constitutional \namendment to do that.\n  Once again, the Senate is so closely divided on this issue, \nregulatory reform, because it is a very key issue.\n  I say to the majority leader that at least as one Senator, and I know \nfrom the meetings that I attended there are others, as so ably stated \nby the Democratic leader, that we think we are very close. We get down \nto these situations, though, and the old bulls lock horns. The old \nbulls like to say unless you do it my way, you are against regulatory \nreform.\n  I think there is general consensus for regulatory reform. I was very \npleased that the Senate voted on the Glenn amendment, 52 to 48. I \nthought we were very close under that kind of a proposal.\n  Now, whether or not the Glenn amendment is exactly the same as that \nwhich was indicated earlier as not being necessarily true or not, I \nthink that most reasonable people would agree that the Glenn amendment \nis extremely close,\n if not identical, which I would agree, to what was, I think, \nunanimously passed out of the committee at one time. I simply say that \nwe are not nearly as far apart from resolving this important issue of \nregulatory reform as I think the majority leader has indicated.\n\n  I do not wish to impugn the motives of the majority leader at all. \nBut I noticed on several occasions he indicated 100 percent Republican \nsupport for the measure, which implied, with the three or four other \nDemocrats that he also complimented for their help, that all was lost \nbecause of minority Democrats just would not yield.\n  Sometime or other, the minority has to stand up when they think \nthings are not going correctly. Why can we not take the Glenn \namendment, that was defeated on a very close rollcall, 52 to 48, and \nuse that as a means to come together in a bipartisan fashion? But, oh, \nno, we cannot do that. We have to use, as the basis of consideration, \nthe proposition that the majority leader has indicated it is not \npossible, under the circumstances, to come together.\n  I say to the majority leader and my colleagues on that side, whom I \nfrequently vote with, I think we are that close. I do not believe there \nis any sincere effort for most of us on this side of the aisle to be \nobstructionist, as the majority leader seemed to indicate in his \nremarks. I therefore suggest that it is time that we not give up. It is \na time that we start working together on this matter of regulatory \nreform, which I think is very, very important.\n  But I want to compliment the Democratic leader for saying this \nprobably is the most far-reaching bill that we will even consider or \npass in this session of the Congress. It is a very important matter and \nthere are some major concerns on this side of the aisle, some of which \nare not necessarily shared by this individual Senator. But I happen to \nfeel it is critically important for us to recognize and realize, when \nwe pass major pieces of legislation, we must take the time to consider \nas best we can. And I happen to feel it should be clear to all that, \nwhen we get ourselves into a situation where we are passing this type \nof legislation, major legislation under anyone's definition of that, \nthat 60 votes should be in order. I think the 60 votes are there. I \nreally believe we can get things done in this particular matter if we \njust keep on trying.\n  Therefore, I say to the majority leader, come forth once again, Mr. \nMajority Leader, come forth and talk to the minority leader. I feel \nvery confident that we are that close to coming up with something I \nthink would be generally satisfactory--not totally satisfactory, \nbecause this is a piece of legislation that is obviously so complicated \nand so difficult that we are probably never going to get unanimous \nconsent. However, I say to the majority leader, come, let us reason \ntogether. I have talked at great length about this with the minority \nleader, and I think the \n\n[[Page S10403]]\nminority leader is in a position to speak for enough of us on this side \nthat we could get cloture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10402-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1827 to Amendment No. 1825\n\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, I would just like to talk, again, \nabout regulatory reform. We have been discussing, on this floor, who \nkilled regulatory reform. But the rank and file small business person \nout in America knows one thing for sure. Regulatory reform just died in \nthe U.S. Senate and the small business person who has been looking for \nrelief so he or she would be able to grow and prosper and create the \nnew jobs that keep our economy vital are not going to have that \nopportunity because we have not done the job we said we would do to try \nto get the harassment of Federal regulations off the backs of our small \nbusiness people.\n  We have been working on this bill for 10 days. There are hundreds of \namendments still left on the bill that we failed to get cloture on once \nagain. We have had three cloture votes. What is it going to take? We \nhave been in rooms meeting, talking about the issues that were raised. \nBut the bottom line is, in 10 days of intense negotiations, floor \ndebate, working on this bill, we have failed and the small business \npeople of our country especially are going to understand that we did \nnot get regulatory reform. And when 54 out of 54 Republicans voted for \nit to go forward, I think they are going to figure out who wanted \nregulatory reform.\n  We just passed bills that open trade in the world: NAFTA, GATT, so we \nwould have the opportunities to compete. But our business people cannot \ncompete when they are so saddled with regulations that they have to add \ncosts to their product because of the regulations and, therefore, the \nproduct will not sell in the international marketplace because it is \npriced too high. That is the bottom line. That is why it hurts the \nability to create jobs in this country, when we have so many \nregulations that our businesses are spending money in lawsuits and \nregulatory compliance and they cannot put the money where it needs to \nbe, and that is trying to make their product better, giving jobs to \npeople to create the products and being able to sell those products \nanywhere in the world because we can be competitive.\n  So, Mr. President, something died here today and I do not think the \nsmall business people of our country are going to be asking who did it. \nBut they are going to know that their regulatory burdens are not going \nto be lifted.\n  Mr. President, that is a pretty sad message to have to send to the \nsmall business people of this country. We cannot let regulatory reform \ndie like this, by two votes. It would be unconscionable. So I hope the \nDemocrats will get together, and I hope they will say the rhetoric is \nreal and say what we can really do to take away the 300 amendments that \nare now pending on the bill. And if they are serious, they can do \nsomething about it.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me just say, I have been listening to \nall this back and forth. I think it is part of the process. It does not \nbother me too much. But I listened to my constituents. One Senator gets \nup and says it this way. Another Senator gets up and says no, it is \nthis way and you are wrong. No, you are wrong.\n  Somebody has to be right and somebody has to be wrong. I learned from \nthe other side of the aisle how to file amendments. They bring them in \nhere 100 at a time, you know? They taught us how to put the amendments \non. Now we get accused of having a few amendments out. We talk about \nNAFTA. Something happened to NAFTA in the House because they cut off \nthe ability to help Mexico by eliminating the funding.\n  The Democrats did not do that, Republicans did. There is a scenario \ngoing here, bouncing back and forth like a ping-pong ball. I think it \nis time everybody understand we do not intend to let this bill die. \nThat is No. 1.\n  No. 2, we want to continue to talk. I have been here day and night. I \ndo not think any of the Senators have had to spend the night here \nrecently. Get the cots. The Senator from Texas probably remembers all-\nnight sessions. You know, it gets to be an interesting occasion. It is \nawfully hard to keep somebody on the floor. It is awfully hard to get \nany kind of rest, but we have been here all night. Recently we have not \ndone that. That is the debate of this institution.\n  So when you start badmouthing each other around here, I do not think \nit helps anyone. It just hardens the situation. I think we ought to \ncontinue to talk, continue to work. We want to make as good a bill as \nwe possibly can.\n  I have never heard in any of the remarks tonight what it does to \nindividuals. What does it do to the general public? What does it do to \nthe worker? What are these things we are trying to do here now?\n  I hear nothing about big business. Big business had a 14-percent \nincrease in profits the first quarter and individual hourly wages went \ndown. Something is going well out there, if they are making that kind \nof money. Somehow we have to come together and think about the \nindividual and working with the companies.\n  Mr. President, I had not intended to make any remarks. I do not \nnormally make many speeches on the Senate floor. But I just think this \nknocking each other out here, just hardens the situation. It creates \ngridlock, to come out here and get accused of things. We do what we \nthink is best. I do not always win. I am having a hard time winning \nanything right now.\n But I understand the procedure. I was here for 6 years when the \nRepublicans were in the majority in the Senate before. I went from \nmajority to minority. Then all of a sudden we got it back again. We are \nback someplace else.\n\n  So it is the system, and the system is debate. The system is talking. \nThe system is communicating. The system is doing the best job you can, \nand you have to have something that you really believe in. And when you \nvote for it, you voted on the best piece of legislation that can be \nproposed to this institution. Sure, we have disagreements. That is what \nit is all about. That is what the committee system is all about. We do \nbasically the same thing in committees that we do on the Senate floor. \nWe listen to witnesses. We make up our mind. We offer amendments. We \nvote on amendments, and we vote the legislation up or down to send it \nto the Senate floor. That is part of the system. Then we do it \nbasically again. It goes through the mill several times before it goes \nto the President for signature.\n  This is not a stealth Congress. A stealth Congress is to do it real \nquick and get rid of it before you get someone to jump on you or before \nthe phone starts ringing off the hook, before people start sending out \nletters. Stealth Congress is do it quick and get it over with. \n\n[[Page S10404]]\n\n  Some things are too important to do them quickly and get it over \nwith. Some things are too important to individuals in this Chamber. And \nI learned from Majority Leader Mike Mansfield that on the Senate floor \neverybody is equal except the majority leader and the Democratic leader \nin this case. And the Chair recognizes them before anybody else. I \nunderstand that. That is a precedent. We exercise that. But everybody \nelse has an individual right here. So we exercise that. I hope that we \nnever lose that and that we start working together rather than try to \ndivide, which will not get us together in the future.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10403-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10404-S10405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think we are talking about unanimous-\nconsent requests here that will allow both of these amendments to be \nvoted on. So let me go ahead and talk about my amendment, which is the \namendment that is trying to eliminate set-asides in the Federal \nprocurement process--in the context of this bill as a beginning. And \nthen let me explain why the Murray amendment is a sham amendment that \ndoes not deal with the problem but that simply gives cover to those who \nwant to allow set-asides in the funding for the legislative branch.\n  Let me begin with my amendment. My amendment is the amendment that we \nhave worked on with outside legal groups. It has been endorsed by the \nleadership in the House, it is being offered by Congressman Gary \nFranks, and it is basically an effort to focus in on one particular \nproblem.\n  This is a precise, surgical amendment, and what it says is this: The \nbill before us is the legislative branch appropriations and this \namendment deals with nothing except legislative branch appropriations. \nI plan to offer a similar amendment on other appropriations bills that \ncome to the floor of the Senate this year.\n  What this amendment says is that in the letting of contracts, in \nspending money, none of the money will be spent in such a way that \nrequires or encourages the awarding of any contract or subcontract if \nsuch an award is based, in whole or in part, on the race, color, \nnational origin, or gender of the contractor or subcontractor.\n  So what this amendment says in its first part is that when we spend \nmoney through the congressional branch of Government, we have to engage \nin competitive bidding, and that when someone submits the low bid who \nis qualified, that person will get the contract, and that in no \ncircumstance can the low bidder, who is at least equally qualified, be \ndenied the contract to give it to someone else based on a preference \nthat flows from race, color, national origin, or gender.\n  That is part 1 of my amendment.\n  Part 2 of my amendment has to do with outreach and recruitment \nactivities. And part 2 of the amendment makes it very clear that \nnothing in this amendment would prevent any effort to help people bid \non contracts, to hold seminars on bidding, provide assistance to people \nwho want to bid on contracts, or go out and inform people of the \nexistence of those contracts.\n  In short, we can expend money. We can exercise tremendous effort to \ntry to help people get on the playing field and to compete. But once \ncontract offers have been submitted, then the selection process must be \nbased on merit--and on merit alone.\n  The next provision of the bill makes it clear that we are not seeking \nhere to override contracting that is done with schools designated as \nhistorically black colleges and universities.\n  The next provision of the bill makes it clear that this is all \nprospective. We are not going to go back and undo any existing \ncontracts. In addition, we are not going to override any existing court \norders. If a court acts in the future and finds that a remedy for \ndiscrimination is the establishment of a set-aside, we are making it \nvery clear that would stand.\n  Now, basically, that is what my amendment does. And if my amendment \nis adopted, what it will do is end set-asides in contracting for the \nlegislative branch of Government. If this amendment is adopted and it \nbecomes law, what it means is that none of the money appropriated in \nthis bill can be used for the purpose of letting a contract where \nanybody is given a contract based on race, color, national origin or \ngender.\n  Now, let me talk a minute about the Murray amendment, because what we \nhave in the Murray amendment is the same convoluted language that the \nPresident used yesterday. This is more of the same effort to try to use \nwords to confuse. Let me just read it to you, and I think that if you \nthink about it a minute it jumps out at you as to what this amendment \nis trying to do. Let me read you the language:\n\n       None of the funds made available in this act may be used \n     for any program for the selection of Federal Government \n     contracts when such program results in the award of Federal \n     contracts to unqualified persons.\n\n  Mr. President, no one is saying that people who get contracts because \nof race or color or national origin or gender are necessarily \nunqualified. That is not the point. In fact, it seems as though the \nwhole purpose of this language is to confuse. What we are saying is \nthey are not necessarily the best qualified. They very well may be \nqualified, but the point is somebody else might have been better \nqualified or have submitted a lower bid. If all we are doing is saying \nthat you cannot grant contracts to people who are unqualified, as the \nMurray amendment says, then we are not doing anything unless I can come \nin and say: Well, look, I bid a contract to build a sidewalk here at \nthe Capitol and I bid the contract at $55,000. Someone who was given \npreference bid the contract at $155,000, and they got the contract. But \nunder the Murray amendment, the only way that I could get any relief, \nif I was the contractor who bid it at $55,000, would be if I could \nprove that the contractor who got the bid for $155,000 was unqualified.\n  Now, they may be qualified; they may be unqualified, but the point is \nthe Federal Government should not be paying $155,000 for work that it \ncan get for $55,000. Nor should it be letting contracts in America \nwhere somebody is given a special advantage over somebody else.\n  We listened yesterday as the President gave a very passionate speech, \nbut when you got down to the specific language of the details of the \nproposal, it was more doubletalk. And the doubletalk basically is the \nimplication that this is an issue about whether a privileged contractor \nis qualified. It is an issue of whether they are the best qualified.\n  The second issue has to do with the fact that you cannot give \nsomebody preference over somebody else without discriminating against \nthe person who is not receiving the preference.\n  In the final analysis, something that the President clearly is clever \nenough to understand but was hoping we were not clever enough to \nunderstand is that whenever you give somebody a special advantage on \nthe basis of race or color or national origin or gender, that means \nsomeone else is discriminated against because they do not get that \nbenefit. I believe that what we have got to do is to end set-asides in \ncontracting and what better place to start than in the legislative \nbranch of Government.\n  So we have before us two amendments. One amendment is a serious, real \namendment which says that none of the funds contained in this bill will \nbe used for contracts where someone is given a special privilege so \nthat they get a contract that on the basis of merit they would not have \ngotten. The other amendment says that none of the funds will be used to \naward a contract if doing so results in the award of Federal contracts \nto unqualified persons.\n  Mr. President, that is not the issue here. The issue here is not \nwhether the contractor who got advantage based on race or color or \nnational origin or gender was qualified. The question is were they the \nbest qualified.\n  The amendment then goes on to use many terms which are very \ndifficult, if not impossible, to define. For example, ``In reverse \ndiscrimination.'' Well, by definition, if the most qualified contractor \nwith the lowest price did not get the contract, I think any reasonable \nperson would call that reverse discrimination. \n\n[[Page S10405]]\n\n  Now, Mr. President, here is the point, and then I will yield the \nfloor because I understand that an agreement may have been worked out. \nIf you are for set-asides, I think you ought to have courage enough to \nstand up and say it. If you believe that in America we ought to \nlegislate unfairness for some reason, that we ought to reject merit, \nand that we ought to give people contracts based on their race, their \ncolor, their national origin, or their gender, it seems to me that you \nought to do something that President Clinton did not have courage \nenough to do yesterday. That is, you ought to stand up and say it, and \nyou ought to vote against my amendment.\n  It seems quite another thing to offer an amendment which basically \nsays that you cannot give a contract to an unqualified person. The \npoint is that many people--in fact, I would guess in almost every case \nthe loser of competitive bidding every day in America in public \ncontracting is qualified. It is not the point that they are not \nqualified. The point is they are not the best qualified. They did not \noffer the best bid. They did not offer the lowest price. Therefore, \nthey should not have gotten the contract.\n  So if you vote for the Murray amendment, in my humble opinion, what \nyou are doing is simply seeking political cover because you do not want \nto tell people you are for set-asides. I am opposed to set-asides. \nThere is only one fair way in America to decide who gets a job; there \nis only one fair way to decide who gets promoted; there is only one \nfair way to decide who gets a contract, and that is merit.\n  And if you do it any other way than merit, it is inherently unfair, \nit is inherently divisive, and it ultimately pits people against each \nother based on their group. The genius of America is competition based \non individual decision making and individual qualities. What makes \nAmerica work is that in America we are not part of groups; we are \nindividuals, and we have an opportunity to be judged as individuals \nbased on our merit.\n  While some will say that trying to stop unfairness written into the \nlaw of the land, because for 25 years we have had unfairness written \ninto the law of the land in set-asides and quotas, and people in \nAmerica know it and they resent it and they want it changed, what we \nare doing when we eliminate set-asides is we are going back to the \nunifying principle of America. And that principle is merit.\n  What we are saying is that if any contractor in America wants to bid \nfor a Government job, they have as good a chance to get that contract \nas anybody else. They have a chance to be judged on their merit on \ntheir bid. To do it any other way is totally and absolutely unfair. And \nI believe it should be rejected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10404-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10405-S10416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 120 \nminutes for debate on the pending Gramm amendment, No. 1825, and the \nMurray amendment, which would be modified to reflect that it be added \nat the appropriate place in the bill, and that the time be equally \ndivided between Senator Gramm and Senator Murray. And that following \nthe conclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on \nthe Gramm amendment, to be followed immediately by a vote on the Murray \namendment, as modified, and that no amendments be in order prior to the \ndisposition of the two amendments, and that the Exon amendment, 1827, \nbe withdrawn. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nalready consumed by both sides be considered subtracted from the \noverall time limitation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Reserving the right to object. Mr. President, I will not \nobject. I would just like to know how much time would be left then on \nboth sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington would have 1 hour \nand the Senator from Texas would have 44 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object. I would like the \nstipulation added to give this Senator 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator from Pennsylvania restate \nhis request?\n  Mr. SPECTER. As I understand it, there is 1 hour on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 1 hour. The \nSenator from Texas has 44 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Perhaps I can inquire of the Senator from Washington if \nI might have 10 minutes on your side?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would be willing to yield 10 minutes from my side to \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the chair. I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, so ordered.\n  So, the amendment (No. 1826), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used for any program for the selection of Federal \n     Government contractors when such program results in the award \n     of Federal contracts to unqualified persons, in reverse \n     discrimination, or in quotas, or is inconsistent with the \n     decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Adarand \n     Constructors, Inc. v. Pena on June 12, 1995.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I sit here tonight and I think about the \nwords ``affirmative action,'' and I listened to the words on the floor. \nI wonder sometimes if we have all grown up in the same country because \nI grew up in a country that said you have equal opportunity, an equal \nchance and an equal ability in this life to get a good education, to \nget a good job and make it in this country.\n  Mr. President, that is what the affirmative action program means to \nthis Senator from the State of Washington who stands here tonight on \nthe floor of the Senate as one of eight women in this body.\n  Mr. President, when I hear the words ``quotas,'' ``reverse \ndiscrimination,'' ``preferences for unqualified individuals,'' I am \nastounded because that is not what I see in affirmative action today. \nAnd I think it is a twisting of the debate to try and make people think \nthis program is about something that it is not about. This program is \nabout giving people an ability to make it in a country where we care \nabout all individuals, no matter who they are or where they come from \nor what they look like.\n  And I think that is a particularly important agenda to retain in this \ncountry. It certainly is one I want for my children and my \ngrandchildren who will follow me.\n  The amendment that I have put forward says quite clearly that no \nFederal funds can go to any affirmative action program that results in \nquotas, in reverse discrimination, or in the hiring of unqualified \npersons. The amendment makes it very clear to the agency that its \naffirmative action programs must be completely consistent with the \nSupreme Court's recent decision in the Adarand case that affirmative \naction programs could be justified only if they served a compelling \ninterest and were narrowly tailored.\n  The amendment recognizes that the battle against discrimination in \nAmerica has not yet been won. And I invite all of you to go out into \nour schools, to go out into our institutes of higher education, to go \nout into the workplace and see that it is not yet won for women and for \nminorities. And affirmative action programs are very important to \nwinning that battle.\n  Mr. President, as I listen to the amendment that comes before us--and \nI heard my colleague from Texas say he was going to offer this \namendment on every appropriations bill--I wonder how much money he is \ntalking about and who he is going after. I did not have time, of \ncourse, to put this into a chart that all of you could see. Frankly, I \nthought I would save the Senate money because that is what we are \ntrying to do. So I did not make a chart. But I will share with you what \nI have on this.\n  The total awards that are given in Government contracting, prime \ncontracts, is $160 billion. Of that, $1.9 billion--$1.9 billion--out of \n$160 billion go \n\n[[Page S10406]]\nto women-owned business awards. That is who we are targeting in the \nunderlying amendment. That is who--$1.9 billion out of $160 billion. A \nvery small amount, $6.1 billion to small disadvantaged business awards. \nA total of about $8 billion out of $160 billion--$160 billion--$8 \nbillion going to small disadvantaged business and women-owned business. \nThat is who we are targeting in the underlying amendment.\n  It seems very clear to me that it is a good goal in this country to \nassure that disadvantaged people, that people who do not have the same \nopportunities, are given the ability to move ahead in the workplace. \nAnd I urge my colleagues to defeat the Gramm amendment and to vote for \nthe Murray amendment. That is a positive way to move in affirmative \naction in this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Maine how much time he would \nneed?\n  Mr. COHEN. Ten minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I was intrigued with the Senator from Texas' comment \ntoward the very end of his presentation where he said that for 25 years \nwe have legislated unfairness. We have passed legislation not based on \nquality, but rather on race and gender.\n  The 25 years stood out in my mind because it tended to ignore that \nfor 200 years we have tolerated and practiced unfairness. We said that \nall men are created equal. That is our defining document. Not ``all \nwomen are created equal.'' Not ``all blacks are created equal.'' They \nwere not even treated as human but only three-fifths human, as slaves, \nas pack mules. We broke up their families, and we humiliated them for \nyears and years--not 25 years--but a couple of hundred years or more. \nAnd suddenly we come back and say, ``Well, it is all equal now. The \nfield is completely level. We live in a colorblind society.'' Does \nanyone here really believe that, that we live in a colorblind society?\n  There was an item in the paper recently about ``good ol' boys'' \ngetting together for a good old time. They were Federal employees--ATF, \nmaybe FBI, maybe Secret Service, maybe IRS. Does anyone here truly \nbelieve that we do not live in a colorblind society today, that \ndiscrimination does not exist?\n  The Senator from Texas says that we should not let someone get a \ncontract based on a preference.\n He believes that if you give someone a special preference, you impose \na disadvantage on others. That is one side of the argument. How about \nwhenever you impose on someone a special disadvantage by virtue of \ntheir race or gender? It seems to me that you give someone or another \ngroup a special advantage.\n\n  The Senator from Texas would like to have the best-qualified people \nreceiving contracts. I agree. How about Jackie Robinson, do you think \nhe was the best-qualified player at the time? How about Satchel Paige, \ndo you think he was the best-qualified pitcher at the time? Was he \ngranted access to the professional leagues? Jackie Robinson, yes, he \nwas the first to break through the color-barrier, after years and years \nof practiced racial discrimination. Satchel Paige played the prime of \nhis career in the Negro Leagues, only making it into the big leagues \nafter the color-barrier had been broken. But he made it to the Hall of \nFame nonetheless.\n  The difficulty is, of course, that none of us believe in quotas, \nbecause quotas are arbitrary, they are capricious, they are without \nmerit. But the Senator from Texas believes we should have not more \ngroup preferences. Well, how about veterans? Is that in the amendment? \nI do not think so. I hope not. But make no mistake, we grant \npreferences to many groups.\n  We grant preferences to veterans because they have made a great \nsacrifice for this country. We take that into account and we grant them \npreferences, regardless of what their contribution was. Some served in \ncombat. Some served as medics. Some served as flight assistants. Some \nserved back in the United States. They all were willing to make the \ncommitment, so we treat them as a group and we give them special \nconsideration, as we should.\n  How about small businesses? Are we prepared to eliminate the small \nbusiness set-aside, and give no more preferences in government \ncontracts to small business? Should we let them go up against the giant \nconglomerates, without a care of how small or how capable they are. \nEven if they cannot compete against the big guys--tough luck, no \nspecial consideration.\n  I know that there is some disagreement about affirmative action, even \nwithin the minority community. There are some who feel that the very \nexistence of affirmative action has stamped the red letters of ``AA'' \non their foreheads; that they somehow have been stamped as affirmative \naction babies; that people believe they could not make it on their own, \nnotwithstanding their capabilities; that they are seen only as the \nbeneficiaries of affirmative action.\n  I watched a program just this evening where one very passionate \nindividual said, ``I don't want to support any program that infers or \nimplies that I am somehow inferior.'' That really is not the issue, \nbecause he is not inferior. The problem is that he and others have been \nvictims of societal discrimination. Others call it racism for that is \nwhat it is. The truth is that they were not judged based on their \nquality, they were not judged based on their merit, they were not \njudged based on the content of their character, but they were judged \nbased on the color of their skin. That has been the practice over the \ncenturies in this country.\n  Yes, progress has been made. But I listened to the stories of the \nTuskegee airmen and I remember the turmoil they experienced fighting in \nWorld War II, feeling they had to fight two enemies: one called Hitler, \nthe other called racism in this country.\n  I listened and I remember very well Congressman Louis Stokes, who was \na member of the Iran-Contra committee, speaking about what it felt like \nfor him to make a contribution to his country in the service, but to be \nbarred from eating and sleeping in the same barracks as his white \ncounterparts. It did not matter that he was prepared to die on the \nbattlefields; that was OK. You are equal out on the battlefields, you \nare just not equal in the barracks, you go to the other room, you go to \nthe other fountain, you sleep in another place.\n  That has been changed, not through the marketplace, but through \nactual affirmative action on the part of the U.S. Congress. We changed \nthat. We helped to legislate the beginnings of equality--not entirely, \nbut we helped to legislate at least a part of the way. But it still \nexits day in and day out.\n  I can give you example after example of people who walk into places \nof employment who are turned down, not because they are not qualified \nor the best qualified, but simply because of the color of their skin or \neven their gender. So we have not arrived at a color-blind society. I \nknow there are those on the floor who will say our goal must be a \ncolor-blind society, and I agree, but we are not there yet, not when \nyou put Martin Luther King's photograph in the cross-hairs on a T-\nshirt, not when you put signs up that say, ``No blacks''--and I am \nqualifying it a bit here--``are allowed to cross this line.''\n  The Senator from Texas says this is simply a surgical strike on this \nparticular piece of legislation. But he has already indicated there is \ngoing to be surgery after surgery. This is only one surgical strike. We \nhave a bombardment coming until every aspect of any kind of remedial \naction for past, present and future discriminatory policies are \neradicated.\n  So why have we had set-asides? We ought to face the issue, why have \nwe had set-asides? It is because blacks and other minorities have been \nfrozen out and women have been locked out of opportunities. We have had \n200 years-plus of this discrimination, but only 30 years of trying to \novercome that. We are not trying to put unqualified people into \npositions, but to give those people who are qualified an opportunity to \nbreak through the barriers that we have allowed to exist for a long, \nlong time. The point of affirmative action is not to establish quotas, \nit is to allow qualified people to overcome discrimination.\n  So the Senator from Texas asked the question: If you believe we ought \nto legislate unfairness, then you support the amendment that has been \noffered as a substitute. I would put it another \n\n[[Page S10407]]\nway: If you believe we ought to ignore unfair practices, if you believe \nwe ought to allow those who have been historically and to this day are \ntreated unfairly in the marketplace to continue to be discriminated \nagainst, then you vote for the amendment of the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I think the choice is pretty clear. I hope when the \nvote finally comes that we will reject overwhelmingly the amendment of \nthe Senator from Texas and support that of our colleague from the State \nof Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized. Who \nyields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Maine for his \nvery eloquent remarks and support. I hope all our colleagues had the \nopportunity to hear what he had to say. I yield as much time as she \nneeds to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington \nfor yielding.\n  At the outset, I want to tell you a little story that happened in my \nlifetime. When I was very young, 7 or 8 years old, we went south on the \ntrain from Chicago to the city of New Orleans. We were going through \nAlabama. We stopped at a train station, and there were water fountains. \nThis is in the days Senator Cohen has referenced, the days when there \nwas official segregation in this country.\n  We stopped at a train station. One of the water fountains was labeled \n``colored.'' My mother, because she did not want to start a ruckus in \nthe train station, would not let us go to the colored fountain to get a \ndrink of water, even though we were thirsty.\n  My little brother, however, who was about 5, laid out in the train \nstation and had a temper tantrum because he wanted to have some colored \nwater. He thought it was going to come out of the fountain pink, blue, \ngreen, yellow, and red, a rainbow of colors, and he was determined to \nhave some colored water.\n  Mr. President, I want to suggest the amendment of the Senator from \nTexas is colored water. This amendment tries to convince us that it is \nan amendment in favor of fairness and an amendment in favor of \ndiversity, an amendment in favor of America and the kind of country \nthat we are, a diversity of people, people of all colors and genders \nand coming together, and that somehow or another this supports that \nvision of America.\n  But, in fact, just as we all knew that the water coming out of that \nfountain in that segregated train station in Alabama was not pink and \ngreen and blue, we knew in our hearts, we knew it was just plain old \nwater, but it was going to be set aside. It was different water. It was \na segregated situation for those of us who were not white.\n  We know at the base that this amendment seeks to roll back the clock \nand turn back the gains that women and minorities--as limited as they \nmay be--have made in this country in the last several decades.\n  You know, maybe we should thank the Senator from Texas because, quite \nfrankly, this issue was bound to come to the floor. He has already said \nhe is going to have it on every bill. Maybe we should have this debate \non every bill. But I think it is of critical importance that we tell \nthe truth about what this amendment is and point out to the American \npeople that colored water is not pink and green. It is not a rainbow. \nColored water is just that--it is something that is less than what is \ngiven to everybody else.\n  This amendment of the Senator from Texas is just that--it is \nsomething less. Yes, we are indeed clever enough to use his words to \nunderstand exactly what he is talking about in this amendment. And this \nworld will understand exactly what he is talking about with this \namendment.\n  The Senator from Maine talked about the past and the ugly history \nthat we all know about in this room. Let me submit that the issue of \naffirmative action is not as much about the past, or even the present, \nas it is about the future--the future that these young people will \nhave, the future that we give to the next generation of Americans.\n  If that future is going to allow for us to build as a nation on our \ndiversity, as a strength of our Nation as opposed to weakness, then we \nmust defeat this attempt by the Senator from Texas and every other one \nhe or anybody else comes up with on this floor. If we are going to send \na signal that we believe in opportunity for America, then we must \ndefeat this attempt to roll back opportunity.\n  There is no question, as the Senator from Washington pointed out, \naffirmative action does not guarantee anything to anybody. It is not a \ncarving stone where you get it just because of your belonging to a \ngroup. It is a principle based on merit. It is not about quotas.\n  Frankly, when we talk about preferences, the Senator from Maine is \nexactly right. We have all kinds of preferences. We have preferences \nfor senior citizens; we have preferences for people, depending on where \nthey live; we have preferences for people based on the fact that they \nserved in the military, whether they ever saw a war or not; we award \npreferences because we think there is an objective, a value, if you \nwill, that is important to promote.\n  So why, then, this argument that somehow or another, by allowing an \nopportunity to compete for women and minorities, that sets up some \npreference that may not be logically or ethically or intellectually \nsupported? Why, then? Given the history, and given where we are and the \nfact that the evidence makes it clear that discrimination and exclusion \nfor women and minorities still exists, not only in our community, but \nalso in our economy.\n  There were, in the report that the President had done, ``The \nAffirmative Action Review,'' results from random testing. They make the \npoint that there was a series of tests conducted between 1990 and 1992. \nIt revealed that blacks were treated significantly worse than equally \nqualified whites 24 percent of the time, and Latinos were treated worse \n22 percent of the time, et cetera, et cetera. It goes on.\n  So we know, everybody here knows that discrimination still exists, \neven though we are all, I hope, committed to its eradication. We all \nknow that is a fact. But discrimination notwithstanding, the fact is \nthat the numbers do speak for themselves. Why is it that we are still \nlooking at a situation in which, for our procurement in this Nation, at \nthis time 50 percent of the population being female, 1.21 percent of \nthe contracts awarded in 1993 went to women-owned businesses--1.21 \npercent. The amendment of the Senator from Texas seeks to roll that \nback.\n  Now, does this suggest that 98.89 percent of the people that got the \ncontracts were better qualified than that 1.21 percent of women-owned \nbusinesses? I think everybody in this room and everybody listening \nknows that there are other explanations for why that figure is so low.\n  So why, then, is it inappropriate to suggest that we give women-owned \nbusinesses, that we give minority-owned businesses a shot; that we give \nthem a chance to compete, not based on any lack of qualifications, but, \nindeed, based on qualifications? Why are we suggesting that we close \nthe door on that chance, that we shut down that opportunity and indeed \ncripple the diversity that I believe--and I hope my colleagues will \nconcur--is at the heart of the future of America.\n  The fact of the matter is that that diversity has been talked about \nin many instances by businesses in this country as a business \nimperative. We are in a global economy with global markets, and not \neverybody in the world who does business is male, and not everybody in \nthe world who does business is white, and not everybody who does \nbusiness in the world speaks English, for that matter. So does it not \nmake sense for us to, if you will, stir the competitive pot a little \nbit, to allow for an equality of opportunity for all Americans to \nparticipate in this economy and in building this Nation for this global \neconomy and preparing our country to compete in this world market? Does \nit not make sense for all Americans to allow every child a chance to \nparticipate on an equal basis, to give everybody a shot--not that we \nguarantee a young person a chance \n\n[[Page S10408]]\nwhen we allow for a college scholarship. We do not guarantee them an \n``A'' in chemistry, but we guarantee them a chance to get into the \nclassroom so that possibly if they are an ``A'' student, our Nation \nwill benefit from the contribution they can make.\n  Well, that is the whole point of affirmative action, Mr. President. \nThat is the whole point of the kind of initiatives that have been taken \nto provide, if you will, sheltered markets for women and minorities, \nand it is not as though anybody has abused any of this. There are only \n1.21 percent women-owned businesses.\n  Last year, Senator Hutchison and I worked to pass legislation calling \nfor a 5 percent procurement goal--goal, not quota; not a guarantee, but \na goal--for women-owned business. Five percent. Half of the population \nin this country are female. We said, How about 5 percent? This \namendment would roll that back and say, you have 1.21 percent now and \nlast year we thought it would be a good idea to move the goalposts and \nallow you to at least compete, to try to get to 5 percent. And now we \nare going to say, well, all bets are off, here is your colored water, \ndrink it and be happy. I do not think that is the will of this U.S. \nSenate. At least, I certainly hope not.\n  I would go further to say that the position that is expressed in the \nGramm amendment has already been rejected by seven out of nine of the \nSupreme Court Justices in the recent case of Adarand versus Pena. I \nwould like to read what Justice O'Connor said in Adarand. I think it is \nsomething we need to hear. This was the author of the majority opinion \nthat said race-based classification had to withstand strict scrutiny. \nShe said:\n\n       The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the \n     lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority \n     groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and \n     Government is not disqualified from acting in response to it.\n\n  Yesterday, President Clinton made a statement in which he said we are \ngoing to comply with the law, with Adarand; we are not going to allow \nfor any quotas. We are going to make sure the programs, where they have \nnot worked appropriately, are going to work right. We are going to do \nthis right. He called upon the American people, really, to speak to the \nhigher angels of our nature, to what kind of future do we want to see. \nDo we want a future in which diversity becomes part of the energy of \nthis country, where if you, again, stir the competitive pot and allow \nminorities to participate in the economy and allow women to participate \nin the economy and allow Americans all to participate in this economy \nand to participate in making our Nation strong? The President thought \nthat was a sensible approach.\n  I daresay, Senator Murray's amendment, which I strongly support, \nunderscores that notion. Her amendment says that ``none of the funds in \nthis act may be used for any program when such program results in the \naward to unqualified persons in reverse discrimination, or in quotas, \nor is inconsistent with the decision of the Supreme Court in Adarand.''\n  So her amendment says we are going to do this right, do it consistent \nwith the law. Senator Gramm's amendment, on the other hand, says we are \njust going to knock the feet from underneath the table of opportunity, \nand we are going to tell women and minorities, ``Do not bother to come \naround. We have nothing for you. And, indeed, if you are going to \ncompete, you are going to have to do it as though you were not female, \nminority, or as though you were starting on a level playing field.''\n  I think everybody knows that is colored water.\n  Now, I mentioned appealing to the higher angels of our nature. I know \nmany other people are waiting to speak on this. I would like to yield \nthe floor so that they can. But I would like to refer to Abraham \nLincoln, who, of course, was a U.S. President from my State of \nIllinois.\n I like to refer to him because he was one of the greatest Presidents \nthis country has ever had. He said in an 1862 address to Congress:\n\n       Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this \n     Congress and this administration will be remembered in spite \n     of ourselves. No personal significance or insignificance can \n     spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we \n     pass will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the last \n     generation. . . . We--even we here--hold the power and bear \n     the responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave, we assure \n     freedom to the free--honorable alike in what we give and what \n     we preserve. We shall nobly save or meanly lose the last, \n     best hope of earth. Other means may succeed; this could not \n     fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just--a way \n     which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God \n     must forever bless.\n\n  Mr. President, Abraham Lincoln was talking about the great \nconflagration that this country went through. At the same time, I think \nthat we are right now at another kind of crossroads in this country \nthat will determine whether or not we will go forward, we will nobly \nsave or meanly lose the last, best hope of Earth.\n  This Nation's future will depend on whether or not we can open our \narms, and whether or not we can provide for equality of opportunity, a \nchance for every American. I appeal to my colleagues not to close that \nchance down, not to shut the door on the efforts that have begun by \nwomen and minorities to integrate themselves as full participants in \nthe economic and cultural and social life of this great Nation.\n  Our future is at stake in this vote and the following votes. I \nencourage my colleagues to take the high road and to support the Murray \namendment and to reject this attempt--reject this attempt--to divide us \nand to send us back to a day which, I think, is one that none of us \nwill be proud to visit again. Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I always love it when Abraham Lincoln is \nquoted. I think everyone in this body agrees with the quote that we \njust heard. In fact, the Nation fought a bloody civil war over it and \nended up the winner from having settled the issue, which had to be \nsettled, and was settled correctly.\n  That is not what Abraham Lincoln said about fairness. In fact, there \nis another Lincoln quote that goes right to the heart of this issue. \nThat Abraham Lincoln quote is where Abraham Lincoln sought to say, what \nis the objective of government in providing fairness? On this issue, \nwhich applies directly to this point, Abraham Lincoln said, ``The best \nthat a government can guarantee is a fair chance and an open way.''\n  I do not believe, Mr. President, that any living Lincoln scholar \nwould argue that if Abraham Lincoln stood here on the floor of the \nSenate today, he would support a provision that gave one American an \nadvantage over another when the American who lost the advantage had \nmerit on his side.\n  I do not believe that Abraham Lincoln would have argued that two \nwrongs make a right, which is an argument that we heard earlier today \npresented, as well as a bad argument can be presented. But it is a bad \nargument, nonetheless.\n  Let me begin by trying to answer each of the points that were made. \nFirst of all, the Adarand decision. Senator Murray's amendment conforms \nto Adarand because it has no choice but to conform to it because it was \nbased on the Constitution of the United States.\n  Contrary to the distinguished Senator from Illinois, my amendment is \nwritten in total conformity with Adarand. In fact, it has written on \npage 3 language consistent with the Adarand decision. That is, if the \ncourt finds that a contractor was subject to discrimination, the court \nmay provide a remedy with a set-aside to correct the impact of that \nparticular discrimination.\n  My amendment has the core of the Adarand decision written right into \nit. In no way is it inconsistent with Adarand, nor could it be, since \nthe Adarand decision is now binding.\n  Now, let me go through the points. One of the things I want to thank \nmy colleagues for is that nobody argued that the Murray amendment was a \nreal amendment. We heard arguments that my amendment would end set-\nasides, and that set-asides should not be ended, that people should be \ngiven preference, and that it is perfectly acceptable in America to \ngive contracts to people who are not the low bidder and who might not \nhave merit. I want to thank them for doing that, because that is \nsomething that Bill Clinton did not have the courage to do in his \nspeech the other day.\n  Nobody here tried to argue that, to say that you could not give a \ncontract \n\n[[Page S10409]]\nto someone who was unqualified, somehow represented a real alternative \nto the amendment. Everybody that has spoken thus far has made it very \nclear that this is an issue about set-asides, and that they are for \nthem, and that they believe that preferences are right, and that they \nare somehow justified.\n  Now, here is how they are justified. Senator Murray says they are \njustified because under 8(A) contracting there is only $8 billion, that \nthey are justified because we are giving only $8 billion on a \nnoncompetitive basis, and we are spending so much money, and that is so \nlittle money, so the unfairness involved here is relatively small, and, \ntherefore, we ought to continue to do it.\n  Now, it does not take into account all the other contracts that have \nsome set-aside written in them. Just about every highway contract in \nAmerica has a set-aside for subcontractors. Set-asides create \nunfairness. That is what the Adarand decision was about.\n  The second argument is an argument that 90 percent agree there has \nbeen terrible unfairness in our country. I think everyone realizes \nthat. I think it is part of our history. I think the greatness of \nAmerica is that we have worked to overcome it. I am proud of that. I \ntake a back seat to no one in hating bigots and hating racism and \nhating prejudice. Hate is a strong word, and I use it advisedly.\n  Two wrongs do not make a right. We cannot correct inequity in America \nby making inequity the law of the land. We cannot correct things that \nhappened 200 years ago by discriminating against people in America in \n1995.\n  The only way to have a clean break with the unfairness of the past is \nto purge unfairness from the present and the future. I believe we need \nto be absolutely relentless in enforcing the civil rights laws. It is \nfundamentally wrong to give somebody a job when someone else is better \nqualified. It is fundamentally wrong to promote someone based on some \nprivilege they are granted, rather than promoting the person who had \nthe better record.\n  It is profoundly wrong, in fact it is un-American, to give somebody a \ncontract when they were not the low bidder, when they were not the high \nquality bidder. I do not believe that two wrongs make a right. I think \nwhat we have to do is relentlessly pursue fairness. You cannot have \nfairness by legislating unfairness. That is what this debate is about.\n  The next argument is that women get only 1.21 percent of the \ncontracts. I remind my colleagues, women own over half the wealth in \nAmerica.\n It is almost certainly true that, given the fact that women own over \nhalf of General Motors and General Electric and General Dynamics, \ntrying to take the set-asides in a particular program of the SBA and \nsay that those are the only contracts that women are getting is \ninaccurate. Women are running large corporations, women are running \nbusinesses that are not applying for contracts under set-asides and \nwhich get contracts in America every day.\n\n  The next argument is: Allow people to have a shot. Continue set-\nasides so that people have an opportunity to compete.\n  People have an opportunity to compete in America because our system \ntoday, and we thank God that it is so, is based on merit and \ncompetition. Not that it is perfect. Not that we do not need to work \nrelentlessly to make it closer to being perfect. But the point is, \npeople are allowed to compete. And to say that people cannot compete \nunless they are given a special privilege, I think, perverts the whole \nidea of equality. The idea that by ending set-asides we are saying to \nwomen and to minorities, ``Do not come around,'' assumes that only with \nset-asides can women and minorities compete.\n  Finally, the argument for equal opportunity is completely turned on \nits head here. What my amendment seeks to do is to bring fairness back \nto the American system of contracting. For 35 years in America, \nbeginning with an Executive order under Lyndon Johnson, compounded by \nan Executive order under Richard Nixon, and now written into numerous \nlaws and regulations, we have written in quotas and set-asides. We have \nwritten in a system that consistently, in terms of the programs that \nare targeted for this purpose, grants contracts not based on merit but \ngrants contracts based on privilege. That is fundamentally un-American. \nIt is fundamentally wrong and it needs to end.\n  The American people, by overwhelming margins, are opposed to set-\nasides. We are spending the taxpayers' money. How can we be good \nstewards of the taxpayers' money when we grant a contract to someone \nwho was not the high-quality or low-cost bidder? I think we cannot.\n  It is fundamentally unfair to give a contract to someone who did not \nwin it on merit. What my amendment seeks to do, and does it explicitly, \nis this. It preserves our ability to spend money to recruit, to \neducate, to help. Under my amendment we can go out and advertise \ncontracting all over the country. We can target the advertising to \nspecific groups. We can help specific groups in learning how to do \nGovernment contracting. We can help them get onto the playing field. \nBut that is where help ends and competition begins. Because under my \namendment, unlike the amendment of Senator Murray, once people are on \nthe playing field, once the contracts are submitted, we are then forced \nto make the judgment on merit and merit alone.\n  I conclude by simply saying this. There is no other way to make \ndecisions that are fair, other than on merit. As long as we make \ndecisions on any basis other than merit, they are inherently unfair. As \nlong as we make decisions on any other basis besides merit, then we are \njudging our fellow Americans as part of groups rather than as \nindividuals. When the whole world is torn apart with struggles where \npeople feel themselves more part of a group than part of a nation, I \nthink this is a destructive policy that divides Americans. And I think \nit needs to end.\n  Our goal as Americans has always been that people would be judged as \nindividuals. As a great American once said, ``that they would be judged \nby the content of their character and not the color of their skin.''\n  Set-asides are wrong. They are unfair. They are un-American. And they \nshould end.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from Texas yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Senator has 10 minutes. I would be happy if he uses \nhis time. I will preserve mine. I have people coming to speak.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may ask the Senator from Texas a question on my \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. On my time, then, I ask the Senator from Texas this \nquestion.\n  He makes the comment that his amendment is consistent with Adarand, \nand said further that it would have to be.\n  I will call the attention of the Senator from Texas to the opinion of \nJustice O'Connor, saying,\n\n       The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the \n     lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority \n     groups in this country is an unfortunate reality and \n     Government is not disqualified from acting in response to it.\n\n  Then, Justice O'Connor goes on to say,\n\n       When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling \n     interest, such action is within constitutional constraints if \n     it satisfies the ``narrow tailoring'' test set out in this \n     Court's previous cases.\n\n  Well, the first question would be: Having stated that the Senator \nfrom Texas agrees with Adarand, then would the Senator from Texas not \nagree with what Justice O'Connor has said, that a race-based preference \nis appropriate when it is narrowly tailored to satisfy a compelling \nState interest?\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me pose a parliamentary inquiry. Is it \nin order for a Senator on his time to ask me a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If unanimous consent is given.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me try to answer this one. Then I will \ngo with the regular order. I am not objecting. \n\n[[Page S10410]]\n\n  Let me say this: What I have done in section B on page 3 is simply \nmade it clear that if a set-aside is granted as a remedy to an act of \ndiscrimination that has occurred where the party that is being subject \nto the set-aside committed discrimination, then clearly it would be \nallowed under section B. I believe that is consistent with the Adarand \nruling. And I believe it is consistent with what I am trying to achieve \nhere.\n  My objective is not to ratify the Adarand ruling; my objective is to \nend set-asides--except in those cases where the court might order them \nas a specific remedy to discrimination which has been committed by the \nparty that the set-aside is being imposed on. For example, if the \ncourts found that a contractor had engaged in discrimination against a \nsubcontractor, under my amendment they would have the potential remedy \nto order that the contractor grant a set-aside of the contract to the \nparty that has been discriminated against. But under my amendment, they \ncould not order that the contractor--or my amendment would not order \nthat the contractor have a set-aside program for people who have never \nbeen discriminated against by him and may never have been discriminated \nagainst by anyone else.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that is very interesting but not a \nresponse to my question. And with 10 minutes I cannot engage in a \ndialog with the Senator from Texas.\n  I submit to the body that under the standards articulated by the \nSenator from Texas in the Adarand case, his amendment must fail because \nwhere there is a preference based on action by the Government, or where \nthere is a preference based where a previous court order has not been \ncomplied with, that is satisfied under Adarand.\n  And Justice O'Connor goes on to point out that in the Paradise Case, \nUnited States versus Paradise, in 1987, every Justice of this Court--\nthat would include Justice Scalia--agreed that the Alabama Department \nof Public Safety's ``persuasive, systematic and obstinate \ndiscriminatory conduct'' justified the narrowly tailored race-based \nremedy.\n  One of the difficulties, Mr. President, in considering a matter of \nthis complexity within the confines of a 2-hour time limit is that it \ndoes not give nearly enough opportunity to go into depth on these very \nintricate issues. And I think it is worth noting that both the Speaker \nof the House of Representatives and the majority leader of the U.S. \nSenate decided not to take up this complex question in this session \nuntil, as the Speaker put it, there could be other determinations made \nto help women and minority groups in America.\n  The first notice I had of the amendment by the Senator from Texas was \nshortly before he presented it on the floor. It is a very, very complex \nmatter, it is a very serious matter, and it is one really where the \nSenate cannot deal intelligently in the course of 2 hours of debate.\n  My own view, Mr. President, is that it would be vastly preferable to \ndeal with discrimination on an individualized basis, and that we really \nought to have an EEOC which did not have a backlog of 100,000 cases. I \nam very much opposed to discrimination in any form, and that includes \nreverse discrimination, as the Supreme Court of the United States \nstruck down reverse discrimination against white males in the Memphis \nfirefighters case, when the layoff orders discriminatorily applied to \nwhite males.\n  But there are situations where the unanimous Supreme Court has \ndecided that where there has been a situation where the Court has \nordered a remedy, and it has been disregarded, or when there is State \naction such as the activity of the Alabama State Police, that a remedy \nis required and a remedy is entirely in order.\n  The comments by Justice O'Connor, it should be noted, were concurred \nin by Chief Justice Rehnquist and by Justice Anthony Kennedy. And it is \na very important fact, as noted by the Court, that the persistence of \nboth the practice and the lingering effects of race discrimination \nagainst minority groups in this country constitute an unfortunate \nreality, and Government is not disqualified from acting in response to \nit.\n  I must say, Mr. President, that on short order, the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Washington cannot really be considered \nappropriately, and at sufficient length either. But it is my hope that \nthis body does not act summarily and hastily in an effort to deal with \nthe very important point involved here.\n  In the last few seconds that I have, let me ask the Senator from \nTexas one further question as to whether he would agree that a \npreference based on race would be justified in the case of United \nStates versus Paradise, where, as noted, the Alabama Department of \nPublic Safety had a pervasive, systematic, and obstinate discriminatory \nconduct by consistently refusing to hire any African American, which a \nunanimous Court, including Justice Scalia, said justified the narrow \nrace-based remedy, whether the Senator from Texas would agree that that \nis proper, and that it is not within the confines of his amendment but \nin fact would be prohibited on the face of his amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if I might respond, let me say that the \ncase that is referred to by our distinguished colleague from \nPennsylvania has to do with quotas. My amendment has to do with set-\nasides. So they are entirely different subjects.\n  But let me say that I refer him to section B on the page where I \nspecifically in my amendment provide a remedy based on a finding of \ndiscrimination by a person to whom the order applies.\n  So that if a contractor, which is the relevant subject here, engages \nin discrimination, a remedy that the Court can use under this amendment \nis to impose a set-aside, and clearly in that case, different than a \nquota case which would have no application here, it would be \npermissible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The time yielded to the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May I have 1 additional minute?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes. I yield 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Since the Senator from Texas bases the distinction of \nset-aside as contrasted with quotas--this Senator is very much opposed \nto quotas--then would he agree that a preference based on race would be \njustified in the face of a discriminatory practice as indicated by the \nState of Alabama?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I believe that, if it is proven that an employer is \nengaged in discrimination, a justifiable remedy is to set a \nquantifiable goal whereby they demonstrate as a way of undoing that \ndiscrimination that it no longer exists. The point is in my amendment I \nspecifically allow that with regard to set-asides.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That would be a preference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have a number of speakers who want to \nspeak on my side. I would like to know how much time is left on both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 18 minutes 45 \nseconds. The Senator from Texas has 32 minutes 39 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would be happy to let the Senator from Texas use his \ntime since I have a number of speakers. We do not have much time at \nthis point.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me make a couple of points. And then, \nsince the distinguished Senator from Washington has those here who want \nto speak, she can go ahead and allow them to do it.\n  The distinguished Speaker of the House has endorsed this amendment. \nThis amendment is expected to be offered to the defense appropriations \nbill by Congressman Gary Franks, and the principal cosponsor is the \nSpeaker of the House. What the Speaker of the House is going to do, in \naddition to supporting this amendment, is to support other independent \nprograms that are aimed at doing two things: No. 1, creating more \nopportunity; No. 2, relentlessly pursuing the civil rights laws of the \nland. But it is clearly incorrect, and verifiably so, to say that the \nSpeaker of the House does not support this approach. In fact, he is a \ncosponsor of the amendment that will be offered by Congressman Gary \nFranks. Congressman Franks and I have joined together on this effort. \n\n[[Page S10411]]\n\n  One of the distinctions that continues to be made, which is a \ndistinction that cannot sustain any rational analysis, is an effort to \nsay that some people can be given preference without engaging in \nreverse discrimination against others.\n  This, Mr. President, is falling back into this rhetoric barrage from \nthe President yesterday where the President gave a wonderful, \npassionate speech against discrimination in America. I could have given \n90 percent of that speech and have felt as passionate as the President \ndid. But when he got down to the heart of matter, this mumbo jumbo \nterminology comes into effect.\n  And what the President said--and what we have seen touched on here on \ntwo occasions--is the following: I am for giving some people \npreference. But I am not against creating--I am not for treating \nanybody else unfairly. I want to, in the process--it seems to me that \nour colleagues who oppose ending set-asides in America are saying--I \nwant to give these groups preference because I believe that they \ndeserve it either based on past actions in the country or based on the \nfact that in the big scheme of things this is not that much money, but \nit is not my intention in doing that to discriminate against anybody \nelse.\n  That basically is what is being said.\n  That is a nonsensical statement, Mr. President, because if we have a \ncontract bid and we have the five of us who are here and we all have a \nbid on the contract, and if Senator Domenici is given the contract \nbecause a preference is given to people from New Mexico, when in fact \nthe Senator from Illinois has submitted the low bid, and let us say, to \nmake the case as clear as possible, we are all qualified to do the job, \nby the very act of giving Senator Domenici the contract, anyone who had \na lower bid than he did has been discriminated against.\n  The point is you cannot give preference to one group or to one \nindividual without discriminating against another individual or group. \nThis is the nonsensical position that the President has sought to \nargue.\n  There is only one way to decide who ought to get a contract in \nAmerica, and that way is merit. There is only one way to fairly decide \nwho gets a job, who gets a promotion, or who gets a contract, and that \nis merit. When you decide it on any other basis, you are inherently \nunfair and you are inherently discriminating against people who would \nhave won the contest on merit. Once you start doing this, you are \nbuilding unfairness into the system.\n  We need to end set-asides. We need to be relentless in our pursuit of \nthe equality of opportunity. You cannot promote fairness by legislating \nunfairness. We cannot correct the ills of the country 10 years ago, 20 \nyears ago, 200 years ago or even yesterday by writing the same \nunfairness into the law of the land. If someone is discriminated \nagainst, the courts have the power, under my amendment, to use a \nspecific set-aside to remedy it, but they cannot simply argue that they \nare part of a group that is given preference.\n  What my amendment does is end set-asides. What the amendment of the \nSenator from Washington does is cloud the issue by saying that \ncontracts cannot be given to people who are unqualified.\n  The issue is not that the bidder who gets the contract is \nunqualified. The issue is when you have a set-aside, the bidder who \ngets the contract is not necessarily the best qualified. And that is a \nkey distinction. That is why one amendment is trying to end set-asides \nand why the other amendment is a ruse to protect them, to foster and to \ncontinue the unfairness that is imposed on the system.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, civil rights remains the unfinished \nbusiness of America. We have taken very bold steps in recent decades \ntoward racial and gender equality, but discrimination in this Nation \npersists, sometimes in very obvious forms, and sometimes, in very \nsubtle forms.\n  The recent report of the Labor Department's Glass Ceiling Commission \nhighlights the many problems still encountered by victims of \ndiscrimination seeking to move up the ladder in firms across America. \nThat study, which resulted from legislation sponsored by Senator Dole, \nreported that 97 percent of the top executive positions in Fortune 1500 \ncompanies were held by white men, who are just 43 percent of the work \nforce.\n  According to U.S. Department of Labor statistics, black and Hispanic \nmen in 1993 were about half as likely as white men to be employed as \nmanagers or professionals and much more likely to be employed as \noperators, fabricators, and laborers. Black and Hispanic women were \nmuch more likely than white women to be employed in generally lower \npaid service occupations.\n  In the Nation's largest companies, only six-tenths of 1 percent of \nsenior management positions are held by African-Americans, four-tenths \nof 1 percent by Hispanic-Americans, three-tenths of a percent by Asian-\nAmericans. White males make up 43 percent of our work force, but hold \n95 percent of these jobs. Only 9 percent of American Indians in the \nwork force hold college degrees.\n  These are just a few statistics that indicate that a level playing \nfield does not exist in the American work force. Much remains to be \ndone. We will not eradicate race and gender bias in the work force by \nignoring it--we must continue our efforts to increase the participation \nof individuals who traditionally have been excluded. Only then can we \nclaim to be a nation of opportunity. Only then can our diversity truly \nbecome our strength.\n  We are now in the midst of a significant debate over how best to \nfight discrimination. This debate is sometimes very difficult, and \noften very painful.\n  The issue of discrimination is too important to be grist for the mill \nof partisan politics. We must examine the methods of fighting \ndiscrimination, but we should not question the goal of realizing truly \nequal opportunity for all Americans.\n  Affirmative action is one of our most effective means and best hopes \nfor realizing that goal, and for rooting out bias based on race and \ngender.\n  The President said it best: ``When done right, affirmative action \nworks. It contributes to greater diversity in environments where none \nexisted. It provides opportunity for individuals who have been denied \nopportunity through hatred, exclusivity, and ignorance.''\n  Civil rights is and has always been a bipartisan issue in Congress. \nThe Party of Lincoln has produced many stalwart supporters of strong \ncivil rights legislation: former Senators Everett Dirksen, Jacob \nJavits, Lowell Weicker, and Jack Danforth have led the way in the past, \nand many of our Republican colleagues carry on that distinguished \ntradition today.\n  We must continue that bipartisan effort in the ongoing battle against \ndiscrimination in all its ugly forms.\n  If there have been abuses of affirmative action, then we need to \nreview and address those abuses. Every Federal affirmative action \nprogram should be reviewed to determine whether it has been effective \nor detrimental.\n  But we must be careful to protect those programs that have worked and \nthat continue to work well.\n  President Clinton is right to broaden set-asides, to oppose quotas, \nto reject preferences for unqualified individuals and reverse \ndiscrimination, and to end programs that have been unsuccessful.\n  And he is right to support the continuation of a program that \ncontinues to make a difference in the lives of those who would \notherwise remain on the fringes of society, despite their \nqualifications, their education, their hard work, and their integrity. \nThose principles are the essence of the Murray amendment, and I urge \nthe Senate to approve it.\n  Long ago, our forefathers founded this Nation with the fundamental \npromise of equal justice for all. We as a nation have not yet achieved \nthat promise, but we have taken bold steps toward its fulfillment. We \nmust not retreat from that promise.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered \nby Senator Gramm to kill affirmative action initiatives in Federal \ncontracts, and I support the second degree amendment offered by my \ncolleague, Senator Murray.\n  I oppose the Gramm amendment because we cannot walk away from the \npeople in our society who have either been left out or pushed aside. We \nmust have tools to deal with persistent bias.\n  Mr. President, the second degree amendment is very clear. No Federal \n\n[[Page S10412]]\n  funds can go to any affirmative action program that results in quotas, \nin reverse discrimination or in hiring of unqualified persons.\n  It makes very clear that affirmative action programs must be \ncompletely consistent with the Supreme Court's recent Adarand decision. \nThat decision says that affirmative action programs could be justified.\n  The second degree amendment recognizes that the war against \ndiscrimination is not won. It still exists today.\n  And affirmative action is just one tool needed to help win that \nfight. But, other tools are needed too--education, employment, and \nFederal contracts.\n  Mr. President, I support enforcing the law. That means no quotas \nbecause they are illegal. That means no discrimination because it is \nillegal--and totally unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, affirmative action is about persistent bias in our \nsystem, bias in our government agencies, and unfortunately bias in the \nhearts of many people.\n  I'm talking about persistent bias against minorities, against women, \nand against economic empowerment.\n  What do I mean when I say persistent bias? I mean when people are \ntold throughout their lives ``no'' based on their race, gender, or \nethnicity.\n  When they are told no you can't go to that school, no you can't \nbelong to that club, no you can't go to that college, no you can't have \nthat job, no you can't have that promotion, no you can't have that \nsalary.\n  Persistent bias exists. The Supreme Court knows it. Statistics show \nit. And every day, someone in the United States feels it.\n  Mr. President, statistics prove that persistent bias exits. The Glass \nCeiling report shows the disparity against minorities and women.\n  Black men with professional degrees earn 79 percent of what white men \nmake with the same degree and in the same job.\n  The report states that white men make up 43 percent of the work \nforce, but hold 95 percent of the senior management positions.\n  And women and minorities who do make it to the top, make less than \ntheir male counterparts. Why is this the case? Persistent bias.\n  It's not just about race, it's about gender too.\n  Exactly how far have women come? Only 5 percent of senior managers in \nFortune 2000 industrial and service companies are women.\n  Women are over 99.3 percent of dental hygienists, but are only 10.5 \npercent of dentists. Women are 48 percent of all journalists, but hold \nonly 6 percent of the top jobs in journalism. And it's 1995.\n  Mr. President, with facts and statistics like these, the need for \naffirmative action programs is crystal clear.\n  I'm against discrimination. Everybody else says they are too. But the \nproblem is that many people don't practice what they preach.\n  Throughout America, growing and pervasive economic insecurity has \ncreated immense anger and anxiety. We've heard it all. Some say that \nminorities and women are the problem. And so, many attack affirmative \naction.\n  Everyone is afraid of losing their job, being downsized or being left \nbehind.\n  Blacks and whites, men and women are being pitted against each \nother--most often for political gain. But, let's be clear. Scapegoating \ntakes us nowhere.\n  Look at how we all benefit from having an inclusive society where \neveryone has the opportunity to achieve and compete. Affirmative action \nhas just begun the process of opening up the competition to everyone.\n  Between 1982 and 1987, the number of women-owned businesses rose more \nthan 58 percent.\n  And now we see more women and minorities in law enforcement, \nfirefighting, skilled construction work, and as doctors, and lawyers. \nBut, it's not enough.\n  Discrimination is still alive and well. My constituents write me \nrepeatedly about discrimination in our Federal Government agencies and \nright here in our own U.S. Congress.\n  Mr. President, We must provide an opportunity ladder. The Gramm \namendment cuts off that opportunity.\n  You don't have to sacrifice quality when you pursue equality. \nAffirmative action is not a guarantee for those who could not otherwise \nsucceed. It's simply an opportunity to compete. I support giving \neveryone that opportunity.\n  I'm going to fight for equality, fairness, and a merit-based society, \nwith real opportunity structure so that people can make it, and the end \nof persistent bias. We have to show people that we are on their side.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nDodd and Senator Feinstein as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois [Mr. \nSimon].\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President and my colleagues, I thank my colleague from \nWashington for yielding. I rise in strong support of her amendment and \nin opposition to the amendment of the senior Senator from Texas.\n  Let me give you a very practical example. When I was in the State \nlegislature, a young African-American contractor just starting off \nwanted to do a little bit of curbing work at Scott Air Force Base. He \ncould not get a bond. I went to bat for him. I could not believe the \nbarriers that were there for this person to get a surety bond so he \ncould get a construction job.\n  We finally, after screaming and hollering, broke through, and he \nbuilt up a business and eventually moved to Atlanta and became one of \nthe 10 wealthiest African-Americans in our country. The barriers are \nthere for a great many people, and surety bonds are a good \nillustration.\n  I introduced a bill last session--I believe I have introduced it \nagain this session--to say you cannot discriminate in the issuance of \nsurety bonds. Why, you would think a little bill like that would have \nno trouble at all. What a storm of opposition it got.\n  We have to make opportunity for people. Has anyone here ever heard of \na country club that is all white and all male? Well, they are all over \nthe place. We know it. And that is where a lot of business gets done.\n  Can affirmative action be abused? Of course, it can be abused, like \neducation and religion and a lot of other things, but it is sound.\n  We are talking about opportunity. I heard my friend, Rev. Joseph \nLowery, from Atlanta, on NPR yesterday. He heads the Southern Christian \nLeadership Conference. On affirmative action, he said those who resist, \nthey push somebody outside; you have to stay out in the rain all night. \nThen in the daytime you invite them in, and they are standing on the \noriental rug and we say, ``Sorry, we cannot give you any business \nbecause you are wet.''\n  We have to recognize that there have been some abuses in our society.\n  Let me just give you one example. Today, the average woman who works \nmakes 72 cents as much as the average male. That is not good. But it \nused to be 59 cents. That is progress. I have seen a lot of progress in \nour society, and if this is adopted, this is just one step down the \nroad to knocking out other affirmative action.\n  We all practice some affirmative action. It is very interesting that \nin Senator Gramm's amendment, he accepts that we are going to have \naffirmative action for historically black colleges and universities. I \napplaud him for taking that step, but what is true for historically \nblack colleges and universities ought to be true for women and \nminorities who are in business also.\n  What we have to do in our society is make opportunity for people. The \namendment offered by our colleague from Washington moves on some of the \nabuses without saying let us stop doing this. And make no mistake, if \nthis is adopted, there will be other amendments in the future.\n  When my friend from Texas says, well, people can go to court and get \nthis resolved, let us say you are a small contractor and you cannot get \na surety bond. No. 1, you probably cannot afford to go to court. No. 2, \ngoing to court sounds like an easy remedy --and I see I am getting the \nlook from the Presiding Officer here now--but the reality is that it is \njust not a realistic option. The Gramm amendment should be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time? \n\n[[Page S10413]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Gramm knows that I hold him in \nhigh respect, but frankly I do not think this is the way we ought to \nhandle a matter of this importance. Everybody that is speaking tonight \nin the Chamber obviously is well motivated, but from my standpoint \nthere is an awful lot of discussion in the Chamber that ignores \nreality.\n  The reality is that the U.S. Supreme Court, while it said we have to \ndo these things differently, acknowledged that there is discrimination \nin the United States. I believe there is. I believe we are doing \nbetter. And clearly we are better than we were 100 years ago and better \nthan 50 years ago.\n  Mr. President and fellow Senators, there is no question that this is \nan important issue--discrimination. And to come to the floor on an \nappropriations bill, no public hearings that I know of, no committee \nhearings that I am aware of, and to suggest that on each appropriations \nbill we are going to tailor some way to get rid of affirmative action \nin the United States, in my opinion, is as apt to miss the point as it \nis to solve anything.\n  Frankly, in the United States of America, we cannot rely solely upon \nthe discrimination laws of this land to bring equity and fairness to \nAmericans. In fact, many of us would stand up and say society is \nalready overburdened by antidiscriminatory legislation and that there \nought to be a better way to bring some equity into this system.\n  Now, I am a staunch proponent of capitalism, but I tell you, to come \nto the floor and say that the capitalist system will break down if \neverything is not based on competition and merit, is to ignore reality.\n  There is plenty of rule and regulation of the capitalist system that \nsets apart many things that are not based upon either merit or \ncompetition. And the truth of the matter is we ought to find a way to \ncomply with the Supreme Court's decision and do something about \ndiscrimination from the standpoint of opportunity. Not from the \nstandpoint of going to court to enforce one's rights.\n  And I submit we can find some ways. It certainly is not what we are \ndoing today. And it is not what either of these amendments will \naccomplish in my opinion.\n  The Senator from Washington yielded time to me, and I will say to my \ngood friend, I was not for her amendment either. It is too difficult to \nunderstand. We ought not be debating it here at 9:20 with 10 or 15 \nminutes per speaker. This is an important issue, really. And \nperceptionwise, it is a gigantic issue. And I do not know why we have \nto do it this way. I do not know why we have to say to the millions of \nAmericans who are worried about discrimination, ``It is just plain and \nsimple. There is nothing to it. Just come to the floor. And I have 16, \n20 words. We will fix it all up.''\n  My friend from Texas is a great wordsmith and I have great respect \nfor him. But I submit to him this is not the way to do business. I will \nnot convince him because he is convinced that this is a most important \nissue. And for that, I admire him. He has always spoken his piece. But \nthis is not the way to address this issue in the United States of \nAmerica on an hour's notice on an appropriations bill about the \nlegislature of the United States and how we pay for it. And we ought \nnot do it. Both amendments ought to be defeated. And we ought to pass a \nlegislative appropriations bill tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Let me thank my colleague from New Mexico. And I agree \nwith him we should not be legislating on this appropriations bill. As \nthe ranking member on this committee, I did not chose this evening and \nthis time to have this debate. It was certainly brought before us by \nthe Senator from Texas. And under that I offered my amendment to second \ndegree it. I am not afraid to debate this. But I agree with you. It \nshould not be done on a legislative appropriations bill.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I could not disagree with my colleague more strongly. We \nare getting ready to spend billions of dollars in the first \nappropriations bill of this year. The American people have debated this \nissue. The President of the United States spoke at great length on it \nyesterday. It has been an element in the platform of my party for over \na quarter of a century.\n  This is an issue which is well understood and it is not complicated. \nThe issue here is, should we have contracting through the Federal \nGovernment, in this case through the legislative branch of our \nGovernment, that part that we control directly--should we be letting \ncontracts as a Congress not on merit but rather on race, color, \nnational origin, or gender?\n  I say no. The American people say, overwhelmingly, no. And if we let \nthese appropriations bills pass without ending set-asides, then we are \ncontinuing a practice that the American people clearly rejected in the \n1994 election, and that, by huge a majority, the American people want \nfixed.\n  This is not an amendment that was born out of thin air. This is the \namendment that has been worked on by many, many people. It is a joint \neffort that I have undertaken with Congressman Gary Franks in the \nHouse. His cosponsor is Newt Gingrich and the amendment is supported by \nthe entire House leadership. And what the amendment says is very, very \nsimple. It says that none of the money we are going to be spending \nunder this bill can be used for the purpose of granting contracts that \nare awarded in total or in part based on race, color, national origin \nor gender.\n  My amendment clearly allows for an outreach program. The Government \ncan spend any amount of money, helping people learn how to bid, helping \npeople to get to the site of the bidding, helping people put together \ntheir bid. But, under this amendment, once the bids are offered, the \ncontract has to go to the most qualified contractor. The contract \ncannot be given to someone on the basis of preference rather than on \nthe basis of merit. The amendment is drafted so as to allow the courts \nto grant a specific remedy when a person is discriminated against. Now \nlet me touch on several other issues that have been raised by other \nspeakers before I yield the floor.\n  No. 1, there have been abuses in the past. No one disagrees with \nthat. No one could live in America and not understand that there have \nbeen abuses in the past. The point is, by legislating abuses and \nunfairness in the present and in the future, do we correct the \nunfairness of the past? Do two wrongs make a right? If two wrongs make \na right, then the adage we learned as children must be incorrect.\n  Second, a point was made it is difficult for some contractors to go \nto court. That is equally true for contractors who are discriminated \nagainst by set-asides.\n  The Senator claims to be offering an amendment as an alternative to \nmine, which says that programs cannot be awarded to unqualified \npersons. The issue here is not whether the person who gets the contract \nis qualified, the issue is, are they the best qualified?\n  The fact that the Court said under Adarand that certain types of \nquotas could be allowed under the Constitution does not mean that the \nCourt said they have to be used. We are able to set by law whether we \nwant quotas or not. And I do not want them. We are able to set by law \nwhether we want set-asides or not. And I do not want them. I think \nmerit is the only fair way to decide who gets a contract in America. \nAnd the fact that the Adarand case said that it is constitutional for \nCongress to have very narrowly focused set-asides does not mean that \nthe Court said Congress has to have them. It simply said that it would \nallow them to stand under the Constitution. But no one questions that \nwe have the right to limit them.\n  Quite frankly, my amendment does not totally ban set-asides. In the \ncase where a subcontractor or a contractor can prove that they were \ndiscriminated against in the past, on the basis of that proof a set-\naside could be used to remedy a specific wrong which is proven.\n  The idea that some have argued here is that we have a pure system of \ncapitalism that breaks down when there are impurities in it--I make no \nsuch argument tonight. America can survive \n\n[[Page S10414]]\nset-asides. America has survived quotas and set-asides for 25 years. I \nnever cease to be amazed that our system overcomes not only the illness \nbut the absurd prescription of the doctor. It survives not only the \nnatural problems we have, but the problems we impose on ourselves. But \nthe point is, do we want to continue to allocate contracts in America, \nspending the taxpayers' money, on a discriminatory basis or do we want \nto demand merit? I want to demand merit.\n  Final point. This is not a difficult issue to understand. And I want \nto emphasize this one more time because I am certain that there will be \nthose when the vote is cast who will look at the Murray amendment and \nsay, well, I voted to fix this problem. But the issue here is very \nsimple. Under my amendment we ban set-asides based on race, color, \nnational origin, or gender, period. Under the substitute amendment \nwhich is going to be voted in sequence, what it bans is granting an \naward to an unqualified person. The issue in set-asides is not that the \nperson who gets the contract is unqualified, the issue is that they are \nnot necessarily the best qualified. Is it fair to give a contract to a \nqualified person when another person is better qualified? If you have \ntwo qualified builders, and one submits a bid for $100,000 and one \nsubmits a bid for $200,000, is it OK to give the contract to the one \nwho bids $200,000 simply because they are qualified?\n  The point is, and I am very proud of the fact that nobody here has \nclaimed that in opposing my amendment, they are doing anything other \nthan supporting set-asides, period. That is what the issue is.\n  There is going to be one real vote on one real amendment. If you are \nagainst set-asides in contracts and you want a merit system, then you \nwant to vote for my amendment. If you are not against set-asides, you \nwant to vote ``no.'' If you simply believe that we ought to continue \ndiscrimination written into the law of the land, as long as the person \nwho is getting the privilege is qualified, even if they are less \nqualified, even if they have a higher bid on their contract, then you \ncould find the Murray amendment acceptable. But this is a very clear \nissue. I think everybody understands what it is about.\n  Again, when we are spending money is the time that we ought to talk \nabout the conditions under which it is going to be spent. If my \namendment is adopted, every contract that we let through the \nlegislative branch of Government will be done on merit, and the \ncontractor with the highest quality work and the lowest price will get \nthe contract. That is the only fair way to do it. The American people \nsupport it. It is the American way, and I think it is time we get back \nto it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator from Texas yield for a question on his \ntime?\n  Mr. GRAMM. How much time does the Senator have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 16 minutes, 52 \nseconds, and the Senator from Washington, 8 minutes, 45 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if the Senator uses her time up, I will, at \nthat point, yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I may not take all 5 minutes because I know \nothers want to be heard as well.\n  If he had not said it, I think I would have said it. I want to \ncommend our colleague from New Mexico this evening for his comments. I \nwill support the Murray amendment, which is the one distinction, and I \ndo that because I think having an alternative is necessary.\n  Frankly, as the Senator from Washington and the Senator from New \nMexico have said, we ought not to be considering any of these \namendments. I say, with all due respect to my colleague from Texas, \nthat it was once said by some sage that for every complex problem, \nthere is oftentimes offered a simple solution, and it is usually wrong.\n  With all due respect, I suggest to my friend from Texas that people \nhave debated and discussed and thought about this issue for a great \ndeal of time on how we try and deal with what the Senator from New \nMexico has very appropriately and properly said, regretfully, deeply \nso, there is still racism in our country, there is still discrimination \nbased on gender. Anyone who thinks otherwise is living on a different \nplanet than I am. That is a fact.\n  No one has yet come up with a perfect solution as to how we solve \nthese problems. The Senator from Washington has offered something on \nwhich I think all of us agree. Maybe we ought to this evening support \nthat amendment, because I hear the debate all the time about quotas and \nreverse discrimination. Her amendment at least puts us on record on \nthose issues. I think that is worthy of support.\n  We had the President yesterday give a major speech on this issue. He \nhas been under significant pressure for some months to come up with \nsome ideas and solutions on how we might address the issue of \naffirmative action. Whether or not you agree with everything he said in \nhis speech, he has laid out a roadmap, a plan on how we might deal with \nthese issues.\n  I think it is only fitting and proper that we in this body at least \nexercise a modicum of the same degree of deliberation as we look at \nthese issues. To suggest in the space of an hour or hour and a half, \nwith an amendment thrown up this evening, that we are going to solve \nthis problem once and for all, I think is terribly, terribly \nshortsighted.\n  So I urge my colleagues this evening, whether you agree \nphilosophically with the Senator from Texas or not, this amendment \nought to be rejected, and the people, through this body and the \nlegislative process, can decide what best action we ought to take.\n  Mr. President, let me say for my part, I happen to think that \naffirmative action in this country has made us a stronger, a better, a \nricher nation, because we have reached out to people. Merely look in \nyour own neighborhoods and communities and recognize today what a \nbetter country this is than it was even 2 or 3 decades ago when major \nportions of our population were denied public access to basic \nfacilities.\n  We are not talking 100 years ago. We have come a long way as a \npeople. The great strength of our country is our diversity, and we need \nto grope and figure out how we can constantly be more inclusive. That \nis our strength. It is not our weakness.\n  Too often when people address this issue, they appeal to the emotions \nof people. There are people who are troubled today, worried, frustrated \nabout jobs and their families and their futures, and it is so easy to \ncome along and to point to some problem as the reason for their \ndifficulties and then to appeal to those emotions. This is not a time \nfor that. We need to figure out together, in this body and elsewhere, \nin the private sector and public sector, how we can come together and \nhelp address this difficulty.\n  This is not the way to go about this. This is not the answer, no \nmatter how appealing the language may be. This is not going to help us \nsolve our problems. It divides us, and that is not what we ought to be \nabout in the U.S. Senate. We ought to be seeking the common ground that \nthe President talked about the other night and that the Senator from \nNew Mexico addressed in his brief remarks.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is right; this is not the time or the \nplace. There is a place, there is a time, but this is not the answer to \nit. So I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me just respond very briefly. I do not \nthink there is anyone here who argues that there is no racism in \nAmerica or that we do not have any discrimination today. I think we all \nknow that, thank God, there is not as much as there used to be, but if \nthere is any, and there clearly is, it is too much.\n  The point is, however, that we cannot correct unfairness in America \nby making unfairness the law of the land. We cannot correct injustices \nof the present \n\n[[Page S10415]]\nor the past by legislating injustice in the present to carry us into \nthe future.\n  The point is that any time people are judged on the basis of anything \nbut merit, it is unfair. That is our definition of discrimination. That \nis our definition of prejudice.\n  What we are doing with set-asides is legislating discrimination into \nthe law of the land, the idea being that if wrongs have existed, if \nwrongs exist today, that somehow we can correct them by making another \nwrong the law of the land. I reject that. I think that is faulty logic, \nand making unfairness the law of the land, it seems to me, simply holds \nthe system up as being corrupt.\n  Second, I want to make it clear that I have not used the term \n``affirmative action'' once in this debate, and I never use the term \n``affirmative action.'' When Lyndon Johnson chose the term \n``affirmative action'' in 1965, it is clear to me that he chose it for \none and only one reason: Nobody knew what it meant. And it is equally \nclear that nobody knows what it means today.\n  I have sought to deal with one issue, set-asides, the granting of \ncontracts on the basis of something other than merit. I make it very \nclear in the amendment, something that I have worked on with Members of \nthe House and the Senate and outside groups, that there is nothing in \nthis amendment that prohibits outreach, that prohibits recruitment.\n  The legislative branch of Government could spend an unlimited amount \nof money trying to get people to bid on contracts, trying to help them \nbid, trying to outreach to them, trying to school them, trying to be of \nassistance to them. All of that is perfectly allowable under this \namendment.\n But where this amendment draws the line is that once the contracts are \nsubmitted, you cannot decide who gets the contract on the basis of \nrace, color, national origin, or gender. You have to decide it on \nmerit. That is the American way of doing things. Any other way is \ninherently unfair, is inherently discriminatory, and it is \ndiscrimination written into the law of the land.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator yield for a question at this time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator. I wanted to ask the Senator \nspecifically about his amendment. Obviously, we are dealing with the \nlegislative branch appropriations here. What programs funded under \nlegislative appropriations are there that concern the Senator and that \nbrought this amendment to us at this time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, reclaiming my time to respond, we have, \nthroughout our appropriations process, through Executive order and \nthrough law, set up a system where routinely contracts are granted on a \nnonmerit basis.\n  I did not choose this bill. This bill happens to be the first \nappropriations bill that came up. But I think the good thing about \nchoosing it is we begin by practicing what we preach, because all the \nother appropriations bills have to do with the executive branch of \nGovernment.\n  So what I am saying here is that any contract let, whether we are \ndoing construction work on the Capitol, or whether we are doing work at \nthe Library of Congress, or whether we are doing work at the \nCongressional Research Service, or whether we are building the new dorm \nfor pages--a dorm that I did not even know existed, which is why I \nalways vote against this bill, because there is always something in \nthese legislative appropriations--or has been until this year, and I \nhave more confidence now than in the past--that I do not know about. So \nwhat this would say is, to give you an example, in the subcontracting \nor the contracting on the page dorm, that contracts have to be let on a \nmerit basis. They cannot be let on the basis of a set-aside, clear and \nsimple.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator further yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will yield for one last question.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I appreciate that because I wanted to ask the Senator \nthis. Under the legislative branch appropriations in fiscal year 1995, \nthe Library of Congress awarded five contracts for a total of $10 \nmillion that would be affected by your amendment. Out of, I believe it \nis, well over $266 million total contracts, only five of those would be \naffected by your amendment. I am curious as to why you are approaching \nthat for such a minute number on this appropriations bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Senator has said that under SBA there are only $8 or \n$9 billion of set-asides. But my response is that this is a matter of \nprinciple, it is not a matter of money. It is a matter of principle. \nThe principle is, if it were one nickel, if it were one penny, do we \nwant to be on record in the greatest deliberative body in the history \nof the world, in the greatest democracy that the world has ever known, \nsaying that we want money we expend--in this case on legislative branch \nactivities--spent in a discriminatory way?\n  So you can argue that there were only $10 million of contracts here \nand $8 billion there, and there may have been some in subcontracts. But \nthe point is not the money. The point is the principle. This is not a \ncomplicated issue. This is something we should be doing because the \nprinciple is as clear as the morning Sun.\n  Should contracts be let on merit? Or should they be let on a system \nof preference? In America, do we have competition among individuals? Or \ndo we have competition among groups? That is the issue here. It is a \nvery fundamental issue. It is a very simple issue.\n  I want to be relentless in our pursuit of equality of opportunity, \nand we cannot pursue equality of opportunity by legislating bias, by \nlegislating discrimination, by legislating unfairness. The American way \nis merit. No other way is acceptable. It is not an issue about money. \nIt is an issue about principle because it goes to the very heart of who \nwe are as a people and what we stand for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I have one quick additional question. Would the Senator \nyield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 8 minutes 36 \nseconds. The Senator from Washington has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will yield for one last question.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I just wanted to know if veterans preferences were \nacceptable to the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMM. A veterans preference is a preference we have set out in \nlaw as an inducement for people to serve in the military. It is part of \nthe reward that they get for service. Any American can join the \nmilitary if they can meet the mental and physical requirements, and in \ndoing so, they know as part of their package that they not only get the \npay, they not only get the retirement, but they get a veterans \npreference in terms of public employment.\n  It is perfectly reasonable that our Nation has set out a goal of \nencouraging people to join the military, and many people have taken the \nopportunity to serve. In fact, the veterans preference now brings \ndiversity to the Federal Government. It is a preference that promotes \nthe very objectives that our colleagues claim they want. But it is an \nobjective that is promoted through service. It is an earned benefit. \nThat is the distinction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. I guess that having 2 \nminutes really proves the point that Senator Domenici from New Mexico \nmade earlier with a considerable amount of eloquence. This is an \nimportant, really fundamental issue that goes to the core of who we are \nas a people and a society. It really should not be debated tonight on \nan appropriations bill--the legislative appropriations bill.\n  I guess about all I can say in 2 minutes is that I wish it was the \ncase when I visit hospitals--now being a grandfather with two small \ngrandchildren--that I could look at a child and feel reassured that \nthat child, regardless of gender, or regardless of race, or regardless \nof disability, would have the same opportunity. That is called equality \nof opportunity. I am the son of a Jewish immigrant from Russia, and I \nthink that is one of the most important principles to me in our \ncountry, which is why I love our country so much. But, Mr. President, \nthat is not the case. \n\n[[Page S10416]]\n\n  I think that we ought to think long and hard before we pass an \namendment which, I believe, is very extreme, and I believe that its \neffect--I do not know about purpose--turns the clock back a good many \ndecades. I think it would be a profound mistake for us to support the \nGramm amendment. I think that the Murray/Cohen/Daschle/Moseley-Braun \namendment, if we are going to have this debate tonight, should and must \nbe the prudent middle ground for us.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, for 30 years we have had unfairness built \ninto the law of the land. I am trying to turn the clock forward to the \nfuture, where not only do we have a goal of equal opportunity and merit \nas a nation, but that our laws reflect it.\n  In terms of what we all wish when we see our children, I think we all \nhope for them a society where ultimately merit triumphs. We have heard \na lot tonight about problems in America's past, and there are a lot of \nthem. But I think, also, we have to give ourselves credit. America is \nthe greatest, freest country in the history of the world. Since our \ncolleague brought up looking at his grandchildren and thinking about \ntheir future, let me conclude on that remark by talking about America \nin action.\n  My wife's grandfather came to this country as an indentured laborer \nto work in the sugarcane fields in Hawaii. I do not know whether they \nlet him vote during that period or not. But they certainly let him \nwork, and he worked off that contract.\n  His son, my wife's father, became the first Asian American ever to be \nan officer of a sugar company in the history of Hawaii. Under President \nReagan and President Bush, his granddaughter, my wife, became chairman \nof the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, where she oversaw the \ntrading of all commodities and commodity futures, including the same \nsugarcane her grandfather came to this country to harvest so long ago.\n  That is not the story of an extraordinary family. That is the story \nof a very ordinary family in a very extraordinary country. I want every \nchild born in this country to have the same opportunities that my \nwife's grandfather had when he came to America. But we are not going to \ngrant those opportunities by writing unfairness into the law of the \nland. We are not going to fix problems and unfairness in the past by \nwriting unfairness into the law.\n  There is only one fair way to decide who gets a job, who gets a \npromotion, and who gets a contract. That fair way is merit, and merit \nalone.\n  What my amendment tries to do is go back to merit. This is not a \nsweeping amendment. This amendment applies to this bill, this year. \nWhat this amendment says, very simply, is this, that in letting \ncontracts--it does not apply to contracts that already are in \nexistence, but on the contracts that we will enter into through the \nfunds that we appropriate this year, new contracts--that the letting of \nthose contracts will be on a fair, competitive basis, where merit will \nbe the determining factor.\n  This is not a revolutionary idea. Although, I guess in a sense it is \na revolutionary idea. It is the most revolutionary idea in history. It \nis the American idea. It is the American ideal. Merit should be the \nbasis of selection and award. That is what my amendment says.\n  The amendment which is offered, the alternative, says that you should \nnot give contracts to people who are not qualified, but that begs the \nquestion of whether someone else was better qualified. Merit is what I \nseek in this amendment. If you believe in it, I think you should \nsupport the amendment. If you support set-asides, I believe you should \nvote against my amendment and you should vote for the amendment of the \nSenator from Washington [Mrs. Murray].\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 2 minutes and \nthe Senator from Texas, 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much, Mr. President, and I thank \nthe Senator from Washington. I will be very brief.\n  The Senator from Texas keeps referring to two wrongs not making a \nright. We all know that the first wrong which he refers to, the history \nas well as the present experience that we had in this Nation, was \ndiscrimination.\n  Let me submit to everyone who is listening, the second wrong is not \naffirmative action. It is not our effort to fix that tragic legacy. The \nsecond wrong lies in this amendment in shutting the door, closing down \nthe small efforts, the small steps we have taken, to remedy, to provide \nfor opportunity, to give people a shot, to give people a chance.\n  I say to my colleagues, as someone who is both minority and female, I \nam not comforted at the notion that by getting rid of affirmative \naction anybody is doing me a favor. So I encourage my colleagues to \ndefeat the amendment from the Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10405-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. MACK.

Mr. President, as some of my colleagues may know, I am in \nthe process of preparing legislation that is designed to get the \nFederal Government out of the business of granting group-preferences. I \nwill be introducing this legislation next week.\n  This legislation will stand for a simple proposition--that the \nFederal Government should neither discriminate against, nor grant \npreferences to, individuals on the basis of race, color, gender, or \nethnic background.\n  Whether it is employment, or contracting, or any other federally \nconducted program, our Government in Washington should work to bring \nits citizens together,\n not to divide us. Our focus should be protecting the rights of \nindividuals, not the rights of certain groups.\n\n  The amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from Texas is \nconsistent with the approach embodied in the bill I will be introducing \nnext week. And of course, I look forward to working with him as well \nwith all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  Rather than the piecemeal approach of amending each of the \nappropriations bills, I would prefer to address this very, very \nimportant issue more thoroughly and as a separate matter--and that's \nthe point of my bill--to serve as a starting point for this discussion.\n  This legislation may not be perfect, but it is my hope that it can \nact as the basis\n for a serious, rational, and, yes, optimistic dialog on one of the \nmost contentious issues of our time.\n\n  Of course, our country's history has many sad chapters--slavery, Jim \nCrow, separate but equal. And, of course, discrimination persists \ntoday. We do not live in a color-blind society. I understand this.\n  But, Mr. President, fighting discrimination should not be an excuse \nfor abandoning the color-blind ideal. The goal of expanding opportunity \nshould not be used to divide Americans by race, by gender, or by ethnic \nbackground. Discrimination is wrong, and preferential treatment is \nwrong, as well.\n  So, Mr. President, our goal should be to provide equal opportunity--\nbut not through quotas, set-asides,\n and other group preferences that are inimical to the principles upon \nwhich our country was founded.\n\n  A relevant civil rights agenda means conscientiously enforcing the \nantidiscrimination laws. It means outreach and recruitment. And it \nmeans knocking down regulatory barriers to economic opportunity, \nincluding repeal of the discriminatory Davis-Bacon Act; enacting school \nchoice programs for low income innercity families; and fighting the \nscourge of violent crime that is unquestionably one of the biggest \ncauses of poverty today.\n  This is the agenda upon which dreams can be built--and it is an \nagenda that this Congress should be relentlessly pursuing.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10416-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10416-S10419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 1944\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I have a consent agreement that has been \napproved on both sides of the aisle on a matter other than this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the \nlegislative appropriations bill, the Senate turn to \n\n[[Page S10417]]\nthe consideration of H.R. 1944 and it be considered under the following \nagreement:\n  One amendment in order to be offered by Senators Wellstone and \nMoseley-Braun regarding Education Funding/Job Training and LIHEAP, on \nwhich there be a division, and each of the two divisions be limited to \n1 hour, to be equally divided in the usual form with all time being \nused tonight except for 30 minutes under the control of Senator \nWellstone; and that at 10:20 a.m. the managers be recognized to utilize \n10 minutes for debate to be followed by Senator Wellstone to be \nrecognize for his 30 minutes of debate, to be followed by a vote on a \nmotion to table the first Wellstone division, and that following that \nvote, the majority leader be recognized to place the bill on the \nCalendar, and if that action is not exercised, the Senate then proceed \nimmediately to a vote on a motion to table the second Wellstone \ndivision and that following that vote the majority leader be recognized \nto exercise the same right with respect to placing the bill on the \nCalendar, and if that action is not utilized the Senate proceed \nimmediately to a vote on passage of H.R. 1944.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute, 6 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I want to thank all of my colleagues who have come to \nthe floor tonight to speak so eloquently for equal opportunity.\n  I yield my remaining time to the Senator from Maine, Senator Cohen.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, at the heart of the amendment of the \nSenator from Texas is that everything should be decided on merit. That \nmakes the assumption that we are all starting off on a level playing \nfield. That makes the assumption that we all have equal opportunity and \nwe are born with that equal opportunity.\n  That completely ignores what is a reality of our lives--that not \neverybody has an equal opportunity, not everyone has equal access to \neducation, not everyone has the same opportunity to break through \nvarious barriers.\n  There is the assumption that everything is decided on merit. If that \nis the case, why do we have laws against monopolies? Why do we just not \nsay the company that gets the biggest, that provides the most for the \nleast should prevail in every case? Why do we need to break up \nmonopolies if everything is to be decided on merit?\n  We have law to prevent that because we understand that not everyone \nis treated equally in the marketplace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 3 minutes and 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me begin with the last point. No one has ever argued, \nnor does anyone believe, that any two people are born equal. No one \nbelieves that the playing field is level.\n  If the mother of the Senator from Maine loved him and my mother did \nnot love me, no law can ever make us equal. I do not know how much \nproperty the father of the Senator from Maine owned when he was born as \ncompared to any other Member. Society cannot guarantee equality, except \nin one way, and it is what Abraham Lincoln called a fair chance and an \nopen way. There is no legislative remedy to an unlevel playing field \nother than leveling it in the future so that people can compete. \nBecause there have been wrongs in the past does not justify making \nthose wrongs the law of the land in the future.\n  I believe that merit does not hold people down. Merit liberates \npeople.\n  I think we are down to a moment of decision. I want to use my final \nmoments in defining what I have offered, a very limited amendment that \nsays on this bill, this year in the Congress in congressional spending, \nthat we will provide under this appropriation that contracts cannot be \nlet on any basis other than merit.\n  Nothing in my amendment limits outreach, limits recruitment, nothing \nin my amendment overturns an existing contract, nothing in my amendment \noverturns a court order or prevents the court from issuing an order in \nthe future to remedy a specific problem.\n  What my amendment seeks to do is to bring back to America, and in \nthis particular bill, legislative branch spending, the concept of \nmerit. The alternative which is offered by the Senator from Washington \nsimply says that contracts have to go to qualified persons. That is not \nthe issue, Mr. President. The issue is not that the person who gets a \ndiscriminatory contract is unqualified. The issue is that they are not \nthe best qualified candidate. The issue is they did not submit the \nlowest bid or the best value.\n  There is only one fair way to decide who gets a job, who gets \npromoted, and who gets a contract. That is merit. That is what I am \ntrying to bring back to this individual appropriation bill.\n  If you oppose set-asides, and a huge percentage of the American \npeople do, then I urge Members to vote for my amendment and vote \nagainst the Murray amendment. The Murray amendment simply precludes \ngiving contracts to people who are not qualified. My amendment requires \ngiving contracts to people who are the best qualified. That is the test \nof merit. Not that the loser of the competition has no merit; it is who \nhas the most merit. That is the issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1827 withdrawn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 1827 \nis withdrawn.\n  So the amendment (No. 1827) was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is on amendment No. 1825.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to use just a couple of minutes of \nmy leader time to comment on the pending matter prior to the vote. I \nwill be very brief.\n  Since the days of the New Deal, our Government's goal has been to \nexpand opportunity, to give more Americans a fair chance to succeed, to \nopen doors, not to close them.\n  Affirmative action has been a bipartisan part of that goal for 30 \nyears, since the days of the civil rights revolution.\n  President Johnson issued the Executive order which authorizes \nprograms of affirmative action. President Nixon greatly expanded and \nstrengthened that Executive order 5 years later. For more than 30 \nyears, Members of the Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, all \nsupported the policy.\n  In 1986, when President Reagan's advisors were urging him to repeal \nthat Executive order, 69 Members of the Senate, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, joined in a letter to the President urging that he \nresist that advice.\n  In 1991, 4 years ago, the Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of \n1991, reversing Supreme Court rulings which undermined fundamental \ncivil rights--and part of the bill included the Glass Ceiling \nCommission, to study why women, who are 45 percent of the work force \nare less than 5 percent of top management in the private sector.\n  Just 1 year ago, the full Senate, Republicans and Democrats alike, \nwithout a single dissenting voice, voted to establish a Government-wide \ngoal of 5 percent of contracts for women-owned businesses.\n  If affirmative action was needed 9 years ago; if a study of women's \nworkplace role was needed 4 years ago; if a Government-wide goal for \nwomen-owned businesses was a good idea 1 year ago--then those who now, \nsuddenly oppose all affirmative action, all goals, all efforts to study \nthe makeup of our work force, have a responsibility to explain to the \nAmerican people what has changed.\n  In fact, not much as changed. Our goal is a colorblind society. But \nidentifying a goal and reaching it are two different things.\n  We have not yet reached that goal, and until we do, the amendment of \nthe Senate from Texas should be voted down. It is an effort to divide \npeople, not to find common ground. It is a political effort, and it \ndeserves to fail.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       vote on amendment no. 1825\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on amendment No. 1825.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine).

Mr. President, I do believe we will have a vote on the \npending question.\n  Mr. DOLE. Right. I mean after this next one.\n  Is there any demand for a rollcall on final passage?\n  Mr. MACK. No. It has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. DOLE. If we cannot get an agreement on the rescissions package, I \nintend to offer it as an amendment and then have the Wellstone-Moseley-\nBraun amendments and do it all tonight. We are not going to add any \nmore time in the morning. We have been trying to put this together for \n3 weeks. I have been here a long time. I have never been so frustrated \nin my life. So if they want to stay here tonight and keep everybody \nelse here half the night, I am prepared to offer the rescissions \npackage as an amendment as soon as we complete the next vote. If they \nare prepared to enter the agreement we thought we had, we are prepared \nto do that. So we can think it over during this vote, and I am prepared \nto offer the amendment right after this vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I informed the manager of the bill I did have an \namendment on OTA.\n  I would call the attention of the Senate to the fact that the bill \nwhich has come to us from the House takes the money for the OTA from \nthe Library of Congress, something that I wish to avoid. The House \nvoted strongly in the Chamber on that matter.\n  I think we have made a mistake, not correcting that situation to \nprotect the Library of Congress. But perhaps we can do it in \nconference.\n  In view of the problems that the majority leader just announced, I \nwill not offer that amendment now, but I want the Senate to know I \nthink we are making a big mistake to leave this situation where the \nHouse has voted overwhelmingly to maintain OTA but to take the money \nout of the Library of Congress. And we have not solved that problem \nhere, in my opinion. I disagree with the manager of the bill and his \nsolution. It is not a solution. The GAO has informed a lot of Senators \nhere that they can perform the role of OTA, which in my opinion is \nludicrous. But I will not offer the amendment at this time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. When it comes to controlling Government spending, \nnothing stands out in my mind more than the $1 billion that the Federal \nagencies toss out the window every year in energy waste.\n  The Federal Government is our Nation's largest energy waster. This \nyear agencies will spend almost $4 billion to heat, cool, and power \ntheir 500,000 buildings.\n  Both the Office of Technology Assessment and the Alliance to Save \nEnergy, a nonprofit group that I chair with Senator Jeffords, have \nestimated that Federal agencies could save $1 billion annually.\n  To achieve these savings, agencies just need to buy the same energy \nsaving technologies--insulation, building controls, and energy \nefficient lighting, heating, and air-conditioning--that have been \ninstalled in many private sector offices and homes.\n  I know what you may be thinking, ``Here we go again with another \ncrazy idea about how we need to give agencies more money so they can \nhopefully save money sometime in the future.''\n  Well you are wrong. Why? Because there are now businesses, known as \nenergy service companies, that stand ready to upgrade Federal \nfacilities at no up-front cost to the Government--that's right, at no \nup-front cost to the Federal Government.\n\n[[Page S10419]]\n\n  These companies offer what are called energy saving performance \ncontracts which provide private sector expertise to assess what energy \nsaving technologies are most cost effective, provide nongovernmental \nfinancing to make the improvements, install and maintain the equipment, \nand guarantee that energy savings will be achieved.\n  Agencies pay for the service over time using the energy costs they \nhave saved--if they do not see the saving they do not pay for the \nservice--it's that simple, that's the guarantee.\n  This type of contract is used every day in the private sector and \nState and local government facilities. For instance, Honeywell Corp. \nhas entered into these energy-saving arrangements with over 1,000 local \nschool districts nationwide, allowing schools to reinvest $800 million \nin savings in critical education resources rather than continuing to \npay for energy waste.\n  Unfortunately, even though Congress first authorized Federal agencies \nto take advantage of this innovative business approach in 1986, \nagencies have been dragging their heels.\n  To help get things moving, the Department of Energy recently prepared \nstreamlined procedures to encourage their use.\n  Now is the time for Congress to put the agencies feet to the fire on \nfinancial reform of Government energy waste. Agencies must enter into \nthese partnerships with the private sector.\n  That's why, today, I am introducing an amendment calling for the \nagencies to reduce Government energy costs by 5 percent in 1996. I'm \nalso asking that agencies report back to us by the end of 1996 to \nensure that they have actually taken action to reduce their energy \ncosts.\n  You know, we are often called upon up here to make really hard \ncontroversial decisions that please some and anger others. This is a \nwinner for everyone. If 1,000 local school boards have examined it and \nare reaping the savings, I say it's about time we got our Nation's \nbiggest energy waster on track too.\n  With this one, simple reform, we will create thousands of job and \nbusiness opportunities in every one of our States, improve the \nenvironment by reducing air pollution, and save ourselves hundreds of \nmillions of dollars every year, at no up-front cost to taxpayers.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10416-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 1944\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and the Senate proceed immediately to vote on the \npassage of the bill with no other intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, shall the bill pass?\n  So the bill (H.R. 1854), as amended, was passed.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MACK. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I will take this opportunity to \ncongratulate the managers of the first appropriations bill to come to \nthe floor, Senator Mack of Florida and Senator Murray of Washington \nState. We started them off here on the trail to sort of get a feel of \nthe body in terms of acting on these appropriations measures. They have \nnot only demonstrated the skill in putting the bill together in the \ncommittee framework, but certainly here managing on the floor.\n  Mr. President, this is a very tough year for the Appropriations \nCommittee. It is a tough year for all Members, but especially the \nAppropriations Committee, because in effect we are playing the \nimplementer, the mortician, the executioner, and many other roles in \nterms of the budget resolution and all the other various forces that \nare forcing Members to face up to some of these fiscal problems.\n  I hope that at an appropriate time we reconsider an action that would \npermit legislation on appropriations, because this type of legislation \nattracts all kinds of policy issues. It should not be on this bill or \non any other appropriations bill. We must resist that effort on the \nfloor and on the part of the committee. Since we found the test case, \nwe will bring some more appropriations bills. But I want to thank these \nmanagers.\n  I have one further point to make, and that is when I visited \nAntarctica and was introduced to the culture of penguins, and one of \nthe things about the culture was that there are seals, giants seals \nunder the ice. The penguins go along the edge of the ice looking into \nthe water to see if there are any seals there, and they are not certain \nby their vision. So pretty soon they nudge one into the water, and if \nthey swim away, there are no seals and the others jump in.\n  So to speak, an analogy can be drawn here tonight. We have had the \nseal test and it has passed well. I congratulate my colleagues.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman. At least, I \nthink I want to thank the chairman for his remarks. I appreciate that \nand appreciate his assistance as we have begun this process.\n  I also want to thank Keith Kennedy and Larry Harris for the work they \nhave done to prepare us and the bill and to assist as we move forward. \nAnd again, to Senator Murray, it has been a pleasure working with the \nSenator through conference and completing the bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I, too, want to thank the appropriations \nchair, as well as the ranking member, Senator Byrd, who have been very \nhelpful in this process, and in particular to thank the Senator from \nFlorida, Senator Mack, for a job well done.\n  We have not agreed on every part, but he has been wonderful to work \nwith and I appreciate his willingness to step down and go through this \nwith me. I thank him, and Jim English, who worked with me.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to work with you on my first bill, \nSenator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10419-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1817\n\n  Mr. MACK.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Wellstone for \nstarting this ball and getting this issue and debate going.\n  Frankly, in spite of the fact that I know there are a number of \npeople who are concerned about this particular legislation and where it \nis going, I think it is absolutely regrettable that we are just taking \nup as important an issue as this at 10:55 p.m. on a Thursday night \nfollowing a major debate around the legislative appropriations bill. \n\n[[Page S10421]]\n\n  The rescission issue has been held somewhat in limbo for the last \ncouple of weeks, in large part because Senator Wellstone and I both \nargued and agreed and suggested to our colleagues that the issues \nraised, the substantive issues raised in the rescissions action was too \nimportant to be let go in what Senator Wellstone called in a stealth \nmanner.\n  Forgive me, Mr. President, it is late, and I think we are all a \nlittle bleary-eyed, but the fact is we are now taking up, in fact, in \nstealth fashion, and limiting debate, on what I think is a very vitally \nimportant issue that should have had the kind of debate around \npriorities and around the import and the significance of the \nrescissions legislation in the context of where we are going with the \nbudget.\n  I was actually kind of delighted to hear Senator Hatfield's \ndescription of the seal test, because if anything, in terms of a seal \ntest, this rescission legislation, I think, indicated the first step \nthat we are taking as a legislative body in responding to the desperate \nneed--and I think it is a desperate need--to get our fiscal house in \norder.\n  Last year, Mr. President, I cosponsored the balanced budget \namendment, because I believed that if we were serious about our future, \nif we were serious about not handing to the next generation a legacy of \ndebt, if we were serious about reducing Federal deficits and taking the \nsteps necessary to achieve balance, to get on the glidepath to a \nbalanced budget and not bankrupting the country by the turn of the \ncentury, if we were going to do that, we ought to move in the direction \nof trying to achieve budget balance.\n  The good news, Mr. President, is that this time the Senate, in the \nbudget that has been adopted, did achieve budget balance, or headed in \nthe direction of budget balance, or put us on the glidepath in that \ndirection. The bad news, in my opinion, it did it in a way that speaks \nvery poorly of priorities and speaks very poorly of the allocation of \ncontribution by various sectors of our population.\n  If anything, the problem with the rescissions bill, and I point out \nto those night owls who are listening and who get sometimes turned off \nby the more technical language that we use, a rescissions bill is \ntaking back. It is a take-back.\n  It is the first step. It takes back money that was appropriated last \nyear and says OK, we are not going to do that after all. We are going \nto rescind, we are going to turn that around, and then we are going to \ngo forward. So in that regard the take-back bill from last year's \nappropriations effort in the context of this session is the seal test, \nin some ways, that the Senator from Oregon referred to. It is the first \nstep that we take on the glidepath toward a balanced budget.\n  Unfortunately, the seal test and the first step that is taken by this \nrescissions bill, I believe, calls for more sacrifice from the most \nvulnerable populations in our country than ought to be the case in any \nrescission package or, frankly, in this budget.\n  In fact, by one analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities, it was found after analyzing the numbers and how the cuts \nweigh in, the center found that some 62 percent of the cuts in this \nrescissions bill would come from discretionary programs to serve low- \nand moderate-income individuals, even though that group of Americans \nrepresent only 12 percent of discretionary spending overall.\n  That sounds kind of technical, 62 percent for low- and moderate-\nincome individuals. But the cuts that this bill would have us undertake \ncome in areas that, frankly, again, I just, for one, not only \npersonally cannot accept, but that I believe would be inappropriate for \nus to accept as our first step on this glidepath. If anything, our \npriorities ought to reflect shared sacrifice. We are going to have to \nall step up to the plate as Americans and make some sacrifice in order \nto get our fiscal house in order. We are all going to have to make a \ncontribution to resolving budget deficits and to getting us on a \nglidepath, if you will, to budget balance, at least a glidepath that is \nopposite to the trends that we have taken, that we are taking right \nnow.\n  I served as a member of the President's Bipartisan Commission on \nEntitlements and Tax Reform. There was no question, if there is one \nmessage out of the entire hearings and the information that we looked \nat in terms of the budget, it was that current trends, budget trends \nare unsustainable and that we had to change the way that we do \nbusiness. That is one of the reasons why this rescissions bill is so \nimportant and that is why I believed, and still believe, that it was so \ncritically necessary to have the debate in the sunshine, to have the \ndebate in the daytime, to allow people to know what it was that we were \ntalking about, what was at stake and what were the issues.\n  In the first instance, among the cuts in this bill that are sought to \nbe restored by the Wellstone/Moseley-Braun division, and it is a \ndivision because the amendment is in two parts, among the restorations \nare a program that I have worked on, education infrastructure, to help \nrebuild some of the dilapidated schools around this country, schools \nthat are falling apart. I do not think it is a secret, at this point, \ngiven the discussion about the condition of American schools, our \nschools are falling apart. They are not equipped to prepare our \nyoungsters for the 21st century. We do not have the infrastructure in \nthem even to make them computer ready, if you will. In many instances, \nthe electricity is not there.\n   So we are really, I think, missing the boat and really shortchanging \nour children by refusing to even take some small steps toward getting \nour schools in better shape. But that was cut. That program was \nterminated altogether in this legislation.\n  Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities--that was cut by $15 \nmillion. Again, youngsters who have difficulty going to school for fear \nof being shot by the drug dealers, that kind of a cut is a major \nimpediment to their education.\n  Education technology, another $17 million cut. You talk education \ntechnology, it is clear what that is; the whole idea we are going into \nthis information age without allowing our youngsters to get adequately \nprepared.\n  Eisenhower Professional Development, to help teachers be better \nteachers. Again, another set of cuts. This one, Eisenhower Professional \nDevelopment, was cut by $69 million. Again, I think that is \ninappropriate.\n  Then we get to the really difficult cuts. I say really difficult only \nbecause it hits people who are probably more in need than just about \nany other group: Homeless veterans jobs training. The homeless veterans \njob training program was cut by $5 million. How we can cut something \nfor homeless veterans, in terms of job training, is a mystery to me. \nYet that was a decision that was made as part of this rescissions \ncompromise.\n  Displaced worker training. With all the base closings and all the \ndislocations in our economy with job downsizing and the like, again, to \ncut displaced worker training by $67 million seemed to me to be \ninappropriate.\n  Adult job training was cut, JTPA adult job training, cut by $58 \nmillion. JTPA youth training cut by $272 million. Again, in communities \nparticularly where there is less than--and there are communities in \nthis country, Mr. President, and I am sure you are aware of them--in \nwhich there is about 1 percent--in fact I will be specific. In a \ncommunity in the city of Chicago, in my State of Illinois, 1 percent \nprivate employment, 1 percent. That is economic meltdown. If we do not \nundertake some steps to provide for job training and job readiness for \npeople who live in communities with 1 percent private employment in \nthem we are setting ourselves up for a black hole to develop in our \nsocial fabric from which we may never recover. Again, those cuts, it \nseems to me, are inappropriate. And as the seal test, as that first \nstep on the glidepath, seems to me to be the absolute wrong place for \nus to go.\n  Interestingly, this amendment calls for an offset. Because we are all \ntalking about, ``Can we pay for these things?'' The offset which would \npay for these restorations, which the Wellstone/Moseley-Braun amendment \nsuggests, comes from the administration and travel budget of the \nDepartment of Defense. According to the General Accounting Office, the \nDOD has that money and money to spare when it comes to administration \nand travel. Certainly, the absorption of these costs would not be \nsomething that would \n\n[[Page S10422]]\ncripple the ability of our military to travel around the world.\n  So it would seem, starting from the notion that there ought to be \nshared sacrifice, the amendment that Senator Wellstone and I put \ntogether--again I hope he will be able to talk about in the sunshine--\nwould have gone a long way to restoring our capacity to respond to some \nof the most vulnerable populations and respond to people who are least \nable to take the impact of the cuts of this rescission legislation.\n  The second part, the second division of the amendment has to do with \nthe Low Income Home Energy Assistant Program, LIHEAP. Mr. President, I \nknow you probably noticed in the newspapers, in the city of Chicago in \nthis last couple of weeks we had a heat wave that left almost 300 \npeople dead. Mr. President, 300 people died because they could not \nphysically tolerate the heat that came into the city. Chicago, IL, does \nnot have a cooling assistance program under LIHEAP, although those \nthings are allowed. It does not have a cooling assistance program but \nit does have heating assistance. It is one thing about the city of \nChicago, and the State really, but as beautiful as it is, it is known \nfor some extremes of temperature. It can go from having 300 people die \nbecause there is no assistance and they are too poor to move to the \nnearby hotel into an air-conditioned room, but at the same time, come \nwinter, when the temperatures fall to below zero, it is just as likely \nthat in the absence of LIHEAP, in the absence of heating assistance for \npoor people, we will see the same kind of loss of life and the same \nkind of attendant tragedy.\n  That is a preventable tragedy and it has been prevented over time by \nthe Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. It is a program that \nprovided energy assistance for heating and cooling to economically \ndisadvantaged individuals, particularly senior citizens, particularly \nthe elderly, in all 50 States. The LIHEAP program was cut by $319 \nmillion in this rescissions package and I daresay, given the need for \nthe assistance, particularly for senior citizens, given the \nvulnerability of these populations to die when the temperature gets \nover 100 degrees or die when it gets under 32, it was inappropriate for \nus to take that kind of cut, inappropriate for us to head on this \nglidepath, calling on them to make a sacrifice that, unfortunately, in \nall too many instances, could well be the supreme sacrifice.\n  So that is what this amendment is about. I know we have 30 minutes \ntomorrow to debate this issue. I know, also, there are other things \nabout this legislation that encourage my colleagues to want to move it \nquickly.\n   As I stated from the beginning of this debate, I was never \ninterested, no one was interested in holding up relief for California \nor relief for Oklahoma City, and those are parts of this rescissions \nlegislation. So no one has been interested in doing that. But at the \nsame time, for us to respond to those emergencies and at the same time \ntrample over the emergency that is faced by the low-income individuals \nwho have faced 62 percent of the cuts in this bill seems to me to take \na wrong step, in the wrong direction, in the wrong way.\n  So we thought it appropriate and believe it appropriate to have a \nchance to talk at length about these issues. While we will get to talk \nabout it for half an hour tomorrow morning, and we will be able to pass \nthe issue, there are other parts of this legislation of the rescissions \nbill that are problematic. There are some environmental issues that are \nproblematic.\n  But, again, we all know that part of the legislative process is that \nthings that you do not like often get wrapped up in things that you do \nlike. In fact, one of my colleagues a few moments ago used an \nexpression that I have liked to use over the years. The expression is \nthat those who love the law and who love sausages should not watch \neither of them being made. Quite frankly, this legislation, I think, \nfits into that category very well because it has a combination of some \npalatable initiatives such as California and Oklahoma City, and then an \nawful lot that would just make you, in my opinion, gag on what has \nhappened here.\n  Quite frankly, I think that the issue that is on fire is the one that \nwe really do need to engage, an entire legislative body with everybody \nparticipating and talking about--the direction that our country will \ntake as we try to achieve budget balance and integrity in the way we \nhandle these fiscal year issues.\n  Quite frankly, one of the things people ask me very often is, ``What \ndo you like about being in the Senate?'' And I tell them that I cannot \nimagine--I am sure the Presiding Officer will relate to this--I cannot \nimagine a more exciting time to serve in the U.S. Senate or to serve in \npolicymaking, the policy of a legislative body of our Government, \nprecisely because so many of the issues that have been around for a \nlong time, as well as issues that are new to our time, are now facing \nus four square and calling on us for resolution, calling on us to \nexpress an opinion; issues that 5 years ago did not get talked about. I \nmean, when they were building up huge budget deficits nobody really \ntalked about it. What should be our foreign policy? You had a Soviet \nUnion. It was pretty clear-cut. Now we have to construct something.\n  What is going to be the direction in terms of diversity? We just had \nthe vote on affirmative action. What kind of economy are we going to \nhave in the future? All of these issues and a host more that I know I \ncould stand here probably the rest of the night to talk about, all of \nthese issues are before us now.\n  So when it comes to specifically the issue of budget priorities, now \nis the time for us to take up that debate and not to handle it willy-\nnilly. Let us get it done, kind of make those sausages faster, but in a \nway to allow us to really have a comprehensive and coherent debate and \ninput from every Member of this U.S. Senate. That is what we were sent \nhere to do.\n  Again, to the extent that my colleagues had concern that the holding \nup of this legislation would have untold effects, I am optimistic that \nthose effects will not be untold and that we will be able to go \nforward, and hopefully we will pass the Wellstone/Moseley-Braun \namendment. I am not unrealistic about that. But I would encourage my \ncolleagues to take a look at the amendment, a serious look at the \namendment, recognizing that we have to have deep and painful cuts in \nsome regards.\n  But the question I put to every Member as you take up the issue of \nhow to vote on this amendment to the rescissions bill is whether or not \nlow-income individuals should have to suffer 62 percent of that pain. I \ndo not think they do. And I hope that is not the signal and the message \nthat gets sent by this body tomorrow when we take this issue up to \nvote.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n                       Substitute Salvage Program\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my serious concerns \nabout H.R. 1944, the fiscal year 1995 rescissions bill. I'll get right \nto the point: this is a bad bill. Its relevance to the budget process \nin Washington, DC, is minimal, and its relevance to the American people \nis marginal.\n  This bill cuts $16 billion from the Federal budget. We recently \npassed a resolution that cut over $1 trillion; what's the logic in even \ndebating this bill? We have only a few days left in the fiscal year, \nand yet we are proposing to go back and cut already-appropriated funds \nfor virtually no good policy reason. This bill cuts commitments and \ngoes back on promises made by this Senate less than 1 year ago.\n  This bill has another problem. I believe the language about timber \nsalvage included in the bill by my colleague, the senior Senator from \nWashington, will backfire. I believe it will hurt--not help--timber \ncommunities and workers in the Northwest.\n  Mr. President, this timber salvage authorizing language is designed \nto accomplish three things: respond to a timber salvage problem \nresulting from last year's forest fires and recent insect infestations; \nspeed the rate of timber sales under the President's forest plan, \noption 9; and release a few timber sales remaining from legislation \npassed by Congress 4 years ago.\n  These are goals with which I agree. My problem is with the method. I \nbelieve the language contained in this bill will cause a blizzard of \nlawsuits, cause political turmoil within the Northwest, and take us \nright back to where we were 4 years ago.\n\n[[Page S10423]]\n\n  Our region has been at the center of a war over trees fought in the \ncourtrooms and Congress for almost a decade. We have a history of \nwaiving environmental laws to try and solve timber problems; that \nstrategy has not worked.\n  In fact, that strategy has made the situation worse. Until 1993, the \nForest Service was paralyzed by lawsuits, the courts were managing the \nforests, and public discourse in the region was dominated by acrimony. \nThe language in this bill will reopen those old wounds. Mr. President, \nI strongly\n believe that would not be in the best interest of the region.\n\n  During floor consideration of this bill last spring, I offered an \namendment that would have taken a more moderate approach to salvage \noperations. My amendment was narrowly defeated 46-48. I respect the \nwill of the Senate in that regard. However, when the rescissions bill \nreached the President's desk, he vetoed it, citing among other things \nproblems with the timber language.\n  Mr. President, I learned before the July recess that a deal was being \nworked out on this issue. Despite my obvious interest in and concern \nabout the salvage issue, I was not involved in the negotiations. I was \nnot consulted during the process. Had I been, I would have been more \nthan willing to work out a compromise in good faith. Unfortunately, \nthat did not happen. I have reviewed the language, and frankly, I still \nhave very serious concerns.\n  The language in the bill before us is almost exactly the same as was \ncontained in the conference report vetoed by the President, with three \nminor changes. While these changes may add flexibility, the fundamental \nproblems in the bill remain: it rolls over current laws governing land \nmanagement, and it cuts the public completely out of the process. \nTherefore, I cannot support it.\n  Mr. President, there is a legitimate salvage issue right now \nthroughout the West. Last year's fire season was one of the worst ever. \nThere are hundreds of thousands of acres with burned trees rotting \nwhere they burned. I believe that many of these trees can and should be \nsalvaged and put to good public use.\n  I believe there is a right way and a wrong way to salvage damaged \ntimber on Federal lands. The wrong way is to short-cut environmental \nchecks and balances. The wrong way is to cut people out of the process. \nThe wrong way is to invite a mountain of lawsuits.\n  The right way is to expedite compliance with the law. The right way \nis to ensure that agencies work together and make correct decisions \nquickly. The right way is to let people participate in the process--so \nthey don't clog up the courts later. My amendment, and my approach to \nthe negotiations,\n would have focused on these points.\n\n  Mr. President, there is a reasonable, responsible approach to \nensuring salvage operations move forward. Unfortunately, the bill \nbefore us doesn't take it. Instead, it recklessly goes too far, too \nfast.\n  Attaching a major harvesting amendment to an appropriations bill like \nthis--worked out at the last minute, behind closed doors--is no way to \nmake good public policy. Instead, the timber language should be \ndeveloped through the normal authorizing process. The Senator from \nIdaho [Mr. Craig], has a bill pending in his committee that would \nestablish a forest health program. There have been some hearings on \nthat bill, and I have already stated my interest in working with him on \nhis bill.\n  Mr. President, there have been numerous editorials and articles \nwritten about this provision, most of which have urged the President \nand the Congress to reject these sweeping changes. In addition, recent \nstatistics on employment and growth rates within the timber industry \nindicate the picture of the industry is not as bleak as some have \npredicted. I ask unanimous consent to insert some of these materials in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. MURRAY. In summary, I believe this is the wrong bill at the \nwrong time. The Senate has passed its own balanced budget resolution, \nand recently passed the conference report. The cuts in this rescissions \nbill are paltry by comparison. And the timber salvage provisions go too \nfar without adequate safeguards and public participation.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this unnecessary, harmful bill.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  WESTERN STATES GAIN 14,251 IN TIMBER JOBS--JANUARY 1993--SPRING 1995  \n                             [In thousands]                             \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               Timber related jobs      \n                                        --------------------------------\n                 States                   January    December  April/May\n                                            1993       1994       1995  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUtah...................................      3,863      5.131  .........\nWashington.............................     51,700  .........     54,700\nOregon.................................     61,200  .........     61,600\nNew Mexico.............................      2,100      2,100  .........\nColorado...............................     10,400  .........     12,100\nArizona................................      6,400  .........      8,500\nIdaho..................................     16,017  .........     16,500\nCalifornia.............................     84,400  .........     90,600\nMontana................................      8,000  .........      7,100\n                                        --------------------------------\n    Totals.............................    244,080      7,231    251,100\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       These figures are based on the most current data available \n     from state economists.

The bill cut $16.4 billion from previously approved \n     social programs.\n       ``We must recognize that the only deficit in this country \n     is not the budget deficit. There's a deficit in this country \n     in the number of drug-free children. There's a deficit . . . \n     in the number of safe schools. There's an education \n     deficit,'' he said in wielding the pen for his first veto.\n       It took perhaps even more courage for the president to set \n     himself up for cheap-shot charges by Northwest Republican \n     lawmakers that he is anti-job because he insists that the \n     nation's forests be harvested under rule of law. But there \n     are sure to be further attempts to circumvent proper \n     practices, and Clinton should stand tall against them.\n       The bill, using poorly defined criteria, would have given \n     the timber industry three penalty-free years to remove \n     ``damaged'' trees that pose a fire threat. The trees would \n     have been removed without the benefit of the standard \n     environmental safeguards that are meant to protect salmon \n     streams and watersheds, and citizens would have been legally \n     barred from filing suit to object to any violation of \n     environmentally sound harvesting no matter how gross.\n       The salvage program must get under way, and Congress is \n     perfectly capable of passing legislation that provides for \n     responsible removal of trees that pose a fire hazard without \n     abandong environmental safeguards.\n       But by sending the White House an irresponsible proposal \n     for timber salvage, Congress has thrown away valuable time \n     and risked further fire losses in the Northwest woods.\n       Members of this state's delegation should have insisted on \n     using their time to prepare an acceptable plan for this \n     summer's fire season rather than in devising a political \n     booby-trap for the president.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                          Logging Bill Flawed\n\n       A case can be made for salvage logging of some federal \n     forest lands that have a dangerous accumulation of dead or \n     diseased trees that pose a fire hazard.\n       But a case cannot be made for the sweeping salvage-logging \n     proposal now under consideration in Congress that sets aside \n     environmental safeguards and promises to raid the treasury \n     for the benefit of private timber companies.\n       The overly broad language of the bill renders it \n     unacceptable; more important, existing law makes it \n     unnecessary.\n       The bill arbitrarily mandates a doubling of the amount of \n     timber to be felled over the next two years from federal \n     lands, whether or not that much timber needs to be salvaged, \n     and thus opens the door for a giveaway of public property.\n       That's because it cleverly stipulates that no so-called \n     ``health management activities'' directed by the legislation \n     shall be precluded simply because they cost more than the \n     revenues derived from sale of the salvaged timber.\n       And the bill says that any environmental review, however \n     cursory it may be, ``shall be deemed to have satisfied the \n     law.''\n       Sponsors wrongly imply that the bill is needed to permit \n     the Forest Service to conduct salvage logging. But Sierra \n     Club attorney Todd True notes, ``Existing law already gives \n     the agency authority'' for whatever salvage logging it deems \n     necessary due to threat of fire and insect infestations.\n       Last summer's huge, costly fires in Eastern Washington \n     forests provided clear evidence of the folly of the Forest \n     Service's past policy of suppressing natural wildfires. It \n\n[[Page S10424]]\n     bears noting that the agency followed that practice partly to protect \n     adjoining commercial timberlands.\n       If Congress doesn't gut the Forest Service's budget for \n     environmental impact studies, those important reviews can be \n     done in a timely manner and permit defensible salvage-logging \n     operations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, June 22, 1995]\n\n   The Logger's Ax: No Wild Swings--Clinton Should Hold Firm Against \n                    Amendment That Threatens Forests\n\n       In the early days of his presidency, Bill Clinton \n     productively approached the volatile issue of forest \n     management by breaking with the tired ``jobs versus owls'' \n     rhetoric of past years. Through his 1993 Forest Summit he \n     showed he understood both the need to preserve dwindling \n     federal forests and the painful dislocations that new limits \n     on logging would cause. He led by talking with all sides and \n     instituting programs to retrain displaced workers. But now, \n     locked in battle with congressional Republicans, Clinton \n     seems to be in danger of abandoning that principled approach.\n       Last month he rightly vetoed a congressional recisions bill \n     that was loaded with special-interest riders. One of them, \n     the deceptive ``Emergency Two-Year Salvage Timber Sale \n     Program,'' in essence would have ordered the U.S. Forest \n     Service to sell as much as 3.2 billion board feet of \n     ``salvage'' timber from national forests. It would have \n     allowed logging of trees killed by windstorms, fire, insects \n     or disease and permitted selective thinning of forests to \n     control forest fires. The legislation, pushed hard by timber \n     companies, also would have forced the Forest Service to sell \n     twice as many trees as it felt appropriate. Further, these \n     sales would have been exempt from environmental review and \n     public comment. Worst of all, the language was so vague that \n     virtually any tree, living or dead, standing or fallen, could \n     have been defined as ``salvage,'' even the dwindling stands \n     of old-growth redwoods in California's national forests. For \n     these reasons Clinton should stick to his guns as Republicans \n     seek to include this nasty amendment in a compromise \n     recisions package. The President reportedly is considering \n     accepting it.\n       Even the staid Sunset Magazine highlights a special report \n     entitled ``The Crisis in Our Forests'' in its current issue. \n     Sunset doubts that stepped-up salvage operations would \n     markedly improve forest health or prevent the spread of \n     wildfires.\n       The salvage amendment has nothing to do with cutting \n     wasteful government spending but everything to do with \n     wasteful cutting. The President must hold firm--the amendment \n     must go.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 3, 1995]\n\n                             Chopping Block\n\n       It isn't just spending that would be cut by the bills the \n     House and Senate passed a month ago rescinding appropriations \n     for the current fiscal year. A fair amount of timber would \n     likely be cut, too--cut down, that is. Each version of the \n     bill includes a rider aimed at sharply increasing the timber \n     harvest this year and next in the federal forests.\n       If the riders did no more than urge an increase in the \n     harvest or order that the harvest be as large as possible \n     under the law, that would be fair enough. There's always a \n     great dispute about the amount of timber that can best be \n     taken from the national forests and other public lands. The \n     total the past few years has been well below the level to \n     which the industry became accustomed in the 1970s and 1980s. \n     The timber lobby says the cut should be increased--it argues \n     among much else that there is currently an enormous amount of \n     dead and dying timber in the forest that will otherwise go to \n     waste--and the new majority in Congress agrees.\n       But the riders don't stop there. To make sure that no \n     obstacles in the form of conservation laws, environmental \n     groups and courts can stand in the way, they also take the \n     extraordinary step of suspending for the purpose of this \n     ``salvage timber sale'' the entire array of federal forest \n     management and environmental statutes that might otherwise \n     apply. Timbering undertaken under terms of the riders ``shall \n     be deemed to satisfy'' such laws no matter what their \n     requirements, the riders say. The House version also seeks to \n     overcome any existing court orders that might interfere with \n     the sale; it says the sale can be conducted despite them.\n       The industry says the reason for all this is not just that \n     it wants to increase the cut and has a receptive Congress but \n     that an emergency exists in the forests. Because they are so \n     overgrown, there's a greatly increased danger of fire, and \n     their health has declined in other ways that a stepped-up \n     salvage operation will help to cure--so say the supporters. \n     They add that without suspension of the laws, environmental \n     groups will go to court and block the necessary actions.\n       Opponents of the riders, including the administration, say \n     the necessary salvage cutting can go on without suspension of \n     the laws--a lot of salvage cutting occurs every year \n     already--and that suspension would only be a license to log \n     where otherwise the companies could not, in ways that would \n     leave the forests less healthy, not more.\n       The opponents make the more plausible case. This is grabby \n     legislation. If there is a genuine need to increase salvage \n     and other such operations in the forests, even to increase \n     them rapidly, surely that can be done without abandoning the \n     entire framework of supporting law. Likewise, if Congress \n     wants to change the law with regard to management of the \n     forests, it ought to do so in the normal way, not tack a \n     decision of such importance on the back of a supplemental \n     appropriations bill. The measure is shortly to go to \n     conference; the conferees should cut the budget, not the \n     trees.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                  [From the Denver Post, May 8, 1995]\n\n                    Clinton Should Veto Timber Bill\n\n       President Bill Clinton should veto a timber measure because \n     the proposal is bad environmental policy and a shoddy way to \n     make federal law.\n       The timber proposal is buried in a larger measure that \n     deals with trimming federal spending. Clinton compromised \n     with Senate Republicans to make the rescissions bill, as the \n     main measure is called, less draconian than the first version \n     adopted by the U.S. House.\n       However, the larger bill has been burdened with a bunch of \n     special-interests, anti-environmental provisions. The worst \n     would let logging companies cut an enormous amount of extra \n     timber from the national forests. Gluing such harvesting \n     proposals onto an already complex and controversial measure \n     is a deceitful way to mold federal law, so they all should be \n     removed from the bill.\n       Actually, the Senate would have stripped the timbering \n     portions from the measure weeks ago, except Ben Nighthorse \n     Campbell, Colorado's junior U.S. senator, deserted his \n     moderate environmental leanings and voted to keep the logging \n     provisions in the main bill. Coloradans who had hoped \n     Campbell would remain an independent voice even after he \n     changed from a Democrat into a Republican were sorely \n     disappointed by his partisan performance on this matter.\n       There are ways to cut timber, including methods to salvage \n     lumber from dead or dying trees, without severely damaging \n     the forests. But this measure is especially troubling because \n     it tosses aside most environmental considerations the Forest \n     Service usually weighs before deciding how much logging to \n     allow.\n       When the rescissions bill lands on Clinton's desk, the \n     President should veto it because of the timber and other \n     environmental provisions. When Congress votes whether to \n     override the veto, Campbell this time should side with common \n     sense instead of letting his new partisan allies dictate his \n     behavior.\n                                                                    ____\n\n Shift in U.S. Timber Policy Puts Forests, Fish and Wildlife at Risk--\n            Congress moves too fast, with too little thought\n\n       The pendulum in the nation's timber policy is swinging too \n     fast and too wide.\n       The public has become accustomed--dazed may be the correct \n     term--to the daily headlines of sharply revised public policy \n     on welfare, immigration, food programs and more.\n       But the sudden shift in federal timber policy is more than \n     even the most blase citizen may be able to accept.\n       The U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee has followed the \n     House's lead in opening big areas of our national forests to \n     harvesting without the normal regulations to protect fish, \n     wildlife and the environment and without allowing the public \n     to bring legal challenges.\n       The committee-passed proposal directs the forest service to \n     set aside existing environmental laws. Although the original \n     intent of the legislation was to speed up the salvage of dead \n     and dying timber, this measure may go beyond that. It gives \n     sole discretion to the Forest Service to harvest wherever it \n     wants. Only designated wilderness areas are off-limits.\n       No one can be sure what forests and what areas might be \n     subject to harvesting--or how carefully it would be done.\n       The public will not stand by and watch the years of \n     protecting our forests against environmental damage be wiped \n     out in a spurt of action by a Congress that has so many pro-\n     harvest allies in its midst.\n       Our forests can be harvested without damage to our \n     environment. But doing so requires more scientific and \n     technical thought than Congress appears willing to devote. \n     The final protection against abuse is the legal system. If \n     that access also is prohibited, then all of us should worry.\n       Citizens should demand that Congress slow down and remember \n     its stewardship duties to the public land.\n       Narrowly focused salvage harvesting is acceptable. \n     Abandoning our traditions of environmental protection and \n     legal accountability is not.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1944, the \nrevised emergency supplemental appropriations and rescissions bill for \nfiscal year 1995.\n  It is time for Congress to complete this bill and provide the \nemergency disaster assistance that is needed in at least 40 States to \nrespond to natural disasters.\n  It is time to complete action on the rescissions in the bill so that \nagencies can close out the fiscal year, and Congress can address the \nfunding issues for the new fiscal year. The Senate will be turning to \nthe fiscal year 1996 funding bills this week.\n  I am pleased that the President will support this bill. It provides \nfunding \n\n[[Page S10425]]\nthe administration requested to respond to the tragic bombing in \nOklahoma City and to carry out a proposed counterterrorism initiative.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us will save $15.3 billion in budget \nauthority and $0.6 billion in outlays from the current fiscal year \nthrough the rescissions in the bill. As chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nrelationship of the bill to the Senate Appropriations Committee's \nbudget allocation be placed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                H.R. 1944, EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL AND RESCISSIONS                               \n                             [Fiscal year 1995, in millions of dollars, CBO scoring]                            \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                        Current                    Subcommittee    Senate 602(b)                   Total comp to\n     Subcommittee      status\\1\\   H.R. 1994\\2\\        total        allocation                      allocation  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAgriculture--RD......

Mr. President, each day, members of this body rise to \npay tribute to men and women who have had an impact on our Nation in \none manner or another. On any given day the Record will contain \npassages praising elected officials, captains of industry, and others \nwho have accumulated a list of accomplishments that are usually nothing \nless than impressive and oftentimes enviable. Today, I want to \nrecognize a woman who does not possess such a vita, but is nevertheless \nworthy of recognition, the late Mrs. Dollye Hanna, who recently passed \naway at the age of 98.\n  Though Mrs. Hanna, or ``Momma Doll'' as she was affectionately known \nby her family and friends, was not involved in either public service or \nthe private sector, she did dedicate her life to the noblest endeavor \nthere is, her family. In her almost century on this earth, she was a \nloving wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother, and great-great \ngrandmother. She set an example for kindness and caring, and as the \nmatriarch of the family, she left her strong mark and influence on four \ngenerations of Hannas.\n  During a service held in her memory last month, Mrs. Hanna was \nremembered as a woman who was: a lady; a mother; a friend; someone who \nspanned time; and as a child of The Father. I cannot think of a more \nflattering or appropriate manner in which to remember this special \nwoman who devoted herself to caring for her husband, children, and \nextended family. She is someone who will certainly be missed by all \nthose who knew her, and my sympathies go out to all those who knew and \ncared for this remarkable lady, especially her grandchildren: E.G. \nMeybohm; Robert L. Meybohm; Dollye W. Ward; Mildred W. Ghetti; and \nHanna W. Fowler.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10425-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10425-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10425-4", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:55 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2020.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the Orphan Drug Act \nof 1995, legislation to modify and extend permanently the orphan drug \ntax credit. Identical legislation has been introduced in the House by \nRepresentatives by Nancy Johnson and Robert Matsui. This credit \nencourages private firms to develop treatments for rare diseases. As \nmany of my colleagues know, this medical research tax credit expired at \nthe end of 1994. I am pleased that my good friend and colleague from \nMontana, Senator Baucus, is joining me.\n  Since the 1983 enactment of the orphan drug tax credit, we have seen \nvery encouraging progress in developing new drugs to alleviate \nsuffering from a number of so-called orphan diseases. The name \n``orphan'' was coined to reflect a perceived lack of concern about \ndiseases that affect relatively small numbers of people.\n  Mr. President, the incentive provided by this credit gives hope to \nindividuals who suffer from such rare but devastating conditions as \nTourette's syndrome, Huntington's disease, and \nneurofibromatosis. Many drugs \ndesignated as orphan drugs have a much smaller potential market than \neven the 200,000 patients referred to in the definition in this bill--\nsometimes they are for conditions that affect as few as 1,000 persons \nin the United States. This means that without some incentive there is \nsimply no possibility for a firm to profit from its decision to develop \ndrugs that treat these diseases.\n  Fortunately, the ``orphan'' perception has been changing over the 12 \nyears that this research credit has been in effect. In fact, Mr. \nPresident, pharmaceutical companies have made great strides in \ndiscovering treatments for these orphan diseases. While only seven \norphan drugs were approved by the FDA in the decade before the credit's \ninitial passage, over 100 have been approved since and approximately \n600 are now in development.\n  For example, the FDA recently approved the first-ever treatment for \nGaucher disease, a debilitating and sometimes fatal genetic disorder. \nThis disease afflicts fewer than 5,000 people worldwide, yet Genzyme \nCorp. expended its time and money to search for a treatment precisely \nbecause of the orphan drug credit's incentives.\n  Mr. President, this credit's effectiveness has been tested for the \npast 12 years, and it has passed with flying colors. Few provisions of \nthe tax code can claim to have clearly reduced human suffering and to \nhave expanded our store of medical knowledge. This credit has done \nboth.\n  By helping small, entrepreneurial firms to take advantage of the \norphan drug credit, we can make it even more effective. Currently, Mr. \nPresident, the tax credit only serves as an incentive for companies \nthat earn a current-year profit. Under the previous law, if the credit \ncould not be used immediately, it was lost forever. For large, \nprofitable drug companies, this was rarely a problem.\n  However, for many small, start-up pharmaceutical companies, this \ncurrent-year restriction makes the credit of little or no use. These \nfirms typically lose money in the early years since they put all \navailable funding into research. They only expect to see profits many \nyears into the future. While many of the Nation's drug breakthroughs \nhave come from these small firms, Mr. President, the credit's current \nstructure has left them out in the cold.\n  In order to improve the credit's usefulness, this bill will allow \nfirms to carry the credit back 3 years and carry it forward 15 years. \nThis will give small, growing companies an incentive to find ways to \ntreat these rare diseases that cause so many to suffer.\n  In my home State of Utah, a healthy biomedical industry is emerging. \nIn the course of research, scientists often stumble upon treatments \nthat could, if developed, improve the lives of victims of rare \ndiseases. However, because of the high cost of drug experiments and the \nenormous expense involved in gaining FDA approval, many researchers \nreluctantly set these promising drug innovations aside. Mr. President, \nthis should not happen, not when so many are suffering from these rare \ndiseases, and we have an effective credit available that has proven its \nbenefits.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in sponsoring this \nlegislation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \n\n[[Page S10427]]\nthat the text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1052\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

\nMr. Hollings, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Lott, Ms. Moseley-Braun, \nMr. Murkowski, Mr. Packwood, Mr. Pell, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Roth, and Mr. \nSimon) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 155\n\n       Whereas the Governments of the United States and Japan \n     entered into a bilateral aviation agreement in 1952 that has \n     been modified periodically to reflect changes in the aviation \n     relationship between the two countries;\n       Whereas in 1994 the total revenue value of passenger and \n     freight traffic for United States air carriers between the \n     United States and Japan was approximately $6 billion;\n       Whereas the United States/Japan bilateral aviation \n     agreement guarantees three U.S. carriers ``beyond rights'' \n     that authorize them to fly into Japan, take on additional \n     passengers and cargo, and then fly to another country;\n       Whereas the United States/Japan bilateral aviation \n     agreement requires that, within 45 days of filing a notice \n     with the Government of Japan, the Government of Japan must \n     authorize United States air carriers to serve routes \n     guaranteed by their ``beyond rights'';\n       Whereas United States air carriers have made substantial \n     economic investment in reliance upon the expectation their \n     rights under the United States/Japan bilateral aviation \n     agreement would be honored by the Government of Japan;\n       Whereas the Government of Japan has violated the United \n     States/Japan bilateral aviation agreement by preventing \n     United States air carriers from serving routes clearly \n     authorized by their ``beyond rights''; and\n       Whereas the refusal by the Government of Japan to respect \n     the terms of the United States/Japan bilateral aviation \n     agreement is having severe repercussions on United States air \n     carriers and, in general, customers of these United States \n     air carriers: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) calls upon the Government of Japan to honor and abide \n     by the terms of the United States/Japan bilateral aviation \n     agreement and immediately authorize United States air cargo \n     and passenger carriers which have pending route requests \n     relating to their ``beyond rights'' to immediately commence \n     service on the requested routes;\n       (2) calls upon the President of the United States to \n     identify strong and appropriate forms of countermeasures that \n     could be taken against the Government of Japan for its \n     egregious violation of the United States/Japan bilateral \n     aviation agreement; and\n       (3) calls upon the President of the United States to \n     promptly impose against the Government of Japan whatever \n     countermeasures are necessary and appropriate to ensure the \n     Government of Japan abides by the terms of the United States/\n     Japan bilateral aviation agreement.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nexpressing the concern of the United States Senate over the Government \nof Japan's violation of the bilateral aviation agreement between our \ntwo countries and its continued refusal to respect this agreement.\n  I am pleased so many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle \nhave joined me in submitting this resolution. It speaks volumes about \nthe importance of the issue. In particular, I thank my good friend from \nAlaska, Senator Stevens, who has worked very closely with me on this \nmatter for some time.\n  As I said last month when I addressed the Senate at length on the \nUnited States/Japan aviation dispute, this issue is extraordinarily \nstraightforward: Should the United States allow Japan to unilaterally \ndeny United States carriers rights guaranteed those carriers by the \nUnited States/Japan bilateral aviation agreement? The clear and \nunequivocal answer is ``no.''\n  If we tolerate and accept this breach, it would establish a very \ndangerous precedent for U.S. international aviation relations. The \nChinese among others are very carefully watching how the United States \nreacts in this dispute. The potential ramifications are much broader \nthan aviation. We would send the nations of the world the message it is \nokay to pick and choose which provisions of agreements with the United \nStates they want to abide by. That is a very dangerous message. One we \nmust not send.\n  I was pleased when the Department of Transportation issued a show-\ncause order to the Government of Japan on June 19 in response to its \nviolation of our air service agreement. The administration was \nabsolutely correct in doing so. If anything, the show-cause order could \nhave been issued sooner, but quite correctly, the administration was \npatient in its good faith talks to try to resolve this dispute. The \nGovernment of Japan left us with no other option.\n  A month has passed since the show-cause order was issued. The United \nStates continues to negotiate in good faith with the Government of \nJapan. Unfortunately, the Government of Japan continues to refuse to \nhonor the United States/Japan bilateral aviation agreement. I am not \nsurprised because time is on the side of Japan. The longer Japan \ndelays, the longer they prevent our carriers from competing against \ntheir inefficient carriers. Time is definitely on their side.\n  Mr. President, for today and the future, the economic stakes of this \ntrade dispute are tremendous and therefore the administration must be \nprepared to impose strong countermeasures. We cannot negotiate \nindefinitely while our carriers suffer severe economic damages.\n  I cannot emphasize enough the significance of the economic stakes of \nthe United States/Japan aviation dispute. For example, in 1994 the \ntotal revenue value of passenger\n and freight traffic for United States carriers between the United \nStates and Japan was approximately $6 billion. During that same year, \nthe value of cargo shipped by air between the United States and Japan \nwas roughly $47 billion. This figure increases to approximately $132 \nbillion when one considers the value of cargo shipped by air between \nthe United States and all Asian countries. These figures speak loudly \nfor themselves.\n\n  These statistics are indeed impressive. Yet they do not tell the \nwhole story. While both the current size and the potential for the \nfuture of our aviation market to Japan and beyond to other Asian \ncountries are impressive, the figures cited earlier do not rise to \ntheir proper level of significance until one considers the more than \n$65 billion trade deficit the United States currently has with Japan.\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, all too often I see parochial fighting among U.S. air \ncarriers undermine our country's international aviation policy. This \ninfighting sets off a chain reaction on Capitol Hill. The political \nfirestorm that results unfortunately often prevents the Secretary of \nTransportation from making the strongest possible international \naviation agreements. Instead, we accept international agreements that \nmay serve the best political interest of an administration, but that \nall too often fail to produce the greatest possible economic gain for \nour country. Foreign nations know this is our Achilles heel in \ninternational aviation negotiations. They know it and they exploit it.\n  Mr. President, this resolution puts the Senate on record in clear \nopposition to the actions of the Japanese Government. It is designed to \nplace the administration in a position of political strength from which \nit can deal with this vitally important international aviation matter. \nI had hoped the show-cause order would serve as a wake-up call to the \nGovernment of Japan. Apparently it has not.\n  It is my hope this resolution will further drive home the message to \nthe Government of Japan that international agreements are to be \nhonored, not unilaterally disregarded. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this resolution.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10428-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10429-S10430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10429]]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n            THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        BYRD AMENDMENT NO. 1802\n\n  Mr. BYRD proposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. 1854) making \nappropriations for the legislative branch for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 1996, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, yesterday, Senator Pressler and I \nintroduced the NASA authorization bill for fiscal year 1996 which I \nhave enthusiastically cosponsored. The bill authorizes a total of $13.8 \nbillion for the agency, a 3-percent decrease from the requested level \nof $14.26 billion. That funding should allow NASA to continue the \nimportant missions that already are underway such as space station, \nMission to Planet Earth, and the aeronautics and space science \nprograms. It should also prepare NASA for the future by authorizing \nseveral new missions, such as an effort to develop a shuttle \nreplacement and a new radar satellite program.\n  Mr. President, as you know, we are in a budget crisis of sorts and \nNASA deserves a great deal of credit as one of few Federal agencies to \nrespond to it early and responsibly. In 3 years, NASA cut the space \nshuttle budget from $4 billion to $3.1 billion. It developed a redesign \nof space station that was $5 billion less expensive than the earlier \nspace station Freedom concept. Mission to Planet Earth has been reduced \nfrom a $17 billion armada of satellites to a $7 billion focused \nsatellite system. Earlier this year, faced with the prospect of deep \ncongressional budget cuts across all of the Government, NASA took the \ninitiative and developed a plan to cut $5 billion in 5 years, without \nreducing program content.\n  But NASA did not stop there. This year, it conducted a comprehensive \nzero-based review of all of its activities and programs to achieve even \ngreater savings. That review looked at a broad range of money-saving \nmeasures such as work force reductions, elimination of redundant \nactivities, consolidation of functions, and operating more efficiently. \nI understand that, within the administration, NASA's efforts are often \ncited as the model for reinventing government.\n  After 3 consecutive years of brutal budget cuts, NASA is now down to \nthe bone. To require additional reductions would force NASA to cancel \nimportant space programs, close vital facilities, or layoff essential \nskilled personnel. That would decimate the Nation's science and \ntechnology base. Equally important, it would decimate the morale of the \ngood men and women who \n\n[[Page S10434]]\nhave made our space program the subject of movies like ``Apollo 13'' \nand inspired thousands of scientists, engineers, and schoolchildren \nacross our country.\n  It is time for the bloodletting to stop and to give NASA the support \nit needs to face the challenges of the future. This NASA authorization \nbill is designed to do just that.\n  The bill provides the full $2.1 billion requested level for space \nstation. This program is NASA's most costly, complex, and controversial \nactivity and we are all aware of the many criticisms leveled against \nit. However, space station is precisely the kind of bold vision that \nNASA was created to pursue. Space station will enable the United States \nand the international science community to conduct unique microgravity \nresearch and expand our knowledge about humans' ability to live and \nwork in space. If past missions are any indication, the space station \nwill undoubtedly yield breakthroughs in biomedicine and advanced \nmaterials. We can probably also expect exciting spinoffs just as past \nspace missions have spawned microelectronics, pacemakers, advance water \nfiltration systems, communications, and many other products and \nservices we now take for granted.\n  I must admit concern about the heavy reliance of the current station \nplan on the Russians. I remain troubled by the possibility that the \nprogram might collapse if the Russians were to withdraw for any reason. \nHowever, I am still a strong Station supporter and the full funding \nprovided in the bill will keep the program on track for a first element \nlaunch in 1997.\n  The bill also provides full funding for Mission to Planet Earth. \nMission to Planet Earth is NASA's $7 billion satellite program aimed at \nstudying how the oceans, land, and atmosphere work as a system in order \nto understand and predict global climate change. For those of us \nrepresenting farm States, weather and water are our lifeblood. Mission \nto Planet Earth promises dramatic improvements in our ability to \npredict climate change and manage our scarce water resources. If those \nexpectations are met, the program will easily pay for itself in lives \nand property saved and improved water management.\n  Mr. President, in my view, one of the most important areas within \nNASA is aeronautics--the first A in NASA. For many years, aeronautics \nseemed to be reduced to a small A status. It always seemed to take a \nback seat to the higher-profile space missions. However, under Dan \nGoldin's leadership, that is beginning to change and NASA is giving \naeronautics the backing it deserves.\n  To me, the aeronautics research is critical to maintaining U.S. \ntechnological leadership and aerospace competitiveness. For instance, \nthe high speed research program is developing pre-competitive \ntechnologies in support of supersonic aircraft. It is estimated that \nthe first country to market such an aircraft stands to gain $200 \nbillion in sales and 140,000 new jobs. Similarly, the advanced subsonic \ntechnology program funds research in support of subsonic airplanes--a \nmarket that generates one million jobs and contributes over $25 billion \nannually to the U.S. trade balance. These programs are money-makers and \nit is in the national interest to give them whatever support they need. \nAccordingly, our NASA bill authorizes aeronautics research at the \nrequested level of $891 million for fiscal year 1996.\n  As a final point, Mr. President, I note that the bill also authorizes \na collection of activities and initiatives designed to extend NASA's \nvision to include our rural States. Our rural States can make an \nenormous contribution to the civilian space program if only given the \nchance. For example, in May, Prof. Steve Running of the University of \nMontana testified before the Science Subcommittee about his efforts to \nuse remote sensing satellite data in forest and crop management. To \nembrace our rural States in our space program, the bill contains a $2 \nmillion increase for the EPSCoR program, which funds important research \nin our rural States. It also funds another Rural Teacher Resource \nCenter to the existing nine Centers, as well as an additional rural \ntechnology transfer and commercialization center, to fill in coverage \ngaps in those two programs. Further, it provides funding for an Upper \nMissouri River Basin hydrology project. This project should help the \nNation develop better strategies for predicting, and responding to, the \nflooding and other water management problems that have plagued the \nMissouri River region in recent years.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this bill provides NASA with the \nsupport it requires to continue and build on its important work in \nspace and aeronautics and I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation when it reaches the floor later this year. Thank you, Mr. \nPresident.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10433-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10434-S10435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the need for comprehensive health care is \napparent in the numbers. We have 41 million Americans without health \ncare coverage.\n  But these are not just numbers.\n  We are talking about real people and real problems.\n  When you look at the individual cases, you see the tragedy of our \npresent policy.\n  At the end of my remarks, I am inserting into the Record a letter \nfrom Mrs. Mary Davis that is largely self-explanatory.\n  It tells what is happening in one family.\n  Why we cannot respond, I do not know.\n  As some of my colleagues know, I have introduced a bill calling for \nhealth care coverage for pregnant women and children six and under.\n  I am pleased that Senator Chafee of Rhode Island has expressed an \ninterest in the legislation.\n  I hope we can emerge with a bipartisan consensus to at least cover \npregnant women and children six and under. That would take care of the \nneeds of this one family, at least for a short time, and protect a \ngreat many others.\n  It is not a substitute for universal coverage, but it is a step in \nthe right direction.\n  I ask that Mrs. Davis' letter be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n                                                    June 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Paul Simon,\n     U.S. Senator, United States Congress, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Simon: I am writing to you with a very \n     distressing problem.\n       Our granddaughter was born May 2, 1994 16 weeks premature. \n     At the time of her birth, her mother had been unemployed \n     because of medical problems; her father was laid off in April \n     of that year from his job. They applied for assistance and \n     received care for mother and baby. Bethany was in the \n     hospital for 4 months, and although doing well, she has lost \n     her eye sight. She is in therapy for work on her hip joints \n     and she had allergies and has a history of respiratory \n     problems. They moved in with us shortly after Jennifer was \n     dismissed from the hospital, because they had no income. We \n     are in the ministry and live in a parsonage.\n       In November of last year, Andy went back to work and they \n     were able to secure a house for $150.00 per month. Andy \n     brings home about $150 after taxes. As it should be, Jennifer \n     was picked up by Andy's insurance, however, Bethany remained \n     on a medical card because her dad's insurance, Blue Cross and \n     Blue Shield, refused to cover her. Bethany is in therapy for \n     her legs, regular doctor visits, and she has had two \n     surgeries on her eyes last October in Detroit. She is \n     scheduled to have more surgeries. However, it is understood \n     that she will probably only have light vision.\n       Cost of living became so that Jennifer was forced to return \n     to work just to keep rent and utilities paid. This past week, \n     Jennifer and Andy were notified that Bethany would be losing \n     her medical card and all coverage as of July 1, just because \n     her mother had gone back to work. Jennifer works for Kentucky \n     Fried Chicken and brings home about $150 per week. Beth does \n     receive SSI of about $401 per month. By losing these medical \n     benefits, she will not be able to keep regular office visits, \n     because the clinic requires payment each and every time, she \n     can no longer go to Detroit for eye surgery because the \n     doctor won't take her without coverage, and she probably will \n     have to give up the therapy on her legs, because they cannot \n     afford the costs.\n       Tell me what they are suppose to do. Both insurance \n     coverage that their jobs provide, refuse to insure Bethany \n     and now she is losing her assistance. These two young kids \n     and Bethany have been through a lot this last year. Now they \n     have a blind child who cannot get assistance. Can something \n     be done?\n       I wouldn't have your job for nothing. Being in the \n     ministry, we realize just how difficult it is to please \n     everyone, but I don't care if you are Democrat or Republican, \n     I am neither, but someone has to do something about medical \n     coverage.\n\n[[Page S10435]]\n\n       I believe you are trying. But tell me where do you go to \n     get help for the innocent children. She cannot go on medicaid \n     or medicare, because she has not worked and not put anything \n     into the system. She will never be able to read, drive or get \n     around on her own. I realize that technology may be available \n     in years to come that will be beneficial to her, but what is \n     going to happen to her now.\n       I hope that you will be able to read this. I know that we \n     are just a small amount of the millions you must hear from \n     daily, but I just couldn't sit and do nothing with my \n     distress and care for this beautiful little girl who is \n     struggling to live.\n       God bless you and your family. May you gain the wisdom and \n     the ability to lead us to a better way of life for everyone.\n       Respectfully yours,\n\n                                            Mary F.

BRENNAN\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nfellow Louisianian, Mr. Ralph O. Brennan, who will be honored August 4 \nby the Louisiana Restaurant Association for his distinguished career in \nthe food service industry. A member of the world-famous Brennan \nrestaurant family of New Orleans, Mr. Brennan has long exemplified a \ncommitment to community service, participatory democracy and creating \nopportunities for all Americans.\n  He has diligently served, and continues to serve, the $290 billion \nfood service industry and its 9.4 million employees. A past president \nof the Louisiana Restaurant Association, he currently is chairman of \nthe board and president of the National Restaurant Association, a major \ntrade group here in Washington. He is also a trustee of the \nAssociation's educational foundation, and will be an industry delegate \nto the first White House Conference on Travel and Tourism in October \n1995. In all of these capacities he urges independent restaurateurs \nfrom around the country to participate fully in the democratic process \nby getting to know their elected representatives at every level of \ngovernment and then making it their responsibility to keep those \nofficials informed. He facilitates their involvement through a toll-\nfree hotline, numerous personal appearances and--perhaps most \nimportant--leading by example, through frequent visits to his Members \nof Congress and, on occasion, delivering testimony before congressional \ncommittees.\n  With his sister, Cindy, Mr. Brennan owns and operates two award-\nwinning restaurants in the New Orleans French Quarter, thereby helping \nto preserve the rich culinary heritage of that great city which his \nfamily has successfully endeavored to do for three generations. But, as \nan industry leader, he is determined to preserve far more than just a \ngreat family tradition. Mr. Brennan has dedicated his life to \npreserving the boundless opportunities that food service affords \nindividuals the rest of society could ignore, like recent immigrants, \nthose without education or professional skills, and those on public \nassistance. Entry-level restaurant positions--washing dishes, bussing \ntables, assisting with food preparation--are a proven first step up a \nviable career ladder for millions of Americans; in fact, 60 percent of \ntoday's restaurant owners and managers started out in what some \nunknowing and insensitive people might refer to as dead-end restaurant \njobs. In the restaurant business, upward mobility is the rule rather \nthan the exception.\n  Mr. President, as this Congress continues its debate on welfare \nreform, I salute Mr. Brennan for working to ensure that the unmatched \nemployment and training opportunities afforded by the food service \nindustry will be something all Americans can be proud of in the \nfuture.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10435-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10435-S10436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     CALIFORNIA: A SOCIETY THAT CUTS CHILD WELFARE BUT BOOSTS JAILS\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I do not believe I have ever met Prof. \nRobert C. Fellmeth of the University of San Diego, but I read what he \nhad to say in the Los Angeles Times about cutting back on assistance to \nthe poor while, at the same time, we hand largess to the wealthy.\n  Statistics differ somewhat, but the California situation mirrors the \nnational situation.\n  If we are doing what is politically popular, I do not know, but what \nwe are doing is certainly wrong.\n  What we need is not Senators and House Members who follow the latest \npublic opinion poll on tax cuts or anything else, but people who try to \nlead, and sometimes do the unpopular, in order to reduce poverty in our \ncountry, to improve education and to do the things that are needed for \na better future.\n  The incredible increase in prison construction and incarceration has \ndone nothing to decrease the crime rate in our country. If putting \npeople in prison reduced the crime rate, we would have the lowest crime \nrate in the world, with the possible exception of Russia.\n  While Professor Fellmeth zeroes in on the California situation, it is \nworthwhile for my House and Senate colleagues to read what he has to \nsay because they will find a striking similiarity between the \nCalifornia action and the Federal action.\n  I ask that his statement be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, July 5, 1995]\n\n     California: A Society That Cuts Child Welfare but Boosts Jails\n\n                        (By Robert C. Fellmeth)\n\n       Despite what we often hear from the governor and the \n     Legislature, spending for the welfare of our children has \n     been in steady decline.\n       An example: The governor claims to have given politically \n     popular K-12 public education ``high priority'' and ``saved \n     it from cuts'' for the last several years. But figures from \n     the second annual Children's Budget, completed by the \n     Children's Advocacy Institute, show a steady decline each \n     year, including proposed spending for 1995-96.\n       At the federal level, Congress proposes to change child \n     spending from ``entitlements'' based on how many children \n     qualify for assistance to ``block grants,'' set at a static \n     figure for five years. The Republican leadership contends \n     that such a policy will curb what it calls ``runaway \n     spending.'' In contrast, the Children's Budget reveals that \n     such a freeze means substantial reductions year to year, \n     imposed without consideration of need or consequences.\n       Budgets based on raw numbers, or numbers with only \n     inflation or only population changes considered--but not \n     adjusted by both--slowly but inexorably squeeze out \n     infrastructure investment. In California this failure has \n     allowed a largely undiscussed disinvestment in children to \n     accumulate over the past six years.\n       From 1989-90 to the current year, Aid to Families With \n     Dependent Children has been cut 20%, the three child-related \n     Medi-Cal accounts an average of 23% and public education 7.5%\n       The consequences in terms of flesh and blood are momentous: \n     The Children's Budget reveals that AFDC for 1.8 million \n     children in California has been cut from close to the federal \n     poverty line to only 75% of that wholly inadequate amount. \n     The governor now proposes to reduce AFDC to just 64% of the \n     poverty-line figure, posing a clear danger of malnutrition \n     and permanent health damage. Wilson also proposes further \n     cuts in AFDC assistance after six months of help; the \n     Republican House would cut children off altogether after two \n     years if Mom does not have a job.\n       Ironically, the same gradual suffocation has been applied \n     to GAIN, the major program providing child care and job \n     training for AFDC mothers. Here there is a 9% decline from \n     1989 and a proposed further cut of 12%.\n       The typical AFDC recipient--contrary to public perception--\n     is 29, white, recently divorced, with two children and no \n     child support. Her problem is not a desire for welfare \n     dependency but the far more prevalent dilemma of paternal \n     abandonment. Is it relevant that childcare help and job \n     training, without which she does not have a chance, have been \n     cut? Less than 10% of AFDC parents get child-care help.\n\n[[Page S10436]]\n\n       The minimum wage is another example. If it had been \n     adjusted to match inflation over the past 20 years, it would \n     be just above $12,000, the federal poverty line for a family \n     of three. But if our typical divorced mother of two obtains \n     full-time employment at minimum wage (as many must do), she \n     will earn $8,840 before deductions--about what full-time \n     child care for her children will cost. Would we take such a \n     population and cut their wages every year by 3% to 5%? That \n     is what the current numbers accomplish.\n       We are spending more in one area: jailing of criminals. \n     California now has the highest juvenile incarceration rate of \n     any state, in a nation with the highest juvenile \n     incarceration rate among all developed countries. \n     California's adult prison population has increased from \n     19,000 in 1977 to 132,000 this year, at an operating cost of \n     $20,000 per prisoner per year. The state is now preparing for \n     341,000 prisoners and 41 new prisons over the next eight \n     years. Is there a relationship between unlimited prison \n     spending and years of decreases in basic investment in \n     children's programs?\n       To be sure, many of our problems can be traced to private \n     irresponsibility--a dependency mentality by some and, for \n     more, a frightening abandonment of children by biological \n     fathers. But public spending makes a difference.\n       Children Now indexes show that a record 28.6% of California \n     children live in poverty and 20% have no access to private or \n     public health care. We also have high infant disability, \n     record low test scores and increasingly violent juvenile \n     crime.\n       Each of these aspects has a relationship to public \n     spending. It is no accident that California's falling test \n     scores, for example, correlate with the worst student-teacher \n     ratio in the nation and a per-pupil spending level now \n     nearing the bottom five states, just ahead of Alabama and at \n     half the level of New Jersey.\n       California is one of the richest jurisdictions in the \n     world--we can boast of having more vehicles than licensed \n     drivers--and our wealth increases each year. The governor \n     predicts that personal income will increase 6% in each of the \n     next two years.\n       And our tax burden has decreased. In 1989-90, we spend \n     $6.88 from the general fund for every $100 in personal \n     income; in the current year, we are spending $5.86 per $100, \n     and the governor proposes a further reduction to $5.50. At \n     the same time, he is calling for a $7-billion tax cut for the \n     wealthy over the next three years.\n       Could the governor make his cutback proposals if the right \n     numbers were used and understood? The fact is that for six \n     years we have been giving to the wealthy and taking from the \n     children. We just haven't been talking about it.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10435-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        WEST VIRGINIA EDUCATION\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nand commend the counties of Mercer, Monroe, McDowell, Summers, Raleigh, \nand Wyoming in West Virginia and their commitment to participating in a \nparental involvement program called, Teachers Involving Parents \nSuccessfully [TIPS]. This program seeks to promote teachers working \nmore closely with parents to help the children learn and succeed in \nschool.\n  Too often, we forget that the condition of children's lives and their \nfuture prospects largely reflects the well-being of their families. \nWhen family support is strong, stable, and loving, children have a \nsound basis for becoming caring and competent adults. In contrast, when \nparents are unable to give children the attention and support they need \nin the home and for school, children are less likely to achieve their \nfull potential. As a result, many of our Nation's gravest social \nproblems stem from problems in our families.\n  However, Mr. President, there is genuine reason for hope and \noptimism. In my home State of West Virginia, under the leadership of \nlocal education officials, a new program is changing the lives of \nchildren and their families. Its development and expansion of \ncommunity-based family support provides parents with the knowledge, \nskills, and support they need to work with their children and the \nschool system. Its success has been achieved through a collaborative \neffort among State and Federal programs, including chapter I and other \nprograms targeted for at-risk students, and private sector efforts in \nthe community. Each month, 2,000 special education guides are \ndistributed, as well as news releases, public service announcements, \nand radio reminders that focus the community on the need for parental \ninvolvement. Teacher training and support materials have also been \nprovided to every school in a successful effort to coordinate teacher, \nparent, and child activity both inside and outside of school.\n  When I was chairman of the bipartisan National Commission on \nChildren, we urged individuals and the country as a whole to reaffirm a \ncommitment to forming and supporting strong, stable families as the \nbest environment for raising children. The West Virginia TIPS Program \nis an extension of that goal, and its success is a tribute to those \ncounties that have worked so hard to insure its development. The \nparents, children, and teachers in these counties are providing new \nopportunities for children and families. Their commitment to make a \ndifference has ensured the success of the family, which is the best \nstrategy for helping our children. They deserve our support and best \nwishes for continued success.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10436-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10436-S10438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nOPPOSITION TO S. 956, THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS REORGANIZATION \n                              ACT OF 1995\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to S. 956, a \nbill to divide the ninth judicial circuit into two circuits.\n  This is the fourth time since 1983 that a bill to split the ninth \ncircuit has been introduced in the U.S. Senate. The proposal has failed \nto become law because the ninth circuit is operating well and providing \nuniform and consistent interpretation of Federal laws across the nine \nWestern States, and the territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana \nIslands.\n  The courts of the ninth circuit are functioning well, and, in many \ninstances, serve as models for the rest of the country. The ninth \ncircuit has prided itself on its experiments in judicial \nadministration, and has been a national leader in developing innovative \ncaseload management and court administration techniques.\n  The vast majority of judges, lawyers, and bar organizations in the \nninth circuit have voted on several occasions against the division of \nthe circuit.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and to resist \nthe temptation to meddle with an institution that is successfully \nadministering justice in the American West.\n  Just 4 years ago, a comprehensive subcommittee hearing was held in \nthe Senate on nearly identical legislation, and the proposal failed to \nemerge from committee. The proponents of S. 956 have identified no new \nreasons or change of circumstances to justify reopening this issue.\n  Mr. President, the ninth judicial circuit has prepared a detailed \nposition paper opposing S. 956. I agree with the circuit's reasoning, \nand I commend this paper to my colleagues. I also urge them to join me \nin opposing this bill which is both unwise and unnecessary.\n  I ask that the complete text of the ``Position Paper in Opposition to \nS. 956--Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1995'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The material follows:\nPosition Paper in Opposition to S. 956--Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \n                  Reorganization Act of 1995 (6/22/95)\n\n       Prepared by: The Office of the Circuit Executive for the \n     United States Courts for the Ninth Circuit, P.O. Box 193846, \n     San Francisco, California 94119-3486; Tel: 415-744-6150/Fax: \n     415-744-6179. [6/30/95]\n       Proposed legislation: S. 956 would divide the present Ninth \n     Circuit into two unequal-sized circuits. The new Twelfth \n     Circuit would consist of the states of Alaska, Idaho, \n     Montana, Oregon, and Washington (6 districts), with 9 active \n     circuit judges. The new Ninth Circuit would consist of the \n     states of Arizona, California, Hawaii, and Nevada, and the \n     territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands (9 \n     districts), with 19 active circuit judges.\n       The Ninth Circuit opposes S. 956. The Ninth Circuit is \n     functioning well and has devised innovative ways of managing \n     its caseload that are models for other circuits. As the \n     nation's largest circuit, it benefits from significant \n     advantages because of its size and believes division of the \n     circuit is unnecessary and unwise. The Circuit Executive's \n     Office for the United States Courts for the Ninth Circuit has \n     prepared the following information in ``question and answer'' \n     format to assist decisionmakers to understand the circuit's \n     position on S. 956.\n\n\n               1. what would the proposed legislation do?\n\n       S. 956 would create two courts--one 19-judge court and one \n     9-judge court--in place of a single 28-judge court. A basic \n     problem with this proposal is that it creates more \n     administrative problems than it solves. Quantitatively, such \n     a circuit court would have a very small caseload. The \n     aggregate number of cases in such a circuit based on the most \n     recent statistics would be 1935,\\1\\ making it the circuit \n     court with the second smallest caseload in the country,\\2\\ \n     with only the First Circuit court having fewer cases. Of the \n     11 \n\n[[Page S10437]]\n     regional circuits, the circuit court with the median volume is the \n     Second, with 3,986 cases; the proposed northern circuit would \n     be less than half that number. Take away the northern states, \n     and the Ninth Circuit court would still have the largest \n     volume in the country. In short, such a proposal creates a \n     very small circuit and gives not much relief.\n       In general, S. 956 presumes that two smaller circuits will \n     do a better job of maintaining consistency and deciding cases \n     promptly than the present circuit. The proposal ignores the \n     central fact of appellate dockets: caseloads are constantly \n     growing and dividing the circuit would simply create two \n     courts with increasing caseloads without dealing with the \n     fundamental problems resulting from expanding caseloads with \n     no increase in judicial resources.\n    2. how does this bill differ from earlier proposed legislation?\n\n       This is the ninth legislative proposal to split the Ninth \n     Circuit since 1940. It is nearly identical (except for the \n     alignment of Hawaii and the Territories) to measures \n     introduced by Senator Gorton in 1983, 1989, and 1991. Each of \n     those measures failed to emerge from committee and died at \n     the conclusion of the legislative session. The Subcommittee \n     on Courts and Administrative Practice of the Senate Committee \n     on the Judiciary conducted a legislative hearing on the 1989 \n     bill (S. 948) on March 6, 1990. The sponsors of the current \n     bill have advanced no reason for dividing the circuit that \n     was not fully considered and rejected in 1990. They have \n     pointed to no change in circumstances that would justify yet \n     another examination of this issue.\n\n\n              3. are there drawbacks to the proposed bill?\n\n       The Ninth Circuit has functioned successfully in its \n     present configuration for over 100 years. Any effort to \n     abolish a successful, established institution should be \n     cautiously examined. The proposed bill could create serious \n     legal and administrative problems and costs that do not now \n     exist:\n       (1) the potential for inconsistent law relating to \n     admiralty, commercial trade, and utilities along the Western \n     seaboard, including Alaska, Hawaii, and the Territories;\n       (2) the opportunity for litigants to forum shop by filing \n     their cases in whichever circuit, northern or southern, they \n     feel is most sympathetic to their cause;\n       (3) the substantial cost of setting up duplicative \n     administrative structures;\n       (4) the loss of advantages of size (see Question #4, \n     below);\n       (5) the rejection of the expressed will of the vast \n     majority of the judges and lawyers in the circuit who oppose \n     its division.\n       Common sense suggests the inadvisability of creating a new \n     regional circuit that would require duplication of functions \n     that are already being satisfactorily performed in a larger \n     circuit. Administratively, the creation of a new circuit \n     would require duplicative offices of clerk of court, circuit \n     executive, staff attorneys, settlement attorneys, and \n     library, as well as courtrooms, mail and computer facilities. \n     In addition, approximately 40,000 square feet or new \n     headquarters space would be required, all of which would \n     duplicate offices and space in San Francisco. Further, a \n     small circuit, with its concomitant small caseload, would \n     underutilize judicial resources and reduce the opportunities \n     for efficiencies available to a larger circuit.\n       Lawyers expressed particular concern that dividing the \n     extended coastline in the West between two circuits would \n     create inconsistent and conflicting application of maritime, \n     commercial, and utility law in the two circuits, making \n     commerce more difficult and costly, and requiring them to \n     research the law of two circuits for every potential cross-\n     circuit transaction. Potential inconsistencies would be \n     especially troubling in the application of utility rates \n     along the entire Pacific seaboard by the Bonneville Power \n     Administration. These rate and administrative disputes should \n     remain in a single service area, the Ninth Circuit.\n       On four occasions in the past 15 years, the federal judges \n     in the Ninth Circuit and elected representatives of \n     practicing lawyers who participate in the Ninth Circuit \n     Judicial Conference have voted overwhelmingly in opposition \n     to splitting the circuit. The current Almanac of the Federal \n     Judiciary, Vol. 2, based on extensive polling, reports that \n     the lawyers ``almost unanimously praise'' the court, and, \n     with regard to circuit splitting, ``all seem to agree that \n     such a division would be difficult and probably \n     unsatisfactory.'' (1995-1, 9th Cir.)\n              4. are there advantages to a large circuit?\n\n       A single court of appeals serving a large geographic region \n     promotes uniformity and consistency in the law and \n     facilitates trade and commerce by contributing to stability \n     and orderly progress. In many respects, the size of the Ninth \n     Circuit is an asset that has improved both decisionmaking and \n     judicial administration. The court of appeals is strengthened \n     and enriched, and the inevitable tendency to regional \n     parochialism is weakened, by the variety and diversity of \n     backgrounds of its judges drawn from the nine states \n     comprising the circuit. The size of the circuit has also \n     allowed the circuit to draw upon a large pool of district and \n     bankruptcy judges for temporary assignment to neighboring \n     districts with a temporary but acute need for judicial \n     assistance.\n       The Ninth Circuit is a national leader in developing \n     innovative solutions to caseload and administrative \n     challenges. The ABA Appellate Practice Committee's Report \n     applauded three specific operational efficiencies:\n       . . .issue classification, aggressive use of staff \n     attorneys, and a limited en banc-[that] were developed by the \n     Ninth Circuit precisely to address the issues of caseload and \n     judgeship growth that the Subcommittee identified, and hold \n     promise for other circuits as they continue to grow. (at p. \n     10).\n       The Ninth Circuit has served as a laboratory for \n     experimentation in a host of other areas--from decentralized \n     budgeting to cameras in the courts, from block case \n     designations to improved state-federal judicial relations, \n     from alternative dispute resolution to appellate \n     commissioners, from improved tribal court relations to \n     alternative forms of capital case representation. The results \n     have inured to the benefit of the entire Judiciary. As the \n     congressionally-mandated Federal Courts Study Committee noted \n     in 1990, ``Perhaps the Ninth Circuit presents a workable \n     alternative to the traditional model.'' Final Report of the \n     Federal Courts Study Committee (1990).\n                5. what is the position of the sponsors?\n\n       In remarks introducing S. 853 (the immediate predecessor of \n     S. 956\\3\\), Senator Gorton of Washington asserted the \n     following grounds for the proposal: (1) a decrease in \n     consistency of decisions due to size; (2) unmanageable \n     caseloads; (3) inability to appreciate the interests of the \n     Northwest; and (4) a decline in the performance of the \n     circuit. 141 Cong. Rec. S7504 (daily ed. May 25, 1995) \n     (statement of Sen. Gorton). Senator Burns of Montana echoed \n     his colleague's concerns and suggested employment and local \n     economic stability are threatened by delays in resolving \n     lawsuits affecting timbering, mining, and water development. \n     Delays in criminal appeals, especially those involving the \n     death penalty, also are of concern to the Senators. 141 Cong. \n     Rec. S7504 (daily ed. May 25, 1995) (statement of Sen. Burns) \n     The circuit's specific responses to these contentions are set \n     forth in the following sections.\n\n\n     6. has the size of the circuit adversely affected consistency?\n\n       Consistency of court of appeals decisions is important to \n     provide coherent guidance to lower courts and litigants. The \n     Ninth Circuit has instituted case management devices that \n     have effectively reduced conflicts between panels and \n     maintained a high level of consistency in its decisions.\n       Since 1980, the use of a limited en banc panel to resolve \n     intracircuit conflicts has proven highly effective. All 28 \n     active judges participate in determining whether a case will \n     be heard en banc. Each call for an en banc vote leads to \n     careful evaluation of the development of the law of the \n     circuit in that area. If a majority of the judges votes to \n     hear a case en banc (which happens less than a dozen times a \n     year), ten members of the court chosen at random plus the \n     chief judge serve as the limited en banc court. Judges and \n     lawyers have expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the \n     limited en banc process; only a handful of requests have been \n     made for a full court rehearing after the limited en banc \n     panel has issued a decision, and none have been granted.\n       An objective, highly-praised scholarly study of consistency \n     of the law in the Ninth Circuit concluded ``the pattern of \n     [multiple relevant precedents] exemplified by high visibility \n     issues. . . is not characteristic of Ninth Circuit \n     jurisprudence generally. Nor is intracircuit conflict.'' \n     Restructuring Justice: The Innovations of the Ninth Circuit \n     and The Future of the Federal Courts (1990). A recent FJC \n     study reached a similar conclusion:\n       In sum, despite concerns about the proliferation of \n     precedent as the courts of appeals grow, there is currently \n     little evidence that intracircuit inconsistency is a \n     significant problem. Also, there is little evidence that \n     whatever intracircuit conflict exists is strongly correlated \n     with circuit size.\n       Structural and Other Alternatives for the Federal Courts of \n     Appeals (1993).\n       Of greater concern is the potential for increased \n     Intercircuit conflicts that would be spawned by the division \n     of circuits. Dividing the Ninth Circuit would place an \n     additional burden on the United States Supreme Court to \n     resolve conflicts that are now handled internally within the \n     circuit.\n       Nor is keeping abreast of the decisions of the Ninth \n     Circuit a significant problem. For the past seven years, the \n     number of published opinions issued by the circuit has \n     remained relatively constant. In large part due to \n     efficiencies and innovative case management methods pioneered \n     in the circuit, the court has been able to accurately \n     identify those selected precedential cases that truly merit \n     publication and those routine cases which are most \n     appropriately disposed of by a written decision sent only to \n     the parties.\n\n\n  7. Is the Ninth Circuit's Caseload Excessive When Compared to Other \n                               Circuits?\n\n       While the caseload for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \n     is the highest in the nation in absolute numbers, the \n     caseload level is clearly not excessive when compared to \n     other circuits, using either of two standard measurement \n     approaches.\n       Because federal statutes require that nearly all of the \n     work of an appellate court be conducted by three-judge \n     panels, the most accurate measure of a court's ability to \n     manage its caseload is the number of appeals filed and \n     terminated per panel. In 1994, the Ninth Circuit stood at 868 \n     appeals filed per panel, very close to the median of 832 and \n\n[[Page S10438]]\n     substantially below the numbers for the two circuits that emerged from \n     the split of the Fifth Circuit in 1980. For the same year, \n     the\n      Ninth Circuit stood at 914 appeals terminated per panel, \n     slightly above the median of 866.\n       Caseload levels may also be measured by case terminations \n     per judge. The current Ninth Circuit rate of merit case \n     terminations per judge is 446, a number which is exactly the \n     national median. By either measure, the caseload levels in \n     the Ninth Circuit approach the middle range for federal \n     appellate judges.\n       In contrast, under the proposed bill, the new Twelfth \n     Circuit, with nine judges, would seriously underutilize its \n     judicial resources and create huge disparities between the \n     two circuits. Using projected Twelfth Circuit filings of \n     1935, a nine-judge court would have 645 filings per panel. \n     The new Ninth Circuit, with 19 judges and filings of 6391, \n     would have 1014 filings per panel, or 57% more cases per \n     panel when compared to the judges in the Twelfth Circuit and \n     the third highest per panel filings figure in the nation.\n\n\n         7. is regionalism appropriate for an appellate court?\n\n       Sponsors of the legislation to divide the circuit cite the \n     need for a court free from domination by California judges \n     and California judicial philosophy. They assert that the \n     Northwest states confront emerging issues that are unique to \n     that region and that cannot be fully appreciated or addressed \n     from a California perspective.\n       The premise that a judge's place of residence prejudices \n     his or her determination of cases was rejected as completely \n     unacceptable by former Chief Justice Warren Burger in his \n     remarks concerning an earlier version of the sponsor's \n     legislation: ``I find it a very offensive statement to be \n     made that a United States judge, having taken the oath of \n     office, is going to be biased because of the economic \n     conditions of his own jurisdiction.'' (Record, August 2, \n     1991, S 12277) Calling an earlier version of legislation to \n     split the circuit ``environmental gerrymandering,'' then-\n     Senator Pete Wilson of California echoed Justice Burger's \n     concerns, stating:\n       The judges of the Circuit are there to apply the law, not \n     make it. Second, even in their application of the law, it is \n     not intended that federal courts abide by a sense of \n     localism. That is the role of the state and local courts. \n     Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1989: \n     Hearings on S. 948 Before the Subcomm. on Courts and \n     Administrative Practice of the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, \n     101st Cong., 2d Sess. 286 (1990) (written statement of Hon. \n     Pete Wilson, U.S. Senate).\n       Similarly, the ABA Appellate Practice Committee's \n     Subcommittee To Study Circuit Size reported that ``a majority \n     of the Subcommittee questions whether regional differences \n     should be a criterion in determining circuit size. * * * The \n     role of circuit courts is primarily to apply federal law--a \n     law that with few exceptions is to be applied uniformly \n     across the land.'' (at p. 3).\n\n\n         8. What Is THE Ninth Circuit's Record of Performance?\n\n       One measure of the efficiency of an appellate court is the \n     average amount of time required to decide a case from the \n     period between filing a notice of appeal and rendering of a \n     final decision. In 1983, when an earlier version of \n     legislation to split the circuit was proposed, the court had \n     4583 new filings and the average length of time from filing \n     the notice of appeal to final decision was 10.5 months. In \n     late 1989, the court of appeals headquarter (where cases are \n     processed) was badly damaged and closed by the Loma Prieta \n     earthquake in San Francisco. Court staff was scattered among \n     six different temporary buildings until late 1991. During \n     this period, the court has 7257 new filings and the average \n     length of time from filing the notice of appeal to final \n     decision role to 15.6 months. Since the court was \n     consolidated in a single location in 1991, processing times \n     have substantially improved. In 1994, the most recent period \n     for which figures are available, the court received 8092 new \n     filings, and, despite vacancies, had reduced the average \n     length of time from filing the notice of appeal to final \n     decision to 14.5 months, slightly less than the time required \n     in the Eleventh Circuit.\n       The average time from filing to disposition, however, does \n     not accurately reflect the time the cases are actually in the \n     judges' hands. In the Ninth Circuit, the average time from \n     oral argument submission to disposition--that is, the actual \n     time the judges have the cases in their hands--is 1.9 months, \n     or .5 months less than the national average. In short, what \n     the court needs to reduce disposition times is more judges. \n     Hundreds of cases are available to be heard by judges; there \n     simply are not enough judges to hear them. This is the \n     ``swell'' in pending cases referred to when S. 853 was \n     introduced. 141 Cong. Rec. S7504 (daily ed. May 25. 1995) For \n     this reason, in 1992 the Ninth Circuit requested additional \n     judgeships. The Judicial Conference of the United States \n     endorsed the request which is now pending before Congress. \n     With four current vacancies on the court, the average time to \n     disposition is unlikely to improve substantially until new \n     judges come on board. Obviously this central problem would \n     not be alleviated by dividing the circuit and the proposed \n     split would materially increase the caseload of judges in the \n     remaining Ninth Circuit.\n\n\n       9. is circuit division the solution to growing caseloads?\n\n       The presumption that increasing the number of circuits \n     would solve the problem of expanding federal court caseloads \n     is the underlying fallacy of S. 956. Cases are resolved by \n     judges, not circuits, and increasing the number of circuits \n     without increasing the number of judges would only exacerbate \n     the problem.\n       Even with the proposed division of the Ninth Circuit, the \n     population shift and growth that is increasing litigation in \n     the West would continue to increase the workload of the two \n     new circuits. The old Fifth Circuit encountered the same \n     situation when it was divided into the Fifth and Eleventh \n     Circuits in 1980. Before the split, the Fifth Circuit had \n     4914 filings and 27 judgeships, compared to the Ninth \n     Circuit's 4262 filings and 23 judgeships. By 1994, the \n     combined Fifth and Eleventh Circuits' filings had increased \n     241% to 11,858, while the Ninth Circuit's had increased 190% \n     to 8115. Dividing the Fifth Circuit had no effect on the \n     growth of the caseload, which is at the root of the size \n     issue.\n       In its study on circuit size, the ABA Appellate Practice \n     Committee's Subcommittee to Study Circuit Size ``found no \n     compelling reasons why circuit courts of various sizes--\n     ranging from a few judges to fifty--cannot effectively meet \n     the caseload challenge. Indeed for every argument in favor\n      of smaller circuits, there is an equally compelling argument \n     for larger circuits.'' Report (October 1992), as p. 5. The \n     Federal Judicial Center's recent analysis of structural \n     alternatives in response to the mandate of the Federal \n     Court Study Committee concluded:\n       [T]here can be no doubt that the system and its judges are \n     under stress. That stress derives primarily from the \n     continuing expansion of federal jurisdiction without a \n     concomitant increase in resources. It does not appear to be a \n     stress that would be significantly relieved by structural \n     change to the appellate system at this time. Structural and \n     other Alternatives for the Federal Course of appeals (1993), \n     at p. 155.\n       The Ninth Circuit is functioning well and is handling its \n     caseload in a timely and responsible manner. It is a leader \n     in innovative case management techniques and its size offers \n     numerous advantages, including: the application of a uniform \n     body of law to wide geographic area, economies of scale in \n     case processing, the ability to serve as a laboratory for \n     experimentation in judicial administration and adjudication, \n     and the diversity of background of its members. The vast \n     majority of judges and lawyers in the circuit support \n     retention of the circuit in its present form and reject \n     circuit division as a response to the caseload crisis.\n       Further Information Relating to the Issue of Splitting the \n     Ninth Circuit:\n       ABA Appellate practice Committee, subcommittee to Study \n     Circuit Size, Report (October 1992).\n       Baker, Thomas, ``On Redrawing Circuit Boundaries--Why the \n     Proposal to Divide the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Ninth Circuit Is Not Such a Good Idea,'' 22 Ariz.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on how best \nto control the viewing habits of America's children.\n  We are in a communication revolution. We have all heard about the \ninformation highway. We know that there is more and more information \navailable to all of us. And more information available to children. \nMuch of it is \n\n[[Page S10439]]\ngood, and some of it is bad. The information highway includes ever-\nincreasing numbers of television channels. These new and changing \nchannels and the programs they broadcast are coming into our living \nrooms.\n  There is a good side to this growing technology and information, but \nwe also know there is a bad side. Studies tell us that by the time a \nchild enters high school, that child will watch over 8,000 murders and \n100,000 acts of violence on television. How can parents know and \ncontrol what their kids are watching. How can they control it when they \nare away from home working? How can they control what their kids see on \nthe living room television when they are busy in the kitchen?\n  For some the solution is simple, just censor the networks or \nmoviemakers. I believe there is a better way. It is the approach I \nbelieve in, and that is the approach that uses technology and \ninformation.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Media Protection Act of \n1995. This is the V-chip bill. A television that has this V chip will \nallow parents to block out programming that they don't want their \nchildren to see when they are away or in another room. This automatic \nblocking device will be triggered by a rating system that the networks \ncan develop themselves. This is not censorship. It is no more \ncensorship than the current movie theater rating system that was \ncreated by the movie industry less than three decades ago.\n  I am also pleased to cosponsor the Television Violence Report Card \nAct of 1995. This is the information part of what parents need. This \nlegislation will encourage an evaluation of programming to let parents \nknow just what to watch for or watch out for.\n  Some call this legislation censorship, but it is not. It is parental \nempowerment and parental involvement, and maybe a way to stem the tide \nof violence that kids are exposed to every day and evening they watch \ntelevision.\n                   ``WHY NOT ATOM TESTS IN FRANCE?''\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the Washington Post had an editorial \ntitled, ``Why Not Atom Tests in France?''\n  The policy of France is unwise, just as our earlier policy of \ncontinuing tests was unwise.\n  France is not doing a favor to stability in the world with these \ntests.\n  I hope that the French Government will reconsider this unwise course.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent that this op-ed piece be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                     Why Not Atom Tests in France?\n\n       France's unwise decision to resume nuclear testing was an \n     invitation to the kind of protests and denunciations being \n     generated by Greenpeace's skillful demonstration of political \n     theater. But even before Greenpeace set sail for the test \n     site, several Pacific countries had vehemently objected to \n     France's intention of carrying out the explosions at a \n     Pacific atoll. The most cutting comment came from Japan's \n     prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama. At a recent meeting in \n     Cannes the newly installed president of France, Jacques \n     Chirac, confidently explained to him that the tests will be \n     entirely safe. If they are so safe, Mr. Murayama replied, why \n     doesn't Mr. Chirac hold them in France?\n       The dangers of these tests to France are, in fact, \n     substantial. The chances of physical damage and the release \n     of radioactivity to the atmosphere are very low. But the \n     symbolism of a European country holding its tests on the \n     other side of the earth, in a vestige of its former colonial \n     empire, is proving immensely damaging to France's standing \n     among its friends in Asia.\n       France says that it needs to carry out the tests to ensure \n     the reliability of its nuclear weapons. Those weapons, like \n     most of the American nuclear armory, were developed to \n     counter a threat from a power that has collapsed. The great \n     threat now, to France and the rest of the world, is the \n     possibility of nuclear bombs in the hands of reckless and \n     aggressive governments elsewhere. North Korea, Iraq and Iran \n     head the list of possibilities. The tests will strengthen \n     France's international prestige, in the view of many French \n     politicians, by reminding others that it possesses these \n     weapons. But in less stable and non-democratic countries, \n     there are many dictators, juntas and nationalist fanatics who \n     similarly aspire to improve their countries' standing in the \n     world.\n       The international effort to discourage the spread of \n     nuclear weapons is a fragile enterprise, depending mainly on \n     trust and goodwill. But over the past half-century, the \n     effort has been remarkably and unexpectedly successful. It \n     depends on a bargain in which the nuclear powers agree to \n     move toward nuclear disarmament at some indefinite point in \n     the future, and in the meantime to avoid flaunting these \n     portentous weapons or to use them merely for displays of one-\n     upmanship. That's the understanding that France is now \n     undermining. The harassment by Greenpeace is the least of the \n     costs that these misguided tests will exact.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10438-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10439-S10440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ON THE RELEASE OF AUNG SAN SUU KYI\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, after 6 years of unjust detention \nby the Burmese military, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi is \nfree. While this is cause for celebration and great relief from those \nof us who have long called for her release, one cannot fail to stress \nthat there is also great outrage that she was incarcerated in the first \ninstance. The State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC], the \nmilitary Junta in Burma, has sought to thwart democracy at every turn.\n  Led by Aung San Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy [NLD] \nparty won a democratic election in 1990, while she was under house \narrest, yet the SLORC has never allowed the elected leaders of Burma to \ntake office. Instead they have forced these leaders to flee their \ncountry to escape arrest and death.\n  The United States Senate has often spoken in support of those brave \nBurmese democracy leaders. We have withheld aid and weapons to the \nmilitary regime, and have provided some, albeit modest amounts, of \nassistance to the Burmese refugees who have fled the ruthless SLORC. \nPro-democracy demonstrators were particularly vulnerable, yet having \nfled the country they found themselves denied political asylum by \nWestern governments. In 1989, Senator Kennedy and I rose in support of \nthe demonstrators and won passage of an amendment to the Immigration \nAct of 1990 requiring the Secretary of State and the Attorney General \nto clearly define the immigration policy of the United States toward \nBurmese pro-democracy demonstrators. Congress acted again on the \nCustoms and Trade Act of 1990 to adopt a provision I introduced \nrequiring the President to impose appropriate economic sanctions on \nBurma. The Bush administration utilized this provision to sanction \nBurmese textiles. Unfortunately these powers have never been exercised \nby the current administration.\n  The SLORC regime had to be denounced. The Senate continued to press \nfor stronger actions. On March 12, 1992, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee unanimously voted to adopt a report submitted by myself and \nSenator McConnell detailing specific actions that should be taken \nbefore the nomination of a United States Ambassador to Burma would be \nconsidered in the Senate.\n  Last year the State Department Authorization Act for 1994-95 \ncontained a provision I introduced placing Burma on the list of \ninternational outlaw states such as Libya, North Korea, and Iraq, an \nindication that the United States Congress considers the SLORC regime \nto be one of the very worst in the world. The Senate also unanimously \nadopted S. 234 on July 15, 1994, calling for the release of Aung San \nSuu Kyi and for increased international pressure on the SLORC to \nachieve the transfer of power to the winners of the 1990 democratic \nelection.\n  Thankfully, Aung San Suu Kyi has now been released. But the struggle \nin Burma is not over. The SLORC continues to wage war against its own \npeople. Illegal heroin continues to be produced with their complicity. \nAnd the SLORC continues to thwart the transfer to democracy in Burma. \nThe New York Times concludes appropriately:\n\n       The end of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's detention must be \n     followed by other steps toward democracy before Myanmar is \n     deemed eligible for loans from multilateral institutions or \n     closer ties with the United States. It is too soon to welcome \n     Yangon back into the democratic community.\n\n  We in the Senate must rededicate ourselves to the strong support of \nthose in Burma working to overcome this tyranny. I congratulate Aung \nSan Suu Kyi on her extraordinary bravery and determination, and \ncelebrate with her family the news of her release.\n  I ask that the July 13, 1995, editorial be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n[[Page S10440]]\n\n\n                  [The New York Times, July 13, 1995]\n\n                     New Hope for Burmese Democracy\n\n       The release of the political prisoner Daw Aung San Suu Kyi \n     in Yangon, formerly Rangoon, is good news. Mrs. Aung San Suu \n     Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, had been under \n     house arrest for nearly six years. The next test for the \n     regime, which changed the name of the country from Burma to \n     Myanmar, will be to follow Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's freedom \n     with a return to some form of political pluralism and with \n     other improvements in human rights.\n       Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won \n     elections under her leadership in 1990. The military refused \n     to recognize the results, imprisoning and intimidating many \n     of the newly elected legislators. Burmese expatriates say \n     torture is still routinely used in prisons and by the \n     military in its repression of ethnic minorities.\n       Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's release has rekindled the hopes of \n     many Burmese for a return to democracy. At her first public \n     appearance, she stuck a conciliatory note, saying she wanted \n     to promote dialogue with the military junta. She acted \n     properly in cautioning against unrealistic expectations. \n     Nevertheless, hundreds of people have made the pilgrimage to \n     her home in Yangon since her release, demonstrating the deep \n     loyalty of her followers.\n       But Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi is re-entering a society in which \n     her own name has been a forbidden word, where personal \n     freedoms are severely restricted and political life brutally \n     curtailed. She refused to make any deals with the authorities \n     to gain her freedom, and she has made it clear that she \n     intends to pursue her democratic goals.\n       Myanmar is eager to break its isolation and join the \n     region's economic boom. Japan, which covets its rich natural \n     resources, is already preparing to warm up relations with \n     Yangon. But Myanmar will need substantial help from agencies \n     like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to \n     join the international economy.\n       The end of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's detention must be \n     followed by other steps toward democracy before Myanmar is \n     deemed eligible for loans from multilateral institutions or \n     closer ties with the United States. It is too soon to welcome \n     Yangon back into the democratic community.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/20/senate-section/article/S10439-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10440-S10442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               INSULAR AREAS APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 144, S. 1023.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1023) to authorize an increased Federal share of \n     the costs of certain transportation projects in the District \n     of Columbia for fiscal years 1995 and 1996, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering legislation today to allow the District of Columbia to move \nforward with transportation projects that are critically needed for the \nentire metropolitan Washington region.\n  I want to make clear to my colleagues that this legislation is \nconsistent with the temporary match waivers that Congress has provided \nin 1975, 1982, and 1991. Under previous matching share waivers, 39 \nStates have utilized this flexibility.\n  The legislation before the Senate is again a temporary waiver of the \nlocal matching share required before a State, or in this case the \nDistrict of Columbia, can obligate Federal highway dollars. It is not a \ncomplete forgiveness of their financial obligation to provide a 20 \npercent match of these Federal dollars.\n  This legislation requires the District to repay these matching \nrequirements by the end of fiscal year 1996--September 30. If the \nDistrict fails to comply, their 1997 Federal highway apportionments \nwill be reduced.\n  The legislation also requires that these Federal funds are to be used \nto maintain and upgrade National Highway System routes in the District, \nand other projects which the Secretary of Transportation determines to \nbe important to the entire region.\n  Any other project the District decides to move forward with must be \nmatched with local funds. In other words, this bill only temporarily \nwaives the local match for those projects important to maintaining the \nDistrict's most heavily traveled roads.\n  Mr. President, during the committee's consideration a provision was \nadded to require the Department of Transportation to report to the \nCongress on those projects funded in 1995. This provision gives us \nfurther assurance that the District will properly use these funds on \nthose most regionally significant projects. The committee has made \nclear that following a review of the use of the 1995 apportionments, if \nthese funds were not allocated to worthy projects, then the committee \nwill reconsider the waiver for fiscal year 1996.\n  These are the same roads which serve as the gateways to our Nation's \nCapital and are the major commuter arteries for the metropolitan \nregion.\n  These are the same roads which contribute to the functioning of the \nFederal Government and serve the thousands of tourists from our States \nwho travel here each year.\n  Mr. President, it is important to emphasize that this legislation is \nnecessary to reduce congestion which plagues the entire region. The \nprojects to benefit from this legislation are ones that compliment the \ntransportation priorities of Virginia and Maryland, such as the 14th \nStreet Bridge and Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  Also, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of \na letter from Virginia Secretary of Transportation Martinez placing \nGovernor Allen's administration solidly in support of this legislation, \nand a letter in support from the distinguished Representative from the \nDistrict of Columbia, Ms. Norton.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Commonwealth of Virginia,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                                     July 7, 1995.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Warner: This letter is to provide the \n     Commonwealth of Virginia's position on the proposed \n     legislation to authorize the U.S. Secretary of Transportation \n     to increase the federal share of certain highway projects in \n     the District of Columbia for fiscal years 1995 and 1996. This \n     legislation would in effect provide a temporary waiver of the \n     local match for highway projects in Washington, D.C.\n\n[[Page S10443]]\n\n       It is important for the economic health of Northern \n     Virginia and the region to continue the development of \n     critical transportation improvements. The regional projects \n     that Virginia is working with the District include the 14th \n     Street Bridge improvements and certain Intelligent \n     Transportation System (ITS) projects.\n       Virginia supports this measure to allow the needed \n     transportation projects to move forward this construction \n     season and not delay much needed projects. If we can provide \n     any additional information, please do not hesitate to call \n     me.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert E. Martinez.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                    Washington, DC. July 17, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader of the Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: On July 11, the Senate Environment and \n     Public Works Committee passed legislation, introduced by \n     Senator John Warner, that would waive the local match of \n     federal highway funds for the District of Columbia for FY \n     1995 and FY 1996. I write now to seek your assistance in \n     getting this legislation through the Senate.\n       Without swift passage of this legislation in both chambers, \n     before August 1, $82 million in FY 1995 apportioned monies \n     and a similar amount in FY 1996 will be unavailable. It is \n     essential to the economic health of the District and the \n     region to repair the gateway streets used by regional \n     commuters and 20 million visitors annually.\n       No new highway projects are planned this fiscal year in the \n     District; nor have any bids been solicited over the past 18 \n     months because the District's fiscal crisis has left the city \n     unable to meet the matching funds requirement for federal \n     monies. As you know, this federal money does not linger in \n     the government bureaucracy but gets flushed right into the \n     private sector when a city bids from private sector \n     contractors to work on the projects.\n       The waiver in the Warner bill is based on precedents from \n     P.L. 94-30 in 1975, P.L. 97-424 in 1982 and P.L. 102-240 in \n     1991. With the waiver, vital District projects to improve the \n     major gateways into the city could proceed, aiding more \n     tourists and commuters than D.C. residents, and providing \n     desperately needed jobs and economic development for the \n     city.\n       Please help.\n       Best personal regards.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Eleanor Holmes Norton.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on a related matter, I would like to share \nwith the Senate my longstanding interest in preserving the historic \nintegrity of Constitution Avenue. This panoramic avenue has witnessed \nmany landmark events in our Nation's history. It links the Lincoln \nMonument to the U.S. Capitol with many of the principal U.S. Government \noffices, national museums, and the National Gallery of Art gracing this \nhistoric avenue.\n  Unfortunately it has fallen into a serious state of disrepair. It has \nbecome a corridor overburdened with mobile street vendors.\n  Formerly known as B Street, it was renamed Constitution Avenue in \n1913 and hosted President Franklin Roosevelt's inaugural parades. \nPresident Roosevelt was the first President to break with tradition and \nhost his inaugural parade along Constitution Avenue rather than the \nformerly used routing along Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  Today I believe that the historic beauty of Constitution Avenue is \nmarred by an increasing number of vendor vehicles permanently located \nalong this corridor. These vendors create gridlock, as they scramble to \npark, during peak usage of this vital corridor. They distract from the \nintrinsic beauty and historic tradition of this corridor. Cannot the \nusers and visitors to this great capitol city have one avenue free of \ncommercial buildings and commercial vehicles?\n  I have shared these views with the Mayor of the District of Columbia, \nand I will continue to work for these goals.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered and deemed read a third time, passed, and that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe bill be placed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the bill (S. 1023), was deemed read for a third time and passed, \nas follows:\n\n                                S. 1023\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
