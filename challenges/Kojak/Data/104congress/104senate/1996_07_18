It is \nalso our greatest need and our most urgent desire. We really want to \nknow You, not just as some distant creator and sustainer of the \nuniverse but as our Father and our Friend. We confess that often our \nlack of knowledge of You is the cause of our insecurity, our \ninconsistency, and our insufficiency. It also accounts for our \nvacillation in our prayers. We commit this day to seek to know You \nbetter. We open our true selves to You; we want to be real, honest, and \nvulnerable with You; we invite You to invade every aspect of our \nrelationships and our responsibilities today. Show us Your will and \ngive us the strength and courage to follow Your guidance. We dedicate \nourselves to make knowledge of You our first priority. Show us Your \ngrace and goodness, righteousness and power. We place our total trust \nin You, and we will live by faith in You today. Be the unseen but \nundeniable presence in every moment of this day.\n  Gracious Lord, as we seek to know You and understand You, we wonder \nwhy good people face difficult and painful things. We wonder about the \ncrash of the TWA aircraft. We think of the young people and the \nsponsors who were with them from Montoursville, PA. We realize that \nYour most difficult decision was to allow this world to be free in \nwhich accidents can happen, wrong choices can be made. And we turn to \nYou for Your strength and courage in the midst of questions that seem \nto be without answers. But we also know that in spite of everything, \nYou are in control, and so we trust You as our Lord and Savior.

Under the previous order, the Senate \nwill now resume consideration of S. 1894, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1894) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1997, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Harkin/Simon amendment No. 4492, relating to payments by \n     the Department of Defense of restructuring costs associated \n     with business combinations.\n       Levin amendment No. 4893, to strike funding for new \n     production of F-16 aircraft in excess of six, and transfer \n     the funding to increase funding for anti-terrorism support.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4492\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will now proceed to rollcall votes \nwith respect to amendments offered on Wednesday, July 17, with 2 \nminutes for explanation equally divided prior to each vote. The first \namendment is No. 4492, the motion to table. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand we have a minute on each side \nto explain the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, all I can say is:\n\n       Remember the $600 toilet seat and the $500 hammers that had \n     taxpayers up in arms during the mid-1980's. Today's \n     subsidized mergers are going to make them look like bargains.\n\n  That is not my quote. That is a quote of Lawrence Korb, President \nReagan's Under Secretary of Defense.\n  In 1993, DOD changed its policy to allow payments to defense \ncontractors for the costs of mergers and acquisitions. The GAO and \ninspector general have both recently issued reports that seriously \nquestion DOD's purported savings.\n  This amendment simply puts a 1-year hold on merger costs while the \nGAO, the IG, and OMB put together a mechanism to make sure that future \npayments actually result in savings. It does not affect Government \nassistance to laid-off workers. It does not prohibit payment of any \nmerger costs which DOD is contractually obligated to pay in the fiscal \nyear 1997.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment would prevent severance\n\n[[Page S8066]]\n\npay for employees under a restructuring plan. It would eliminate early \nretirement incentive payments for employees, employee retraining costs, \nrelocation expenses for retrained and retained employees, placement \nservices for employees, and continued medical-dental-life insurance \ncoverage for terminated employees. In the past 3 years, the Department \nof Defense has reimbursed contractors $300 million in restructuring \ncosts and will save $1.4 billion, a 450-percent return on the \ninvestment.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding this will be a 20-minute vote, \nregular vote, and the following votes will be 10 minutes. Is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the yeas and nays have been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion to table. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Does the Senator from Michigan wish to proceed?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4893\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment would transfer money that \nthe Air Force did not ask for for two F-16's and transfer it into an \nantiterrorist emergency account which we created yesterday which the \nDepartment of Defense very much needs and wants.\n  The original budget request asked us for four F-16's. Then when we \nasked the Air Force, if they had additional funds, what would they \nspend those funds on? They said, well, if they had about $2 billion \nextra, they would add two more F-16's, for a total of six. In this \nappropriations bill, there are eight, four more F-16's than the Air \nForce requested in their original budget request and two more even than \nthey asked for on their wish list.\n  So what this amendment would do is transfer that $48 million not \nrequested by the Air Force for F-16's and move it into an antiterrorism \nemergency fund.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, after the event of last night, this is a \nvery serious matter. I want to start off by assuring the Senate that we \nhave money for counterterrorism in the Commerce bill, in the Treasury-\nPost Office bill, in the Transportation bill. I want to tell you as \nchairman of this committee, there are significant--very significant--\nsums in the classified portions of this bill for counterterrorism. So \nthe counterterrorism issue should be set aside.\n  The question is, are the two extra F-16's--the F-4 Wild Weasels are \nbeing retired. The F-16's can take their place in that role. The F-\n16's--it is true what the Senator said, they first asked for two. When \nwe looked at it, and the authorization bill authorized four, we went \ninto it in depth. I personally talked to General Fogleman, Chief of the \nAir Force, about the need. He said they do in fact need this. As a \nmatter of fact, General Ralston who is now the Vice Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs, has said that we are short 120 airplanes if the F-16's \nare to carry out the two contingency roles.\n  I believe we need these extra two F-16's. That is the issue, not \ncounterterrorism. I moved to table this amendment. This will be a \nrollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. FRIST). The question occurs on agreeing to \nthe motion to lay on the table the Levin amendment No. 4893. The yeas \nand nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      b-52 modifications amendment\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, yesterday during consideration of the \ndefense appropriations bill, the Senate adopted my amendment allocating \nan additional $11,500,000 in Air Force aircraft procurement funds for \nmodifications to B-52 bombers. I want to explain the source for these \nfunds.\n  In reporting out its version of the fiscal year 1997 Defense \nAppropriations Act, the committee added operations and maintenance \nfunds to maintain the current force structure for B-52 bomber attrition \nreserve aircraft.\n  My amendment allocated funds from within the aircraft procurement \naccount to modify these aircraft. These modifications are required to \nmaintain the combat effectiveness of these aircraft should they be \ncalled upon to fly combat missions.\n  The funds for the bomber modifications are to be offset by a decrease \nof funds allocated for the F-15 fighter data link modifications in the \nsame appropriations account.\n  The fighter data link funds are excess to program requirements due to \na delay in a projected contract award. The fighter data link program \nremains fully funded for fiscal year 1997.\n\n[[Page S8067]]\n\n                    HARRISBURG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to alert my colleagues to an \nenvironmental restoration center at the Harrisburg International \nAirport, formerly Olmsted Air Force Base, located in Pennsylvania. My \ncolleague, Congressman George Gekas, has shown great leadership on the \nissue of environmental restoration.\n  In 1984, this former Air Force base was designated an Environmental \nProtection Agency Superfund site. For the last 13 years, an intense \neffort under the guidance of the EPA, has been undertaken at the local, \nState, and Federal level to determine the nature of the origins, \nlocations, and the proper remediation of the waste left by the U.S. Air \nForce. A database established at the site will enable all future site \nusers to have an understanding of the remediation efforts undertaken. \nBy the time all the current participants have left the site, the only \nremaining reliable reference source will be this database.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his efforts in \nkeeping the committee informed of his actions on this matter. I will \nwork with my colleagues during conference to examine this matter more \nclosely.\n\n\n                         Sacrifices for Defense\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to congratulate my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, on their \nefforts to complete action on the Fiscal Year 1997 Defense \nAppropriations bill. Their management of this complex bill is masterful \nand executed with their customary efficiency. The bill is within the \n602(b) allocations and it is consistent with the amount recommended by \nthe budget resolution.\n  This bill addresses legitimate defense needs and provides support for \nthe men and women in our military. It contains a 3-percent raise in pay \nfor military personnel and a 4-percent raise in the basic allowance for \nquarters, both effective January 1, 1997.\n  It fully funds the initiative included in the fiscal year 1997 \nDefense authorization bill to support the operations of, and enhanced \nmodifications for, the SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft. The rationale for \nincluding this system in the fiscal year 1997 budget is that it is an \ninvulnerable proven system, available day or night, in all-weather, \nregardless of cloud cover. It is available for our commanders in the \ntheater, on an on-call basis, to provide near-real-time imagery of the \nbattlefield or area of interest to those Commanders. As such, it is now \navailable as America's premier tactical reconnaissance airborne system. \nFurthermore, it is inexpensive, compared to the costs incurred for the \ndevelopment of our unmanned aerial vehicles now being funded. I am a \nstrong supporter of developing UAV's as rapidly as prudent development \nschedules allow, but it will still be years before a proven system can \nbe fielded. When that occurs, I would support retiring the Blackbird \naircraft, but it would be foolish to throw away this unique system \nbefore it is fully replaced. Therefore, I congratulate the managers for \ntheir support of continuing the SR-71 in service. The funding includes \n$30 million for 1 year of operations, and $9 million in modification \ncosts which enhance the real-time downlink from the aircraft directly \nto our commanders on the ground. I hope and certainly expect that our \ncommanders in the field, in Korea, in Bosnia, and in other regions of \ninterest will call upon the system frequently to provide the unique \ndata for them that is now available.\n  My concern regarding this bill is not with the many worthy provisions \ncontained with it. I do not want a weak military, unable to defend our \nlegitimate and vital national security interests. But neither do I want \na weak nation, sapped of its vitality, worn down and shabby because \nlegitimate domestic needs have been neglected in favor of greater \nspending on defense. I do not want to see in America a street person, \ndirty, dressed in rags, but carrying a shiny new pistol. I want to see \nin America a hard-working, educated, prosperous homeowner, with a well-\nkept yard where bright-eyed and well-fed children play.\n\n  I know that this bill is within its allocation and consistent with \nthe budget resolution guidelines, but I believe that the budget \nresolution guidelines are out of balance with American priorities, \nskewed toward military spending at the expense of education, \ninfrastructure, and other domestic necessities. I would rather rebuild \nbridges over mighty rivers than build bridges on unneeded ships. I \nwould rather spend funds on domestic airline safety measures than on \nunrequested fighter aircraft. I would rather support more police on our \ncity streets stopping bullets than futuristic missile-stopping missiles \naimed at a flimsy threat.\n  This bill is $10.2 billion over the administration's request for \ndefense. Some have argued that defense spending has declined in real \nterms over the last 10 years, and that buying weapons now rather than \nlater in the decade saves money. But the funding for domestic programs \nhas also declined, and continues to decline. If we are to make good on \nour promises to reduce the deficit and to bring spending in line with \nreality, every program, domestic and defense alike, must share in the \nsacrifice. Right now, domestic programs are being cut more deeply in \norder to support defense spending that is above the administration's \nrequest. For instance, the Department of Agriculture, as part of its \nWater 2000 initiative to provide safe, affordable drinking water to \nevery home in the United States by the turn of the century, estimates \nthat $9.8 billion is needed to accomplish that goal. This $9.8 billion \nis needed to provide nearly 3 million U.S. households--176,114 of them \nin my own State of West Virginia--with clean drinking water. For less \nthan the amount added to the Department of Defense for 1 year, we could \nprovide clean, safe, drinking water to 8 million suffering Americans.\n  The budget resolution, which passed without my support, deliberately \nchose to sacrifice safe drinking water, education, highways, medical \nresearch, police, children's programs, and other peaceful domestic \nprograms, in order to spend more on weapons and war. I regret the \nchoice and the path that we have taken. This defense appropriations \nbill is the result of that decision, and reflects the largess bestowed \nupon the Defense Department at the expense of the Departments of \nEducation, Labor, Agriculture, Environment, Health and Human Services, \nInterior, and others. It reflects the decisions taken in the defense \nauthorization bill, which I voted against. Therefore, I must \nregretfully vote against this bill.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to S. 1894, the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997. This \nbill suffers from the same fundamental defect as S. 1745, the national \ndefense authorization bill, a bill I also opposed.\n  The appropriations bill adds $10.2 billion to the President's budget \nrequest. The $10.2 billion is spent partially funding programs not \nrequested by the administration for which we will pay billions in the \noutyears. For example, the bill adds $856 million for ballistic missile \ndefense research, of which $300 million is added to the national \nmissile defense account. The bill also adds $525 million in unrequested \nfunds for the DDG-51, $701 million in unrequested funds for the new \nattack submarine, $300 million in unrequested funds for the V-22, $489 \nmillion in unrequested funds for the F/A-18 C/D, $760 million in \nunrequested funds for National Guard and Reserve equipment, $204.5 \nmillion in unrequested funds for the C-130, $107.4 million in \nunrequested funds for the F-16, and $210 million in unrequested funds \nfor the JSTARS program.\n  I have been a long time supporter of our efforts to ensure our \nnational security. However, Mr. President, this is the second time in \nmy Senate career that I have felt that I must oppose a Defense \nAppropriations bill. I cannot support adding billions and billions of \ndollars for programs that I am not convinced and the Pentagon does not \nbelieve we need. It is true that I would support additional funding for \nsome of these programs but adding $10.2 billion in unrequested funding \nis simply too much particularly when we are cutting funding for \ncritical programs elsewhere in the budget.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, which is responsible for recommending sound, fiscally \nresponsible funding legislation to the Senate, I am deeply disturbed \nabout the spending levels contained in the fiscal year 1997 Department \nof Defense appropriation bill.\n\n[[Page S8068]]\n\n  This bill provides over $244 billion in budget authority for the \ncoming year. This reflects the recently passed national defense \nauthorization bill, which authorized nearly $11.3 billion more than the \nadministration requested for military spending for 1997. Included in \nthis legislation are billions of dollars worth of weapons the Pentagon \nsays it does not want and cannot afford to maintain in the future. \nMeanwhile, vital domestic programs are being critically underfunded or \nterminated. Fiscally, this is unwise; morally, it is unconscionable.\n  Despite all the debate about balancing the Federal budget, it is \napparent to me that we are not yet ready to break off our addiction to \nexcessive military spending. Of even more concern, is the continued \nfailure of this body to define national security in a truly \ncomprehensive and meaningful way. As I have stated many times before, \ntrue national security consists of more than our arsenal of military \nweapons, it also includes the health and welfare of our population.\n  Many years ago, the cabinet agency tasked with protecting the \nnational security of the United States was renamed from the Department \nof War to the Department of Defense. This is an important distinction. \nThe definition of war is a state of open and hostile conflict between \nstates or nations. The definitions of defense and security carry with \nthem much broader connotations. Defense, or to defend, is to drive \ndanger or attack away from. While security means freedom from danger, \nfreedom from fear or anxiety, freedom from want or deprivation.\n  The mission of the Department of Defense is to protect the citizens \nof the United States against threats to our security. Let us recognize \nthat these threats can take many forms, that they are internal as well \nas external. The American people are under attack today. The attacks \nare not as obvious as tanks rolling down Constitution Avenue or nuclear \nsubmarines sailing up the Potomac River. The enemies aren't as easily \nidentifiable as a soldier pointing a gun, rather they are often subtle \nand insidious. But, make no mistake, we do have formidable enemies \nthreatening our population. The enemies I speak of are disease and \ndisability.\n\n  In one year, more Americans will die from disease than from all the \nmilitary battles fought in the twentieth century. The number of \nAmericans killed in battle during World War I, World War II, Korea, \nVietnam, Panama, the Persian Gulf, and Somalia total 426,175. Certainly \na horrendous number and a tragic loss of life. In contrast, however, \napproximately 500,000 people will die of cancer this year alone. Lung \ncancer will kill 115,000 Americans, breast cancer 48,000, and prostate \ncancer 41,000. I could go on and on. Heart disease will kill over \n743,000 people, diabetes 53,000, and AIDS 37,000. The list of \ncasualties from disease is endless.\n  Make no mistake, there are thousands of tiny wars being fought in \nAmerica today. The battleground is the human body. The command centers \nare clinical research laboratories and our weapons are test tubes and \nmicroscopes. The Generals and Admirals leading the fight are the \nmedical researchers, physicians, and nurses all around the country \nsearching for new treatments and cures for disease.\n  But in this war, the front line troops are civilians as well as \nsoldiers. This battle is as ugly and painful as any military conflict. \nEvery day men, women, and children are being killed, maimed, and \nravaged by disease. No mortars are being launched, but limbs are being \namputated as a result of diabetes. No napalm has been dropped, but skin \nis destroyed and bodies are disfigured by EB. No nerve gas has been \nreleased, but brains and central nervous systems are disabled by \nAlzheimers and Parkinsons diseases. It is time to declare war on \ndisease and disability. This is a battle which is worthy of the full \ncommitment and resources of our Federal Government, including the \nDepartment of Defense. In fact, this is one war which I fully support.\n  The Department of Defense also has the responsibility to care for the \nmen and women who sacrifice to serve and protect our country. In \ndevoting a small portion of its considerable resources to medical \nresearch and treatment, the Pentagon invests in the health and welfare \nof our troops, as well as our military retirees, veterans, and family \nmembers.\n  Several years ago, Congress appropriated funds for and directed the \nDepartment of Defense to establish a peer-reviewed breast cancer \nresearch program. This program has been a tremendous success and is a \nvital component in the effort to find a cure for breast cancer. We have \ncontinued funding for that program in 1997. In this bill, we have also \nprovided $100 million to establish a similar program for prostate \ncancer research.\n  Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among \nmen. Yet, it has largely been overlooked by the general public and \nresearch has been grievously underfunded by the Federal Government. In \n1996, over 317,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and \n41,400 will die from it. Yet, with early detection, 9 out of 10 men can \nbe successfully treated for prostate cancer. Clearly, an investment in \nresearch to improve detection and treatment of this disease will yield \na tremendous return.\n  Medical research is the key to winning the war against disease and \ndisability. I am pleased that the Senate has included some funding for \nthis critical effort in this legislation. In my view, however, the \namount of resources devoted to life-destroying technologies compared to \nlife-sustaining endeavors is still critically out of balance. The \nhealth and well-being of our population is every bit as vital to the \nNation's security as our arsenal of military weapons. Until this \nimbalance is recognized and corrected, the people of our Nation will \ncontinue to be vulnerable to these destructive enemies and true \nnational security will not be achieved, no matter what our level of \nmilitary might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the bill, S. 1894, \nwill be read for the third time.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate shall \nproceed immediately to the House companion bill, H.R. 3610; that all \nafter the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1894, as \namended, if amended, be inserted, and that H.R. 3610 be read for the \nthird time.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read for the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss briefly today's vote on \nthe defense appropriations bill. I will be voting for this bill, \nbecause it includes provisions that do support our national defense. \nBut I have some serious concerns about the overall level of spending, \nas well as some other issues that I feel should be addressed in \nnegotiations during the conference.\n  On the positive side, this bill contains $150 million to fund the \nNunn-Lugar-Domenici amendment, which will strengthen the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram. As I have said a number of times on this floor, Nunn-Lugar is \nexactly the kind of investment in our security that we should be \nmaking. It is far cheaper to destroy Russian missiles and bombers now \nthan to make new expenditures on a strategic deterrent or a missile \ndefense system against them later.\n  The strengthened Nunn-Lugar program will also help us prevent the \nspread and use of weapons of mass destruction by terrorists. A \nterrorist nuclear, chemical, or biological attack is perhaps our worst \nsecurity nightmare today.\n  Moreover, this defense bill contains $69 million for operating, \nmaintaining, and upgrading the Nation's full fleet of B-52 bombers. The \ndefense authorization bill rightly prohibited retirement of B-52's \nbefore Russia ratifies the START II Treaty. I am hopeful that the House \nwill agree to the Senate's very modest investment. It will enable the \nAir Force to abide by the authorization bill's directive to retain this \ncombat-proven force of long-range bombers.\n  On the other hand, given our bipartisan commitment to a balanced \nbudget, the overall funding level in this bill is not sustainable. It \nexceeds the President's budget request by $10 billion. The $6 billion \ndownpayment for unrequested ships and aircraft alone in the bill will \ncreate a funding crunch in\n\n[[Page S8069]]\n\nthe years to come. To make expansive procurement decisions as if they \nhave no consequences for deficit reduction is not responsible.\n  Second, my colleagues will not be surprised to learn that I am \ntroubled by the bill's commitment of $808 million for national missile \ndefense, $300 million above the administration's request. This \nadditional funding is unwanted, unneeded, unfrugal, and unwise.\n  So I will reluctantly vote for this bill in order to move the \nappropriations process forward. Yet I will closely examine the \nconference report on the bill. I urge the conferees to make it more \nfiscally responsible than the versions passed by either the Senate or \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 5 \nminutes, equally divided, under the control of the two managers.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in a few minutes, the Senate will vote on \nthe final passage of this bill. I wanted to use this opportunity to \nadvise my colleagues of my complete support of this measure. Yes, this \nbill provides more funding than sought by the administration, but it is \nat a level approved by the Congress in the budget resolution. \nFurthermore, while it is $1.3 billion more than appropriated last year, \nit still falls short in keeping up with inflation.\n  Mr. President, it is a very good bill. It funds the priorities of the \nadministration. It contains no controversial riders on social policy. \nIt redresses shortfalls identified by our military leaders. It provides \nfunding to cover overseas contingencies, and it meets the needs of our \nfield commanders, who have identified many items that they require to \nimprove the quality of the lives of our men and women in uniform.\n  Mr. President, it is a bipartisan bill. Yesterday, the Senate agreed \non approximately 60 amendments and, by my count, nearly half were \nDemocratic amendments. This should come as no surprise to my \ncolleagues. The Appropriations Committee, particularly this \nsubcommittee, has a long tradition of bipartisanship.\n  If I may, I would like to take my hat off to our chairman, who has \ndone an extraordinary job in preparing the recommendations in the bill \nand managing it on the floor. Mr. President, there is no finer floor \nmanager in the Senate than my friend from Alaska, Ted Stevens.\n  I thank the staff on both sides of the aisle for their help in this \nvery difficult legislation. A particular note of thanks to the staff \ndirector, Steve Cortese, for his leadership. On my staff, a special \nthanks to Lt. Col. Tina Homeland, who kept her eye on health programs \nfor me this year. Also Emelie East of the subcommittee who provided \ntireless energy in keeping track of all of the amendments and assuring \ntheir adoption.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to support this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this bill does reflect the partnership \nthat the Senator from Hawaii and I have shared for many years. I can \nassure all Senators that this approach is a bipartisan approach and \nwill be followed throughout the conference on this bill with the House.\n  I will make further statements after the vote, if I may. At this \ntime, I yield the remainder of my time and ask for final passage of \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I thank the Senate for this overwhelming \nbipartisan support of this bill. It is a bill that I think meets the \nneeds as best we can of our defense forces and maintains the defense of \nthis country. This year we had a record number of requests to our \nsubcommittee from Members of the Senate and, I might say, also from \nMembers of the House that we had to consider. Were it not for this fine \nworking relationship that the Senator from Hawaii and I have, it would \nbe impossible to deal with a bill of this magnitude in a 24-hour \nperiod.\n  But we have done that, and there are a number of people who deserve \nto be identified now who have worked hard in the preparation of this \nbill. The Senator from Hawaii has mentioned the people on his side of \nthe aisle. This team works together on a bipartisan basis on the staff \nlevel, too. So I want to note the contributions of the subcommittee \nstaff on our side. We have this long record of bipartisan work \ntogether: Steve Cortese, who is our staff director; Charlie Houy, staff \ndirector on the other side; Peter Lennon, Jay Kimmitt, Mary Marshall, \nJim Morhard, John Young, Sid Ashworth, Susan Hogan, Mazie Mattson, \nJustin Weddle, Candice Rogers, and Emelie East.\n  This year we were assisted by two individuals who were loaned to our \ncommittee. As I said, we have just had a tremendous workload this year. \nWe have Darrell Roberson from the Air Force and Mike Gillmore from GAO \nwho worked with us. During the floor debate yesterday, I was pleased to \nbe able to have two of the high school interns from my office who have \nobserved our work and were helpful to me yesterday, Brad Brunsdon from \nFairbanks and Meegan Condon of Petersburg.\n  This was my first opportunity to manage a bill in the Chamber since \nthe retirement of Senator Dole, and I want to express my thanks to our \nnew leader, Trent Lott, for his unwavering efforts to help us get this \nbill passed. I thank the Senate for its patience.\n  Additionally, we have received full consideration from many Members. \nWe started out yesterday morning, I believe, with about 150 amendments, \nand they have all been handled in one fashion or another in order to \nget to where we are today. I do thank Senator McCain and Ann Sauer of \nhis staff, who have worked with us this year to review amendments to \nmake certain that we would not meet objections to them in terms of \ntheir presentation to the Senate here on a unanimous-consent basis. \nToday, I have Megan Curry of Juneau and Beth Pozzi of Anchorage with me \nin the Chamber.\n  I am pleased to once again thank the Senate for the support of this \nbill. I do think the American people should know that we have firm \nsupport here in the Senate now on a bipartisan basis to maintain the \nlevel of expenditures which we believe are necessary. I hope we can get \nthe bill into conference and back as soon as possible, because we want \ntime to work with the White House to make sure that the executive \nbranch is willing to share with us this burden of maintaining the \nfunding of our military throughout the world.\n  Mr. President, I now move to reconsider the vote the Senate has just \ntaken to pass this bill.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S8070]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Before the two managers of the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill leave the Chamber, I want to say again today, as I \ndid yesterday, how much I appreciate the outstanding work that they \ndid. We have just seen an unbelievable accomplishment, for this bill to \nhave been completed in 24 hours, with tremendous effort yesterday. They \nobviously are two of the very best managers we have in the Senate, and \non behalf of the Senate I thank them for their good work and hope that \ntheir example will be followed on other appropriations bills and with \nthe bill that we are about to begin consideration of.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/18/senate-section/article/S8065-5", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8070-S8076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, WORK OPPORTUNITY, AND MEDICAID RESTRUCTURING \n                              ACT OF 1996\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate shall now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1956, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1956) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to \n     section 202(a) of the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 1997.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are now ready to go to the reconciliation \nbill. The chairman of the Finance Committee, the Senator from Delaware, \nMr. Roth, is here, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr. Domenici, \nis here, and we have the ranking member, the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. \nExon, here also. So we are ready to begin the debate.\n  I hope we can make progress and reach some agreement on limiting \ntime. We need to complete this legislation by noon tomorrow. We have 20 \nhours of debate under the rules, plus amendments that could be voted on \neven after that 20 hours. So we have a lot of work to do between now \nand 12 o'clock tomorrow. But if we can continue to cooperate as we have \nbeen doing this week from both sides of the aisle, I am convinced we \ncan do it, and that is what we should do. We have the distinguished \nranking member of the Finance Committee here, the Senator from New \nYork, Mr. Moynihan, here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time between now and 1 p.m. be \nequally divided for opening statements only and that the majority \nleader be recognized at 1 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first let me say to the distinguished \nmajority leader, we will be working together with the Agriculture \nCommittee and Finance Committee leadership, and we will try to live up \nto the Senator's desire that we finish this bill by noon tomorrow. I \nwant to say, frankly, I do not see why we cannot.\n  When the majority leader gets the floor, I assume one of the early \nitems of business will be to strike the Medicaid provision. That might \nbe debated, but there is an hour limit even on that, and then the bill \nwill be a welfare bill.\n  I think everybody should know that we have not seen very many \namendments. Neither has the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. But this is a reconciliation bill, so it is not so easy to \nput an amendment together that meets the test of an amendment to a \nreconciliation bill. For those who have them, the sooner we can see \nthem, the sooner we can analyze them from the standpoint of points of \norder, or we may be helpful in some respects. So that is how I see the \nensuing time. I thank the majority leader very much.\n\n  Having said that, I want to publicly first thank the two \ndistinguished chairmen, the chairman of the Finance Committee, Chairman \nRoth, and the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Chairman Lugar, \nand the ranking members. These two chairmen and their committees have \ncrafted the legislation that meets the spending requirements given in \nthe 1997 resolution adopted earlier this spring. Both of these chairmen \nwill be here during the consideration of this legislation and will help \nmanage amendments that might be offered in their respective parts of \nthe bill.\n  I also thank Senator Exon, ranking member of the Budget Committee, \nwho voted with all the Republicans on the Budget Committee on Tuesday \nto report this bill from our committee to the Senate floor. I am fully \ncognizant of the qualification he attached. That was that in fact the \nMedicaid provisions were going to be stricken. I have, just once again, \nto the best of my ability indicated we are pursuing that. The Senate \nwill have to vote nonetheless, and the Senate will make that \ndetermination. I assume it will be almost unanimous that we do that; \nperhaps not unanimous, but overwhelming.\n  Mr. EXON. If I may speak there for just moment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Certainly.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend for his kind remarks. I think it is \nimportant we move this matter along. I would like to add my plea to \nthose on this side and those on the other side as well, to please give \nus the amendments that you have in mind as early as possible, hopefully \nmaybe before noon. If we can get a list of the serious amendments that \nare going to be offered, then we are going to be in a better position, \nnot only to fashion this bill that may eventually receive a substantial \nnumber of votes if some amendments can be agreed to, but also expedite \nthe process. So I pledge my cooperation to every extent I can to the \nchairman of my committee, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and \nthe ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee. I think the four of us \nworking together with our usual understanding and cooperation can move \nthis matter along. That is my desire.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my colleague.\n  Finally, I want to thank our former colleague and former Republican \nleader of the Senate, Senator Dole, who tried not once, not even twice, \nbut three times in this Congress to get welfare reform enacted. I \nbelieve his leadership will be felt even in his absence from the \nChamber today, as this legislation moves forward and, hopefully, this \ntime secures the signature of the President of the United States after \nthese earlier vetoes by the President of the United States.\n  First, for those who may be watching this process, let me briefly \nexplain what we are about to do today. After the President vetoed the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995 last winter, and after the failure to find \ncommon ground on a plan to achieve balance in our budget, the process \nmoved on and Congress again put together another budget blueprint that \nachieved balance in 2002. The blueprint, known as Concurrent Resolution \non the Budget for Fiscal Year 1997, was adopted early in June. The \nbudget resolution does not go to the President for his signature, but \nrather directs the action of the authorizing and spending committees on \nhow to proceed for the remainder of the year to come into compliance \nwith that budget blueprint and resolution. The budget blueprint also \nincluded instructions to 11 Senate committees to make changes in \nlegislation in entitlement programs within their jurisdiction to cause \nfundamental reform of these programs, but also at the same time to slow \nthe spending and achieve the deficit reduction envisioned in that \nbudget plan.\n  Today we begin debate on the first of three reconciliation bills that \nwere prescribed by that budget resolution. The reconciliation bills are \nvery special because they have protections and procedures that the \nBudget Act established for their consideration. And because of the need \nto have them enacted to implement that budget blueprint, they receive \nsome very special consideration and are immune from some of the rules, \nand some of the privileges\n\n[[Page S8071]]\n\nthat Senators have are denied with reference to these kinds of bills.\n\n  This first one addresses two major areas of public concern, welfare \nand the escalating costs of Medicaid. The bill before us at this moment \nmakes very needed and fundamental reforms to our welfare system, a \nsystem that has clearly failed not only the American public as \ntaxpayers, but also the very individuals and families and children that \nthe system was supposed to help. Obviously, much more will be said by \ndistinguished Senators on both sides of the aisle as to how that will \nbe done in this bill.\n  The bill before us also makes many needed changes in the escalating \nMedicaid Program, but obviously that will not be long before the Senate \nfor, hopefully early this afternoon, since it is the wish of the \nmajority and the leadership here, it will be stricken by will of the \nSenate.\n  Federal spending under this bill before us today will still increase \nfor both Medicaid and welfare from nearly $270 to $350 billion. That \nmight surprise some. If we were to enact both of them, both of those \nprograms would increase over the next 6 years from $270 to $350 \nbillion. But compared to what would happen without these reforms, the \nbill would save the American taxpayers $126 billion. We are not going \nto get all of that because the portion that would be forthcoming under \nMedicaid will be stricken, but I believe there would be $56 billion \nleft--Senator Roth?\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As the savings over the projected costs of the welfare \nprogram in all of its ramifications as contained in this bill.\n  So, as we begin this debate, let me remind my colleagues that, \nbecause this is a privileged measure, a bill whose consideration is \ngoverned by rules established in the Budget Act, the amendments are \nlimited both in time and scope. The total time on the bill under the \nstatute is 20 hours. I would say right up front we, on this side, do \nnot think we should use 20 hours. In fact, we do not believe we need \nmuch of our 10 hours allotted under this bill.\n  First-degree amendments get 2 hours, and second-degree amendments 1 \nhour, which is equally divided regardless of how much time is left on \neach side--an anomaly, but that is how it is. So if we had only an hour \nleft and an amendment is forthcoming, we get half the time on the \namendment. That is the way the timing is done on these amendments. We \nintend to move this along, but not to deny Members the opportunity to \nget their case before the Senate.\n  Also, I should remind everyone--and we will hear more about this as \nthe debate unfolds--that amendments may not violate the Byrd rule, \nnamed for our distinguished colleague from West Virginia. This rule is \nvery restrictive and is designed to maintain reconciliation bills as \ntruly budget-focused bills. So I ask that Senators work with the \nleadership and Budget Committee staffs to determine if amendments \nviolate the Byrd rule. If they violate the Byrd rule, you can offer \nthem, nonetheless they would be subject to a point of order and that \nmeans you would have to get 60 votes of the U.S. Senate to pass them \nover the Byrd rule, which limits their adoption.\n  I should also say, the Budget Act does provide for the waiver or any \npoint of order that might lie against a nongermane amendment, and that \nis a very, very heavy-handed test in this case, or an amendment that \nviolates the Byrd rule. But that waiver requires 60 affirmative votes, \nas I have just indicated.\n  Shortly, I will discuss some of the substantive provisions, but I \nwill not do that on this bill until the distinguished chairman and the \nranking member on the Budget Committee have had a chance to talk about \nit. I am hopeful most of the substance can be handled by the committee \nchairmen. I will be here to help them move this along and to make sure \nwe are as fair as possible with reference to the many procedural \nimplications of a reconciliation bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, if I understand the unanimous-consent \nrequest, there is 1 hour equally divided between the two sides up to 1 \no'clock; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two hours ten minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, at this time, I yield myself 12 minutes of \nthat time. Following my remarks, I yield the remaining time, up to the \n1 o'clock time, to my friend and colleague from New York, the ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee. We will be working jointly on the \nvarious amendments. I am grateful that both he and the chairman of the \nFinance Committee will be working jointly with us on this matter today.\n  Mr. President, as the Democratic leader on the Budget Committee, I \ncome to the Senate floor today with some truly mixed emotions. I am \nmost relieved that the Republican majority has decided that they will \nstrike the Medicaid language from the reconciliation bill. It was with \nthat understanding that I joined my colleague and chairman, Senator \nDomenici, in reporting out this bill to the floor.\n  Obviously, cooler heads in the Republican fever swamp prevailed. I \ntrust this will be reflected in the vote. I salute my friend, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, for his role. Might I \nsuggest that Senator Domenici's good counsel had much to do with the \ndecision to seek a more productive and less combative path. But I say \nsomewhat wistfully that I wish his voice of reason had not been drowned \nout earlier in the budget process.\n  For all their fluster and bluster, the Republican majority will walk \naway from the 104th Congress with precious little deficit reduction to \nshow for it. There is no bipartisan 7-year budget plan. Far from it. \nRepublicans made a lot of noise about balancing the budget. In the end, \nthe Democrats made a lot more sense.\n  At this time, I renew a plea that I have made oftentimes, and that \nis, in view of the fact that we have an economy today that is moving \nahead progressively and well, with little or no inflation concerns, I \nsimply hope in due time, maybe sometime in the next couple of weeks, \nthe Federal Reserve Board will recognize the situation and maybe begin \nto ease at least slightly the interest rate problem which continues to \nbother many sectors of America, including the stock market.\n  I do not think our decisions should be directly made here on what \nhappens in any certain phase of our economy. But the facts of the \nmatter are, as I just alluded to the fact we have no 7-year balanced \nbudget plan. We do not have that because the Republican majority and \ntheir leadership in the House and the Senate have refused to meet with \nthe President to see if we cannot come up with a bipartisan compromise.\n  I have said time and time again, and I am not sure that Americans \ntotally understand it--sometimes I wonder if the news media understands \nit from the reports I have been reading--that both sides have agreed \nbasically to make the cuts that are necessary to balance the budget in \n7 years. It can be done, it should be done, and I appeal, once again, \nnow that the Republican leadership of the House and the Senate have \ncome out of their cocoon, to recognize this is the time to strike. \nLet's get together. Let's let the Republican leadership in the House \nand the Senate take up the offer of the President of the United States \nto meet and come up with a 7-year balanced budget plan.\n\n  I know there is a great deal of haste right now, Mr. President, to \nget out of town, to leave things here because we want to go about \ncampaigning. Certainly, I believe that there is nothing that could \nbetter serve the United States of America--the great two-party system \nthat has served us, with all its warts, quite well over the years than \nif we can, before we leave here, have a balanced budget agreement. It \nis clearly within our grasp if we would just get on, put aside some of \nthe egos and come to some kind of understanding. I make that plea once \nagain.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the Republican majority had little \nchoice but to yank the Medicaid portion of this bill out, as we and the \nPresident had suggested. One did not have to read the tea leaves to see \nthat it was certainly headed for a veto without that change. It was a \nplan hatched by the far right that reneged on the promises of providing \nhealth coverage to low-income Americans and those most in need of it--\nthe elderly, children, and the disabled. Many of the Governors could \nnot\n\n[[Page S8072]]\n\naccept the plan because funding did not automatically adjust for \nchanges in enrollment. I am glad that this unreasonable scheme has been \nlaid to rest.\n  Now that the shackles of the Medicaid plan have been released, we \nhave a good opportunity to work together and fashion a bipartisan \nwelfare reform bill that will win not only the approval of the Congress \nbut the signature of the President as well and I believe would have a \ngood chance of receiving near universal support from the American \npeople as well.\n  I compliment the majority for making some substantive and key changes \nin their previous welfare plan. For example, child care resources that \nwere woefully lacking in their earlier efforts have been shored up, at \nleast some. But the majority should know also that those of us on this \nside do not plan to spend the next 20 hours singing hosannas to their \nbill. We intend to offer amendments that we believe could significantly \nimprove this bill and make it acceptable to a broad spectrum of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle.\n  I add, I would have preferred to deal with welfare reform outside of \nthe reconciliation bill. Welfare reform is a policy issue, not a \nbudgetary matter. In fact, there are no budgetary savings. I emphasize \nagain, Mr. President, there are no budgetary savings from what most \npeople believe as welfare. I, of course, reference aid to families with \ndependent children. The savings in this bill come from food stamps, \nchild nutrition, denying SSI and food stamp benefits to most legal \nimmigrants.\n  I hope in the future the majority will not feel the need to hide \nbehind reconciliation skirts when every tough issue comes down the \npike. I point out, too, that last year, we were able to come to a \nbipartisan agreement on welfare reform outside of the context of the \nbudget reconciliation.\n  I emphasize once again, Mr. President, I think that while we are \ngoing to do this, making this part of the budget bill and the \nreconciliation process is not the way that this should have been \nhandled. It should have been a freestanding bill. It should have come \nout of the Finance Committee which, I think, would have been the proper \ncourse of action. But, obviously, for many reasons that was not to be.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a great deal in this Congress about \nreturning power to the States. Under the rubric of devolution, we have \nseen some thoughtful proposals, such as restrictions on unfunded \nmandates and others that are played bad, like the Medicaid plan.\n  But the clear signal we are getting from the townhall meetings and \nthe State houses is the need for greater flexibility in dealing with \nthese problems. I believe the Democrats answered that challenge in our \nupdated ``Work First'' welfare plan that will shortly be offered as an \namendment to this measure. It gives the States the flexibility to \nconsolidate and streamline welfare operations yet protects children and \nsaves $50 billion in the process.\n  As a former two-term Governor of Nebraska, I have more, Mr. \nPresident, than a passing acquaintance with the problems that are faced \ndaily by the Nation's Governors. I have done my able best to help them \nwhere I could. I was an original cosponsor of the unfunded mandates \nbill. But as sympathetic as I may be to our Governors, we must ensure \nthat welfare reform does not just meet their needs, their needs being \nthe Governors. It must continue to meet the needs of the innocent \nchildren who have become pawns, unfortunately, in this debate.\n  In this regard, there are still areas of concern about the Republican \npackage. I will not address all of them today. I am not wedded to any \nparticular amendment, but I do want to touch upon a few concerns today \nthat have a common thread. That common thread, that important thread, \nis kids in need. Children should not be an afterthought in welfare \nreform. Protecting children should be right up there with requiring \nable-bodied men and women to earn their keep.\n  The first issue in the voucher program is important. The Republican \nmeasure prohibits--prohibits, Mr. President--any assistance once a \nparent has been on the welfare rolls for a time limit to be determined \nby the individual States. This, Mr. President, could be anywhere from \n60 days at a minimum to 5 years at the outside.\n  Under the Republican bill, no vouchers would be allowed for families \nreaching the time limits set by the individual States. They would be \nlocked in to whatever State they were a resident of. In my book, this \nis draconian. We should not cut and run on our poor kids. Depriving a \nchild of the bare necessities in life, such as food and clothing and \nshelter, serves no useful purpose. The Government is not punishing the \nparents; it is the children who would suffer. We should not visit the \nsins of the parents upon their children. I see no reason why we cannot \ndesign some sort of a voucher or noncash aid for these children. Under \nthe Democratic work first plan, the States would provide a minimal \nsafety net. That would be an enormous improvement to this bill.\n  My second criticism involves the inflexibility of the Republican plan \nduring hard economic times. This bill cries out for more flexibility \nduring recessions. Under the preferred Democratic proposal, children \nare entitled to assistance based on their household incomes, not \nwhether the States have exhausted their funding due to increased needs \nduring a recession or other uncontrollable events. This would be a \nreasonable and a desirable addition to the welfare reform package and \nsomething that I hope the Senate will accept.\n  My third concern, Mr. President, revolves around the food stamps and \nthe optional block granting of the program. It is a good idea to \nencourage electronic benefit transfers and to reduce fraud and abuse in \nthe Food Stamp Program as is called for in the Democrat work first \nplan. We should throw the book at violators, but I cannot say that I am \nas understanding about the Republicans' insistence on block granting \nfood stamps.\n  It is evident to this Senator that States devote radically different \nlevels of effort to our needy children. They do not treat them with the \nsame level of compassion. By removing the Federal entitlement and block \ngranting food stamps, we could knowingly exacerbate these differences. \nI am also concerned that block granting does not completely take into \naccount the changes in the caseloads or regional economic trends.\n  Mr. President, many thoughtful observers have also suggested that the \ninstigation of block granting would trigger a so-called race to the \nbottom. Let us understand that term. We are very much concerned that \nthe way this is written now, it would almost guarantee a so-called race \nto the bottom among the States seeking to lower services to the poor so \nas not to attract more of them. Even worse, some States may reject the \ndwindling block grants and drop the whole burden on to the narrow \nshoulders of the counties and the local governments below them. We \nshould not be abetting such a shirking of responsibility if it should \nhappen.\n\n  Mr. President, there are, of course, many other issues, bones of \ncontention, in this legislation that we will be addressing. Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle will be talking about them and, undoubtedly, \noffering amendments. But I do believe that, with a few modifications, \nwe could have a bill that sits well with both sides and with the \nAmerican people. To pass their test, it will have to be a bipartisan \neffort that requires work while still protecting children. Those are \nthe tricky waters that we still have to navigate over the next few \nhours. I trust that we will be successful.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield it, as I \nhave previously indicated, to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Who seeks recognition? Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I think, in the interest of symmetry and \nthe fact of seniority and the overwhelming presence of the \nchairmanship, that the Senator from Delaware should speak now. In any \nevent, I would like to hear him in the hopes that I might think of \nsomething to reflect upon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Delaware seeking time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may take.\n  Mr. President, this is the beginning of the end to the lengthy debate \nin the\n\n[[Page S8073]]\n\n104th Congress about the current welfare system. The issue of welfare \nreform has been frequently and passionately debated over these past \nmonths, and rightly so. The effects and consequences of the welfare \nsystem in some way touch us all.\n  Mr. President, it would be difficult to estimate exactly how many \nthousands of hours the Congress has devoted to this issue over the past \nmonths. The various committees in the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives have taken testimony from Governors, Members of \nCongress advocating their own particular brand of reform, Cabinet \nofficials, outside experts, advocacy groups, and so forth.\n  But of all of these, perhaps the clearest message for welfare reform \nI have found comes from a newspaper article about Sharon Stewart, a 33-\nyear-old single mother who has been on welfare for nearly 12 years. In \na Richmond Times-Dispatch article last month, Ms. Stewart was quoted as \npraising Virginia's new 2-year time limit on welfare benefits. She \nsaid, ``I feel like I can actually accomplish something again. This is \nsomething I'm doing and nobody else is just giving me a handout.''\n  With simple eloquence, Ms. Stewart told the Times-Dispatch, ``this \nprogram should have been in effect when I [first] went on AFDC. It \nmeans people''--it means people--``are going to be independent. At \nfirst they're real scared and kind of back off, but I believe it will \nhelp in the long run.''\n  In the same article, Tracy James, a mother of four children, also \nvoiced her support for the time limit on benefits. She summed up the \nsituation better than any of the experts when she stated, ``The old law \nwas too easy. I settled for it. [Now] it's either get yourself together \nor you're just stuck.''\n  Eloise Anderson, the very distinguished director of the California \nDepartment of Social Services, recently responded to a reporter who \nasked whether time limits were a form of ``tough love.'' Miss Anderson \nresponded, ``It's the real world.''\n  Mr. President, this is the fundamental philosophy upon which our \nwelfare reform package is based. We will help families through the \ncrisis which forced them into poverty. But that assistance is only \ntemporary, and they must again help themselves.\n  Welfare reform will restore the dignity to families who want more \nthan to ``just settle'' for what the welfare system will give them.\n  The current AFDC program, as it was designed in the 1930's, abandoned \nmany families long ago as a statistic of long-term dependency in \ncontemporary society. The current welfare system has failed the very \nfamilies it was intended to serve. Look at the record. The record \nspeaks for itself. Unfortunately, in 1965, something like 3.3 million \nchildren received AFDC benefits. In 1990, more than 7.7 million \nchildren received AFDC. This growth occurred even though the total \nnumber of children in the United States had declined--I underscore \n``had declined''--by nearly 5 million between 1965 and 1990. In 1994, \nnearly 9.6 million children received AFDC. Last year, the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services estimated that 12 million would \nreceive AFDC benefits within 10 years under the current welfare system.\n  I think it is clear that the present system has not worked. To the \ncontrary, rather than giving a lifting hand and helping people back to \nwork, back to the mainstream, we find the record is consistently an \nincrease in the number of families, the number of children, caught in \nthe web of welfare.\n  If the present system was working well for children, we would, \nfrankly, not be here today. I do not think anyone wants to make a claim \nthat the existing system is good for children.\n  While the present welfare system is full of excuses, the welfare \nreform legislation being presented to the American people today is a \nbold challenge. While the present system quietly accepts the dependency \nof more than 9 million children, our proposal speaks loudly to them and \ninsists they, too, are among the heirs to the blessing of this great \nNation.\n  The key to their success will not be found in Washington, but, \nfrankly, in the timeless values of family and work.\n  Mr. President, 90 percent of the children on AFDC live without one of \ntheir parents. Only a fraction of welfare families are engaged in work. \nThe current welfare system has cheated these children of what they need \nmost.\n  The reason the States will succeed in welfare reform where Washington \nhas failed is because State and local officials see the faces of their \nneighbors, while Washington only sees caseload numbers. The bureaucracy \nin Washington is too detached, too removed, too far out of touch to \nreform the welfare system.\n  The opponents of welfare reform believe the States lack either the \ncompassion or the capacity or both to serve needy families. They are \nwrong.\n  We understand that there is not a singular approach to welfare \nreform. We believe if families, if children, are going to escape from \nthe vicious cycle of dependency, they must be enabled to find their own \nway out. Welfare reform is not simple because human beings are complex.\n  The goal of welfare reform for all families is for all families to \nleave welfare. The path on how they get there is not necessarily a \nstraight line. Nor, under our approach, must all families follow the \nsame path.\n  In contrast, this is precisely why Washington will never be able to \nend welfare as we know it. The existing system is designed more for the \nconvenience of the bureaucracy than for the needs of the individuals. \nWashington wants to put its one shoe on every foot. That simply does \nnot work. In the tradition of scientific management, everything must be \nreduced to bureaucratic rules, procedures, and mathematical equations. \nThis is why, if we are truly seeking the answer to end dependency, \nWashington is the wrong place to look.\n  The causes and cures of poverty involve some of the most intimate \nacts in human behavior. What many families on welfare need cannot be \nsent through the mail or reproduced in the Federal Register. There is \nno flaw in admitting we do not understand how or why individuals will \nrespond to the various incentives and sanctions present in everyday \nlife in modern society. The mistake is believing, especially after 30 \nyears of evidence to the contrary, that Washington does know how to \napply these incentives and sanctions to the lives of millions of \npeople.\n  Under the present system, welfare dependency is allowed to become a \npermanent condition. This is one of the cruelest features of the \nwelfare system because it saps the human spirit.\n  Welfare reform will help free families from the present welfare trap \nand save future generations from its affect. To do this, we must give \nthe State and local governments all of the tools they need to change \nthe existing welfare system. What works in Delaware may not work in \nVirginia or New York and the States that demonstrated that it is time \nto move beyond the waiver process.\n\n  One of the basic flaws in the existing system is, while State \nofficials have the responsibility to administer these programs, they do \nnot--I emphasize the word ``not''--have the authority they need to \neffectively run the program. That authority is dispensed by Washington \none drop at a time, and this is no longer acceptable. Waivers are no \nsubstitute for an authentic welfare reform.\n  Since President Clinton vetoed welfare reform for a second time, we \nworked with the Nation's Governors to construct a comprehensive welfare \nreform package, which, of course, included Medicaid. And a compromise \nlast February was supported by the most liberal Governor and the most \nconservative Governor and everyone in between. No one liked everything, \nbut there was something for everyone. That is the essence of \nbipartisanship.\n  When this legislation was marked up in the Finance Committee, I \nincluded more than 50 Democratic amendments. Nearly half of all the \nDemocratic amendments were incorporated into the legislation. Those \nchanges still did not gain Democrat support in committee. And, of \ncourse, the administration still refused to compromise on Medicaid. So \nwe are now separating Medicaid from the rest of the welfare package.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, although I am supporting and have \nsupported the separation, it is a matter that I personally believe need \nnot happen. The President, on several occasions, in addresses to the \nGovernors, stated that many, many people on welfare would\n\n[[Page S8074]]\n\nnot take themselves off the rolls because they were fearful that they \nwould put their children at risk, that they would not be covered by \nMedicaid. I think there is great truth in that statement. But, for that \nreason, it seems to me critically important that we deal with welfare \nand Medicaid as a package. That is what the Senate Finance Committee \ndid, and that is what we have before us. But, as I stated earlier, we \nwill be separating Medicaid from the rest of the welfare package.\n  Mr. President, we have a bipartisan bill. There is no need to look \nany further than the measure before us. Frankly, this legislation will \nlook very familiar to my colleagues, as it closely resembles H.R. 4, as \nit was passed by the Senate last September by a vote of 87 to 12. In \nother words, it is basically similar legislation which received broad \nbipartisan support when they voted for H.R. 4 last September. With \nregard to such issues as work requirements and time limits, this \nlegislation is nearly identical to the Senate-passed bill.\n  Mr. President, it has been 41 months since President Clinton outlined \nhis welfare reform goals to the American people. Welfare reform was not \nenacted in 1993 or in 1994. Welfare reform is not about claiming \npolitical credit. We need to enact welfare reform for families like \nthose of Sharon Stewart, Tracy James, and their children. If we do \nnothing, more children will fall into the trap of dependency. That is a \ncertainty of what the current system will bring.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. ASHCROFT assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield to myself whatever time I may \nrequire. I will express, once again, my admiration and gratitude for \nthe tone of thoughtful inquiry which the chairman brings to these \ndiscussions. We will not agree today. We have not in a whole year in \nthis regard, but we certainly are trying to lay out arguments and \ninformation as best we understand it. I think we know where we are \ngoing today, but it does not preclude us from one last effort. There is \nstill hope. You may yet change your mind, but I do not think so today.\n  Mr. ROTH. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am happy to do it.\n  Mr. ROTH. I want to say what an honor and privilege it has been to \nwork on these matters with the distinguished Senator from New York. \nThere is no one on either side of the aisle who brings greater \nknowledge, understanding, and depth than Senator Moynihan. Now, \nfrankly, sometimes his conclusions are wrong, but that is \nunderstandable, and that is what makes for the democratic process. But \nI do want to say that working with them, in an effort to bring a \nsolution, to be compassionate, to take care of the needs of the many \nchildren who are without is our common goal. I know he seeks that with \nall his intelligence and being.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as I rise today, I find myself thinking \nof the passage with which Hannah Arendt begins her classic work, ``The \nOrigins of Totalitarianism.'' She speaks of the disasters of the First \nWorld War, and then the Second World War, and now the prospects of a \nthird, final encounter between the two remaining world powers. She \nsays, ``This moment of anticipation is like the calm that settles after \nall hopes have died.''\n  If I sound subdued today, I hope it will be taken in that light, \nrather than any diminished sense of the importance of what we are about \nto do, because we are all somehow subdued today. The Senate floor is \nall but empty. I see four Senators.\n  The lobbies are empty. There is no outcry against what we are doing. \nTwo fine editorials appeared this morning in the Washington Post and \nthe New York Times saying, ``Do not do this.'' But those are rare \nvoices at this moment.\n  We learn in the press that the President is concerned that there be \nvouchers made available for diapers. This is commendable, but scarcely \na suggestion that something fundamental is about to happen. What is \nabout to happen is we are going to repeal title IV-A of the Social \nSecurity Act, the provision established in 1935 in the act, aid to \nfamilies with dependent children.\n  This will be the first time in our history that we have repealed a \ncore provision of the Social Security Act. Further, we are choosing to \nrepeal the provision for children. It is as if we are going to live \nonly for this moment, and let the future be lost.\n  I said that there were few voices. Actually, there is one unified \nvoice: that of every national religious group and faith-based charity. \nBut we seem unable or unwilling to listen. They all oppose ending the \nentitlement. Catholic Charities USA and the Catholic bishops, \nespecially, the National Council of Churches, Bread for the World, have \npersisted in this matter. Other organizations, as I say, are once again \nsilent. Having briefly aroused themselves, they have sunk back into \napathy, or resignation--or agreement with what is about to be done. We \nwill not know if we do not hear.\n  Yesterday, Members of Congress received a letter from Father Fred \nKammer, president of Catholic Charities USA, who wrote:\n\n       The welfare reform proposal before you reflects ignorance \n     and prejudice far more than the experience of this Nation's \n     poorest working and welfare families. This bill would end the \n     basic guarantee of protection to our neediest families, and, \n     in the words of Milwaukee's Archbishop, Rembert Weakland, \n     OSB, nullify ``America's 60-year covenant with its poor \n     children and those who nurture them.'' It would also punish \n     children born to welfare parents, legal immigrants, and \n     desperately hungry citizens.\n       Welfare reform is acutely needed in this country, reform \n     which is designed genuinely to move people who can do so from \n     welfare to work. Today's proposals are largely a sham \n     designed to appease the ignorant and to pander to our worst \n     prejudices in an election year. There is little here to \n     recommend to believers, for whom Jesus of Nazareth said, \n     ``Whatever you do to the least of my sisters and brothers, \n     you do to me.''\n\n  And then Father Kammer says:\n\n       Please stop this so-called ``welfare reform'' now lest \n     election and budget politics shred the fabric of this \n     Nation's protections and supports for its most vulnerable \n     families.\n       Again in the words of Archbishop Weakland, ``This is not \n     welfare reform, but welfare repeal.''\n       The Nation, its historians, and its poorest families will \n     little remember what you say here, but they will long \n     remember what you do here.\n       Sincerely, Fred Kammer, S.J. President, Catholic Charities \n     USA.\n\n  This is an extraordinary statement by the president of one of the \nNation's leading charities. But then he knows too well the profound \nimpact this legislation will have on poverty and on children.\n  It is children we are talking about. I have been trying for most of \nthis Congress to describe the consequences for children in ending \nsupport after 5 years. The average AFDC recipient will receive benefits \nfor 13 years.\n  Ten months ago, as the distinguished chairman has observed, on \nSeptember 19, 1995, the Senate passed a welfare bill providing just \nthat. That bill, H.R. 4, as amended, was, as the chairman just said, \nnearly identical to the bill now before us. Again, to quote the \nchairman, ``It was basically similar legislation.'' At that time, we \nhad no data before us to give us a sense of what we were doing. There \nwere 11 Democrats who voted against that bill--11. I hope one day we \nmight see their names listed in a place of honor.\n\n  A few weeks later I learned that there was, in fact, in the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, as you would expect, an \nanalysis of H.R. 4 that addressed itself to the poverty impact of the \nbill.\n  Then on October 24, at the first and only meeting of the House-Senate \nconference on the legislation, I put it this way. I said:\n\n       Just how many millions of infants we will put to the sword \n     is not yet clear. There is dickering to do. In April, the \n     Department of Health and Human Services reported that when \n     fully implemented, the time limits in the House bill would \n     cut off benefits for 4,800,000 children. At that time, the \n     Department simply assumed that the administration would \n     oppose repeal. But the administration has since decided to \n     support repeal. HHS has done a report on the impact of the \n     Senate bill on children, but the White House will not release \n     it. Those involved will take this disgrace to their graves.\n\n  During the following 2 days, the administration denied the existence \nof the HHS report. But then, on October 27, on the front page of the \nLos Angeles Times, there was an article by Elizabeth Shogren entitled, \n``Welfare Report Clashes with Clinton, Senate.''\n  It began:\n\n       A sweeping welfare reform plan approved by the Senate and \n     embraced by President Clinton would push an estimated 1.1 \n     million children into poverty and make conditions\n\n[[Page S8075]]\n\n     worse for those already under the poverty line, according to \n     a Clinton Administration analysis not released to the public.\n\n  A subsequent administration analysis of the conference report on H.R. \n4, after the House and Senate provisions had been reconciled, estimated \nthat it would plunge 1\\1/2\\ million children into poverty.\n  On December 22, 1996, when the conference report on that bill came \nback to the Senate, every Democrat save one voted ``no.''\n  Now, with these facts in front of them, Senators on our side--and not \nonly on our side--voted almost unanimously against the bill.\n  I should point out that in some ways the bill before us, although \nbasically identical to last year's legislation, as the chairman of the \nFinance Committee has said, is even worse in that it provides for very \nharsh measures against legal immigrants who are noncitizens. The \nCongressional Budget Office makes this point in its report on the \nmeasure. It says:\n\n       Chapter 4 would limit the eligibility of legal aliens for \n     public assistance programs. It would explicitly make most \n     immigrants ineligible for SSI and food stamp benefits. \n     Savings would also materialize in other programs that are not \n     mentioned by name.\n\n  This must be noted as a regression of genuine importance. In the \nbeginning of this century, Western nations began the practice, and \nafter a while, by treaty, international labor conventions, and such \nlike, of extending social services available in a particular country to \nlegal visitors or immigrants from another country. It was seen as a \npart of the comity of nations, part of the standard civilization which \nwe had attained.\n  Now, sir, I had the opportunity to speak with our distinguished \nSecretary of Health and Human Services this morning, the Honorable \nDonna E. Shalala. She tells me that this bill will cut off some 200,000 \nlegal immigrants currently receiving supplemental security income \nbecause of severe disabilities--cut them off. It will cut off women \nreceiving services in battered women clinics, said Dr. Shalala. Things \nthat civilized nations do not do, save perhaps when carried away, as \nFather Kammer said, by ignorance and prejudice.\n  Now to the present legislation. I recall the long and difficult \neffort to get the executive branch to follow its normal practice of \nproviding a report on legislation saying this is what this legislation \nwill do, this is why we support it or do not support it, or whatever.\n  Since May of this year, Representative Sam Gibbons, ranking member of \nthe Committee on Ways and Means, and I have been asking for a similar \nanalysis of the poverty impact of the new Republican welfare bill. We \nasked for the poverty effects because they have a clarity for Members \nthat perhaps more diffuse issues, such the operation of time limits. It \nis a usage with which we are familiar. Last winter, when Democratic \nSenators found out what the effects of H.R. 4 were, having voted for \nthe bill, they turned around and voted against it. The President, \nhaving indicated he would support the bill, turned around and vetoed \nit.\n  So, since May of this year, Representative Gibbons and I have been \nasking for a similar analysis of the effects of the new Republican \nwelfare bill. Despite three separate written requests, no report has \nbeen forthcoming. But we did receive a letter on June 26 from Jacob L. \nLew, the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in \nwhich he wrote:\n\n       As you recall, the administration's analysis of the \n     conference report on H.R. 4 estimated that it would move 1.5 \n     million children below the poverty line. Based on that \n     analysis, it appears that improvements in the Roth/Archer \n     bill would mean that somewhat fewer children would fall below \n     the poverty line. But many of the factors that would move \n     children below the poverty line remain the same in both \n     bills.\n\n  So we have before us a bill that in the administration's own judgment \nwould impoverish over 1 million children. But I remind you, Mr. \nPresident, we do not have an analysis, and we read in this Sunday's New \nYork Times, by Robert Pear, an eminently respected reporter in this \narea, that the White House had given instructions to HHS that there was \nto be no report. I had not ever thought I would be standing on the \nSenate floor stating my understanding, that an administration has said \nwe will not tell the Senate what it is doing. If we knew what it was \ndoing, we would not do it. That is precisely what happened on our side \nof the aisle, and not just on our side of the aisle, between September \nand December of last year. If we knew what we were doing, we would not \ndare to do it, and therefore the information is being withheld.\n  I would say that Dr. June O'Neill, Director of the Congressional \nBudget Office, has been very forthcoming, but that is an institution \nwithin our ranks, as it were, and with which we have normal \ncooperation.\n  I talked about the problems of poverty, but I would like to make the \npoint that this is not really the issue here.\n  Most children on AFDC are already poor. Those who are above the \npoverty line are part of that portion of the AFDC population which \nworks part of the year, loses jobs, goes on welfare, goes back. Time \nlimits would drop them completely below poverty because there would be \nno available income when they were not working.\n  Might I say we have an AFDC population that is made up of roughly \nthree groups. One is a sizable number in which adult, mature families \nbreak up, and a mother finds herself with children and needs income for \na relatively brief period. It is the equivalent of the mill closing and \nmen out of work. Within 2 years' time, they are back on their own. They \ndo not need any advice, they do not need any counseling. It is income \ninsurance for them, and it works.\n  There is a second, middle group which cycles on and off: Works, finds \nthe work does not work out--jobs are lost, plants close and that kind \nof thing--then they go back onto welfare. Work comes along, they go \noff. And it is back and forth.\n  Then there is another group. In overall terms, it is much the largest \ngroup. This group is on welfare for a very long, continuous time. \nThirteen years is the average.\n  The essential problem with this legislation is that it imposes time \nlimits without any real provision for the heroic efforts that are \nrequired to take people who have been on welfare for a long while, get \nthem off and keep them off.\n  I have no problem with that proposition, that work is what we should \nseek, independence is what we should seek. Some years ago, I wrote a \nlong book on this subject, which began: ``The issue of welfare is the \nissue of dependency. Whereas most people stand on their own two feet, \ndependent persons, as the buried image of the word implies, dependent \npeople hang.''\n  This very week Time magazine chose, on its page called ``Notebook,'' \nto reproduce a cover of Time from July 28, 1967. It is called, 29 Years \nAgo in Time: DOGGED CONSISTENCY. There is a picture of the Senator from \nNew York, and I am arguing the case--this is at a time when I was \ndirector of Joint Center for Urban Studies at MIT and at Harvard--that \nwe have a crisis in our cities and it was getting worse.\n  I am quoted:\n\n       We are the only industrial democracy, he told a Senate \n     subcommittee, that does not have a family allowance. And we \n     are the only democracy whose streets are filled with rioters \n     each summer. The biggest single experience anyone has is \n     working.\n\n  No one argues that. But to put a time limit on, when you do not have \nprovision for seeing that people have work, is to invite an urban \ncrisis unlike anything we have known since the 1960's. It may be it \nwill bring us to our senses. But it will be a crisis.\n  Here are the numbers. The Congressional Budget Office, in the cost \nestimate of the bill, said it would cut Federal welfare rolls by 30 to \n40 percent by the year 2004. If we follow the estimates of the Senator \nfrom Delaware, and they are quite accurate, of course, by the year \n2005, we will have over 10 million children on AFDC. Cut off 40 \npercent, and you have 4 million children dropped.\n  CBO estimates that, under the bill we are dealing with, we will cut \noff 3.5 million children by the year 2001. By the year 2001--5 years \nfrom now.\n  That would be an unprecedented experience, and its impact would be \nquite disproportionate in racial and ethnic terms. Two-thirds of those \naffected would be minorities: 49 percent black, 19 percent Hispanic.\n  I said in the Finance Committee, in March of this year, that to drop \nthese\n\n[[Page S8076]]\n\nchildren from our Federal life-support system would be the most \n``regressive and brutal act of social policy since Reconstruction.''\n  Think of what it means for our cities. Remember, not all these \nchildren will be 4 months old or 4 years old. Many will be 14 years \nold. In 5 years' time, you will not recognize Detroit, Los Angeles, New \nYork. These are cities where a majority of births are out of wedlock. \nThe average for our largest 50 cities is 48.0 percent.\n  What is going on is a profound social change which we do not \nunderstand, just as we could not comprehend the problem of unemployment \nin the first part of this century, and ended with the crisis of the \nworld depression, which almost destroyed democracy. It was a very close \nthing. Now, we are putting the viability of our own social system at \nrisk.\n  This year the National Center for Health Statistics reported that the \nnonmarital, out-of-wedlock ratio of births in the United States has now \nreached one-third, 32.6 percent. That was for 1994, so it is a third \ntoday. In Detroit, that number is 75.3 percent; in Los Angeles, it is \n50.1 percent; in New York City, 52.3 percent; in Chicago, 56 percent; \nin New Orleans, 64 percent. I think Detroit and New Orleans are \nprobably the highest. No society in history has ever encountered this \nproblem. These numbers a half century ago were 4 percent. New York \nCity, 4 percent half a century ago, 52 percent today; Manhattan, 54 \npercent.\n  Nobody understands. Something like this is going on in Britain, in \nCanada, in France, in Germany. We are undergoing an enormous social \nchange which we do not understand. Although it does not happen at all \nin Japan. Ratios were 1 percent in 1940 and 1 percent today.\n  Yet, we are acting as if we do understand. The basic model of this \nproblem in the minds of most legislators, and most persons in the \nadministration, is that since we first had welfare and we then got \nillegitimacy, it must be that welfare caused illegitimacy. And they may \nbe right. I do not know. But neither do they.\n  I have stood on this floor and argued for the Family Support Act, \nwhich one Senator after another invokes as a measure that works, \ngetting people out of dependency, into jobs. It could continue to work. \nBut not this sharp cutoff--bang, 2 years, you are off; 5 years, you are \noff forever. That invites the kind of calamity which it may be we are \ngoing to have to experience in order to come to our senses.\n  I said on the floor last September that we will have children \nsleeping on grates if this becomes law. I repeat that today. I hope I \nshall have been proved wrong. I hope.\n  We will have a chance to track it. In the Social Security Act \nAmendments of 1994, I was able to include a small, but significant, \nprovision to try to get us some accumulation of information and then \nperhaps theoretical knowledge about this situation. We enacted the \nWelfare Indicators Act of 1994. It requires the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to start producing an annual report based on the \nEconomic Report of the President, which derives from the Employment Act \nof 1946.\n  We will have the first interim report due October 31 of this year. It \ntakes a long time for these institutions, if I can use that word, to \nmature, but we will have documentation of what this legislation did. We \nwill know, unless we are reduced to concealing the truth, which we are \ngetting very close to in this debate. Administration officials saying, \nwhen asked for the report, ``There is no report''; when the report is \npublished saying, ``Well, I guess there was a report''; then saying, \n``No more reports.'' We are standing here on the Senate floor with no \nreport from the administration. Shame.\n  One of the comments I have made throughout this debate, over the last \nyear and a half, is that it has been conservative social analysts who \nhave been most wary of what we are doing. They have consistently warned \nus that we do not know enough to do this. They have asked us to be \nconservatives and not take this radical step, putting at risk the lives \nof children in a way we have never done.\n  After we allowed a system to develop in which children are supported \nin this manner, to suddenly stop that support based on some very vague \nnotion of human behavior--that if you are going to suffer awful \nconsequences, you will change your behavior. We will be making cruelty \nto children an instrument of social policy. Lawrence Mead of NYU said \nyou don't know enough to do this. Lawrence Mead, no liberal he; a \ncareer telling the liberals they were letting this situation get out of \nhand.\n  But 52 percent of the children born in the city of New York are to a \nsingle parent. John J. Dillulio, Jr., at Princeton saying, \n``Conservatives should know better than to take such risks with the \nlives of children.''\n  And then George F. Will. George Will of unequaled authority as a \ncommentator on the difficulty of social change and the care with which \nit is to be addressed. He wrote of the vote last September:\n\n       As the welfare debate begins to boil, the place to begin is \n     with an elemental fact: No child in America asked to be here. \n     No child is going to be spiritually improved by being \n     collateral damage in a bombardment of severities targeted at \n     adults who may or may not deserve more severe treatment from \n     the welfare state.\n\n  I end on that proposition. No child in America asked to be here. Why, \nthen, are we determined to punish them?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has approximately \n36 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, let me move on to the issue before us of \nwelfare reform. It is never easy to follow the Senator from New York \nwhen talking about this issue, because there is no one on the Senate \nfloor who knows more about this issue than the Senator from New \nYork. But I was struck by one of the comments he made. I felt compelled \nto respond to that comment, when he made the comment that the bill \nbefore us invites calamity. I am quoting him. He used the term \n``invites calamity.''\n\n  I found it odd that he used the term, that the bill before us invites \ncalamity, right after a very eloquent and fact-filled dissertation on \nthe calamity that has been created by this welfare system, that \ncalamity of illegitimacy in our civilization.\n  He suggested there is no solution, at least we do not know the \nsolution, and, therefore, we should not try anything. I assume that is \nthe conclusion. Since we are not absolutely sure what causes \nillegitimacy, then we should not even attempt to bring it up since we \ndo not have the answer.\n  I suggest that the Senator from New York should have been here in the \n1960's when in fact we did not know the solution for poverty but we \nwent ahead and tried the Great Society programs anyway. We went ahead \nnot knowing\n\n[[Page S8077]]\n\nwhat the answers would be, and for the last 30 years, in my opinion, \nignoring--ignoring--the results of the Great Society programs, the \nwelfare component of the Great Society programs in particular.\n  So if we are going to talk about not knowing what the future holds \nwith the bill before us, then let us talk about not knowing back in the \n1960's what the welfare state that we created would do, and now \nrefusing to change it, when we know it has created the calamity that \nthe Senator from New York eloquently described. He only described, in \nmy opinion, one element of that calamity.\n  Oh, it is a very serious one--illegitimacy. I suggest it may be the \ngreat social ill that can be the cancer within to destroy this \ncivilization. So I think he does highlight a most important issue. It \nis one that we attempt to address in this bill, which I suggest we \nattempt to address in a very modest way. We have not gone out with a \nright wing extreme agenda, whatever that is, to deal with this issue.\n  We have taken steps like saying that people who are on welfare, if \nthey want to have more children, they should not necessarily get more \nmoney for having more children out of wedlock. The States can enact a \nlaw under our bill to pay them money if they want. But the presumption \nis that if you are on AFDC and you are not married, and you are \nreceiving benefits and you have additional children, you are not \nautomatically going to get a pay raise.\n  The second thing we do is we look at mothers who have children out of \nwedlock and do not cooperate with the Government in telling us who the \nfather is. One might suggest that that probably is not a very likely \noccurrence. The fact of the matter is, having visited many agencies in \nmy State that deal with this problem, that is a very common occurrence \nfor a variety of reasons.\n  The most common reason is because usually there is a relationship \nbetween mom and the boyfriend. Mom does not want to jeopardize that \nrelationship by giving the boyfriend a legal responsibility for the \nchild. The Government is willing to pay. Why rely on a tenuous \nrelationship, sometimes, between the boyfriend and the mom, to track \ndown someone who may not have regular work to provide for that, when \nyou have a Government who is going to consistently provide for that \nchild? You may even work out something that has been told to me on many \noccasions, where the Government provides, and under the table the real \ndad provides some money, too.\n\n  It works out best for everybody except for the fact that the child is \nwithout a father. That is a little glitch that somehow gets glossed \nover. Like it or not, in our society--I know some do not believe it--\nbut I think fathers are important. I think we need mothers and fathers \nto raise children.\n  I happen to believe one of the big problems in our society of youth \nviolence among young males is because we do not have fathers in the \nhousehold. They do not have the example of a father to help guide them \nthrough the very difficult time of growing up.\n  Yes, we do some things that are untested. Sure, they are untested, \ngranted. We do not know whether making mom cooperate with authorities, \nforcing the mother to give us the name of the father--sanction her if \nshe does not--will in fact help. We do not know. But, my God, we should \nstart trying.\n  We cannot turn our back and say, just because we do not know, we \nshould not try. Donna Shalala says, Well, you know, there may be people \nwho fall off welfare because they did not cooperate, and that is a \ntragedy for the children. What the tragedy for the children is is they \nhave no father. That is a tragedy. We run around and we hide behind \nchildren. The liberals hide behind children, when it is the children \nwho are hurt the worst by this system that does not care. It is not \nloving and compassionate. Passing out a check behind a bulletproof \nwindow in a welfare office is not compassion, is not how we solve \nproblems in this society when it comes to the poor.\n  We give States a bonus if they reduce their illegitimacy rate. So we \nprovide an economic incentive for States to begin to try things to help \nreduce the number of illegitimate children. And they cannot do it \nthrough abortion.\n  That is illegitimacy. That is only one of the calamities that we now \nhave as a result of this system.\n  How many people believe that, in the last 30 years, as a result of \nthe welfare state, the neighborhoods in which people on welfare reside \nare safer, that crime is less, that the values of the people who are on \nwelfare in second and third generations are better than they were \nbefore? If you want to look into the eyes of those values, look into \nthe eyes of the senseless and indiscriminate juvenile crime that we see \nin our society, the lack of values between right and wrong, the lack of \nrespect for human life in our society.\n  Drugs. Are there less drugs? Are drugs less of a problem in these \ncommunities than they were 30 years ago? Is education better in these \ncommunities than it was 30 years ago? Is the family structure better \nthan it was 30 years ago? Oh, what progress we have made, what a system \nwe should defend. And, oh, we dare not try anything that is untested. I \nwould agree with the Senator, maybe he is right, maybe we should not \ntry anything that is untested, because the last time we tried something \nthat was untested, we got a horrible result. But the problem is, we are \nstuck with that system right now. We must--we must--face that and \nchange that.\n  Here is how we change it. As I said before, we deal with the issue of \nillegitimacy and in a modest way--I have to repeat that--in a very \nmodest way.\n  Secondly, what we say is that we are going to require people who are \nable-bodied to work. I talked about the values in communities. One of \nthe most important values that you can pass on to your children is a \nwork ethic. You can pass it on by talking about it. But you parents \nknow you can tell your children all sorts of things--I have three \nchildren; I tell them lots of things--but they are more interested in \nwatching you and seeing what you do and following your example.\n  How many times do you catch your kids saying things that you say, and \nyou say, ``Gosh, do I say that that much that they actually pick it \nup?'' I tell them not to say it, but they say it, so I guess I do, too. \nI do this, so they do it, too. Work is one of those things. The most \nimportant thing for economic success for children is to have a mom and \na dad--or mom or dad--go to work every day. So we require work because \nwe think that is a value that is important for people to exit poverty.\n\n  I am not interested in taking care of people on poverty as the \nsolution to poverty. My solution to poverty is to get people out of \npoverty. That is how we should measure a successful system--not how \nmany children we take care of--by how many families are no longer \nneeded to be on the system. That, to me, is a successful poverty \nprogram, not going around looking and saying, ``Look at all the people \nwe have on welfare and we are taking care of all these people now.'' I \nhave not met very many people on welfare who tell me that life on \nwelfare is a lot of fun or is what they desire for their life. Why \nshould it be the goal of the Government to put people or to capture \npeople in a system which they do not want to be in, and which the \npublic resents paying for, because it is a dead end? That is not a \nsolution.\n  Our goal is to get people to work and to self-sufficiency, to instill \nthe values that make America great. So, yes, after 2 years we require \nwork. For 2 years the State, through this bill, will have resources \navailable for education, for training, for searching jobs. There are a \nlot of people who get on welfare, are job-ready, and there are some \nthat cannot, they need their GED, to get some training, it takes time. \nSome people take more than 2 years.\n  The Senator from New York said we are going to put these rigid time \nlimits on people of 2 years, and after 5 years no more benefits. The \nSenator from New York knows very well within this bill there is what is \ncalled a hardship exception. What the State can do is exempt 20 \npercent, 20 percent of the people in this program from the time limit. \nThe time-limited program only applies to 50 percent of all the people \nin the program. That is not for 7 years. It starts out at 25 percent of \nthe people.\n  I know it is a lot of numbers, but let me suggest there is lots of \nflexibility here for hard cases, for people who are really trying, and \njust cannot seem to find a job. We understand that happens. We \nunderstand it happens in a lot of urban areas and rural areas where \nunemployment is scarce. We provide an\n\n[[Page S8078]]\n\nexception, but it is an exception to the rule. Sometimes it is \nimportant to establish a rule, an expectation of what we desire out of \neveryone. Set the bar a little higher. Instead of just saying you are \nall incapable of providing for yourself, so we will provide for you.\n  I ask the Senator from New Mexico for 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 3 additional minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It is important to set that standard. We set that \nstandard. We do it with the understanding that we know not everybody \ncan meet that standard. We give the States and the communities, and, I \nhope, and the Governors assure me, this is not going to be just one \nFederal bureaucratic program transferred to 50 State bureaucratic \nprograms.\n  Frankly, I am not that much comforted, I am somewhat comforted, but \nnot significantly comforted, to know that this is a Federal program run \nby Federal bureaucrats that now is going to be a State program run by \nState bureaucrats. State bureaucrats may be marginally better than \nFederal bureaucrats, but that is not enough. The Governors understand, \nat least the ones that are talking to me, that they need to go further. \nThey need to get down into the local communities, into the nonprofit \norganizations, into the folks who really have compassion, because it is \ntheir neighbors and their friends they are providing for. Those are the \norganizations we have to empower through this bill, and give them the \nresources to solve the problems that are in their community. We believe \nthis is a vehicle with the flexibility that is in this bill to make \nthat happen.\n\n  I want to talk about just a couple of other things. No. 1, child \ncare. It has been argued on this floor, and I think well argued on this \nfloor by Members, frankly, on both sides of the aisle, that the key to \nmaking work work is child care. That there are millions of women out \nthere who would like to go to work but because of the barrier for safe, \naffordable day care, they simply cannot do it. We provide $4 billion \nmore in child care in this bill than under current law, and even more \nmoney than what the President is suggesting. Under this bill, work will \nwork, and people will be able to succeed.\n  The other two things I will quickly go through, first is child \nsupport enforcement. There is uniform agreement on both sides to \nimprove, toughen child support enforcement, including wage withholding, \nand is included in here, among other things. This gets back to, again, \nrequiring fathers to take responsibility for their children. Again, \nsetting the bar high, but, my goodness, we should have standards high \nfor fathers when it comes to providing for their children.\n  Finally, the issue of noncitizens. The Senator from New York said no \ncivilized society would cut off these benefits for noncitizens like we \ndo in this bill. He is absolutely right. Do you know why? Because there \nis no civilized society that provides the benefits in the first place. \nWe are the only society that gives benefits to people who are in this \ncountry who are not citizens of the country. What we are saying is we \nwill provide benefits to refugees, to asylees, but to people who come \nin under sponsorship agreements, the sponsors, who signs that document \nwill be the one who takes care of them, not the Federal Government.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is time left on both sides; could you tell us how \nmuch each side has?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The side of the Senator from New Mexico has 17 \nminutes and 17 seconds and the other side has 7 minutes and 18 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have Senator Frist here. Does the Senator from \nFlorida want to speak during that time, during that 7 minutes?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I have not had an opportunity to talk to the floor \nmanager, Senator Exon, but I will request time to speak. If Senator \nFrist is prepared to proceed, that is fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 6 minutes to Senator Frist.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is with much disappointment that I rise \ntoday to mark the apparent, the apparent, demise of what was a \ncarefully considered, carefully crafted, bipartisan agreement on \nMedicaid. Despite the historic agreement among the Nations 50 \nGovernors, we are compelled by the President's veto threat to separate \nMedicaid reform from welfare reform.\n  Ultimately, comprehensive welfare reform must include health care and \nhealth care reform for the poor. The face of that woman with her child \nin her arms who is below the poverty level, who wants to go back to \nwork, is just inextricably combined and connected to that welfare \nsystem. Our Medicaid plan, which was based on this Governors' \nbipartisan proposal, would have indeed preserved the safety net for \nwomen, children, our senior citizens, and for individuals with \ndisabilities.\n\n  Mr. President, I stand here today also, along with my colleagues and \nbefore the American people, to assure them that we will continue to \nwork for a strong, for a secure, and for a simplified Medicaid Program. \nAfter the election, when all of the partisan passions have subsided, we \nwill find a way to work together and give relief to States burdened to \nthe point today of bankruptcy by out-of-control skyrocketing Medicaid \ncosts. For the sake of our children, for the sake of their families, we \nmust find a way to put policy before politics.\n  Before coming to the U.S. Senate, I performed transplant surgery, and \na third of my transplant patients received Medicaid. That gave me a \nperspective of those patients on Medicaid also on welfare. As chairman \nof the Tennessee State Task Force on Medicaid Reform, I grappled with \nthose issues before coming to this body from a State perspective.\n  Medicaid today takes up nearly 6 percent of the total of all Federal \nspending. State by State, it is approximately 20 percent of all State \nspending. Unless we act, we can expect an over 150 percent increase in \njust 10 years. The increase in Medicaid spending from last year alone \nis more than we spent on mass transit, criminal investigations, \npollution control and abatement, or the National Science Foundation.\n  Yes, Medicaid is bankrupting our State budgets and will ultimately \ndrive the Federal budget into bankruptcy, unless something is done.\n  Now, nothing in the budget reconciliation plan reported to the Senate \nconstitutes a cut in Medicaid. President Clinton and Republicans both \nattempt to reign in the excessive growth in spending and, at the same \ntime, protect eligible populations.\n  The chart that I have beside me shows just how close we in Congress \nare with what the President has proposed. This chart depicts overall \nMedicaid spending growth over a period of time, comparing what has been \nspent from 1991 to 1996, a total of $463 billion, to what we have \nproposed, the U.S. Congress, from 1997 to 2002, the Republican budget \nproposal, to spend $731 billion, which is very close to what the \nPresident has proposed to spend from 1997 to the year 2002. The \ndifference between the yellow bar, what the Republican proposal has put \nforth, and what the President has proposed is less than 2 percent. We \nare very, very close. But the difference is that the Republican plan \nwas based on the National Governors' bipartisan proposal. It passed \ntheir assembly unanimously. It was designed to specifically protect all \ncurrent law eligibles, and included an umbrella fund for emergencies as \nwell. And to truly preserve this safety net, there is $56 billion more \nin this bill than was in last year's budget resolution.\n  The program will continue to grow. Nothing is going to be cut. It is \ngoing to continue to grow at a rate of about, on average, 6.2 percent a \nyear, and that is more than twice the rate of inflation. And it will \ngrow a total of 43 percent over the 5-year period from 1996 to the year \n2002.\n  When I came to this body, the U.S. Senate, I came as a physician out \nof the private sector, as a citizen legislator, unfamiliar with the \npolitical machinery that can block this type of positive advance. At \nthat juncture, I hoped to work with my colleagues, Republican and \nDemocrat, to address these issues that will affect our future and the \nfuture of our children. We have made progress, and I am glad we have \nmade progress. But I am disappointed that we cannot enact a combined \nMedicaid Program with welfare, facing the realities that, again, \nMedicaid is inextricably woven to our welfare program. That is \nsomething that is close to my heart. But we shall return next year to\n\n[[Page S8079]]\n\nmove forward on this very important issue of preserving Medicaid and \nimproving Medicaid for the future generations.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator from Nebraska has yielded to me the remainder \nof time under his control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes remain.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to speak to one section of this \nbill to which I will intend to offer an amendment, and that is the \nsection that deals with the rights of legal aliens who are in the \nUnited States.\n  As my colleagues will recall, this is not a new issue. In fact, we \nhave spent weeks on the Senate floor debating the question of what \nshould be the eligibility of legal aliens for a variety of Federal \nbenefits. This Senate, by an overwhelming vote, passed on May 2 an \nimmigration control bill, which laid out with great specifics what \nwould be the rights of legal aliens--Mr. President, I underscore the \nword ``legal''--to various Federal benefit programs. That legislation \npassed after extensive hearings and markups in the Judiciary Committee \nand exhaustive floor debate that lasted well over a week. Similar \nactions were taken in the House of Representatives, and now this \nlegislation is before a conference committee.\n  While all of that has occurred, we now receive this welfare bill, \nwhich has a redundant, conflicting, and, I think, draconian set of \nprovisions relative to the rights of the very same people who were the \nsubject of our debate just a few weeks ago--legal aliens in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I am going to propose that we should strike this \nsection from the bill and leave the question of what should be the \neligibility rights of legal aliens to the process of resolution in the \nconference committee and our final action on the results of that \nconference committee. There are extreme differences between the \nprovisions in the immigration bill that the Senate passed in May and \nwhat we are now being asked to consider in July. Let me just mention \ntwo of those principal differences.\n  The essential concept of eligibility in the immigration bill was the \nconcept of ``deeming.'' Deeming is the responsibility of the sponsor \nwho has made it possible for the legal alien who comes into the United \nStates to have the sponsor's income added or deemed to be part of the \nincome of the legal alien, in determining whether the legal alien is \neligible for Federal needs-based programs.\n  This bill uses a different concept, and that is a concept of a \nprohibition of legal aliens for a variety of Federal benefit programs.\n  I might say, Mr. President, that much of the debate on the question \nof rights of legal aliens is a result of the report that was originally \nsanctioned by this Congress called ``U.S. Immigration Policy: Restoring \nCredibility,'' often referred to as the ``Barbara Jordan report,'' \nafter our esteemed recently-passed colleague. In the report--the Jordan \nreport--it states, ``The safety net provided by needs-tested programs \nshould be available to those whom we have affirmatively accepted as \nlegal immigrants into our communities.'' It points out that it is \nappropriate to look to the sponsor to be the primary caregiver for \nthose they have sponsored into the United States. They endorse the \nconcept of deeming. But they say that under circumstances where a \nsponsor is not available, the sponsor has died, the sponsor has \nsuffered illness, or some other incapacitating condition that made them \nunable to meet their obligations, that immigrants should continue to be \neligible. ``A policy that categorically denied legal immigrants access \nto such safety nets, based solely on alienage, would lead to a gross \ninequality between very similar individuals and undermine our \nimmigration goals to reunite families and quickly integrate immigrants \ninto American society.''\n\n  So that is one fundamental difference. This is a difference, Mr. \nPresident, which will have real impact on the lives of real residents \nof our country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \ncircumstances of Polyna Novak, a legal immigrant who has come to the \nUnited States as a refugee from persecution in the Soviet Union and how \nthe difference in the immigration bill's use of deeming and this bill's \nuse of an absolute bar would have an impact on her life.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Polyna Novak is a legal immigrant who came to the United \n     States as a refugee from Russia 16 years ago (1980). She \n     currently lives by herself in an apartment in Marina del ray, \n     California. Her daughter Dina lives nearby and is her \n     mother's full time care giver.\n       Polyna is 74 years old, has Alzheimer's disease and also \n     has great difficulty walking. She speaks and reads basic \n     English. She receives SSI and Medicaid.\n       In November, she tried to become a naturalized citizen \n     under the 1993 rules exempting persons with cognitive \n     disability from some of the testing requirements. The INS \n     examiner refused to administer the oath, however, because of \n     her cognitive impairment, claiming that she could not \n     understand what she was doing.\n       Mrs. Novak is in a catch-22 situation-too disabled to \n     naturalize, under this Welfare bill, she will lose her only \n     source of Income, her SSI benefits. There is no deeming, it's \n     simply an unfeeling, outright ban, with no consideration for \n     tragic individual cases such as this one.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, in my State of Florida, we are now \nreceiving thousands of refugees and people seeking asylum from \ncountries such as Cuba, generally under agreements that have been \nreached between the United States Federal Government and foreign \ngovernments, and now the Federal Government is going to take the \nposition that it washes its hands of the financial responsibilities \nthat flow from that.\n  The second big difference is the impact on State and local \ngovernments. The bill that we passed would have had a cost transferred \nto State and local governments of approximately $5.6 billion over the \nnext 7 years. This bill, if you would believe it, would have a cost \ntransfer to State and local governments of up to $23 billion over the \nnext 7 years.\n  I suggest, Mr. President, in respect to the work that this Senate has \nalready done on the immigration bill and the efforts that are currently \nbeing made in conference to reconcile the House and the Senate \nversions, that it is inappropriate for us at this hour under these \nconstrained parliamentary procedures to take up a provision that would \nfundamentally change the decisions that we have already made, increase \nthe cost to State and local governments by potentially three times or \nmore than in the legislation that we have already passed, and place \nliterally hundreds of communities and tens of thousands of people in \nserious jeopardy by our ill-considered actions.\n  So at an appropriate time, Mr. President, I will ask, as will \ncolleagues, including Senators Murray, Simon, and Feinstein, that those \nprovisions that relate to the eligibility of legal aliens be deleted \nfrom this bill and rely upon the immigration bill to come to an \nappropriate policy resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan editorial from today's Los Angeles Times on this subject, and other \nmaterials that relate to legal aliens.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, July 18, 1996]\n\n                      Passing the Buck on Welfare\n\n       Tucked into the Republicans' welfare reform package in \n     Congress is a wrongheaded proposal to cut benefits and social \n     services to most immigrants who are legally in the United \n     States but who have not yet become citizens. Under the \n     proposal, Washington, which is seeking ways to finance \n     federal welfare reform, would shift billions of dollars in \n     costs to states and counties. The provision should be \n     rejected.\n       Sen. Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat, plans to offer an \n     amendment to the bill to strike out restrictions on public \n     benefits to legal immigrants. A host of eligibility issues \n     ranging from student aid to Medicaid for legal immigrants \n     already is part of a separate immigration bill now in \n     conference committee. There is no logic in including those \n     matters in a welfare bill. The two issues should be handled \n     separately.\n       The welfare bill now proposes to help finance the costs of \n     reform by cutting $23 billion over six years in benefits to \n     legal immigrants, including children and the elderly. This \n     would be an unfair and punitive move against legal immigrants \n     who have played by the rules.\n       The bill would make most legal immigrants now in the \n     country ineligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and \n     food\n\n[[Page S8080]]\n\n     stamps. Future legal immigrants (except for refugees and \n     asylum seekers) would be inteligible for most other federal \n     means-tested benefits (including AFDC and nonemergency \n     Medicaid services) during their first five years in the \n     country.\n       The cutbacks would disproportionately hit California, \n     Florida, New York and Texas, the states with the biggest \n     immigrant populations. California alone could lose $10 \n     billion, or about 40% of the proposed $23 billion in benefit \n     reductions. Those ineligible for such benefits would have to \n     turn elsewhere for aid. In Los Angeles County, for example, \n     if all affected SSI recipients sought general assistance \n     relief instead it would cost the county $236 million \n     annually. The cost shifting could have potentially disastrous \n     results for the already fiscally strapped county.\n       The immigration bill now under consideration already \n     includes $5.6 billion in savings from tightening eligibility \n     requirements for legal immigrants on a variety of federal \n     programs, including Medicaid. The attempt to use welfare \n     reform to slip through further curbs on public assistance to \n     legal immigrants should be called what it is--a deplorable \n     money grab by Washington that can only hurt California.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    June 24, 1996.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: As health care providers caring for \n     millions of Americans in rural and urban areas, we are \n     writing to express our concerns about provisions in the \n     welfare reform legislation the Senate Finance Committee plans \n     to mark up this week. The provisions at issue would \n     completely bar legal immigrants from receiving any Medicaid \n     coverage for five years, and would effectively deny Medicaid \n     coverage to most legal immigrants for an additional five \n     years.\n       These provisions will force hundreds of thousands of legal \n     immigrants off of Medicaid, creating a new population of \n     uninsured low income individuals at a time when the number of \n     uninsured Americans is approaching 40 million. Furthermore, \n     the loss of Medicaid coverage means that the amount of \n     preventive care provided to legal immigrants will be \n     drastically reduced, thereby exposing entire communities to \n     communicable diseases while increasing the overall cost of \n     providing necessary care. We urge the Committee to drop these \n     provisions when it marks up the welfare legislation.\n       In particular, the bill would bar legal immigrants from \n     eligibility for Medicaid (and other assistance programs) for \n     five years. After five years, the legislation would require \n     that the income and resources of a legal immigrant's sponsor \n     and the sponsor's spouse be ``deemed'' to be the income of \n     the legal immigrant when determining the immigrant's \n     eligibility for Medicaid.\n       If a low income legal immigrant is barred from receiving, \n     or deemed out of the Medicaid program, he or she may have no \n     other means to pay for health care. Most low income \n     immigrants cannot afford private health insurance. Many \n     sponsors may be unable or unwilling to help finance the \n     health care costs of the immigrants they sponsor. Yet, \n     because of the five-year ban and the deeming requirements, \n     legal immigrants will be ineligible for Medicaid, although \n     they will still need care. This is a cost shift from the \n     federal government to state and local entities and providers \n     of care. And this cost shift will disproportionately fall on \n     providers in states with large numbers of legal immigrants--\n     states such as California, Texas, Florida, New York, New \n     Jersey, Massachusetts, and Illinois.\n       We understand provisions dealing with benefits in the \n     welfare bill are based upon the recommendations of the United \n     States Commission on Immigration Reform, a bipartisan \n     commission appointed by Congress in 1990 to study and make \n     recommendations on national immigration policy. But the \n     Commission opposes any broad, categorical denial of public \n     benefits to legal immigrants such as the pending welfare \n     bill's five-year ban to Medicaid eligibility. In its \n     recommendations to Congress, it firmly states that ``the \n     Commission rejects proposals to categorically deny \n     eligibility for public benefits on the basis of alienage.'' \n     It expressly stated that ``special consideration should be \n     given to the issue of medical care.'' Specifically, the \n     Commission's recommendation was very clear:\n       ``The safety net provided by needs-tested programs should \n     be available to those whom we have affirmatively accepted as \n     legal immigrants in our communities . . . circumstances may \n     arise after an immigrant's entry that create a pressing need \n     for public help--unexpected illness, injuries sustained due \n     to a serious accident. . . . Under such circumstances, legal \n     immigrants should be eligible for public benefits if they \n     meet other eligibility criteria. We are not prepared to \n     remove the safety net from under individuals who, we hope, \n     will become full members of our polity.''\n       We recognize the importance of regulating legal and illegal \n     immigration into the United States. But it must be \n     accomplished through means that will not pull the health care \n     safety net from under legal immigrants, create a public \n     health threat, or impair the ability of health care providers \n     to provide essential services to their communities. \n     Therefore, we urge the Finance Committee to honor the \n     Commission's recommendations and exempt Medicaid from the \n     five year eligibility bar and deeming requirements.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Hospital Association, American Osteopathic \n           Healthcare Association, American Rehabilitation \n           Association, Association of American Medical Colleges, \n           California Association of Public Hospitals and Health \n           Systems, California Healthcare Association, Catholic \n           Health Association of the U.S., Federation of American \n           Health Systems, Greater New York Hospital Association, \n           InterHealth, National Association of Children's \n           Hospitals, National Association of Public Hospitals and \n           Health Systems, Premier, Inc., Private Essential Access \n           Community Hospitals, Texas Association of Public and \n           Non-Profit Hospitals, Texas Hospital Association, VHA \n           Inc.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes of that to the Senator \nfrom Missouri. Might I yield myself 1 minute before I yield to him?\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Frist for his comments on the floor, \nand I add one thought to it. Frankly, I, too, have a real concern about \nnot doing anything this year about Medicaid. But I think the die is \ncast. However, it seems to me that the next episode that is going to \npush us to do something significant is not something that leadership \nshould feel very proud of because I think we are going to be pushed by \nStates that cannot afford to pay for the programs.\n  We have all been talking about what is happening to the \nbeneficiaries; how we are going to modify the program, make it more \nefficient, and what about the delivery system? But there has been very \nlittle talk about the fact that many States cannot afford the Medicaid \nProgram.\n  I note in my own State that there was a major story. People are \nconfused when you talk about Medicaid not having enough money because \nthey almost always believe that is us, the Fed's. But in my State the \nstory was our State has not appropriated enough money for its share. We \nhappen to be one of those States where only 25 percent is our burden; \n75 is the Federal burden. We cannot even afford to pay for the program \nin its current form, and we are concerned about whether the Federal \nGovernment ought to reform it so that it becomes more efficient. We are \nthe ones getting accused, with reference to fixing that, of being \nneglectful of some parts of our population.\n  The truth of the matter is education at home is suffering. Pretty \nsoon they cannot pay for education because the States do not have \nenough money if they have to pay for Medicaid and programs of that \nsort.\n  So I think the Senator's suggestion that perhaps it would have been \ngood if we would have challenged the President and others and proceeded \nwith that Medicaid provision was a good one. Our job will get done \nsoon, I am sure, thanks to people like the occupant of the chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. I commend the Senators from Mexico \nand Tennessee each for mentioning this important component of reform \nwhich is literally pressing and demands that the system will require \nit. We must undertake those reforms immediately.\n  I am struck by the fact that our debate is not a debate about \nrestructuring a government program. Our debate is about rescuing our \nculture from a tragedy, a tragedy the dimensions of which have been \neloquently outlined and defined by speaker after speaker on this floor. \nThe Senator from New York eloquently and tragically defined the \nproblem. He said that 75 percent of some of the births in some cities \nin this country are births to incomplete families.\n  The welfare system, which has been designed or hoped for as a way of \nhelping people, has become a way of ensnaring people. A net can be \nsomething that saves you from a fall. It can be something in which you \nare caught. I believe we have a system where we have seen that the \nwelfare system is one where people are caught. It is not where people \nare saved.\n  When he rather dramatically ended his speaking earlier, the Senator \nfrom New York talked about the children. What about the children? I \nthink we\n\n[[Page S8081]]\n\nhave to ask the question. What about the children? What about the one-\nthird of all children in this country who are born to incomplete \nfamilies without fathers in the home? What happens to those children?\n\n  I was reminded about one child whose story I read. Her name was Ariel \nHill. She was one of five children of a welfare family that lived in an \napartment beyond description in Chicago public housing. The parents \nwere 22-year-old, drug-using high school dropouts. They did not have \njobs. The mother had her first child as a teenager, obviously. She was \none of five children. The father grew up on welfare. The source of the \nincome to the family was the $900 per month in public aid checks.\n  What tragically impressed me was after she died at the hands of her \nmother, the investigators came in to look around the apartment to see \nwhat they could find. They went into the apartment and found a paper \nlisting the welfare dollars that each child had brought into the \nfamily.\n  We are literally living with a system which has taught people to \nvalue children for the kind of incomes those children could attract to \nthe family through the welfare system.\n  This is not something that recommends our future. It is not something \nupon which we should build. It is something which we must change.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania made it very clear and eloquently \nargued that we may not know everything about what we want to do and we \nmaybe cannot be assured that it will work completely. But we do know \none thing with a certainty. That is that the current system of welfare \nis a tragedy. It has entrapped individuals. It has seen the \nskyrocketing rate of individuals born into homes without families. It \nhas found more and more people in circumstances of dependence.\n  The War on Poverty, started years ago, addressed the situation where \nfewer children were in poverty then than are in poverty now. It seems \nto me that we must take action to change the status quo. We are dealing \nwith a tragedy. If every time we say, ``Well, we cannot reform welfare, \nwe are not sure that what will happen will be a perfect solution,'' we \nare allowing the potential for perfection to paralyze us. And to say \nthat we will not act at all, it is pretty clear to me with individuals \nwho have begun to make careers--and not only careers for one individual \nbut careers for individuals generation after generation in families--of \na system which has ensnared them and not saved them, that we have the \nwrong kind of net here and that we have to restructure it. We have to \nprovide some of the very tough motivations for people who lead this \nsystem to be involved in the ladder of opportunity rather than the net \nof ensnarement.\n  I believe that is what welfare has to be. It has to be a transitional \nsystem.\n  So I think it is time for us to limit the amount of time that people \ncan be on welfare. It is time for us to provide disincentives to bear \nchildren out of wedlock. It is time for us to provide powerful \nincentives for people to go to work. It is time for us to say that, if \nyou are on welfare, you should be off drugs. It is time for us to say \nthat, if you are on welfare, your children should be in school. It is \ntime for us to say that, if you are on welfare, your children should \nhave the immunizations that are available to them free of charge. You \nhave to be responsible for what you are doing. We are not going to \ncontinue to support you in a way in which you abdicate, you simply run \nfrom, you hide from, your responsibility as a citizen.\n  As we look at where we are, we see a system the carnage of which is \nwritten in the lives of children. It is written in the lives of adults \nwho have been ensnared by a net which was designed to arrest their \nfall.\n  But instead of being a net of saving, it tends to be a net of \ntrapping, a net of ensnarement, and it is time for us to make this \nsystem one of transition. It is time for welfare to be a ladder of \nopportunity, and I believe the measure that is before us today gives us \nthe opportunity to make that the truth for the American people. They \nare asking us to reform the welfare system. It is time to get about the \nbusiness and get it done.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  All time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been suggested. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nmajority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the net effect of provisions reported by the \nFinance Committee is that the committee fails to achieve its \nreconciliation instruction for the year 2002. The Medicaid supplemental \numbrella fund increases outlays in the year 2002. Pursuant to section \n313(b)(1)(B) of the Budget Act, I raise a point of order against \nSection 1511 of the Social Security Act as added by section 2923 of the \nreconciliation bill from page 772, line 13, through page 785, line 22.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken, and the \nprovisions are stricken from the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4894\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to strike all of subtitle B, \nRestructuring Medicaid, from title II of the reconciliation bill from \npage 663, line 9, through page 1027, line 20.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I believe there are Democratic Senators who would like \nto speak on this measure. I do not know their names.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. LOTT] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4894.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 663, strike line 9, through page 1027, line 20.\n  Mr. LOTT. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. I believe that this \nwould be debatable for up to 1 hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The debate will be 2 hours.\n  Mr. LOTT. Two hours equally divided. So if the distinguished Senator \nfrom New York has Senators who wish to speak, they would have that \nopportunity.\n  I would like to be recognized just briefly, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I personally feel very strongly that we \nshould act on the need to improve and reform Medicaid.\n  I had hoped we could get that done this year. I think that we could \nhave a better program, and I think that we could control the rate of \ngrowth in such a way that it would help us move toward fiscal \nresponsibility and a balanced budget, but a number of considerations \nhave come into play.\n  The Senate and the House majority are very much committed to genuine \nreform of welfare, requiring work, also giving flexibility to States as \nto how this program is administered, also trying to move toward a \nsituation where welfare is not a way of life but there is an \nopportunity for people in this country to get off welfare, get the \nnecessary training and education that will allow them to get into a \nfull-time job.\n  Unfortunately, in view of the opposition and threat of a veto from \nthe President if we had these two combined, we felt it was the best \nthing to do at this time to move forward with welfare. We are committed \nto getting that done. We are committed to getting it through the Senate \ntoday or tomorrow and then going to conference as soon as possible and \ncompleting action on this very important legislation before we go out \nfor the August recess.\n  There are a lot of factors that have come into play here, and I know \nwe will hear more about it from the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee and the chairman of the Finance Committee, but I just \nwanted to make those brief remarks. I think all things considered, this \nis the right thing to do at this time, and I hope the Senate will act \nquickly on it and move on to further consideration of the welfare \nreform package.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before the majority leader leaves, we \nhave\n\n[[Page S8082]]\n\nheard from the Democratic side that they want a vote on this. I wonder, \nwhile the leader is still here, if we could get the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If the Senator will give me just 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He will come back with an answer.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield myself such time as I might take.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the leader's motion to separate \nMedicaid from this welfare reform legislation. Leo Tolstoy once said \nthat ``Life and the ideal are hard to reconcile. To try to make them \nfollow the same path is a life's work.''\n  I have to say that this observation has taken on new meaning for me \nas we have worked diligently to craft welfare reform in a way that is \nworkable and meaningful.\n  In the case of welfare reform, the ideal, of course, is a proposal \nthat breaks the back of dependency, a proposal that reverses the \nperverse incentives in the current program, and empowers men, women and \nfamilies to find security through work. The ideal program returns \nauthority to state and local governments--allowing them to unleash \ntheir creativity, to be innovative, effective and, of course, \ncompassionate. This is where the people live; it is where their needs \nare best met; it is where they are seen as individuals rather than as \nstatistics.\n\n  Likewise, Mr. President, the ideal welfare reform program contains \nreal and necessary reforms to Medicaid. In the past, President Clinton \nhas expressed why Medicaid reform is necessary for real welfare reform. \nThe Nation's Governors, liberal and conservative, have been eloquent \nand persuasive as to why: Medicaid is quickly overtaking education to \nbe the number one expense in State budgets. Medicaid as it is currently \nadministered leads families to impoverishment, as they find it \nnecessary to qualify in an ``all-or-nothing'' way. Federal Medicaid \nspending will be over $827 billion in the next 5 years, Mr. President, \nchallenging our Treasury, our taxpayer resources, as well as America's \neconomic well-being.\n  The ideal would be to have Medicaid reform attached to welfare \nreform. I have made no secret of this. In trying to keep Medicaid a \npart of this proposal, we have compromised time and again to give the \nPresident a bill he could sign. In fact, the President himself proposed \nto cut Medicaid by $59 billion. In our proposal to reform Medicaid, we \ncame within 2 percent of this number--2 percent--the difference of \nabout two dimes a day per beneficiary. And in our compromise we \ncontinued to increase spending in the Medicaid Program--increase it \nfaster than Social Security. But, unfortunately, despite all this, \nPresident Clinton maintains that Medicaid reform is a ``poison pill.'' \nMany of the President's allies in Congress support him. In their \narguments, they suggested that they could support welfare reform, and \nthe President would sign welfare reform, if the two were decoupled.\n  We have separated, or are in the process of separating Medicaid \nreform from this legislation. Welfare reform is so important to the \nAmerican people that they are willing to accept compromise. Like \nTolstoy, they understand that ``life and the ideal are hard to \nreconcile.'' While it may take a life's work to achieve the ideal, it \nwill certainly take the best efforts of this Senate to eventually \nreturn to Medicaid reform when the time comes. We cannot leave undone \nsomething so important and declare complete victory.\n  Medicaid, in my opinion, must be addressed, if not now, later. Anyone \nwho looks at the spending trends, anyone who looks at how this one \nprogram is threatening the States, anyone who sees how it leads \nfamilies to choices, behaviors that are counterproductive to their \nwell-being and long-term success can understand that Medicaid must be \nchanged. It must be improved. It must be administered in a way that \nallows States to be more flexible, more creative, and more effective in \nhelping families.\n  For the time, we must move forward. This is what the American people \nwant. We must pass this welfare reform legislation, a bill that takes a \nvery important first step toward meeting the needs of those most \nvulnerable among us, a bill that returns common sense to the welfare \nsystem, a bill that gives greater flexibility to the Federal and State \ngovernments to help people help themselves. The time is right for this \nlegislation. At another time, we will revisit Medicaid, but for the \nmoment we must move on.\n  Mr. President, it is no secret that I firmly believe that it is \nvitally important that both welfare and Medicaid reform should go \ntogether. I believe there are compelling reasons for Medicaid reform. \nThe Governors, Democratic and Republican alike, have been strong \nadvocates of including Medicaid with welfare reform. President Clinton \nhimself for more than 3 years has talking about Medicaid's role in \nremoving the incentives to families to stay in poverty.\n  More than 3 years ago, President Clinton told the Nation's Governors \nthat, ``* * * many people stay on welfare not because of the checks * * \n* they do it solely because they do not want to put their children at \nrisk of losing health care or because they do not have the money to pay \nfor child care * * *. This is precisely the purpose of the legislation \nwe introduced in May, S. 1795. That is why we have worked for months \nwith the Nation's Governors to keep welfare and Medicaid reform \ntogether. Let me spell out some of the reasons why they belong \ntogether.\n  It is important for the American people to understand that the \ndifference between our proposal and the President's plan for Medicaid \nis not about spending money.\n  There is now little difference between this plan and the President's \nown plan in terms of Federal spending levels on Medicaid.\n  Secretary Shalala appeared before the Finance Committee last month \nand knowledged the President proposed to cut Medicaid by $59 billion.\n  Under our plan, the Federal commitment to Medicaid remains intact. \nEven while slowing the rate of growth Medicaid spending would still \nrise faster than Social Security under our plan.\n  The Federal Government will spend an estimated $827.1 billion between \n1996 and 2002 on Medicaid, an average annual increase of approximately \n6 percent.\n  We have met the President half-way in terms of Medicaid savings.\n  The difference between us is less than 2 percent of the total Federal \ncost of Medicaid.\n  That is difference of about two dimes a day per beneficiary.\n  The American people should fully understand that the critical \ndifference between President Clinton and this legislation is not about \nthe level of spending. The difference between us is who controls the \nspending. The fundamental issue is whether or not the Governors and \nState legislators and judges can do a better job in running the $2.4 \ntrillion welfare system than the bureaucracy in Washington.\n  The essence of the administration's opposition to Medicaid reform is \nthat the States cannot be trusted. The Clinton plan is built on the \npremise that Washington must control the decisionmaking.\n  It is unfortunate that the potential achievements which would have \nbeen brought from including Medicaid in welfare reform are not better \nknown. Too many people listened to unfounded accusations that the \nGovernors and State legislatures cannot wait to abandon the children in \ntheir State. That is pure nonsense. If a family stays on welfare, that \nfamily will get both a welfare check and Medicaid. Under this reform \nproposal, the States have greater incentives to expand Medicaid \ncoverage and help prevent families from being forced onto the welfare \nrolls in the first place. Reform is a critical component of getting \nthose now on welfare off of cash assistance.\n  The Governors also understand that under current law, Medicaid is an \nall or nothing proposition. The current system contains built-in \nincentives for families to impoverish themselves in order to qualify \nfor Medicaid.\n  The Governors also understand that under today's all or nothing \nscheme, a lot of low-income working families get nothing. As if to add \ninsult to injury, many low-income families are paying for the benefits \na welfare family is getting while their own children go without \ncoverage.\n\n[[Page S8083]]\n\n  Medicaid is an important program for our elderly citizens in terms of \nlong-term care coverage. But the current system is far from perfect in \nserving our senior citizens.\n  The current system forces elderly citizens into poverty even before \nany benefits can be provided.\n  Our senior citizens often do not receive the most appropriate \nservices because the current system, run under rules dictated by the \nFederal Government, is not flexible enough. What is good for the \nbureaucracy is not necessarily good for the individual. Our legislation \nwould have given the States greater flexibility to redesign benefits so \nthat our senior citizens could be better saved.\n  But instead of reform, the Clinton administration chose to scare the \nelderly and hide behind children. The very idea that the current system \nmust remain in place in order to protect our vulnerable citizens from \ntheir Governors and State legislators is not only insulting. It is \nwrong.\n  More than half of the money being spent on Medicaid is there solely \nbecause the States have chosen to provide optional benefits and extend \noptional coverage to a greater number of people.\n  The administration scared people with a convoluted argument that our \nlegislation ``lacks a Federal guarantee'' as if only the Federal \nGovernment is entirely responsible for anything good in the Medicaid \nprogram. This argument is completely hollow. As Secretary Shalala \nacknowledged to the Finance Committee earlier this month, the States \ncould take nearly $70 billion today, more than half the spending in the \nprogram, out of the current Medicaid system without needing her \napproval.\n  We did not create the linkage between welfare and Medicaid.\n  That was done more than 30 years ago when Medicaid was created.\n  Our legislation guarantees coverage and benefits for poor children, \nchildren in foster care, pregnant women, senior citizens, persons with \ndisabilities, and families on welfare.\n  If anything, our legislation goes beyond the Governors' resolution in \nterms of setting guarantees. In committee, we extended those Medicaid \nguarantees even further to phase in coverage of children ages 13 to 18.\n  We also extended coverage to families leaving welfare. The \nmodification also requires States to provide health coverage under the \nMedicaid Program for 1 year to families leaving welfare to go into the \nwork force.\n  This goal of Medicaid reform also goes directly to issue of a \nbalanced budget, another major issue of concern to the American people. \nSimply put, the Federal budget cannot be balanced without Medicaid \nreform. It is the third largest domestic program in the Federal budget. \nIt costs more than AFDC, food stamps, and SSI combined.\n  Medicaid reform is also critical to balancing State budgets and \npriorities. One out of every $5 spent by the States goes to Medicaid. \nThe National Association of State Budget Officers reports that Medicaid \nsurpassed higher education as the second largest program in 1990.\n  If nothing changes, Medicaid spending may soon overtake elementary \nand secondary education spending as well.\n  To those taxpayers who are wondering why there is not more money for \nschools, to repair roads, and build bridges, a large part of the answer \nis the uncontrolled spending of Medicaid.\n  Our Medicaid legislation would have returned power and flexibility to \nthe States, while retaining guarantee of a safety net for the most \nvulnerable populations. It would have helped replace a failed welfare \nsystem in which dependence is measured in generations and illegitimacy \nis the norm, with a system that encourages work and helps keep families \ntogether.\n  But in the past few weeks, it has become clear that the President \ncannot stand the heat of a compromise on Medicaid.\n  For the record, let me point out that President Clinton vetoed a \nwelfare reform last January, H.R. 4, which did not include Medicaid.\n  In doing so, he also vetoed a bill which provided more support, \nincluding child care, for welfare families than his own legislation \ndoes.\n  H.R. 4 did not include Medicaid. But it did include the sweeping \nchild support enforcement reform for which millions of American \nfamilies are waiting. This legislation, again included in S. 1795, goes \nlight years beyond anything the President could ever accomplish solely \nthrough administrative actions.\n  In the meantime, thousands of children have remained in poverty or \nunder the threat of poverty for at least another 6 months because they \nhave not received the cash assistance and medical insurance of their \nabsent parent as a result of President Clinton's vetoes.\n  My Democratic colleagues on the Finance Committee vowed that unless \nwe agreed to drop Medicaid, welfare reform would be lost. To his great \ncredit, the Republican nominee for President, our former colleague and \nmajority leader, Bob Dole, also encouraged us to not allow this dissent \nto keep us from achieving welfare reform.\n  Senator Dole understands that the children and families in poverty \nshould not be forced to wait any longer for welfare reform.\n  In that spirit, we have again agreed to compromise. I support the \nleader's motion to strike Medicaid.\n  Having now removed this stumbling block, it is my hope that the \nadministration will not erect new barriers to welfare reform at the \n11th hour. The children and families who need this legislation should \nnot have to wait any longer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from New York [Mr. \nMoynihan].\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, there will be no objection on this side \nof the aisle to the proposal to strike that will now be made. But may I \npoint out that after a not inconsiderable debate, the Committee on \nFinance, following the lead of its distinguished chairman, voted 17 to \n3 not to strike this measure. But other considerations have appeared.\n  Mr. ROTH. If the distinguished Senator will yield, I would just point \nout that that vote reflects the ideal.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The ideal--we are doing nothing but realities today. I \nthank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici].\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand we could adopt this right \nnow.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think we have to do a couple of things in order to do \nthat. I understand there is no objection to adopting this by voice \nvote?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. None.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is that correct?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If people want to speak, they better show up. There is \nno Senator on this floor wishing to speak on this matter. I have not \nbeen informed of any. I have been told that there might be, but there \ncomes a time when that will no longer do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think we can accommodate them in case they drop along \nand want to talk. If you will give me just 1 minute --I understand we \nwould have to yield back time--let me make this unanimous consent \nrequest first.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Certainly.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending Lott \namendment be deemed agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, the time between now and 2 p.m. be equally divided, and that \nat 2 p.m. the Democratic leader be recognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we have no objection, at least to this \namendment. But does the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee \nnot want to proceed to the matter of striking the Medicaid provision?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is what this does: ``The pending Lott amendment be \ndeemed agreed to.''\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Lott amendment was not to the Byrd but to the \nstrike?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Lott amendment is to strike Medicaid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I think, lest I reveal further ignorance \nin regard to this measure, I had best be silent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Have you ruled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I have no objection.\n\n[[Page S8084]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4894) was agreed to.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The time is under control of \nthe Senator from Delaware or the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we have approximately 45 minutes. I \nwould like to divide that to 27\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana, or anyone he should recognize.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if I might at this point--how \nmuch time would Senator Grassley like?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to have 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 10 minutes to Senator Grassley on our side. I \nassume we should return to your side since we had just spoken. He will \nbe recognized after you have completed yours.\n  I ask unanimous consent that 10 minutes of our time be reserved for \nSenator Grassley and he follow the first Democratic speaker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux] is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, let me start off by saying I support the \neffort of the Senator from New Mexico and chairman of the Finance \nCommittee to separate this welfare reform legislation from the Medicaid \nreform effort that has been worked on by the Members of this body. I \nsay that for just very pragmatic reasons. We need to reform Medicaid. \nWe need to reform welfare. But if we have an agreement on one, do not \nmess it up with another item we do not have an agreement on.\n  This body is not in agreement on what to do with regard to Medicaid. \nI think we are close to reaching an agreement on how to reform the \nwelfare programs in this country, so let us proceed together, \nhopefully, to try to come up with a welfare reform bill that makes \nsense, that both sides of the aisle can support, and, hopefully, one \nthat the President will be able to sign.\n  So, I support the effort to separate the two, and, of course, now \nthat is exactly what has occurred. We are now going to be dealing with \nwelfare reform this afternoon and hopefully finish it up in a timely \nfashion.\n  I think the people of this country--I know the people of Louisiana--\ncertainly know welfare in this country today does not serve well the \npeople who are on it, nor does it serve very well the people who are \npaying for it. It is clear the American people, particularly those \noutside of Washington, are saying to the Congress that we want \nrealistic welfare. We want a welfare reform bill that emphasizes work, \na real welfare reform bill that is more about getting a job and less \nabout just getting a check. They want a welfare reform bill that is \nfair, that emphasizes work, that has time limits, but a welfare reform \nbill that is also good for children.\n  As President Clinton has always said, he wants to reform welfare as \nwe know it. He wants to be tough on work but good for kids. I have said \nyou can say the same thing and come to the same conclusion saying that \nwelfare reform is really about putting work first, but it is also about \nmaking sure we do not put children last. I think, in a bipartisan \nfashion, we should be able to come together and reach those separate \nbut, I think, mutually agreeable goals.\n\n  While Congress has not been able for over a year now to come to an \nagreement on welfare reform, the administration has really not waited \nfor us. If you look at what the administration has done, working with \nthe States, you will see they have really left the Congress behind, \nbecause we have not been able to agree. President Clinton and his \nadministration team has really been working with the States. They have \nnow approved 67 welfare reform plans in 40 different States. Welfare \nreform is occurring, and it is occurring without Congress.\n  It is time that Congress get on the wagon, get on the ball and write \na national program so we do not have to have 67 separate welfare reform \nprograms in 40 different States, many with different types of standards \nand different emphases on what should be done. We should come together \nand write a national welfare reform bill.\n  It is important the Federal Government be involved. In my own State \nof Louisiana, the State puts up 28 percent of the money, approximately. \nThe Federal Government puts up 78 percent. Should not the Federal \nGovernment be involved in welfare reform? If we are raising 78 percent \nof the money that is going to the people of my State, of course, we \nshould be. It is not a question of who does it, it is a question of \nmaking sure everybody does it. It is not a question of whether it is \nrun in Washington or whether it is run by the States, it should be run \nin partnership between the States and the Federal Government, giving \nthe States the maximum amount of flexibility, but also having some \nnational standards because national funds are being contributed to the \nwelfare reform program in all of the various States.\n  So, Mr. President, I think we ought to all agree reform is needed. We \nought to agree we can come up with something the President can sign. \nWe, on this side, will be offering what we now call a ``Work First'' \nwelfare reform bill. It meets the principles of what people in this \ncountry want.\n  No. 1, they want it to have time limits. Welfare should not be \nforever. It should be about getting a job. It should have time limits \nthat are real and realistic. The amendment that we will be offering \nsays that at most, people will be able to be on welfare for a total of \n5 years in their lifetime. Then we give the States authority to make it \nless if they think it is right for their State. We give the State the \nflexibility to do that.\n  Our bill requires work. It is an absolute unconditional requirement \nthat people on welfare move into the work force. There is no more \nunconditional assistance. The goal of welfare reform, under our \nproposal, would be to get people into the private sector and get them a \nreal job. Instead of just getting a check for not working, get them a \njob and then the check will be for working.\n  Our bill says the States should have the maximum amount of \nflexibility. What is good in my State of Louisiana may not work in New \nYork or in any other State in the country, and vice versa. So our \nlegislation gives the States maximum amount of flexibility. What does \nthat mean? It means the States set the benefit level for the people in \nthat State. They will decide how to get people off welfare into a job. \nIt is a State decision. The State will set the sanctions, or the \npenalties, if you will, for those who refuse to go to work. We give the \nStates the flexibility that they need.\n  I think that, however, in many instances, our bills are very similar. \nThe Senate Finance Committee, under the leadership of Senator Roth, has \nmoved in a major way toward a middle ground, a middle proposal. He is \nto be congratulated for that. It is an indication of good faith on his \npart in working with some of us on our side of the aisle to produce a \nbetter bill.\n  What we have to do is to make sure that our goal is to put work first \nbut without putting children last. That is a very important standard \nfor us to meet. We should be as tough as we possibly can be on parents, \nbecause they have a responsibility and are old enough to understand \nwhat that responsibility should be. But there are a lot of innocent \nchildren involved who did not ask to be born and are here because of \nperhaps, in some cases, the fault of their parents, but they are here \nnot because they want to be here necessarily. They are innocent victims \nof welfare problems in this country. Therefore, it is very important \nthat we make sure that we protect children while we are as tough as we \npossibly can be and should be with regard to parents.\n\n  I also point out that our legislation is going to make sure parents \nwho are on welfare or AFDC assistance are eligible for health care in \nthis country. I cannot imagine anybody standing up and saying, ``I'm \ntough on families, but I want to knock them off health care.'' The bill \nthis Congress passed before, by an 87 to 12 margin, guaranteed AFDC \nrecipients would continue to receive Medicaid. This bill does not do \nthat. It is a major change. It says if you knock\n\n[[Page S8085]]\n\nthem off AFDC assistance there is no guarantee they will get health \ncare. I think that is wrong. We are going to have a bipartisan \namendment to correct that. This body should adopt that.\n  I also want to point out that in trying to make sure we protect \nchildren, we ought to take into consideration what happens if we are \nbeing tough on parents and we say that you are off after 2 years, no \nmore assistance, you should be working, what are we going to tell a 2-\nyear-old child of that parent? Are we going to tell them they are not \ngoing to have any more help? Are we going to tell the 2-year-old they \nshould go out and find a job?\n  These are the innocent victims who I think we should work together to \ntry and help. Be as tough as we can on parents, but let's make sure \nthat the innocent child, in many cases almost a baby, is protected.\n  I have an amendment that I will be offering to the bill that says we \nshould have vouchers for children. After the family has been take off \nof AFDC assistance, do not just throw the child out into the street. \nOur amendment is going to provide for noncash vouchers for innocent \nchildren of families who have had welfare terminated.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from New York talking about \nproviding diapers for children. If anybody ever had small children, \ndiapers for children happen to be a pretty important thing in raising a \nchild in a healthy environment. Yes, they could use the noncash \nassistance for diapers, but they could also use it for clothes, they \ncould use it for school supplies, they could use it for medicine, they \ncould use it for food so that a 2-year-old baby does not go hungry \nbecause they have a parent who is not responsible.\n  Again, the emphasis should be as being as tough as we possibly can be \non the parent, but let's not in this body in this prosperous country \nsay we are not going to take care of the innocent child. So our \nvouchers for children will say just that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BREAUX. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. There remains \n17 minutes 23 seconds.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield myself an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the point of the vouchers for children is to say to \nStates, ``Look, if you want to have a 5-year cutoff of an AFDC \nrecipient, you can do that now and you ought to have authority to \nprovide vouchers for kids after that 5-year period, if you cut off a \nfamily or a recipient sooner than 5 years, say maybe 2 years.''\n  In my State, we will do exactly that, which has been approved, a 2-\nyear time limit. But when a State does that, we have a responsibility \nto say that you should be required to provide at least noncash vouchers \nout of the money you are getting for the innocent children.\n\n  We are giving the State the absolute maximum amount of flexibility on \ndesigning that program. The States will be able to decide just about \neverything with regard to how that voucher is going to be handled and \nhow it is going to be awarded.\n  My own State has the highest percentage of children in poverty in the \nNation. Mr. President, 34.5 percent of all the children in my State are \nin poverty. I think we on the Federal level have an obligation to say \nthat they should be taken care of after the parent is told that there \nwill no longer be any cash assistance to that parent.\n  We are not talking about any additional spending by the State or any \nadditional money by the State, we are talking about the money the State \nis going to get under this new block grant. The Federal money and State \nmoney can be combined to provide these vouchers for children, which I \nthink are very, very important. We are talking about giving the State \nthe absolute maximum degree of flexibility on designing how this \nprogram would work. The State would assess the needs of the child. They \nwould set how much that child will be able to get and in what form it \nwould be able to be given. They would set the amount. They would set \nthe type of assistance, but I just do not think that we, as a Nation, \ncan walk away from children who are innocent victims of circumstances \nthat they have absolutely no control over.\n  The Food Stamp Program is going to be addressed. We need to make \nsure, from a Federal level, that it is a responsibility, as it always \nhas been, to design a Food Stamp Program that provides certain \nguarantees in terms of economic downturns by the various States.\n  I think it is incredibly important that the Chafee-Breaux amendment, \ndealing with the Medicaid guarantee, will be addressed in a positive \nfashion. If we can do something positively on the vouchers for \nchildren, I think we can come together on a true, real welfare reform \nbill that this President will be happy to sign.\n  We have to decide whether we want a political issue or whether we \nwant a real bill. There are some Democrats in Congress who say, ``We do \nnot want any bill; we'll do anything we can to stop it, because it is \nnot to our liking 100 percent.''\n  I think there are some on the Republican side who also want to send \nthe bill to the President as bad as they can make it to make sure he \nvetoes it and then blame him for vetoing it. There is a growing number \nin the Senate that wants to work together and come up with something \nthat is doable.\n  So I summarize my points as let us be as tough as we can on the \nparents, let us have time limits, and let us have work requirements, \nand let us give a maximum degree of flexibility to the States to do \nwhat they want, but at the same time let us make sure we protect the \nchildren who are the innocent victims in this entire exercise.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kristen Testa \non my staff, a fellow in my office, be granted floor privileges for the \nduration of the debate on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nIowa has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee that has worked so hard to put these bills on the floor of \nthe Senate, I am very proud, for a third time, to be part of an effort, \nanother effort, I might say, to pass comprehensive welfare reform.\n  We have passed welfare reform on two separate occasions. The \nPresident has vetoed the bill on both of those occasions. So we \nobviously wonder whether or not he wants an issue or whether he wants \nwelfare reform. Does he want a bill or an issue? He said in the \nelection of 1992 that he wanted to end welfare as we know it.\n  For sure, the bills that we passed previously ended welfare as we \nknow it. One bill, part of the 1995 Balanced Budget Act, the first \nBalanced Budget Act Congress would pass in a generation, did welfare \nreform, saving $58 billion, compared to the $53 billion that this bill \nsaves.\n  So maybe the President vetoed that because there was something else \nin that very big Balanced Budget Act that he did not like. Then we took \nthe welfare reform language out of that, and on December 18 passed \nthat, and in early January he vetoed it. So we wonder just exactly what \nkind of welfare reform the President wants that would satisfy his and \nour desire to end welfare as we know it.\n  Until just last weekend, it looked like he would veto the bill that \nwe are talking about today. In his Saturday radio address, however, he \nsaid that the Republican Congress was finally--remember that--finally \nsending him a welfare bill he could sign. That sounds pretty certain, \nright? But it is not so certain, because he has said similar things in \nthe past concerning the Senate-passed bill and the Governors' \nproposals. We do not get a definitive answer--even on this bill--do not \nget a definitive answer of whether he would sign it even after he \ntalked so positively on the radio Saturday. So only time will tell if \nhe will actually sign this bill.\n  The President seems to be able to have it two ways. Through the TV \nmedia and the radio media, he sends a very clear message to the public \nthat he is promoting welfare reform and he is ready to sign something. \nBut then, when you actually try to pin his people down, whether he will \nsign a certain bill, we do not get the answer. So, to the mass of the \npublic, they hear that we have a President leading on welfare\n\n[[Page S8086]]\n\nreform. But the truth is that in the Halls of Congress, there is a \ndragging of feet of whether or not his people will say, yes, he will \nsign it.\n  We passed a previous welfare reform bill by a high bipartisan margin \nof 87 to 12. Like that, this bill that we have before us now creates a \nblock grant to the States to draft their own welfare reform proposals. \nThis eliminates the need to come, hat in hand, on bended knee to the \nFederal Government under current waiver provisions.\n  The President has been touted as signing 67--I do not dispute that--\nfor 40 different States. But still you find an environment today where \nStates have to come on hands and knees to beg for permission to make \nsome change in their welfare system so they can put people to work and \nsave the taxpayers money.\n  So what is different about this approach is that it is \nfinally welfare reform and not just waiver reform. People that do not \nwant to give up the power of Washington to determine everything, their \nproposals tend to be more waiver reform, not welfare reform. Welfare \nreform, in the strictest sense of the word, trusts States.\n\n  Wisconsin is an example. The President, wanting to beat Senator Dole \nto the punch when he knew Senator Dole was going to espouse Wisconsin-\ntype welfare reform, the President said that what Wisconsin is doing is \nwhat we should be doing. And under existing law, Wisconsin comes, hat \nin hand, to the Federal Government begging for a waiver. Now, 60 days \nlater they still do not have their waiver. Yet, the President said, \nflatly, that we ought to be doing what Wisconsin is doing. Within a few \nminutes after that comment that day he was asked, would he sign it, if \nCongress passed what Wisconsin did, and he would not say that he would. \nWe still do not know. For sure, if he likes the Wisconsin approach, why \nhas he not granted Wisconsin's waiver?\n  The importance of this change from waivers to welfare reform or mere \nwaiver reform, which would be nothing compared to welfare reform, is we \ngive power to the States for a very good reason. We passed so-called \nwelfare reform in 1988. It passed this body 96 to 1. It was supposed to \nsave the taxpayers money. It was supposed to move people from welfare \nto work. What do we see 8 years later? Three million-plus more people \non welfare, we have not saved the taxpayers money, and we are not \nmoving people from welfare to work.\n  In the meantime, we have seen States, like Wisconsin, that even the \nPresident said is doing something right--Michigan, Iowa, and a lot of \nother States, we have actually seen them, regardless of the fact that \nthey have had to come to Washington to get permission to do what they \nwanted to do--we are seeing States succeeding where Washington has \nfailed. That is why we have great confidence in what we do, of \nsuggesting welfare reform, welfare to be turned over to the States to \nadminister.\n  My own State of Iowa overwhelmingly passed legislation in April 1993 \nto change welfare in our State. In order to implement that plan, the \nState had to seek 18 initial Federal waivers, and more since. Although \nthe State wanted to implement a statewide plan, they were required to \nhave a control group of between 5 and 10 percent who would remain under \nthe old AFDC policies in order to obtain even this initial waiver.\n  In October 1993, the policies that affected work incentives and \nfamily stability were implemented. At that time, there were over 36,000 \nfamilies receiving assistance in my State with an average monthly \nbenefit of over $373. I just received the latest figures from my State. \nThat caseload of 36,000 is down 12.6 percent to just under 32,000. The \naverage monthly benefit is down 11.7 percent to $330.\n  In January 1994, the State implemented its personal responsibility \ncontracts, in which each family on welfare commits to pursue \nindependence, and the State commits to provide certain supports to move \nthat family from welfare to work. Before the State implemented welfare \nreform, only 18 percent of the welfare families in my State on cash \nassistance had some earned income.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have permission from Senator Domenici, \nthe floor manager of the bill, to yield myself more time. I yield \nmyself 10 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Now, under this new plan people are working. The most \nrecent numbers show that the 18-percent figure has gone to over 33 \npercent of all cash-assisted families in Iowa now having earned income, \nthe highest percentage of any State in the Nation. Now, some have \nattributed this dramatic increase to a strong economy and low \nunemployment rate in my State. However, in this control group that we \nhad to have to satisfy the Washington bureaucrats at HHS, only 19 \npercent of the people in the old program have earned income. That is \nonly 1 percentage point above what it was for a long period of time \nbefore reform in Iowa. So it shows that it takes policies and it takes \nreform, not just a strong economy, to bring about changes of behavior. \nMy State's success demonstrates that giving States freedom and \ndiscretion to create their own programs will be best for the \nconstituents we serve. This bill does that. I firmly believe that State \nleaders are as compassionate and as concerned for those in need as we \nare here at the Federal level.\n  By passing welfare reform that gives more authority to the States, we \nare putting the best interests of our constituents first. Not only \nthat, but by enacting good welfare policy we are also saving the \ntaxpayers some of their hard-earned money. In this package, we save $53 \nbillion over the next 6 years. Much of this savings comes from making \nnoncitizens ineligible for most Federal assistance programs. Even with \nthese savings, spending on major means-tested programs will actually \ngrow 4.3 percent from $99.3 billion in fiscal year 1996 to $127 billion \nin the year 2002. This is a measured approach to reforming our welfare \nsystem. I am pleased to support it.\n  There is a concern that a reduction in funds will hurt low--income \nfamilies. Once again, Iowa serves as an example of what can happen when \nStates are given more freedom to create their own programs. When my \nState implemented welfare reform in October 1993, the monthly payout \nfor the State was $13.6 million. In June of this year, the monthly \npayout was down to $10.5 million, a reduction of almost 23 percent. \nBecause of these savings, the State has been able to put more money \ninto job training and into child care for both those on public \nassistance and those who are low-income working Iowans. This is as it \nshould be.\n  My State and other States are demonstrating their commitment to serve \nthe needs of their respective constituents. Producing savings to better \nserve Iowans is simply a benefit of good policy changes.\n  It is incumbent upon this Congress to try again, then, as we are, to \npass welfare reform that fulfills our promise. In this act we are \nfulfilling our commitment to change welfare as we know it. We are \nfulfilling our commitment to require work for welfare. We are \nfulfilling our commitment to have time-limited assistance.\n  We do not know what the President will do. But just because the \nPresident has trouble keeping his promise does not mean we should have \ntrouble keeping our promise, as Members of the U.S. Senate, to deliver \non our promise of ending welfare as we know it. We are fulfilling our \ncommitments. He will have to reconsider his commitment.\n  I am also supportive, as we have just done, of the striking of the \nMedicaid provisions. I do not like to do that. Striking Medicaid from \nthis bill, no doubt, means any Medicaid reform is dead for this \nCongress. That is too bad because Medicaid definitely needs reform. \nMedicaid is spending too much money. The rate of increase it is \nspending under current law is too rapid to sustain. It is also too \nencumbered with Federal rules and requirements.\n  I remind my colleagues that just 12 months ago Senator Packwood, as \nthen chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was on the floor. He \nheld up a stack of documents just from the State of Oregon--new \nregulations that had been issued just within the previous 6 months, new \nregulations for the State Medicaid Program. That is how complicated and \nirresponsibly administered this program is. Too much control in \nWashington, not enough faith.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n\n[[Page S8087]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, I want to yield to Senator Gregg when you are \nfinished. Can I do that now?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the remainder of time on our side, once Senator \nGrassley is finished, be yielded to Senator Gregg. Then we will have \ncompleted time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. So this Medicaid proposal we had before the Senate \nwould have ended some of that complicated bureaucratic overregulation \nthat has come from the last 30 years under the existing program.\n  There is nothing new with this proposal. We have been back and forth \nover this ground. This bill would have changed a lot of that. What \ndisappoint me most, in the Senate Finance Committee's deliberation on \nMedicaid, we tried in every way possible to satisfy the Democratic \nmembers of our committee. Senator Roth accepted over 50 amendments, \nmany of them retaining Federal protections that the other side wanted, \neven some Republicans wanted. It seems to me Senator Roth went a long \nway toward addressing the major concerns that the minority had and \nmaybe even the President had on the Medicaid portions of the bill.\n  Despite this, not a single Finance Committee Democrat voted for the \nbill.\n  I understand that some of the Republican Governors are not happy with \nthe changes the Finance Committee made to the bill. When we started \ndown this road of Medicaid reform, the idea was that the States would \nbe able to live with less Federal assistance if they had sufficient \ndiscretion to organize their programs as they see fit. The bill filed \nby the Finance Committee does not provide the discretion which most of \nthe Governors were saying earlier this year that they wanted.\n  Perhaps, for that reason, some of the Governors are willing to see \nMedicaid and welfare separated. I don't know.\n  In any case, even with the Democratic amendments accepted by the \nFinance Committee, the Governors would have had substantially greater \ndiscretion than they have now over important aspects of their savings \nif this legislation were enacted. And we would have moved a step closer \nto a balanced budget by getting greater control over the Medicaid \nspending which has been growing in recent years at an unsustainable \nrate.\n  But the minority in the Finance Committee voted against the bill. And \nthe President has said again that he would veto it.\n  So, our leadership has yielded to the inevitable. If there is a \nsilver lining here, it is that we will have a chance to get real \nwelfare reform, assuming that the President is at last willing to sign \na welfare reform bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Gregg has 4 minutes and 32 seconds, \nthe remaining time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his courtesy in \nyielding me this time. I wish to rise to echo much of what has been \nsaid here but also hopefully to expand upon it in an effective way. The \nissue which is being brought forth here is the fundamental issue that \nwe have to address as a Governor. It is the issue of how to control our \nentitlement accounts.\n  I serve on the Appropriations Committee. I have the pleasure to chair \nthe Commerce, State, and Justice Subcommittee. I am constantly \npetitioned by individuals coming to me who represent very legitimate \norganizations, asking that they receive funding at last year's level of \nexpenditure, or maybe even a slight increase, maybe an inflationary \nincrease in their accounts. I have to say to them, ``I am sorry, we are \ngoing to have to reduce this account,'' or in some cases we have to \neliminate spending in that account because we do not have the money \navailable.\n  Why do we not have the money available? Primarily because of the fact \nwe have not been able to control entitlement spending here in our body. \nTherefore, all the effort to control spending in this body falls on the \ndiscretionary side. Entitlement spending, as my colleagues know, is \nmade up of five major items: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, AFDC, \nand earned-income tax credit. There are also the farm programs and a \nvariety of other mandatory programs. In fact, I think there are 400 of \nthem.\n  This Congress, in the balanced budget bill which we sent to the \nPresident, addressed the primary drivers of our spending problem on the \nentitlement side. We addressed Medicaid, we addressed Medicare, we \naddressed welfare, we addressed AFDC, we addressed the farm program. We \ndid not take up the Social Security issue because that had been moved \noff the table. Regrettably, the balanced budget proposal which was \npassed by this Congress was vetoed by the President.\n  So we have now proceeded to take up these items one at a time. There \nwas a legitimate effort and a very good effort made in the farm area. \nIt did not go as far as I would like on issues like sugar and peanuts, \nbut it did make significant strides.\n  However, there remains the core issues of the health care accounts, \nSocial Security, and welfare. So today we take up one more leg of the \nschool of entitlement spending which must be addressed and shored up, \nif it is to be stable, and that is the welfare issue.\n  I regret, however--and I want to talk about this--that we have not \naddressed, also, the Medicaid accounts. It is very hard, logically, to \nseparate these two because Medicaid is the health care benefit for \npeople who are essentially on welfare. To separate them is to do \nsomething which, from a matter of substantive policy, makes little \nsense. It may make sense politically, because the administration and \nthe other side of the aisle refuse to address Medicaid. More important, \nit makes no sense from a standpoint of how it affects our day-to-day \nlife in this Congress in the area of controlling the Federal budget, \nbecause Medicaid is a much more significant problem than welfare in the \narea of spending. In fact, Medicaid spending, over the last 5 years, \nwas $464 billion. But if we do nothing about it over the next 5 years, \nit will be projected to be $802 billion. That is a 73--percent increase \nin spending on those accounts.\n  Now, at that rate of increase, we would soon see--it is projected--\nthat by the year 2010, all the revenues of the Federal Government would \nbe absorbed in order to pay for the costs of the entitlement programs: \nMedicaid, Medicare, Social Security, welfare benefits, and interest on \nthe Federal debt. We would have no money available to do discretionary \nactivities, such as defense spending, roads, environment, or education.\n  So this Congress needs to address all those different entitlement \naccounts. Yet, it has decided not to address the Medicaid accounts--not \nbecause this side is not willing; this side is willing to do that. We \nproposed a bill which addressed it that was vetoed by the President. We \nreported out of the committee another bill which would have addressed \nit. The other side of the aisle is not amenable to this.\n  Therefore, our failure to address the Medicaid account is, in my \nopinion, a fundamental failure to do the job that is required of us as \nMembers of this Congress, because it is a failure to address what is \none of the core issues that is driving the deficit of this country and \ndriving the fact that this Nation is headed toward fiscal bankruptcy in \nthe next century, unless we take control back of these entitlement \naccounts.\n  I, therefore, am one who feels that we should have joined the \nefforts. We should have brought welfare and Medicaid to the floor \ntogether, and we should pass them together. But the decision has been \nmade to pursue this welfare reform package.\n  I simply want to say that, even though it does not include Medicaid \nas a package, it is a step in the right direction. Although it still \nhas more strings attached than there need to be, it is a package which \nreturns to the States pretty much authority over the management of the \nwelfare accounts in this country. That is the essence of our effort, to \ntake a program that has been an entitlement, directed at the Federal \nlevel, and turn it back to the States as a discretionary program, and \nbasically allow the States to manage it in a way that is much more \nefficient and effective.\n  In New Hampshire, the dollars that come back to the States without \nstrings will be spent much more effectively than those that come back \nwith strings. It will be able to take care of more people for fewer \ndollars than is\n\n[[Page S8088]]\n\npresently occurring under the system as it functions today.\n\n  I, therefore, strongly support the welfare part of this \nreconciliation bill. I regret that we are not taking up what I consider \nto be one of the other core elements that is driving our fiscal \nproblems in this country--the Medicaid issue. I hope that as we move \ninto this election cycle, however, we will not ignore those issues that \nare critical in getting this fiscal house in order, such as Medicaid, \nMedicare, and the Social Security issue, as we move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The minority \nleader or his designee has 7 minutes, 30 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. President, I support the motion to strike the Medicaid provisions \nof the pending bill, thereby providing for a realistic change of \nhistoric welfare reform becoming law this year.\n  This is something I have supported for some time. I joined with \nSenator Bond in 1994 to introduce the first bipartisan welfare reform \nplan that required responsibility from day one. Last year, I worked \nwith Republican and Democratic colleagues to craft a bipartisan \ncompromise that passed the Senate by a vote of 87-12. This year, I have \nbeen pushing to free welfare reform from controversial proposals to cut \nnursing home and other health care in Medicaid.\n  In May, I offered an amendment to the budget resolution calling for \nthe separation of welfare from Medicaid. Although my effort at that \ntime was defeated, I am pleased that it looks like that change is \nagreed to here today, and we do have them separately.\n  Mr. President, there is no doubt that the current welfare system is \nbroken and in desperate need of reform. It is failing the people on it \nand the taxpayers who provide the money to finance it. We need to \nchange it, and we should do it, as we did last year, with bipartisan \ncooperation.\n  No one has a corner on good ideas, and by putting partisan politics \naside and working together, we can forge a bill that makes common \nsense. For the past few years, I have talked, from time to time, about \nthe need to enact bipartisan welfare reform, which demands \nresponsibility from day one, requires work, and releases welfare \nfamilies from the cycle of dependency.\n  The Iowa Family Investment Program, I believe, provides us with an \neffective model for achieving these goals. Since Iowa began \nimplementing welfare reforms in October 1993, the number of people \nworking has almost doubled, the welfare caseload has declined, and \nwelfare costs are down. I call that a triple play. In fact, I am proud \nof the fact that our State of Iowa, right now, has a higher percentage \nof people on welfare who work than any State in the Nation. I believe \nthat is because of the historic welfare reform that we passed in 1993.\n  Mr. President, there are other good reasons to look at the Iowa \nexperience as we craft legislation. I commend the Iowa experience to my \ncolleagues. In 1993, Iowa enacted sweeping changes to the welfare \nsystem, and did so with very strong bipartisan support. In fact, the \nIowa plan received only one dissenting vote from the 150-member \nDemocratically controlled general assembly, and it was signed into law \nby our Republican Governor. So it shows that it is possible to work \ntogether on welfare reform, and the State of Iowa is better because of \nit.\n  In 1994, I sought to take a page from the Iowa playbook and went to \nwork with my Republican colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, to \ndevelop bipartisan welfare reform legislation modeled on innovations \noccurring in our respective States. The result was the first bipartisan \nwelfare reform legislation in that session of Congress. The bill was \nreintroduced last year.\n  The centerpiece of the Iowa program is the family investment \nagreement.\n  In order to receive aid, all welfare recipients are required to sign \na binding contract which outlines the steps that each individual family \nwill take to move off of welfare and a date when welfare benefits will \nend.\n  Last September, I offered, and the Senate adopted, an amendment to \ninclude such a requirement in our bipartisan bill that passed by a vote \nof 87 to 12. Unfortunately this provision was dropped in the conference \nwith the House.\n  Later today, I will again, hopefully with bipartisan support, once \nagain try to include a provision which requires individuals to sign a \npersonal responsibility contract as a condition of receiving benefit. I \ncan tell you these contracts are working in Iowa. In fact, I frequently \nvisit with welfare recipients and caseworkers to ask about the \ncontracts. An overwhelming majority say it is positive and very helpful \nin charting the course for a family to move off of welfare and to keep \non track.\n  While there are many positive features in this bill that we have \nbefore us, from requiring work to increased child care funding to child \nsupport enforcement improvements, I have concerns about some \nprovisions, and I hope we can work together to improve them. I will not \ngo into all of them. But I want to say that some of the cuts in \nnutrition really do not have anything to do with welfare reform, and I \nthink are more designed to reach arbitrary budget savings. We cannot \nback off of our commitment to child nutrition. It will cost us more \nmoney in the long run.\n  I also have concerns about assuring that we maintain basic health and \nsafety standards for child care. I think the work first substitute is \nfar superior to the committee reported bill. It addresses my concerns, \nand it also includes a strong contract requirement as well as making \nour Iowa program a model that other States might adopt. It also \nmaintains our commitment to child nutrition and preserving important \nprotections for children.\n  Senator Daschle will be offering this substitute shortly. As one of \nhis cosponsors, I believe it deserves the support of all Senators. It \nis tough on work while protecting kids. And that is common sense.\n  Mr. President, if there is one lesson to be learned from the past \nyear and a half it is this: Confrontation and partisanship is a \nprescription for failure. The only way we can truly accomplish welfare \nreform this year is to stop the political games and join forces across \nthe aisle to craft a bipartisan welfare reform which accomplishes the \ngoals that the American people support--a welfare system that puts \npeople to work, and gets them off public assistance quickly, fairly, \nand permanently.\n  The adoption of this amendment to take up stand-alone welfare reform \nmoves in that direction of bipartisanship, and I hope that as we \nproceed on this bill we will continue to work in this spirit--a spirit \nof bipartisanship--to craft and pass a bill so we can finally achieve \nneeded reform in the area of welfare.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The minority leader, Senator \nDaschle, is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, thank you.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4897\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk. I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Daschle), for himself, \n     Mr. Breaux, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Ford, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n     Reid, and Mr. Kerrey, proposes an amendment numbered 4897.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, let me begin by commending the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa for his excellent statement just now. \nHe has indicated, in much the same way that I intend to give, the \nreasons for supporting the work first bill, and his concerns about the \npending bill as it has been reported out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  There are many Members in our caucus that I would like to single out \npublicly, and applaud for their remarkable effort and the tremendous \nwork that they have dedicated to this whole issue\n\n[[Page S8089]]\n\nand to the determination they have shown to pass a meaningful welfare \nreform bill this year.\n  Let me begin with the distinguished Senator from Maryland, Barbara \nMikulski, and the distinguished Senator as well from Louisiana, John \nBreaux, who were extraordinarily helpful to the leadership all the way \nthrough our deliberations and have provided remarkable leadership in \ntheir own right. I thank them for that. I appreciate very much their \nassistance in so many ways. The Senator from Connecticut, Chris Dodd, \nand the Senator from North Dakota, Byron Dorgan, and so many of our \ncolleagues who are listed today as cosponsors have also been extremely \nhelpful.\n  While we have all put an effort into the issue of welfare reform, I \nshould say that no one in our caucus, I daresay in the Senate, has been \nmore vocal and more of a student of this issue than the senior Senator \nfrom New York, Senator Moynihan. He is not on the floor at this moment. \nBut I also want to commend him for the real leadership and the \nwillingness that he has demonstrated throughout to hold this body to a \nset of principles, and in a sense to be the conscience of the Senate \nwhen it comes to welfare. He is indeed the conscience of the Senate \nwhen it comes to this issue, and no one has dedicated more years--in \nfact, I would say more decades--to the issue of welfare and the ways in \nwhich to address many of the social ills of our country in an effective \nway as he has.\n  Madam President, I have two charts here that I just want to address \nvery briefly. I have listened with some interest to the comments made \nby colleagues on both sides of the aisle. While, obviously, there are \nissues that divide us, there are many things that unite us. One of the \nthings that unites us I think is an awareness of the degree to which \ncurrent welfare recipients face barriers of all kinds as they attempt \nto confront the real changes that they face in their own lives.\n  The effort to understand those barriers at the beginning through a \nbetter realization of how we address those barriers in an effective way \nthrough public policy are all listed on this chart. This chart outlines \nthe barriers identified in a study released last year by the Child Care \nTrends organization. I think it is very constructive to note that of \nall the barriers that exist today, the biggest barrier of all is child \ncare. The realization that people are not willing to leave their child \nhome alone, that young children demand and, indeed, deserve to be cared \nfor and protected, and that there has to be some confidence that \nchildren will find a way with which to be fed and cared for in a \nmeaningful way. But child care without exception is by far the largest \nbarrier that we face in encouraging and finding ways in which to bring \nabout more work for welfare recipients today.\n  The second is personal--personal problems; struggle, most likely \nrelated to job skills; problems that they have had going all the way \nback to perhaps even their failures in education. But the realization \nthat unless they develop better job skills and better personal skills \nin order to be more competitive is something that over one-fourth of \nall recipients say is the problem that leads them to welfare \ndependency.\n  Obviously, there are other issues. I will not go into all of them. \nSome people simply cannot find work. I know of a lot of South Dakotans \nwho live on Indian reservations where unemployment is 80 percent, and \nthere, frankly, is no job on a reservation in large measure that will \nbring people to a better opportunity for work than the one they have.\n  Pregnancy is a problem; inability to work because of disabilities; \nand, obviously, there is a motivation question in some cases.\n  So, if we are going to devise a bill that will deal with the \nbarriers, we have to devise a bill that deals with all of the different \ncircumstances that welfare recipients find themselves in. We have to \nensure that there is motivation to give them some sense that they do \nnot have the luxury of being unmotivated; that we have to deal with \nchild care; we have to deal with job skills; we have to find ways with \nwhich to ensure that, if work is not there, we will find work for them.\n  So we want to do as many things as possible to ensure that welfare \nrecipients no longer face the barriers that they are facing. That \nreally is what unites Republicans and Democrats, and brings us to the \neffort that is underway in both the House and the Senate this \nafternoon.\n  Madam President, there are a number of areas--and a number of our \ncolleagues have already addressed them--that have been improved in the \npending legislation. There are significant improvements, and we have \ncounted perhaps as many as two dozen improvements in the current bill \nover what was originally proposed last year. There certainly has been \nsignificant progress.\n  I heard the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee address \nmany of the improvements that are made in this legislation. We still \nbelieve, however, with all of the improvements, there are some very \nserious deficiencies we have to address. And in an effort to lay down \nthe marker, to find a way with which to make a comparison between the \npending legislation and what ideally Democrats would like to see as a \nmeaningful comprehensive welfare reform approach, we are now offering \nwhat we call the work first II plan. We have also made improvements. We \nhave also addressed deficiencies that have been raised over the last 12 \nmonths. We have also tried to find ways with which to come to the \nmiddle, and, even though we thought we were in the middle from the very \nbeginning, maybe a better phrase would be to compromise with our \nRepublican colleagues in a way that addresses their concerns and brings \nto a higher level of priority some of the concerns that have been \nraised by critics of welfare reform in the past.\n  So we today propose the work first plan which provides for \nconditional assistance of limited duration, which provides work first \nfor all able-bodied recipients, which turns welfare offices into \nemployment offices, and which guarantees child care assistance.\n  If I could say what our goal ought to be, regardless of what approach \nwe might take, I hope we would all agree on three important goals: \nfirst and foremost, providing the assurance that people will have the \nability to get a good job, first by the acquisition of skills, and, \nsecond, by the acquisition of whatever necessary means it may require \nto ensure that they have access to good jobs. Turning welfare offices \ninto employment offices ought to be what welfare is all about.\n  Secondly, we want to ensure that we are protecting children, that we \nare not going to punish them, that we will not hold vulnerable \nindividuals in a way that would jeopardize their future, that would \ncondemn them to the same cycle of dependency that their parents and \ngrandparents and great grandparents have experienced.\n  So protecting children ought to be our second goal--fortifying them, \nstrengthening them, empowering them to do things that they may not \notherwise be able to do on their own.\n  Third, we believe there are ways in which to save Federal tax \ndollars. We believe we can provide a welfare system that is more \nefficient, that saves resources in ways that can be better spent, \nfirst, in welfare but also in the vast array of other responsibilities \nwe have at the Federal level.\n  So in a sense, Madam President, that is exactly what the work first \nbill does. It provides work; it provides job skills to get work; it \nprotects children; and it saves money. In fact, it saves about $51 \nbillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO scores \nour plan as real reform. The CBO says that we have sufficient resources \nto put welfare recipients to work, one of the goals.\n  In addition, we provide sufficient resources to pay for child care to \nassist states in meeting the work rates, to pay for the other major \nresponsibilities that we see shared at both the State and the Federal \nlevel.\n  Unlike our plan, the CBO does not say the same about the Republican \nplan. CBO says that States will just take the penalties that are \nincorporated in the Republican plan; that they will not put people to \nwork; that they will not meet the work rates; that they will not \nfundamentally change the current system. The Congressional Budget \nOffice says that about the Republican plan, about the Finance Committee \npassed plan, not about our plan.\n  Under our plan, the work first plan of 1996, we do some of the same \nthings that the Republican plan does. We provide conditional assistance \nof limited\n\n[[Page S8090]]\n\nduration. We require that there be work for all able-bodied welfare \nrecipients. We turn welfare offices, in other words, into employment \noffices. And we guarantee child care assistance.\n\n  Those are the fundamental principles of the work first plan. Our plan \nanswers three key questions: Does it require welfare recipients to look \nfor a job? The answer is yes, unequivocally. Second, does it require \nwelfare recipients to work? The answer is yes, unequivocally. Finally, \ndoes it help welfare recipients retain a job? Again, the answer is yes, \nunequivocally.\n  Under our plan, there is no more unconditional assistance. From the \nvery first day parents are going to be required to sign a contract. It \nis a blueprint for employment. They must sign it to receive any \nassistance whatsoever. Under the Republican plan, there is no contract \nat all.\n  For the first 2 months, our plan calls for extensive job search. We \nget the most job-ready into the work force that we can, that is, the \nmore people that come into the welfare offices looking for help, the \nwhole design is to find them help not with a welfare check but with a \njob, with assistance to get that job. If within 3 months a parent is \nnot working or is not in job training or education, that parent must \nperform community service. They do not have the option. They are \nrequired to perform community service within a 3-month period of time.\n  Within 3 months, our plan, in other words, has a work requirement. It \nmay surprise some that there is no work requirement of that kind in the \nRepublican plan. There is no similar provision. We see a lot of tough \ntalk but no actual work requirement for 2 years under the Republican \nplan.\n  So there you have one of the very significant differences between the \nwork first plan, which is work in 3 months, and the Republican plan \nwhich is only work after 24 months or 2 years. That is 2 years of \nunconditional assistance under the Republican plan as it is currently \nwritten.\n  Our plan is tough on parents, Madam President, but not on children. \nAnd that in our view is the second big difference between ours and \ntheirs. Our plan protects children. Child care for parents who are \nrequired to work and parents transitioning from welfare to work is \nsomething we want to do in every possible instance. We want to provide \nvouchers for children whose families have reached the time limit.\n  We recognize that in some cases you are going to bump up to the time \nlimit and then it begs the question, what happens to the kids? Are the \nkids also going to be penalized through no fault of their own? And if \nthey are penalized, are they then relegated once more to this \nneverending cycle of dependency and poverty with no hope of bringing \nthemselves out?\n  Health care coverage for children whose families have reached the \ntime limit is something that we think is vital if we are going to \nprovide meaningful, comprehensive assistance that deals with the \nchallenges we talked about earlier.\n  It seems to us that Republicans may not want to do this. They end up \naiming at the mother but in some cases hitting the child. They do not \nallow their block grant funds to be used to help children whose \nfamilies have reached the 5-year time limit. They do not guarantee \nchild care. They do not guarantee health care. Their idea of a safety \nnet is a sieve. There are so many holes in that safety net there is no \npossibility that people who are trying to work their way through the \nsystem can protect their kids and ensure that they have the competence \nto go out and get a good job.\n  The work first plan targets the specific barriers, in other words, \nMadam President, that we feel must be addressed if we are going to be \nsuccessful in passing a meaningful comprehensive, successful welfare \nreform plan this year. In child care, we provide $8 billion in new \nresources. That is $16 billion total because that is what we are told \nwill be required if, indeed, we want to provide the services to those \ndirectly affected. Unlike the Republican plan, the Congressional Budget \nOffice says we sufficiently fund child care to make the work rates and \nassist those transitioning from welfare to work. The Republican plan \ncannot make that claim. They recognize, if CBO is to be the guide, that \nthey fall short in providing the necessary resources to ensure that the \nchild care services are going to be provided.\n  Our plan also targets aid to the working poor so they will not have \nto turn to welfare or return to welfare at some later date.\n  The second barrier that I addressed just a moment ago is personal \nreasons. Many welfare recipients cite personal reasons for not working, \nlike the lack of transportation or no job skills. The money to tear \ndown these barriers is something that has to be provided in a welfare \nreform plan--money for transportation, resources for job training, \nresources it takes to create their own plans to put people to work. In \nother words, to be honest and to recognize that unless we have the \nability to deal directly with those reasons that welfare recipients \ngive for their inability to get a job--their inability to get to a job, \ntheir inability to qualify for a job, their inability to demonstrate \nthat they have the personal skills to hold a job--we are not going to \nchange this welfare dependency regardless of all of our good \nintentions.\n  So, we address those. We address those personal reasons that welfare \nrecipients have given time and time again. For those who are \nunmotivated, our answer is very simple. We say the time limit is going \nto be there and you are going to have to accept it. You have a \ntimeframe within which you must get a job. You have a timeframe within \nwhich you must realize the benefits are going to stop.\n  Unless you are unwilling to work with us, you can expect we will work \nwith you to address your motivation and problems of the past. We can \nhelp you get job skills. We can help you get child care. But you have \nto reciprocate. You have to find ways in which you can prove to us you \nare motivated and you want to get that job as badly as we want to get \nyou one. So dealing with the unmotivated is something we feel has to be \naddressed.\n  We also address the barriers the Republican plan does not. The \nCongressional Budget Office says the Republican plan will not meet the \nwork rates that we all are stipulating or stating as our objective in \ndealing with welfare reform. The Congressional Budget Office says the \nRepublican plan falls far short on child care.\n  Clearly the Republican plan needs to be improved in a number of \nareas, and that is our whole purpose: To lay down in a comprehensive \nway, in one bill, all of the areas that we believe would allow us, as \nDemocrats and Republicans, adequately to address the deficiencies and \nwork together to solve them.\n  There is a lot of common ground, as I said just a moment ago, on \nwelfare reform. We all want to reform welfare. We all want to end \nwelfare the way we knew it. We all want able-bodied welfare recipients \nto work. There ought to be no unconditional assistance. We largely \nagree with that. But not welfare reform on the backs of children. That \nmay be an area where there is some disagreement. There are over 8 \nmillion children today who receive welfare. It is the children that we \nfeel the need to protect, infants and toddlers who do not know what \nwelfare is ought not to be penalized. They ought to be held harmless in \nthis effort to try to help their families and their parents.\n  So, Madam President, this is an opportunity. It is an opportunity to \ncome to the middle. It is an opportunity to address what we consider to \nbe a bill that yet, in spite of its improvements, still has some \nserious deficiencies that need to be addressed if, indeed, we are going \nto pass this legislation and have it signed into law.\n  The President has made it very clear he will not be hesitant to veto \na bad bill. On the other hand, he has also made it clear that he would \nlike very much to work with Republicans and Democrats to sign a good \nbill. We have an opportunity this afternoon, tonight, and tomorrow, to \nmake this bill a good one. Passage of this amendment would do just \nthat.\n  So we hope Republicans will join Democrats in supporting the work \nfirst amendment: To save the $51 billion we know we can save if we do \nit right and still protect the children, to fundamentally change the \nwelfare system as we know it and to recognize we simply cannot do it on \nthe backs of children.\n  A tremendous amount of effort has gone into this whole project. I am, \nindeed, very grateful to my colleagues\n\n[[Page S8091]]\n\nfor their help and all the leadership they have demonstrated in \nbringing us to this point. I urge its adoption. I urge bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I will be delighted to yield to one of the coauthors of the \nlegislation, the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question? Will the Senator \nyield for a question? Just a brief one?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Of course.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We do not have the amendment. We understand it is 800 \npages long and we have not seen it. Does anybody know where we could \nget a copy of it?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We will get you a copy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You will get us a copy? Thank you very much. Thank you, \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I am proud to join the Democratic \nleader and Senator Breaux in offering this substitute amendment, the \nWork First Act of 1996. As one of the coauthors of this amendment, \nworking with Senator Daschle and Senator Breaux, I want to say it does \nreform welfare. It embodies the principles of turning the welfare \nsystem into an employment system, of being firm on work, and of \nproviding a safety net for children. It recognizes that child care is \nthe linchpin between welfare and work. And it puts men back into the \npicture.\n  We do it very straightforwardly. We do it by replacing AFDC with \ntemporary employment assistance, which is time-limited and conditional. \nWe require all parents on welfare to sign a parent empowerment \ncontract, which is their plan for moving from welfare to work, and \nwhich also emphasizes their role and responsibility in child rearing. \nWe advocate not only moving people to work, but we do it by providing \nthe tools to move people to work, through child care assistance, \ntransitional Medicaid coverage, and other work-related services. We \nalso require a safety net for children with child care funding, a \nguarantee of health care, and noncash aid where it is needed to meet \nthe specific needs of each child. In the event the parents do not meet \ntheir responsibilities, we are not going to punish the child for the \nfailings of the mother. We also eliminate the cruel and punitive rule \ncalled the ``man in the house'' rule and allow States to offer job \nplacement services to fathers. The Work First Act is a plan that is \ntough on work but not tough on kids.\n  It is important to note the bill before us today is much improved \nover the Republican plan which the Senate considered last year. Many of \nthe provisions included in the Democratic work first bill from last \nyear have been incorporated into this version.\n  I am particularly pleased that earlier Republican efforts to block \ngrant child protection programs--to take the child protection programs \nand turn them into a block grant--have been abandoned. This is an issue \nof special importance to me. I worked as a child abuse and child \nneglect worker, and I know how crucial those programs are. It was \nabsolutely crucial this bill maintain those protections. I thank \nSenator Chafee and all those on the other side of the aisle who worked \non that. I want to acknowledge the Senator from Maine for her \nparticular role in that advocacy.\n  I believe the changes that have been made to last year's Republican \nbill has brought us a long way. The pending bill is no longer the \npunitive one that was brought to the floor last year.\n  But I do believe improvement needs to be made. That is why we are \noffering the work first amendment. This amendment is the result of \nongoing efforts to find the sensible center. We listened to the \nconcerns raised about the work first bill in last year's debate. So we \ntightened up our plan, and we save more money. We save some $51 \nbillion. We also heard the voices of the Governors, and in response \nmade sure our plan provided greater flexibility for the States to \ndesign their own programs. I believe our plan is a stronger plan as a \nresult.\n  In drafting our amendment, we emphasize two clear priorities. First, \nwe wanted to emphasize work as the goal of any welfare program. Second, \nwe wanted to protect children and provide a safety net for them.\n  First and foremost, our plan is about the empowerment of people, not \nthe enlargement of bureaucracy. Empowering people has become almost a \ncliche. What does empowerment mean? Empower means that you give people \ntools to get ready for a job, to obtain a job, and to keep a job. We \nthink you have to be in job training and we emphasize the job training \nmust immediately lead to work.\n  I do believe the best social program is a job; one that moves a \nperson from welfare to work, and to a better life for themselves and \ntheir families. That is what we hope to do.\n  Work is the cornerstone of our plan. The first step for any welfare \nrecipient will be to sign an empowerment contract, which is a contract \noutlining a plan to get into the work force. Our plan ensures that \npeople live up to their contract by requiring recipients to engage in \nan intensive job search, ending assistance to those who refuse to \naccept a legitimate job offer, and providing a 5-year time limit for \nbenefits.\n  We give the States the resources and the flexibility to help people \nmeet the terms of their empowerment contract, whether it is job search \nassistance, on the job training, placement vouchers or even wage \nsubsidies.\n  This emphasis on work changes the whole culture of welfare by saying \nwelfare should not be a way of life but a way to a better life. We want \nto turn welfare offices into employment offices, by changing the focus \nto looking for work rather than looking for benefits.\n  But while we are making work the top priority, we also look out for \nthe children with a safety net that provides child care, health care \nand protections from child abuse. We recognize that lack of child care \nis the biggest obstacle to work; to both getting a job and keeping one. \nSo our bill provides $16 billion in child care funds for those required \nto work, for those transitioning to work, and for the working poor so \nthey don't slide into welfare.\n  We also make sure that every child has access to health care; that \nthey get their immunizations; that they get their early detection and \nscreening so that their parents are not only work-force ready, but the \nchildren are learning ready when they go to school and stay in school.\n  We maintain that Federal commitment to fight child abuse by requiring \nStates to meet Federal standards in child welfare and foster care \nprograms. We also reauthorize the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment \nAct.\n  Child abuse and neglect is growing like an epidemic. Just like we \nneed to end welfare abuse, we need to end the abuse of children. With \nchild protection systems overwhelmed, and half the States under court \norder because of the way they handle child protection, we must do all \nwe can to make sure no one gets away with abusing or neglecting a \nchild.\n  Madam President, we also provide a safety net for children. I believe \nthat most welfare recipients will move to work and take advantage of \nthe opportunities in this bill. But if they do not, we are not going to \npunish the child. We are not going to aim at a parent and hit the \nchild. So we require the States to assess the needs of children in \nfamilies who have reached the time limit, and to provide noncash aid, \nfor example, vouchers to a third party, to meet the basic subsistence \nneeds of children. States will have the flexibility to design this \nprogram, but we believe the Federal requirement is needed to make sure \nthat children do not pay the price when parents are unable to move from \nwelfare to work.\n  Because we value family, marriage, and work, we know the strongest \nfamily is one with two parents, with the father in the home. So the \nwork first amendment brings men back into the family by ending rules \nwhich create a marriage penalty if poor people get married and stay \nmarried.\n  Our bill is also tough on child support. It requires Federal and \nState governments to work together to enforce child support orders, \nstreamlines the process to collect child support checks, and calls on \nStates to implement tough procedures to make sure that parents do live \nup to their responsibilities. We, the Democrats, believe that if you \nare a deadbeat parent, you should not have a driver's license or a \nprofessional license, and so we call on States to implement procedures \non that.\n\n[[Page S8092]]\n\n  Madam President, I hope we adopt this work first amendment. It is an \namendment which pulls together the best ideas of both parties. It ends \nthe cycle of poverty and the culture of poverty.\n  It is a plan that saves lives, saves taxpayers dollars, creates \nopportunities for work and protects the children.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I yield 15 minutes of our hour to the \nSenator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the welfare \nbill that is before us. Let's put it simply: Our current welfare system \nis broken. It is broken. We have recognized that. This Chamber passed a \nwelfare reform bill 87 to 12. I want to raise the question, did my \ncolleagues who overwhelmingly support this bill vote for that because \nit was a bill that was going to punish people or did they recognize \nthat the system is broken and is in need of repair--87 to 12?\n  Let me say something. The welfare system was never intended to become \na way of life. It was meant as a temporary haven for rough times to \nassist people, and after 30 years, it has expended $5 trillion, and the \nwelfare system still does not work. It entraps people, and the results \nhave been a horror.\n  The fact of the matter is that we have to do better than \nsloganeering. We have to do better than saying ``ending welfare as we \nknow it'' is a priority. The President has said that. But we need \naction, we need real action, and the one thing we do not need to do is \nto empower the bureaucracy here in Washington, because some of my \ncolleagues are advocating that we give and make the czarina of HHS, the \nczarina who will have absolute authority as it relates to the \nadministration of welfare programs in our States.\n  All of a sudden, we have adopted an attitude that somehow the \nGovernors of our States, Democrats and Republicans, and the \nlegislatures of our States are inhuman, that they do not have the \ncapacity to do what is right, that they would threaten our children, \nthreaten our seniors, threaten the elderly.\n  Madam President, that is not correct; that is not true. But I will \ntell you what I do believe. I believe that most of the Governors and \nmost of the State legislatures are saying, ``Set us free. Let us help \nour people help themselves. Help us help encourage a work ethic.''\n  The fact of the matter is, this bill is very similar to last year's \nbill which passed overwhelmingly. There are some myths that say we will \nhurt children. That happens not to be the case. I am going to touch on \nsome of these things, but let me say something. No less than a great \nPresident known for his compassion for immigrants, for poor people, for \nworking people, for the downtrodden than Franklin Delano Roosevelt said \nit best when he talked about welfare. He said:\n\n       If people stay on welfare for prolonged periods of time, it \n     administers a narcotic to their spirit, and this dependence \n     on welfare undermines their humanity, makes them wards of the \n     state and takes away their chance at America.\n\n  Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I do not believe any of us can say it \nbetter. I am not going to attempt to say it better. I refer to a great \nAmerican, a great President, the man who had every bit as much \ncompassion for those in need as anybody who warned us and gave us the \nadmonition of watching about entrapping people and killing their \nspirit, the American spirit.\n\n  Madam President, the current system has created a culture of \ndependence that has doomed an entire generation of children, and it has \nconsigned them to poverty. Some people do not like to lose control. \nThey are more worried about their power and their control in terms of \nwhat has taken place. They seem to be blind to that. Somehow we are \ngoing to make it worse. How can we make it worse?\n  Look at the statistics. Look at the out-of-wedlock births that \ncontinue to rise. Look at the cycle of dependency. The current system \nprovides a basis for, if not encouragement of, irresponsible behavior, \nparticularly in the area of out-of-wedlock births.\n  This is a strong bill. Is it a perfect bill? Of course not, but it is \nan attempt to strike a balance between giving power to the States and \nto local communities to set expectations for work and responsibility, \nlimiting benefits as it relates to time and maintaining a safety net \nfor children and hardship cases. This bill maintains that safety net.\n  Let's take a look at the record. A great Governor in our State, Al \nSmith, said that sometimes people do not like to look at the record \nbecause it can prove to be embarrassing. There are facts in these \nrecords. If we look over the last 15 years, we will see an increase in \nwelfare spending that is absolutely startling.\n  Our expenditures have risen from $27 billion in 1980--$27 billion \nwhen I came here to the Senate--to $128 billion. Have we improved the \nlot of those on welfare? I do not think so.\n  While the bill converts the AFDC Program, the Aid to Families with \nDependent Children Program, to a block grant that we have heard so much \nabout--``No, don't give a block grant, you're going to be giving it to \nthe Governors.'' We are not giving it to the Governors. What we are \ndoing is turning over responsibility to those closest to the people who \nhave seen how badly the system has been administered, how flawed it is, \nhow it does not give flexibility to deal with the human needs of our \ncitizens.\n  While it makes a block grant, it provides $4 billion in extra money, \nnot less. Four billion dollars in extra funds will be available to help \nwelfare clients hold a job, and it provides up to 20 percent of the \ncaseload will be exempt from time limits, so that if there are those \npeople with special needs who cannot hold a job, who cannot work, who \nare going to have to stay on welfare beyond 2 years or beyond 5 years, \nit does exactly that, it gives to the States flexibility.\n  The bill addresses a small but very growing problem of immigrants' \nuse of welfare. I, being the grandson of immigrants, understand the \ngreat culture that we have in this country due to our immigration and \nto our diversity of cultures, and it has contributed to the strength of \nAmerica. I do not want to stop immigration to this country, but I have \nto tell you, we have seen lately a situation that has developed where \nwe have 3 percent of the population, and that is what the foreign-born \npopulation is; the immigrant population over the age of 65 now \nconstitutes over 30 percent--30 percent--of the elderly receiving SSI \nbenefits. Something is terribly wrong, and we have found, through \nhearings, what is taking place.\n  There are those people who are gaming the system. They sign up to \nbring elderly people in and say they are going to be responsible for \nthem, and they put them right on welfare. That is not right. That is \nnot what this system is about. We did not design the system to say, \n``Come here and get welfare benefits, and John Q. Public, hard-working \nmiddle-class families, are going to pay for it.''\n\n  There is a question of, are we going to hurt the children? Let me \ntell you something. We guarantee that school lunch programs will be \ncontinued for the children of those who are born here and for immigrant \nchildren as well. We understand our responsibility. I thank the \nAgriculture Committee for continuing this important program.\n  Let me touch on one other area. For years we have had a gaming of the \nsystem. We have had what you call welfare shopping where people from \none jurisdiction will move in to an adjoining State so that they can \nget higher benefits. We have seen the statistics. I saw one county, \nwhen I offered this provision 4-years ago to stop welfare shopping, to \neliminate it, to cut down on it, they had this relatively small county, \nand more than 600 families moved in, people moved in to Niagara County \nto get benefits. They were receiving welfare benefits in other States, \nadjoining States. Since the benefit level in New York was much higher, \nthey found the system, and the word spread. People moved in simply to \nget on welfare.\n  That is not what this is about. What does this bill do? It stops \nwelfare shopping. It says, if you move into a jurisdiction and you were \npreviously on welfare, you come into a system and go right to the \nwelfare commissioner to\n\n[[Page S8093]]\n\nget your increased maintenance, you will receive payments at the same \nlevel for a year that you were receiving from the adjoining State. So \nthat is going to stop that practice.\n  Again, President Roosevelt talked about the narcotic. It seems to me \nthat this is what has taken place. We have really been saying over \ngenerations and generations, it is OK, it is OK; you can game the \nsystem.\n  This bill includes $4 billion in additional child care funding that \nis not available now. It is not available now. That is a good bill. It \nmakes sense. In fact, this bill has more money for child care, a larger \ncontingency fund, greater financial incentives for States to meet the \nwork requirements, a higher hardship exemption from the 5-year limit, \nand a better maintenance of effort than the bill that we passed 87-12.\n  It is a superior bill. It has more safety for children. It provides \nmore revenue, more flexibility for States. To what? To hurt people? No. \nTo move them off the cycle of dependency, to move them into real work.\n  The bill has a 5-year limit on benefits. It is necessary. It is an \nadequate length of time for recipients to raise their infants, \nstraighten out their lives, and get a job and make a better life for \nthemselves and their children.\n  Madam President, we have to be honest with ourselves. May there be \nsome imperfections? Of course. Are we going to say, though, if there is \nan imperfection that a State will duck out on their legitimate \nresponsibility to feed the poor, to take care of the children, to take \ncare of those who are truly in need? Are we really saying that somehow \nthose of us here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives have \na higher standard of helping those who are most in need than our local \nrepresentatives, than our Democratic legislatures, than our Republican \nlegislatures and our Democratic Governors and our Republican Governors? \nIs that what we are really saying?\n  The system has been gamed. The system has grown from $27 billion to \nover $128 billion in the past 15 years--billions and billions more--no \nadditional freedom, no additional opportunity for those it has \nentrapped. If one were to look at the statistics, it is staggering. \nOnly 1 out of 20 who have dependent children--only 1 out of 20--go to \nwork. Is that the legacy we are sowing? Is that what Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt meant when he said, again: If people stay on welfare for \nprolonged periods of time, it administers a narcotic to their spirit. \nThis dependency on welfare undermines their humanity.\n\n  Think about that. How prophetic. I think it has undermined their \nspirit, their humanity. It makes them wards of the state. Who wants to \nbe a ward of the state? Who wants to feel like a second- or third-class \ncitizen? Who wants to feel like they are not carrying their weight? \nGive our people an opportunity. Free them. Let us create the incentive \nto move them into work. Do not hold them in bondage. Let us not get \ninvolved in the ridiculous politics of one-upmanship.\n  Let us give to our States and local administrators the ability to \nhelp bring about this kind of change. It is going to be tough. It is \nnot going to be easy. It is going to be very tough. Some people may not \nmake it. We may not be totally successful. I daresay, we will not be. \nBut for every individual, for every citizen that we help, who gains \nthat spirit of independence and freedom, freedom to do for themselves, \neconomic freedom, freedom to stand up and say, ``I participate to the \nbest of my ability,'' that is what we have to be seeking.\n  I think it is about time that all of us, Democrats, Republicans--this \nbill passed overwhelmingly, 87 to 12. My colleagues on the other side \nsupported it. Was it perfect then? No. Is it perfect now? No. But it is \nbetter than doing business as usual. The time for sloganeering has \npassed, Madam President. Future generations need our help. Some parents \nmay not be happy about what we are going to be doing, but to those who \nare born and those who are yet to be born, we have an obligation to do \nwhat is right and to provide a way and to provide an opportunity for \neconomic freedom.\n  I urge that we come together and pass this bill. It is a good bill. \nIt is not perfect. It certainly will be helping people--people--in this \ncountry and its spirit.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, before I ask the question, I see my friend, \nSenator Exon is here, the ranking minority member. A little while ago, \nI mentioned I have not seen the Senator's Democrat amendment yet and \nthat it was 800 pages, I understood. I ask the Senator, did he have \nsome suggestion with reference to that amendment?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes, I did. I am not sure how serious it was, but I heard \nthe strenuous objection to the 800 pages in the amendment that is now \nbefore us. I suggested maybe if the Republicans would accept it, we \nwould cut it down to 700 pages. The Senator did not immediately agree \nto that. Will the Senator take it under consideration?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think the Senator has to get down to maybe 300, 400 \npages. Then we might be interested.\n  Mr. EXON. That shows bipartisanship and cooperation is working.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wanted to ask Senator D'Amato awhile \nago--he was talking about noncitizens who are receiving welfare \nbenefits. I want to ask, because I think the American people somehow \nhave missed over the last 15, 20 years, because most of us missed it, \nwe were totally unaware, as I understand it, that many Americans were \nsending off to foreign countries for their elders under an American \npolicy that is so generous it just makes you understand what a \nwonderful country we are. Under a policy of family unification, we let \na 45-year-old, 48-year-old American send off to a foreign country and \nbring their 65-year-old mother or father to America.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right. That 45, 48-year-old American signs an agreement \nthat that relative will not become a ward of the people of America, \nbecause we have had a policy since our Revolutionary days that \nnoncitizens, aliens, illegal aliens and aliens, would not become wards \nof the state; thus, moving aliens to become citizens and to become \nproductive. That was the reasoning.\n  Here is what has happened. That 45, 46, 47-year-old American, in good \nfaith, brought that elderly parent over here. But what happened, I say \nto the Senator, is that in very short order they found that the U.S. \nGovernment would do nothing about it if they did not support them. So \nguess what happened? They did not support them. So guess what happens? \nHundreds of thousands are on SSI.\n  In fact, I want to show the Senator this chart because it is so \nincredible. It makes our point in the most descriptive way you could. \nOf the general population, 2.9 percent of that general population are \nnoncitizens over 65.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield on that point?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In just a moment. Look at this. And 29 percent of all \nof those on SSI are noncitizens over 65, 10 times the proportion of the \npopulation that they represent--10 times.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was borrowing his time.\n  Mr. DODD. If the Senator will yield, my colleague from New Mexico \nraised a good point.\n  As I understand it, the underlying bill that came out of committee \nbans this. The substitute that is being offered by the Democratic \nleader bans this. Our colleague from New Mexico has raised a good point \nhere. As I understand it, both bills plug up this loophole that the \nchairman of the Budget Committee has so accurately and properly pointed \nout.\n  Am I wrong on that?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I do not know about the----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have a lot of difficulty finding out what is in your \nbill. As soon as we get the 800-page bill.\n  Mr. DODD. I am here to say it is in the bill. We ban it. I presume it \nis banned in the underlying bill, as well.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. It is banned in the underlying bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We agree it is there, and we compliment you for, at \nleast, that page.\n  Mr. DODD. I just wanted to be clear on that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Just to understand, that is 1 million aliens who are on \nSSI.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Improperly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Frankly, all we are saying is that is not the way we \nintended it, so fix it, and make sure it does not happen.\n\n[[Page S8094]]\n\n  Now, we actually know, and I share this with my friend from New York, \nwe actually know that there are games taking place where people are \neducated about how they can come here under the circumstances I \ndescribed and how soon they can get on SSI. Now, if you would like for \nthis little dialog to show how many are advantaged now by Medicaid, \nsince Americans wonder about Medicaid, let me give you the number. I do \nnot think you would have known it. Madam President, 2.7 million aliens \nare on Medicaid.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Would my colleague know how many billions of dollars a \nyear that is costing the taxpayers?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I cannot remember.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. If we multiplied 2.7 million times $3,000 per \nrecipient--and that is a modest figure, because as they are more \nelderly the cost even goes up higher--we would find that is a shocking \nfigure. It seems to me that approaches over $6 billion a year--$6 \nbillion a year. That is a round number.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We figured it out. It is $8.1 billion.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. So I gave you a low figure of $6 billion.\n  I am happy to yield to my colleague and friend but, again, let me \nsimply say what is taking place is that the noblest of purposes--as a \nresult of the culture that has developed in terms of our present \nwelfare system, it is doing exactly what our great President Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt said. He said it would act as a narcotic to the spirit \nof those who received these benefits for a prolonged period of time, \nundermine their humanity.\n  There is nothing more noble than taking care of the elderly, taking \ncare of one's parents and grandparents and sending for them. That was \nwhy we have this legislation. I think we demonstrate how quickly that \nbecomes undermined when we now have a system that encourages the abuse. \nI commend my colleagues on the Democratic side for saying, and \nrecognizing, that this is something that has to be dealt with.\n  Madam President, I strongly urge we get done with the business of \nrhetoric as it relates to talking about the need for welfare reform and \nenact this legislation substantially in the form that it is, do the \nbusiness of the people, and particularly the business of future \ngenerations, of giving them an opportunity to really live the American \ndream, to feel free, to feel that spirit of independence that is a \nright of every one of our citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, may we have the chart back up for a \nminute. I yield myself such time as I may need. I will be brief and \nthen I will yield to the next speaker on this side.\n  It is an interesting chart that my friend and colleague brought up. \nWe have been debating this. I simply point out that I think we are \ndebating a smelly dead polecat or a straw man. Both of the bills, the \nRepublican bill and the amendment that we have offered, both address \nwhat has been pointed out here as something wrong. Another way of \nsaying that is that there are general agreements on both sides of the \naisle that these kind of things must be corrected.\n\n  I simply want to point out that we agree with the points made by the \nchairman, my friend and colleague from New Mexico, and the junior \nSenator from New York. I simply say of the 800-page bill that we have \nagreed to cut down, one or two of the pages in that bill that address \nthe very same thing that is adequately addressed in your bill, are two \nof the pages that we will not drop. I simply say, I think we have \nenough to debate about. I want to make the point there are lots of \nsimilarities between the two bills, and it may take 800 pages to define \nsome of the objections that we have which we will continue to debate \nand point out.\n  I come back to the basic point I made in the opening remarks on this \nside. We are most concerned about children, and while we recognize and \nagree and salute the opposition for some of the changes they have made, \nwe still think more has to be done with regard to children.\n  How much time remains on the Daschle amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 31 minutes and 10 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. How much time does the Senator from North Dakota need?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Twelve minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 12 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I appreciate the cooperation of the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  I rise to support the work first amendment offered by Senator \nDaschle. This issue is not, as is often portrayed, a caricature about \nCadillac welfare queens whom we have heard about over a couple of \ndecades of debate about the welfare system. The stereotype we hear \nabout is this clipping of a Cadillac welfare queen, living in some big \ncity, collecting a multitude of checks with which to buy a Cadillac and \ncolor television, and living the life of leisure.\n  That is not what this debate is about. It is about a welfare system, \nand this is a serious subject, that affects the lives of many, many \npeople. This is the right subject. The welfare system does not work \nvery well in this country. It does not work very well for the \ntaxpayers, because there are able-bodied people who make welfare a way \nof life and should go to work. It does not work very well for those on \nwelfare because it encourages them to stay there rather than go to \nwork. It does not work well for kids, who are the most important \nelement in this issue.\n  I have told my colleagues about the young boy I have never forgotten, \na young boy named David who came to testify at a committee hearing. He \nlived in a homeless shelter with his mother in New York, moving back \nand forth between shelters. He testified before a committee on hunger \nand said, ``No 10-year-old boy like me should have to put his head down \non his desk at school in the afternoon because it hurts to be hungry.'' \nI have never forgotten this young fellow and what he said.\n  The debate about this bill is increasingly about children, about \nthose who live in circumstances that are troubled, about those who are \nborn in circumstances of poverty, about those who have suffered \nsetbacks in their lives. Two-thirds of the welfare expenditures in \nAmerica are for the benefit of kids under 16 years of age. If you \nlisten to some of the debate, you would believe that welfare is \nessentially, if not entirely, about giving a check to an able-bodied \nperson so she can find a LA-Z-BOY couch or chair and lean back, and \nwatch television, while drinking a quart of beer. That is the \ncaricature drawn of welfare recipients, but that is wrong.\n  Two-thirds of the welfare dollars are spent for children under 16 \nyears of age. No one here would sensibly say it is time to kick 10-\nyear-olds out and have them go to work, get a good job, and take care \nof themselves. Children in this country, born in circumstances of \npoverty, did not ask for that, and we owe it to them to care about \ntheir lives.\n  I mentioned that welfare is the right subject, because the current \nwelfare system does not work very well. The fact is, there are many \nsimilarities between what the Republicans and Democrats in the Congress \nbelieve on welfare reform. We tend to emphasize the differences, but we \nhave much in common.\n  There is an avalanche of teen pregnancies in this country, and too \nmany of them end up on welfare and are unprepared to take care of \nchildren. We need a national crusade to try to reduce the number of \nteenage pregnancies in this country. That is one way to address the \nwelfare issue. We do that in the amendment that is before the body now.\n  There is an army of deadbeat dads in America, men who have babies and \nleave, saying, ``Yes, it is my baby, but not my responsibility, and I \ndo not intend to pay a cent for that child.'' Guess who pays for that \nchild? The American taxpayer. This bill says: Deadbeat dads, avoiding \nyour responsibility is over. If you have children, you have a \nresponsibility to help pay for the care of those children. And you have \na responsibility to the American taxpayer.\n  Tens of billions of dollars in child support payments that are owed \nby deadbeat dads who have left and said, ``The kids I fathered are none \nof my business.'' This bill says: I am sorry, but you are wrong, and we \nare going to make sure that in the future you take responsibility for \nthose children.\n  Yes, there are able-bodied people in this country who believe that \nwelfare\n\n[[Page S8095]]\n\ncan be a way of life. This bill says, you are wrong. This bill says \nthat we intend to turn welfare offices into employment offices. We \nintend to say to welfare people--those who are able-bodied--If you are \nable-bodied and need a helping hand, if you are down and out, down on \nyour luck, if you have just had a fire and lost everything in your \ntrailer home, lost your job, suffered health consequences, or you have \nsuffered a multitude of problems, we want to reach out and give you a \nhelping hand. We want to help you back up, to help you get back on your \nfeet, and to give you a chance.\n  That is what our welfare system ought to be. But it ought to also say \nthat you have a responsibility as well. Yes, we will help you get back \non your feet, but you have to be involved in helping yourself, and you \nhave certain responsibilities. If all of the American taxpayers are \ngoing to help you, you have a responsibility to help yourself. That is \nalso what this legislation does.\n  Work is the focus of this bill for those who are able-bodied. This is \na tough bill, but a fair bill. It reforms the welfare system in the \nright way. It says that if you take responsibility for yourself, the \nGovernment will provide you with a temporary helping hand. It says we \nwill provide you with the tools to get back into the work force and \nwhen you get there, we expect you to stay there. This amendment \nrequires the able-bodied to sign a contract agreeing to go to work. It \nalso says that if you fail to live up to the terms of that contract, \nyour benefits will be terminated immediately.\n  The plan is flexible. It gives State and local governments the \nability to be creative in developing their plans. But this plan \nespecially recognizes that child care and job training are the \nlinchpins to solving the welfare problem for those who are able-bodied.\n  I have told my colleagues of getting up in 6 in the morning and going \nto a homeless shelter in this town, Washington, DC, and talking to a \nyoung woman who had several children, and then driving back to the \nCapitol Building about 8 in the morning and thinking to myself, if I \nhad been that young woman, what would I have done? Would I be able to \nclimb out of the circumstances she found herself in, with a husband who \nleft her, a need to care for several children, no job, no skills, but \ncertainly not a desire to remain in that circumstance? This is not \nsomeone who said to me over pancakes at the shelter, ``I really want to \nstay on welfare.'' With tears in her eyes, she said, ``I want to go to \nwork. I want to get a place to live. I want to provide for my kids. I \nwant to get skills so I can get a good job.'' I was trying to think on \nthe way back to the Capitol, I wonder how I could deal with that if I \nwere her. Well, if you save for the first and last month's rent to get \nan apartment, they will cut you back on the AFDC payments. So you \ncannot save in order to get into an apartment. So no housing, no home. \nYou will remain homeless. If you go get a minimum wage job frying \nhamburgers, as she did, what happens? You lose your children's Medicaid \nbenefits. No health care for your children. If you try to go find some \njob training, where do you put your kids? Is anybody going to pay child \ncare? No. So they are trapped. This young lady was trapped and she did \nnot want more help. She did not want more welfare. She wanted to find a \nway out of that trap--to find a job, help provide for her kids, to give \nher hope and an opportunity for the future. That is what this debate is \nabout.\n\n  This debate says it is unfair to the American taxpayers to pay for \nthose who are able-bodied and stay at home. But it also recognizes that \nmost people finding themselves on welfare want a way out, a way up, a \nway to improve their lives. This legislation offers that helping hand \nby saying that you have a responsibility, even as we help you. If you \nfail to meet that responsibility, we will not help. The amendment says, \nwith respect to the issue of teen pregnancies, there will be no more \nindependent households for teen mothers on welfare. None. Stay at home \nand stay in school. You must live with an adult family member or in a \nsupervised setting where you can learn the skills to become a \nresponsible parent. If you do not, there will be no benefits.\n  Some will say that is tough, and it is tough. But it is what we must \ndo to reform this welfare plan. I have talked about the many challenges \nwe face in Congress today. I summarized it by talking about kids, jobs, \nand values. That summarizes most of the challenges we face in \nCongress--dealing with kids, jobs, and values. The welfare debate \ntouches all of those areas. It is, most importantly, an issue of what \ndo we do about kids born in circumstances of poverty, born into a life \nthat they did not choose. They did not ask to be born in poverty. What \ndo we say to them? Do we say, ``You have value, merit, and we intend to \nhelp you, and we care about your lives''?\n  Welfare reform is about jobs, moving people from circumstances of \nwelfare to employment, and to the ability to take care of themselves. \nValues? Yes, it is also about values. Do we value work over welfare? If \nso, let us apply those judgments in welfare reform, on the minimum wage \nand in other areas. Let us say to the folks at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder in America that we are going to help you climb up the \nladder and help you reach your full potential.\n  In my final remaining moments, let me tell my colleagues, I think for \nthe second time, about Caroline, because she is an object lesson, it \nseems to me, of what we are discussing today.\n  Caroline was a wonderful Norwegian woman, who married a man named \nOtto in Oslo, Norway, came to this country and settled in St. Paul, MN. \nOtto tragically died. When Otto died, Caroline had six children. She \ntook the six children and moved to the prairies of North Dakota and \nsettled in a tent in Indian Creek Township, I believe, in Hettinger \nCounty, ND. They lived in a tent. Then this strong Norwegian woman \nbuilt a home, raised a family, started a homestead and became a North \nDakota farmer.\n  I can only guess what kind of strength and courage it took for this \nNorwegian woman, losing her husband, to move to the prairies of North \nDakota and pitch a tent and raise her family and start her farm. But \nshe did it. And she had a son, and her son had a daughter, and her \ndaughter had me. That is how I came to live in Hettinger County, ND.\n  I told that story one day on a radio show when I was asked about my \nheritage. And somebody called in and said, ``Isn't it lucky that we did \nnot have a welfare program at the turn of the century, because Caroline \nnever would have left St. Paul; she would have stayed there and stayed \non welfare.'' I said, ``Well, who do you think gave Caroline the land \nwhen she homesteaded 160 acres in Hettinger County, ND? The Federal \nGovernment.''\n  The Homestead Act said what we are trying to say in this welfare \nbill. We want to help those who are willing to help themselves. It was \ngood policy then. It is good policy now.\n  I hope that in the name of Caroline--and in the name of children \nacross this country--and in the name of common sense we will pass a \nwelfare reform bill that is a bipartisan effort to understand that this \nSenate needs to do what is right to address one of the vexing problems \nof the day.\n  Mr. President, thank you for your indulgence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the Senator from Connecticut is patiently \nwaiting. About how much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. DODD. I do not know. I see my colleagues from Pennsylvania and \nNew Mexico. I can wait.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I want to respond to the speeches about the Work First \nAct.\n  This is, from what I can tell, an 800-page amendment that has been \nsubmitted without giving anyone on the other side a preview of that \namendment, or any kind of opportunity to review an 800-page document. \nWe were handed a background brief which is on one side of the paper. I \nthink it is five or six pages of one-sided paper with fairly big type. \nIt is not much information. There are, in fact, a lot of questions \nabout the exemptions that are provided for to\n\n[[Page S8096]]\n\nthe rules that sound very good but like previous bills that I have seen \ncome from the Democratic leader, while the appearance, the facade, \nlooks nice, there are a lot of holes in the floor for the people to \ndrop through and stay in the current system, and, in fact, in the end \nthe current system is alive and well after we have gone through great \neffort to pass something.\n\n  This bill does, from what I have seen--at least what they admit to in \nthis background brief; I think ``brief'' is probably the applicable \nword here--there are essentially no time limits left. Under the \nRepublican bill, under the bill that passed the U.S. Senate last year \n87 to 12, there is a time limit on welfare. After 5 years, you are off \nAFDC; you had your time to, in a sense, get an education, get training, \ndo job search, work, get that experience, and after 5 years the social \ncontract was, in a sense, at an end.\n  That is important for the reason that we have to--just like all \nprograms where you are dealing with people who are troubled and need to \nturn their lives around, it is important to set a time limit, some sort \nof goal, and some sort of time where people have to hit the wall. We \nprovide in this bill, and we provide in the bill that we passed last \nyear, a hardship exemption for those who were having a tough time still \nand realize, ``Hey, look, you are trying. You are still working.'' We \nallow a percentage of up to 20 percent of the people in the system to \ncontinue to receive benefits. Will they do that in this bill, in the \nDemocratic substitute? In addition, people who hit the 5-year limit--\neverybody continues to receive vouchers which is, in a sense, a cash \npayment. They say, ``Well, it is vouchers for the children.''\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I can tell you while there are vouchers for the \nchildren, the parents get the vouchers. The parents spend the money for \nthe children.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator for yielding because the Senator is \nmaking an incorrect statement. Under the amendment that I am going to \noffer, which I happen to have written, it is very clear that the \nvouchers do not go to the parent or to the children. They go to a third \nparty. They go to the people who provide the services. They cannot be \ngiven to the parent by law. They do not go to the parent. They do not \ngo to the child. They go to the person who provides the benefit, the \nclothing, or the food, or perhaps a 2-year-old child whose parent has \nbeen cut off of welfare.\n  I ask the question of the Senator. What would he say to a small child \nwhose parent has been cut off of any assistance and that kid could not \nhave the food? What does he say to that kid?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would say one thing. No. 1, under the Republican bill \nthat family still is eligible for food stamps. That family is still \neligible for food stamps; still eligible for other medical benefits and \nother kinds of welfare services. What they are not eligible for--and \nwhat your vouchers are replacing--is cash.\n  So what you are doing is taking a cash program and turning it into a \nservices program that does not have to be used for food, and can be \nused--again, I have to apologize. There is not much detail in this \nthing. So I am groping a little bit for my own information. I \nappreciate the Senator's responding and filling it in. But what you are \nfilling in for--you already have people qualifying for food stamps, you \nalready have people who are continuing to qualify for Medicaid, you \nalready have people who continue, if they are eligible today, to \nqualify for housing. None of that changes. What we eliminate is cash, \nand what you replace it with is pseudocash, which is in a sense the \nsame thing.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. The Senator talks about food stamps. For the first time, \nyou are taking the Food Stamp Program and, through block grants, States \ndo not have to use their money for food stamps if they do not want to.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We did in the bill, as we did in the bill that passed \n87 to 12 on this floor, allow States the option to take a block grant \nfor food stamps, the option which was again approved by 87 votes on \nthis floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX. The question is: Is it not possible that the States do \nnot have to provide food stamps for the child you are talking about if \nthey do not want to?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If they take the option for the block grant, they can \ndesign this program, which has to be approved by the Secretary, of \ncourse. I am sure there are going to be some limitations on that.\n  Mr. BREAUX. You are mandating.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. No. There is mandate. But I would suspect, knowing the \nGovernors I have talked to on this issue, if they are going to come to \nthe point where they are going to end cash assistance, they are not \ngoing to take food stamp benefits away. In fact, the Congressional \nBudget Office, when they scored our bill, in fact, provided for an \nincrease in food stamp expenditures because of the reduction in the \nAFDC payment. Therefore, you have less income in the family and, \ntherefore, they are eligible for more food stamps. So food stamps have \nactually a counterbalancing influence on the reduction of cash. That is \nprovided for in our bill.\n  But I think the point is here what you are doing is continuing the \nentitlement which is continued in this bill, No. 1.\n  No. 2, what you are doing is allowing families to legitimately make \nan economic decision which they make today, which is not to work, to \nstay on welfare, and to be able to survive doing so.\n  What we want to do, except for those cases that are hardship, except \nfor those cases where people are really trying in high-unemployment \nareas, have problems one way or another with their family and holding \ndown a job--we are not talking about people who are disabled. People \nwho are disabled are not even in the program. We are taking about able-\nbodied people who are capable of working. We are saying to 20 percent \nof those people, we are going to allow you to stay after 5 years \nbecause we know there might be situations where it is tough. But the \nrest of you, yes, we will have an expectation that after 5 years you \ncan get a job. You should be able to hold that job.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Is that the Senator's premise of what he is trying to \naccomplish? Let me read a very short description of what a voucher \nprogram does, and tell me why he disagrees with it. It says a voucher \nprovided to a family under this law shall be based on the State's \nassessment of the need of the child of the family. That shall be \ndetermined from the day of the subsistence need of the child; that it \nis effectively designed to appropriately pay third parties for shelter, \ngoods, and services received by the child; and, third, finally, it is \npayable directly to such third parties.\n\n  If a State decides to have a 24-month termination of a parent because \nthey do not follow the rules, what is wrong with this provision taking \ncare of the needs of the child designed by the State to take care of \nthe needs determined by the State to be payable to a third party on the \nsubsistence needs of the child? If they talk about food stamps, it \nwould not qualify under this.\n  We are talking about assistance needs of the child. Food stamps would \ninclude food.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Sure. I can respond. Again, it is very hard to respond \nbecause you may be looking at the bill. I just got it.\n  Mr. BREAUX. We got it this morning.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That bill came through the Finance Committee. You are \non that committee. You saw it when it came through that committee. You \nhad the markup when this came through the committee. You have the \nmarkup document before you, No. 1. No. 2, let me just say that what you \nsay here again in your description is to provide non cash aid; maintain \na minimal safety net for the children.\n  Who determines that in your bill?\n  Mr. BREAUX. The State.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The State determines the minimal safety and the Federal \nGovernment has no oversight?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Let me read it again. A voucher provided to a family \nunder this law shall be made on the State's assessment of the need of \nthe child--not the Federal Government, not Washington, but the States.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. This is an optional voucher program.\n\n[[Page S8097]]\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. It is a voucher of 5 years, optional on behalf of the \nState. The cutoff in less than 5 years is mandatory on the part of the \nchild.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If it is less than 5 years, and the people are not \nworking, this is a difficult----\n  Mr. BREAUX. Not the parent. The parent gets zero under my amendment. \nWe are talking about a child maybe 2 years old that cannot work.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Or a child 16 years hold who can work.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Or a child 3 years old who cannot work.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Or a child 17 years old who can. We can go back and \nforth. But the fact is we are talking about all children; that is, \nunder 18. The point I am trying to make is, the question I am trying to \nhave answered here is, if it is under five years, you mandate that the \nState provide a voucher to someone who is unwilling to work.\n  Mr. BREAUX. If it is less than 5 years and the parent is cut off, the \nchild, as determined by the State, has to receive a voucher to provide \nthe subsistence needs of that particular child.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In part of this dialog some 4 minutes ago, the question \ncame up on block grants for food stamps. I might say the Republican \nbill before us here says the State has the option, but I would suggest \nthat you read further, because it says that 85 percent of that money, \nif they choose to block it, must be used for nutrition. I believe that \nis correct in terms of the underlying bill.\n  I am going to yield now. We should be moving to the other side. Might \nI ask Senator Exon, does the Senator know how many more speakers there \nare on the Democratic substitute?\n  Mr. EXON. There is the Senator from Connecticut and there is myself \nand the Senator from Louisiana, so that is three.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska controls 17 minutes, \n21 seconds; the Senator from New Mexico controls 27 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the Senator from Connecticut would be next. \nHow much time does the Senator from Connecticut need?\n  Mr. DODD. I see one of the authors, my colleague from Louisiana, so I \nwill try about 7 minutes or so.\n  Mr. EXON. I have some time that I can yield off the bill.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. Ten minutes, if I can.\n  Mr. EXON. Ten minutes. I yield 10 minutes off the bill to the Senator \nfrom Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \nup to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Nebraska.\n  Let me begin by thanking the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, \nalong with our colleague, Senator Breaux, of Louisiana, and Senator \nMikulski, of Maryland, who are the principal authors of this \nalternative. I commend them for it.\n  I draw my colleagues' attention to the exchange between our \ncolleagues from Pennsylvania and Louisiana that comes to one of the \ncritical elements as far as I am concerned. It is the critical \ndistinction between what is being offered by the majority and what we \nare offering in the alternative. That is, Mr. President, the children.\n  I do not think there is any debate among us here about trying to get \nthe adults from welfare to work. There are 2 million people out of \nroughly 275 million that we are going to put to work.\n  Let me begin by framing this in mathematical terms so people can get \na conception in their minds of what we are talking about. We are a \nnation of some 270 million people, thereabouts. What we are talking \nabout is Federal welfare, aid to families with dependent children. \nThere are 13 million people in the United States on AFDC, aid to \nfamilies with dependent children, out of a nation of 270 million. Of \nthat 13 million, Mr. President, 4.1 million are adults and 8.8 million \nof that 13 million are children under the age of 18. And 78 percent, \nalmost 80 percent of that 8.8 million are under the age of 12; roughly \n50 percent of that 8.8 million are under the age of 6.\n  I do not think the debate here is about whether or not we can take 2 \nmillion of the 4 million adults out of a nation of 270 million and put \nthem to work. That we all agree on. What this side of the aisle has so \nmuch trouble with and why there is such a fundamental disagreement here \nrelates to the 8.8 million children--80 percent of whom are under the \nage of 12. People who are 16 or 17, I presume they are almost adults; \nthey can work. But I do not know of anyone, Mr. President, regardless \nof ideology or political persuasion, who is going to look into the eyes \nof a child and say, ``I am sorry. Because your parent did not get a \njob, because the recession happened, because there were not enough \njobs, you are out of it. We cannot help you any longer.''\n\n  I do not understand that sort of approach. It would break a tradition \nin this country, regardless of party and political persuasion, that has \nexisted for more than a half a century. We have said, when it comes to \nAmerica's kids, the circumstance they are born into is none of their \ndoing. It is none of their doing. And yet if a 6-year-old child is \nstarving, is hungry, we ought to find subsistence help. That is what my \ncolleague from Louisiana was just talking about, some form of \nsubsistence assistance for them.\n  Mr. President, I am going to focus these brief remarks on the \nchildren. I do not make any argument about whether we want to make it 2 \nyears or 5 years to get people off of welfare to work. I'm talking \nabout roughly 2 million or 4 million of 270 million. I figure we ought \nto be able to figure out how to do that.\n  I am really concerned about these infants and children. We see under \nthe proposal offered by the majority that we do not have health and \nsafety standards for child care if the parents go to work. These \nchildren under the age of 12 who are going to need a child care \nsetting. Yet the bill eliminates today's health and safety standards \nfor child care settings.\n  We have standards for automobiles that must be met, emission controls \nthat must be met. We have standards for pets in this country that must \nbe met. For the life of me, I do not understand why we will not have \nhealth and safety standards for America's children in a child care \nsetting. What is so radical or outrageous about saying that on basic \nhealth and safety, children who are put into a child care setting ought \nto have that minimum guarantee.\n  I will offer an amendment, assuming--I hope it is not the case--that \nthe Democratic alternative is rejected, to try to correct that \nsituation on health and safety standards. I am hopeful my colleagues \nwill support it.\n  Senator Hatch and I, 6 years ago, wrote the child care legislation \nand included health and safety standards, and we have worked with it \npretty well over the last 6 years. It is not in this bill. I would urge \nthat we put it back in. The Democratic alternative does that. We have \nin our bill a minimum requirement that would require quality of child \ncare.\n  If we are saying to these parents, which we should, we want you to \nget to work, and we want you to be self-sufficient. Then we have to say \nthat when these children are being cared for, there is going--Mr. \nPresident, I am having a hard time even hearing my own self speaking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.\n  The Senate will come to order.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  So, Mr. President, the health and safety standards, the quality of \nour child care settings, again, this ought not be a question of \npartisan disagreement here. As I said, if we are going to have quality \ncontrols on automobiles and pets, then we ought to do it for child care \nsettings. If you try to place your pet in some place over the weekend \nwhen you go on your vacation, there are standards for where your pet is \nkept. And yet this bill says that the standards where you place your \nchild 8 hours a day as you go to work are not required.\n  I do not know why this ought to be the subject of partisan \ndisagreement, and yet it is. And so when you talk about welfare reform, \nit is critically important that health and safety standards and quality \nbe included. We will offer alternatives in that regard.\n\n[[Page S8098]]\n\n  I also want to emphasize the point that the Senator from Louisiana \njust made to our colleague from Pennsylvania about a voucher system at \nthe end of 5 years or 2 years. In my view, you can put any level you \nwant on it. My concern is, what happens to the kids at that point? What \nhappens to those children at the end of 2 years? For some of the \nadults, let us assume they will be going off to work. But let us assume \nfor a second they cannot. What happens to those kids? You cut off the \nparents. OK, I do not like that, and I think you have a problem with \nthat. But for the life of me, why would you say to the child, you lose.\n  The voucher system here provides the safety net. And, of course, \nunder the bill offered by the majority, in fact, it is mandatory--\nmandatory--there be no voucher system. It specifically prohibits it. It \ndoes not even give the State the option. It mandates that no voucher \nexist at all.\n  I do not understand that. I do not understand that at all.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me, if I can, finish my remarks, because time is brief \nhere, and then I will be glad at the end, if I do have an extra minute, \nto yield to my colleague.\n  The proposal offered by the distinguished Senator from South Dakota \nand the Senator from Louisiana offers a safety net for children that I \nurge my colleagues to look at. The voucher system that allows for that \nsafety net for children.\n  The same on the food stamp issue that has been raised earlier. Again, \nby block granting it, you run the risk in certain States, because the \npolitical will is not there--and my colleagues know as well as I do \nthat can happen--then the food stamp issue is also lost.\n  I hope that is not the case. I heard my colleague from Pennsylvania \nearlier say he did not think that would happen. I hope he is right. But \nI do not know why we cannot require some safety net so all of us on a \nnational level know these children are not going to be adversely \naffected.\n  One of the other provisions that has not been the subject of much \ndebate is the penalties imposed by the majority's proposal. We are told \nby the Congressional Budget Office that many States will not be able to \nmeet the criteria laid out in the legislation, the standards here, and \nthat in fact they will be imposing penalties of 5 percent of the \nassistance they will be receiving under this bill in the first year. \nThen it is cumulative. Whatever that number is, the penalty the first \nyear, if there is a penalty the second it is 5 percent on that number. \nThe point is, as has been pointed out by some of our Governors, this is \nan unfunded mandate, because that falls on the States, on local \ntaxpayers. One estimate from one Governor is it may be as much as $12 \nbillion in an unfunded mandate on the States as a result of the \npenalties being imposed if States do not get the numbers of people to \nwork in the timeframe they are required to under our legislation.\n  Again, I assume most of the States will try to get it done, but I \nthink all of us know what happens when a recession or other economic \ndifficulties hit. For one reason or another, the States would not meet \nthose standards and the penalty is imposed. Then it gets cumulative \nthereafter. We collect that back. So that is, in effect, a tax, an \nunfunded mandate on the States. And I am looking specifically at our \ncolleague in the chair because he authored very effectively, at the \nvery outset of this Congress, a very successful piece of legislation on \nunfunded mandates. I urge him to look at this, because Governor Carper \nof Delaware and others at the Governors Conference raised this issue \nincluded in the majority bill, and I do not think any of us would like \nto see an unfunded mandate imposed as a result of this legislation \ndespite our activities earlier in this Congress.\n  I end where I began here. My concern is about these children, these \nkids.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be able to proceed for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. My concern is children. Again, on the health and safety \nstandards, on the quality, on the vouchers and food, it seems to me we \nought to try to correct these mistakes. Again, remember, we are talking \nabout putting 2 million adults out of 4 million adults on welfare to \nwork over the next 5 years, out of a Nation of 270 million people. Of \nthe 8.8 million children on welfare, 80 percent are under the age of \n12, 50 percent under the age of 6--of the 8.8 million. We ought to be \nable to say to those infants and those children that there is a safety \nnet here. We are going to try to see to it that your parents go to \nwork, but for whatever reason if they are unable to do it, no matter \nwhat we do to them, you are not going to be adversely affected by this. \nThat ought not to be that hard to do. I do not understand why we cannot \nfind common ground on that issue as we try to achieve the goal of \nputting people, adults on welfare, to work without jeopardizing the \nchildren. That is the simple question.\n  Can we not write a bill, can we not come together and write a bill \nthat puts people from welfare to work and does not adversely affect \ninfants, infants in this country who I think will be hurt as a result \nof the legislation, if adopted unamended, as the majority has presented \nit?\n\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Pennsylvania standing. I will \nbe glad to ask for an additional minute if he wanted to ask me a \nquestion, or maybe my colleague from New Mexico would.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 27 minutes, \nthe Senator from Nebraska, 17 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I do have a question of the Senator. Let \nme state something first. I stated before in my opening comments that \nthe Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from New York said and \nrepeated that what they care about is the children. I suggest the \ncurrent system reflects that all the care that has been expressed for \nchildren, here, has not panned out into a reality that children are \ncared for. That is the real issue.\n  We can all care about children. The question is, are children cared \nfor and by whom? What we are trying to do here, in this bill, is to \nmake sure, not that we feel good about caring for children--I am sure \nthe Senator from Connecticut knows that everybody in this Chamber cares \nfor children; that is not the issue, to measure our care--it is to \nmeasure whether children are cared for and by whom.\n  What we do here in our bill is to try to rebuild a culture that has \nbeen systematically destroyed by the welfare system to make sure that \nthere are families to care for children; that there are communities \nwhere children are safe again. As long as you continue the welfare \nentitlement, the dependency structure of unlimited welfare, you will \nnot get care for children. You will not get caring neighborhoods. You \nwill not get caring communities. You will not have stable families. It \nis a reality. You are looking at it today. That is why we are here.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I just ask this question of my friend from Connecticut. \nDoes your bill create a day care entitlement?\n  Mr. DODD. No.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. You say in your bill that ``all children will receive \nday care.''\n  Mr. DODD. No, we block grant----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. You say all children will receive day care. I will read \nfrom it. ``To help recipients get and keep a job, child care will be \nmade available to all those required to work.'' That sounds like a \nquasi-entitlement.\n  Mr. DODD. If the parents go to work, we are trying to provide a \nsetting for those children in that situation. Rather than have them go \nonto the streets, there is some child care setting for them.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. As the Senator from Connecticut knows, under the \nRepublican bill before you, we spent $4 billion--``b'' billion--$4 \nbillion more on child care than under current law and almost $2 billion \nmore than what the President believes he needs for day care. So we \nspend a lot more money. The question----\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator did not hear me suggest I was going to offer an\n\n[[Page S8099]]\n\namendment to add additional funds for child care. I said health and \nsafety standards. And I appreciate the fact we are going to be able to \nget more on child care. I say to my colleague, it will probably be \ninadequate. If, in fact, we get everybody to work, the money there will \nnot provide for the child care needs for those families. I do not think \nanybody will tell you that it would be adequate. But I appreciate the \nfact there is more money and I appreciate the fact the Senator from \nDelaware, who is the chairman, is responsible for that.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The second question is on the vouchers issue, and the \nSenator from Louisiana, while he responded to a question was not \nresponding to my question. He was responding to the provision in his \namendment, not the provision in the amendment before us.\n\n  You suggest the Republican bill forbids vouchers after 5 years.\n  Mr. DODD. Right.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am sure the Senator from Connecticut knows that what \nit forbids is Federal dollars to be used for vouchers after 5 years. \nStates can give vouchers using their own dollars for an unlimited \nperiod of time. Obviously, if they do not, if they use their money--\nthere is a discrete amount of money here. What we are saying is you \nhave to focus that money on the 5 years. If you want to extend beyond \nthe 5 years, then use your own dollars.\n  Conversely, what you would say is, look, you can use our dollars \nafter 5 years, which means you would necessarily have to take it out of \nthe first 5 years. We do not think that money should come out of the \nfirst 5 years. We think there should be an intensive effort in 5 years, \ncommitting every Federal resource possible to that 5-year transition \nperiod, to get those people to work and not hold out money, Federal \ndollars, for a continuation of welfare into the future. That is the \nphilosophical difference.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me respond, if I may, to my colleague. Two points. One, \non child care, there is a cap on entitlements on the child care issue. \nI ask for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. It is a capped entitlement on child care, so it will not be \nincreased.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It is a new entitlement?\n  Mr. DODD. Let me respond. You asked the question. Let me respond.\n  In regard to the issue of the vouchers, obviously the States and \nlocalities can do what they want. But we are talking about our Federal \ninvolvement here. We prohibit the use of the Federal funds, of our \nmoney, Federal money, if you will, to go for the voucher system. I just \nsuggest that, if we are going to put people to work as we should, and \nif for some reason States are unable to meet those standards, then \nthose children, whatever else you want to do with the adults, ought to \nhave a safety net. The voucher ought to be a system they can use to \nprovide for that safety net. We say that States ought to be able to \nprovide that. The bill by the majority prohibits it. Obviously, we \ncannot stop a State from doing what it wants, but why would we prohibit \nthem from using these moneys?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask for 1 additional minute to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would respond by saying, as the Senator from \nConnecticut knows, we are talking about originally 25 percent of the \nAFDC population, able-bodied AFDC population----\n  Mr. DODD. Four million.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes--going into this system, increasing up to 70 \npercent over the next 5 years. Within that category, 20 percent are \nexempted for hardship. That means they can go beyond the 5 years and \nstill receive Federal dollars after 5 years. We are talking about a \nlimited number of people who are able-bodied, who have had 5 years, who \nare not designated by the State as hardship. That is not a high hurdle \nto get over.\n  Mr. DODD. I do not have any disagreement on that. On the adult side I \nhave no disagreement. My focus is on the 8.8 million kids, 80 percent \nunder the age of 12. That is the focus of my concern. My fear is the \nchildren are not being adequately protected at all.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. How much time does the Senator from Nebraska have left on \nthe amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 16 minutes, 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. EXON. On the Daschle amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for \nup to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I think a lot of this is getting far more complicated \nthan it deserves. It is a serious issue, but it is not that \ncomplicated. I think the work first amendment that has been offered by \nthe distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, is a very good \ncompromise. It is fair, it emphasizes work, and it sets time limits for \npeople on welfare. It also, I think, however, is good for children. It \nis tough on work, but it is good for kids.\n  Welfare reform must be about getting a check by working as opposed to \ngetting a check by not working. We all agree with that. Democrats have \nsaid very strongly that we believe that there should be time limits; \nthat people should be required to work; that an unmarried mother should \nbe required to live with an adult, in an adult family, with her own \nfamily, if that is possible, but with adult supervision; that we should \nhave a time limit on how long someone can be on welfare. It cannot be \nforever.\n  Our amendment says there is a lifetime limit of 5 years, and a State \nhas the option under our bill to set shorter limits if they want. My \nown State of Louisiana has been approved to set time limits for welfare \nas low as 24 months, 2 years.\n  But what I am talking about when we are talking about these vouchers \nfor kids is that all of us believe that while we are being so tough on \na parent, that we should not be tough on an innocent child and an \ninnocent victim who did not ask to be brought into this world. What \ngood do we do by telling a 2-year-old that we are going to throw him or \nher out without any help or assistance?\n  The voucher proposal which I have as an amendment to be offered later \non simply says that if a State determines to terminate a person on \nwelfare assistance in a period shorter than 5 years, that that State \nmust use the Federal and State money that they have to help pay for \nessential needs of a child.\n  My amendment says that the State shall do an assessment of that \nchild. They still determine the need of that child. The child may need \ndiapers, the child may need medicine, the child may be older and need \nbook supplies, good gosh, to go to school, which we all should support, \nor may need food because they are hungry and the Food Stamp Program is \nnot adequate.\n  The State makes the determination of the need of that child, and then \nafter they have made the determination, they determine vouchers for \nthat child's benefits. The parent does not get it. Everybody wants to \npenalize the parent. The voucher does not go to the parent under my \namendment. The voucher would go to the third party who is going to \nprovide the essential needs for the child. Maybe it is a food supply \norganization, maybe it is a school, maybe it is a drugstore for \nmedicine for the child. They would get the voucher under the State \nprogram, and they would take care of the needs of that child as \ndetermined by the State.\n\n  Is it too much for us in Congress to say to a State that we are \ngiving most of the money to that you have to use those moneys to take \ncare of children who are innocent victims while we are being so tough \non the parent?\n  I support time limits of parents. I support making them go to work. I \nsupport making them be responsible and live with an adult if they are \ngoing\n\n[[Page S8100]]\n\nto receive AFDC assistance. My gosh, can't we be, in this great country \nof ours, with the economic benefits that we all participate in, strong \nenough also to say we are going to somehow protect the needs of \ninnocent children?\n  We are close on this. It should not be a big disagreement. After 5 \nyears, we say we allow the State to do it, but the Republican proposal \nforbids it. Why, if the State wants to do it, can they not use the \nblock grant money they get to do this? If the State sees a child that \nthey think is in need, why should we not at least allow the State, \nunder this wonderful block grant concept, to provide vouchers for \nchildren after 5 years if the State wants to do it with the block grant \nmoney that they get? Yet, the Republican bill forbids it.\n  I think that is too extreme. Let the State make the decision. If the \nState wants to forbid it, all right, let them do it. But if the State \nwants to do it with the block grant money they are getting, allow them \nto do it. Then, if it is less than 5 years, if they want to cut off the \nassistance to a parent in 2 years or 3 years or 4 years, we think that \nthe moneys that Washington and the States are providing together should \nat least be used to take care of the child while we are being tough on \nthe parent.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BREAUX. All this should be about putting work first but not \nchildren last.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is it my understanding that in your proposal, the States \nare mandated to use the vouchers during the 5 years, permitted to use \nvouchers after 5 years.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I will answer the Senator, who has a distinguished career \nas Governor back in his State, it says that a State, based on their \ndetermination of the need, if the child does not need it under the \nState determination, the State does not have to do it, if it is a 2-\nyear time limit, 3 years or 4. But if the State, in their \ndetermination, sees a child who has a need that is not being met, then \nthe State must have a voucher. If the State finds that child is being \ntaken care of with other programs or through a parent, aunt, uncle or \ngrandfather, there is no need there. The State makes the determination.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I may continue this question, basically what you are \nsaying, then, is the State is required to use the voucher for a child \nup to the 5 years.\n  Mr. BREAUX. That is incorrect.\n  Mr. GREGG. The State identifies the need.\n  Mr. BREAUX. The question the Senator is posing is an incorrect \nstatement in the sense it does not require the State to give a voucher \nto a child whose parent has been cut off from welfare for less than 5 \nyears. It would only require it if the State first makes a \ndetermination that the child has a need. The State makes that \ndetermination.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. That differs from the pending legislation. The pending \nlegislation leaves it up to the State to make that decision during the \n5-year period; is that correct?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I think the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. And then you are saying that after the 5-year period, the \nStates would be given the flexibility to continue the voucher, but even \nif there was a need at that time, it would be identified by the State, \nit would not be required.\n  Mr. BREAUX. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. So, essentially, you are putting the State in this \nposition--as the bill is presently structured, you are taking that \nlanguage and moving it into the post-5-year period, and then for the \npre-5-year period, you are requiring that the payments be made for \nneed--\n  Mr. BREAUX. As I understand the Senator's question--let me try and \nrestate it as simply as I possibly can.\n  Under the Breaux voucher amendment that will be offered, for a family \nthat is cut off from welfare after being there for 5 years, it would \nallow the State to use their block grant funds to provide vouchers to a \nchild if the State determines that there is a need for assistance for \nthat child.\n  If the State has a shorter period than 5 years--2 years, 3 years, 4 \nyears, what have you--based on the State's assessment of the need of \nthat child, the State decides there is a needy child here, then the \nState is required to use block grant funds to help that child. They \ndetermine how much; they determine where to spend it. It does not go to \nthe parent. It does not go to the child. It goes to a third-party \nprovider.\n  Mr. GREGG. Which I guess leads to the point I wanted to ask about, \nwhich is that if you are essentially using the logic of this bill for \nthe post-5-year period, why not use it for the pre-5-year period also?\n  Or to state it another way, you said in your statement that it made \nno sense to you that people wanted to give flexibility to the States; \nthey would not allow the States that flexibility after a 5-year period \nto spend the voucher. Doesn't that same logic apply to the pre-5-year \nperiod?\n  In other words, shouldn't the State flexibility remain for the pre-5-\nyear period as well as for the post-5-year period? Why should the \nFederal Government come in and direct the States to do it?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I will respond to the Senator in this way.\n  I would like to, but politically I do not think it is possible to do \nit, to say that when you have a block grant fund going to the State, \nand the State has made a determination that there is a needy child out \nthere, the State be required to use those funds to take care of the \nneeds of the child at any point, 5 years, 2 years, or 3 years, either \none. I just do not think that is politically possible to do.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, I appreciate the Senator's courtesy of yielding to \nme for these questions. If the logic of the Senator's position is \ncorrect--and I think there is a lot of attractiveness to the Senator's \nlogic in the post-5-year-period--if this bill, as it is presently \nstructured, basically takes that logic and applies it to the pre-5-year \nperiod, would not the Senator's amendment be a lot stronger and \nconsistent, if the Senator would essentially use his language for the \npost-5-year period, but not change the language for the pre-5-year \nperiod to create a mandate on the States which is going to put the \nStates in a position of basically being instructed as to how to govern \nthe welfare system in that 5-year period?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I respond by saying I offered that in the Senate Finance \nCommittee. I think it may have lost on a tie vote. I tried it once. I \nthink I will try to get something that will pass the Senate and narrow \nit down to one. The bottom line is very simple.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank Senator Exon for yielding the time.\n  What I am trying to accomplish--and I do not think anybody on the \nSenator's side is being cruel with children or anything. I think that \nthere is a great deal of sympathy on both sides. I say to the Senator, \nwhat I am trying to do is say to the States that are getting Federal \nmoney with their State money, if the State looks at their population \nand the State sees children who are being put in need because we have \ncut off their parent, that we should use funds to take care of the \nneeds of those children.\n  The State determines what the need is. The State determines how to \nhelp that child. The State determines whether to help that child or \nnot. They can make a decision this child does not need help. But if the \nState makes a decision that there is a child in need, and he has been \nput in need because the parent has been cut off of welfare assistance, \nthat we should have a requirement that they use Federal and State funds \nto take care of that need.\n  How much they do is left up to the State. How they do it is left up \nto the State. But, by gosh, we have an obligation here to say that we \nare not going to let children go hungry or uncared for. I think the \nSenator's side should agree with that. I think that many do.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator would yield for an additional comment.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I simply state that the question and the point I make is \nthat the Senator's amendment is, on its face, inconsistent because in \nthe first 5 years it puts mandates on the States, the second 5 years it \ngives the States flexibility. I think the flexibility part is very \nrefreshing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n\n[[Page S8101]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time remains on the Democratic side and how \nmuch on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska controls 4 minutes \n50 seconds. The Senator from New Mexico controls 20 minutes 14 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to say to the Senators on our side, the chairman \nof the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, wants to speak for a few \nmoments, and I want to speak for a couple. Then we want to yield back \nour time and have a vote. Obviously, the Senator has a few minutes \nleft, Senator Exon.\n  Before I proceed to ask Senator Roth if he would like to speak, may I \nclarify for those who are going to vote shortly.\n  I say to the Senator from Louisiana, his discussion was about an \namendment the Senator proposes to offer; is that correct?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I respond to the Senator by saying that we have been \ntalking about a little of everything here, but most of the comments \nhave been about the Breaux voucher amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Breaux voucher amendment will not be before us when \nwe vote here in about 10 or 15 minutes. The Senator intends to offer it \nlater on, as I understand it.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I also answer to the Senator, for clarification, the work \nfirst also has a voucher plan for children in it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Nation's current welfare system does \nnot serve the Nation well. It has failed the children it is intended to \nprotect and it has failed the American taxpayer. I am hopeful that the \ndebate in the Senate will ultimately result in a constructive \nbipartisan effort which will finally end the current system and achieve \nmeaningful reform.\n  Meaningful reform will assure that children are protected, that able-\nbodied people work and that child support enforcement laws are \neffective in getting absent parents to support their children.\n  One challenge is to seek genuine reform of welfare without abandoning \nthe goal of helping children. The Daschle work-first bill fundamentally \nchanges the current welfare system by replacing unconditional, \nunlimited aid with conditional benefits for a limited time.\n  Under the work-first bill, in order to receive assistance, all \nrecipients must sign a contract. This contract will contain an \nindividual plan designed to move the parent promptly into the work \nforce. Those who refuse to sign a contract won't get assistance and \ntough sanctions apply to those not complying with the contract they \nsign.\n  The underlying legislation requires people to work within no more \nthan 2 years. Why wait that long? Why wait 2 years? Unless someone is \nin school or job training, why wait longer than 3 months to require \nthat a person who is able bodied either have a private job or be \nperforming community service.\n  I have long believed that work requirements should be applied \npromptly. The Daschle amendment contains language which I will offer as \nan amendment to the underlying bill, if the Daschle substitute fails \nwhich requires that recipients be in training or in school or working \nin a private sector job within 3 months, or if one cannot be found, in \ncommunity service employment. Within 3 months, not 2 years. The \nrequirement would be phased in to allow States the chance to adjust \nadministratively and would allow for a State to opt out.\n  Last year, the Senate-passed welfare reform bill contained this \nprovision, added as an amendment which I offered with Senator Dole.\n  Experience has shown we must be more aggressive in requiring \nrecipients to work. But, as we require recipients to work, we must \nremember another important part of the challenge facing us: that fully \ntwo-thirds of welfare recipients nationwide are children. Almost 10 \nmillion American children--nearly 400,000 in Michigan alone--receive \nbenefits. We must not punish the kids.\n  I am hopeful that the 104th Congress is on the road to finding a way \nto get people off welfare and into jobs, in the private sector, if \npossible, but in community service, if necessary; make sure that absent \nparents take the responsibility for the support of their children; and \ndo these things without penalizing children--that way, I believe, is \nthe work first plan offered by Senator Daschle.\n  I congratulate Senator Daschle, Senator Mikulski, Senator Breaux, and \nthe many others of my colleagues who have worked on the Daschle work \nfirst bill.\n  The work first bill is tough on getting people into jobs, but it \nprovides the necessary incentives and resources to the States not only \nto require people to work, but to help people find jobs, and keep them.\n  Mr. President, I have focused on getting to people to work. However, \nthere are other elements of positive welfare reform that I support. The \nnumber of children born to unwed teenage parents has continued to rise \nat unacceptable rates. We all recognize the need to do something about \nthis and to remove any incentives created by the welfare system for \nteenagers to have children. I support teen pregnancy prevention \nprograms with considerable flexibility for the States in \nimplementation.\n  We know, however, that the problem of teen pregnancy and unwed \nteenage parents will not be completely or easily eliminated. I strongly \nsupport provisions which require teen parents to continue their \neducation or job training and to live either at home, with an adult \nfamily member, or in an adult-supervised group home in order to qualify \nfor benefits.\n  Another key element of any successful welfare reform plan will be \nassuring that parents take responsibility for their children. We must \ntoughen and improve interstate enforcement of child support. I support \nprovisions to require cooperation in establishing the paternity of a \nchild as a condition of eligibility for benefits, and a range of \nmeasures such as driver's license and passport restrictions, use of \nFederal income tax refunds, and an enhanced data base capability for \nlocating parents who do not meet their child support obligations.\n  The Daschle amendment which is before us addresses these and other \nproblems. It ends the failed welfare system and replaces it with a \nprogram to move people into jobs, to guarantee child care assistance, \nto assure that parents take responsibility for the children they bring \ninto the world, and does so without penalizing the children.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us is an improvement over the bill \nwhich the President vetoed last year, which was inadequate in many \nways, including its failure to protect children. However, the bill can \nstill be improved. In my judgement, the Daschle amendment does a better \njob by putting people to work more quickly and by doing a better job of \nprotecting innocent children. I intend to vote for Senator Daschle's \nwork first welfare reform plan. I urge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to lay partisanship loyalties aside and to join in an effort \nto finally end the current system and achieve meaningful reform.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 5 minutes to the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the American people should heed the old \nadvertising slogan ``accept no imitations.'' The work first amendment \nis a well-named imitation of welfare reform. But real reform must have \nsome very basic provisions. It must have real and workable time limits. \nIt must bring closure to entitlement programs. It must not engender \ndependency and allow multigenerational abuse of the system. Real reform \nmust require able-bodied individuals to work. It must offer flexibility \nand authority to State governments to be innovative and effective in \nmeeting the needs of their people.\n  While work first has the benefit of good advertising, it is an \nimitation. Work first has no real time limits. Work first has no real \nrequirements for people to work. Work first lacks the specific, \nconcrete requirements needed for reform. Rather, work first appears to \nbe more of the same. It does not extend real authority to the States. \nIt offers waivers. It grandfathers existing waivers and intends to \nexpedite the process.\n  The Governors have had their fill of waivers. To them, work first is \nbusiness as usual with Washington bureaucrats dispensing authority one \ndrop, one waiver at a time. But waivers, Mr.\n\n[[Page S8102]]\n\nPresident, are not welfare reform. And for requiring individuals to \nwork, work first offers something called parent empowerment contracts. \nThese sound great. And I have much interest in that concept. But we do \nnot know much about them other than intensive job search is required. \nThis is all we know, and that they are designed to move the parent into \nthe work force as soon as possible.\n  For real reform, Mr. President, this rhetoric is simply too vague. I \nmight say, that the Governors have real concern about these contracts. \nThey are concerned that they will be provocative of much litigation for \nthose who would seek to impose obligations on the States because of \nthese contracts.\n  But in any event, real reform must be concrete. As I said, it must \nhave time limits and a bottom line. To create incentives in the hearts \nand minds of people moving off welfare rolls, they must know that \nWashington and their State governments are serious. Their behavior must \nchange.\n  Last year the General Accounting Office reported that between 1989 \nand 1994 the Federal and State governments have spent more than $8 \nbillion through the job program. The GAO told Congress that we do not \nknow what progress has been made in helping poor families become \nemployed and avoid long-term dependence.\n  Real reform must change behavior and foster policies that encourage \nmen and women to make correct choices. Work first attempts to attract \nsupport by offering false choices in regard to teen parents, child \ncare, and transitional Medicaid benefits. Make no mistake about it, the \nRepublican welfare bill includes all of these items.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the amendment. It is time for welfare reform. \nIt is time for the real thing. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, may I inquire as to whether or not the yeas \nand nays have been requested on the Daschle work first amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been requested.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I think we are trying to bring this debate \nto a close. The Senator from Nebraska has been yielding time now for 2 \nor 3 hours. I wish to address this briefly myself, not hash over other \nground. I understand that the Senator from Connecticut may wish some \ntime. Is that correct?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from Nebraska. If it is possible \nto speak for up to 5 minutes, I would be grateful.\n  Mr. EXON. I will be glad to yield 5 minutes. Then I will take 3 or 4 \nminutes. I believe that will be the end of the debate on this side. \nThen maybe we can get some agreement to proceed to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska controls 3 minutes \n42 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. As soon as the manager of the bill finishes his statement, \nI will yield 5 minutes off of the bill to the Senator from Connecticut. \nThen I will use the last 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me just say, the 800-page amendment is subject to a \npoint of order, which I do not want to make. However, if we cannot vote \nin about 15 minutes--I have a couple of Senators who will not be here \nfor a little while--I will need to make a point of order on this \nmatter.\n\n  Could we agree right now on how much time we will use, Senator, and \nthen vote?\n  Mr. EXON. I have agreed to give 5 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut. I think I have 3\\1/2\\ minutes left on the bill, for a \ntotal of 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will wrap it up with 3 minutes. That makes 11 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is 11\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that in 11\\1/2\\ minutes there \nbe a vote, and the time be distributed as we have indicated.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, I would like 2\\1/2\\ or 3 \nminutes, if I might be part of the queue.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, in order to accommodate everyone, the \nmanager of the bill will agree to put my statement in the Record. I \nyield whatever time I had to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota would have 3\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  Is there an objection to the unanimous consent request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Nebraska for \nyielding.\n  I rise to support the work first amendment, which I think is balanced \nand valuable in the sense of expressing the values of the American \npeople's statement on the problem of welfare. It is genuine reform. It \ntargets and puts the pressure on those who should feel the pressure. \nThat is the parents who are on welfare. It does what I think the \nAmerican people, in the best expression of our values, want us to do, \nand that is to protect the children and not punish the children who are \nthe innocent victims of the current status quo.\n  As I look at the various proposals before the Senate, the underlying \nbill, the amendment we have put together, it seems to me there is so \nmuch in common that we ought to be able in the interest of those on \nwelfare and the interest to the Federal Treasury and the interest of \ncreating a welfare program in this country that truly expresses the \nvalues of the American people, to get together and make this happen. I \nstill think there is time to send the President a good bill that he \nwill feel in the fullness of his conscience that he can sign.\n  Mr. President, if we talk about welfare reform, I think we have to \nfocus at its heart on the question of babies born out of wedlock. \nParticularly, of teenage pregnancy. Because so many of those on \nwelfare--and the numbers are in the Record--are children and mothers of \nchildren who were born when the mothers were teenagers and unwed--an \nextraordinarily damaging epidemic that has swept this country, damaging \nto the young women whose future is hobbled and severely limited by the \nfact they have given birth to babies as teenagers, unmarried, and \nbringing into the world these children who are subjected to some of the \nworst imaginable conditions, with very little hope, born to a 12, 13, \n14, 15, 16-year-old girl without a man in the house and living in \npoverty--what chance does that child have, on the average to make \nsomething of his or her life?\n  All the proposals here, including the work first proposal, contain a \nbasic principle, which is that unmarried, minor moms are required to \nlive at home or under adult supervision, and must stay in school or \ntraining in order to continue to receive welfare benefits. A great idea \nwhich I fully support.\n\n  Mr. President, I intend to offer two amendments which I think \nstrengthen this battle against teen pregnancy. I saw a study last week \nthat said that we spend $29 billion every year because of babies born \nto unwed mothers, a startling number. Think what we could do if we \ncould prevent this from happening.\n  I have two amendments. The first one would require States to dedicate \n3 percent of their share of title 20 social service block grants, which \nis an amount equal to $71.4 million, to programs and services that \nstress to minors the difficulties of becoming a teenage parent. \nHopefully, these programs will infuse our children with a clear \nunderstanding of the consequences, let alone the immorality of bearing \na child as a teenager who is unmarried.\n  The second amendment gets at a problem we have recently uncovered in \nour country, which is that a startling number of the babies born to \nteenage mothers are fathered by older men. This used to be something \nwhen I was growing up that we called statutory rape. It sort of went \nout of fashion to think of that in the age of widespread consensual \nsex, and none of the norms that used to exist. Very often in these \ncases it is not consensual. It is an older man forcing himself on a \nyounger woman with drastic consequences for that woman and the baby.\n\n[[Page S8103]]\n\n  My second amendment would appropriate $6 million, a small sum, to the \nAttorney General to direct a national program of training State and \nlocal prosecutors to revive and enforce statutory rape laws. It will \nalso--and I think this may be the most significant part, as part of the \ncertification procedure that is in the underlying bill, in which the \nGovernor of a State has to certify that programs in his or her State to \nqualify for aid under the program--it requires the State to certify \nthat there is within the State a program to reduce the incidence of \nstatutory rape of minors by expanding criminal law enforcement, public \neducation, and counseling services, as well as restructuring teen \npregnancy prevention programs to include the education of men.\n  Mr. President, I hope one or both of these might be accepted as the \nday goes on, by the majority, because they are not presented in a \nspirit of partisanship. Obviously, this is a problem that is not \npartisan and is very human.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Nebraska. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise to support the Democratic work first \nsubstitute amendment to the budget reconciliation bill. As I observed \nin my opening statement, there is ample room for improvement in the \nRepublican welfare reform bill. But there is also a great deal of \ncommon ground upon which we can build.\n  There is agreement that the current welfare system serves neither the \nrecipients, nor the taxpayers. The cycle of dependency deepens with \neach new generation and is most discouraging. We agree that all able-\nbodied recipients should earn their daily bread. And we concur that \nassistance should be conditional.\n  I want to commend by colleagues on the other side for moving off of \nsome strongly held beliefs and seeking the center. I believe that this \nnew version of the Democratic work first welfare reform bill also \nreflects this same spirit of compromise and bipartisanship.\n  I argue, however, that the amendment before us today is preferable to \nthe Republican plan. The sponsors of the amendment have spoken with \ngreat clarity and vigor about the differences between the two plans. \nBoth give the States greater flexibility to administer welfare. But the \nDemocratic work first plan does not accomplish it at the expense of \ninnocent children who find themselves in the middle of this legislative \ncrossfire.\n  I would hope that Senators on both sides would hold the line on \nprotecting the safety net for children. The Democratic work first plan \ndoes that in three critical areas.\n  First, it provides for vouchers or noncash aid to children whose \nparents have exceeded a State's time limit on the welfare rolls. \nDepriving a child of life's necessities not only saps their strength; \nit weakens our spirit as a Nation as well.\n  Second, the Democratic plan provides for flexibility during times of \nrecession. Who is hurt most in these times? The poor. Let's not make a \nbad situation worse.\n  And third, the Democratic plan does not provide for an optional block \ngrant of food stamps. We should not be encouraging the States to lower \naid even further.\n  There is great merit in both bills, but the necessary safeguards I \nhave just outlined make this amendment the superior piece of \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to vote for it.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). There is 3 minutes, 20 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 3 minutes and 20 seconds to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to thank the able floor leader on \nthe Democratic side on this legislation, Senator Exon, for giving me \nthis time.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the Finance Committee I have been \ndeeply involved in the formulation of this legislation, including the \nwork first alternative that has been presented by Leader Daschle.\n  Mr. President, Senator Lieberman has made the point well with respect \nto teen pregnancy. One of the epidemics we are facing in this country \nis an epidemic of teen pregnancy, children having children. One has to \nask what chance does a child have who is born into a circumstance when \nthe mother is 14 years old or 15 years old? We know the chances are \nlimited. We know the results--dramatically increased chance of living \nin poverty, dramatically increased chance of living a life that is \nblighted by crime.\n  Mr. President, we also know what can help prevent that circumstance. \nWe know that requiring the child to live at home and to stay in school \nis critically important. I remember very well the testimony before the \nFinance Committee by Sister Mary Rose, who works with Catholic \nCharities in Covenant House. She has dealt with literally thousands of \nyoung women in this circumstance. How do you prevent that young woman \nfrom having another child? She has found that if you can bring that \nyoung woman into a circumstance where there is warmth, love, \ndiscipline, and structure, almost without exception, those young women \ndo not have another child.\n\n  Now, this legislation, work first, has $150 million for second-chance \nhomes for those young women who cannot be at home, who face abusive \nsituations at home. Some people can go home and that is appropriate and \nright, and that is what should happen. But in other circumstances, \nthese girls who have had children really have no place to go. They have \nbeen in an abusive setting at home. The last thing to do is to send \nthem back there. Yet, if we can structure a circumstance or an \nenvironment in which there is discipline, structure, and warmth, and \nthere is a vision of a better future, these young people can have a \nchance. Sister Mary Rose told us very clearly that if we can structure \na circumstance in which those elements were present, we could avoid the \ntragedy of increased teen pregnancy.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the bill before us.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just want to make one observation. The \ndistinguished minority leader said, in explaining this bill, that with \nreference to the work requirements, he thought it was the equivalent of \nthe Republican bill in that, in 2002, 50 percent of the participants \nwould have to be working. Actually, we have had that analyzed and \nlooked at, and because the bill uses different rules for establishing \nthis percentage, we believe that it is more like 60 percent of what the \nRepublican bill does. So it is in the neighborhood of 25 to 30 percent \ninstead of 50. I believe that is a truism. Just a reading of what goes \ninto the formula would indicate that it is clearly a different formula. \nMuch more is included in their starting point than in ours. So if for \nno other reason, the amendment before us does not push the States to \nthe same degree in turning this program into a workfare instead of a \nwelfare program.\n  Whatever time I have remaining, I yield that back. I think we are \nready to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 46, nays 53, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 201 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--53\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frahm\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n\n[[Page S8104]]\n\n\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Bradley\n       \n  So the amendment (No. 4897) was rejected.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to speak \ntoday on the important yet controversial topic of welfare reform. As \nthis Congress works through the rigors and challenges of welfare \nreform, I am reminded of my upbringing in Idaho, where I learned that \ncharity begins in the home.\n  Having grown up in a rural western State, I can remember the days \nwhen the county clerks were the ones who handed out public assistance. \nToday that task has been assumed by the Federal Government and operated \nthousands of miles away from the recipient. Obviously, the war on \npoverty was launched with good intentions, but it has become a \nmiserable failure. Unfortunately, the plight of the poor today is worse \nthan it was before we began our massive assistance programs.\n  Since 1965, when our current welfare system was started, the American \ntaxpayers have spent trillions of dollars--yes, trillions. The current \nbudget is in the hundreds of billions and its growth continues to \nspiral upward. Incredibly, with this extraordinary growth in spending, \nthe number of children living in poverty has also risen. We need real \nreform in the welfare system. Throwing unlimited money at this problem \nhas proven not to be the answer.\n  Welfare spending was intended to provide a safety net for children, \nlikewise to provide a hand up and out of poverty for those in need. \nWhat it has become is a way of life and not short term assistance.\n  With dramatic reforms and an emphasis on getting people into real \npermanent work situations, we can provide these children and their \nparents with a future. All one has to do is to look at the successes \nStates are achieving that are already out there operating under waivers \nto the current policy. I would argue that these same States have done a \nmuch better job at designing programs to meet the needs of their people \nthan has the Federal Government. It is just plain common sense that the \nState can identify problems quicker and develop solutions faster, as \nthey can see the problems as they really are.\n  One of the ways these States are achieving successes is through block \ngrants. Governors have supported this. Our Governor in Idaho supports \nthis. We can provide block grants to the States and give them the \nflexibility to use funds in a variety of ways, including to supplement \nwages for those recipients who are working.\n  In closing, I support welfare reform. Everyone here supports welfare \nreform. We must find ways to overcome bipartisan differences in our \nefforts toward our single common goal--providing a helping hand up and \nout of poverty while preserving the dignity of those in need.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe we are going to yield to \nSenator Specter for a resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/18/senate-section/article/S8076-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8104-S8105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE TRAGIC CRASH OF TWA \n                               FLIGHT 800\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have consulted with the distinguished \nmajority leader as to sequencing on a resolution relating to last \nnight's crash of TWA flight 800, and this is a resolution which has, as \nI understand it, been cleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could we have order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this resolution relates to the disaster last night \ninvolving TWA flight 800 where 229 passengers were killed. As I have \nsaid, my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, \nand I have taken the lead on this because at least from preliminary \nindications, our State, Pennsylvania, has been hit the hardest. We are \nnot yet sure about the passenger list, but from all indications the \npassenger list contained some 16 members of the Montoursville High \nSchool French Club and 5 chaperones.\n  I talked earlier today with Superintendent David Black and Principal \nDan Chandler to get an idea of the impact on the community. They have \ncommented that this group of students was a most extraordinary group, \nas shown by the fact that it was a specially planned trip to Paris, and \nthese young men and women were among the best and the brightest.\n  Along with these 16 high school students were 5 chaperones, and I \nunderstand a recent report shows that two other Pennsylvanians were on \nboard. Of course, passengers included people from all over the United \nStates and doubtless beyond the United States.\n  So I offer this resolution expressing the sense of the Senate \nregarding the tragic crash of TWA flight 800:\n\n       Whereas, on July 17, 1996, Trans World Airlines Flight 800 \n     tragically crashed en route from New York to Paris, France, \n     creating a tremendous and tragic loss of life estimated at \n     229 men, women, and children;\n       Whereas, according to Daniel L. Chandler, principal of \n     Montoursville, Pennsylvania High School, among those \n     traveling on board this airplane were 16 members of the \n     Montoursville High School French Club, who were among the \n     very best students of the French language at their school, \n     and five adult chaperones, who generously devoted their time \n     to making possible this planned three-week French Club trip \n     to Paris and the French provinces;\n       Whereas the actual cause of the airplane crash is as of yet \n     unknown;\n       Whereas the federal government is investigating the cause \n     of this tragedy; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the United States--\n       (1) expresses its condolences to the families, friends, and \n     loved ones of those whose lives were taken away by this \n     tragic occurrence; and\n       (2) expresses its sincere hope that the cause of this \n     tragedy will be determined through a thorough investigation \n     as soon as possible.\n\n  That is the text of the resolution. Beyond that, as has been reported \npublicly, it is unknown what the cause was. We have requested a \nbriefing for Senators through the Intelligence Committee or Terrorist \nSubcommittee of Judiciary. We are awaiting final word on that.\n  Mr. President, I submit this resolution for consideration by the \nSenate and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 280) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate regarding the tragic crash of TWA flight 800.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, last night TWA flight 800, on route \nfrom New York to Paris and then Rome, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean \napproximately 10 miles off the coast of Long Island. It does not appear \nthat there were any survivors among the 228 passengers and crewmembers \nwho were aboard.\n  My heart goes out to the family and friends of the victims of this \ntragedy. It is always hard to lose a loved one. It is particularly hard \nto lose a loved one in an unexpected, violent event such as last \nnight's tragedy.\n  We do not yet know the cause of this terrible crash. We do not know \nwhether it was accidental or intentional.\n  I do not believe that we should make assumptions at this time as to \nwhat happened last night. This is the time to collect the remains of \nthe dead, to mourn their passing, and to begin to investigate the cause \nof this tragedy.\n  Rest assured, however, that this is an event that must be fully \ninvestigated. If last night's tragedy was intentional, we will find out \nwho was responsible. If it was the result of a mechanical or electrical \nfailure, we will find out the cause.\n  Every year, Americans take off and land 547 million times; 22 \nthousand flights take off every day in this country.\n  I am committed to achieving the highest possible level of safety for \nour Nation's airways. Yesterday's events point out that we need to \nredouble our efforts to ensure the safety of our travelers.\n\n[[Page S8105]]\n\n  Air transportation is an integral part of the lives of millions of \nAmericans, and we must do everything in our power to ensure that it is \nas safe as we can possibly make it.\n  We must do everything in our power to prevent future tragedies like \nthe one that occurred last night.\n  My prayers are with the families and friends of the people aboard TWA \nflight 800.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested.\n  Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

So for now, \nthe best I can do is say let us wait for at least 30 minutes and then \ntry to give you a more concrete answer.\n  I thank Senator Ashcroft for yielding.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, the debate over the provisions before \nus today represents an opportunity to change the way we view welfare in \nthis country. The question is simple: Will we continue to allow Federal \nassistance to be a way of life?\n  That is the fundamental choice we face. Will we see welfare as the \nintergenerational problem that it is, or will we continue to fund this \nfailure, this dependence?\n  There are a number of things in this bill that would help us make \nsure welfare is no more than a transition. We put time limits on \nwelfare, for instance. But if we really want to move people from \ndependence to independence, if we want individuals to move from welfare \nto work, if we really want individuals to change their behavior, I \nthink we ought to be asking people to display a set of behaviors which \nreadies them for the real world.\n\n  If you want to be part of the working world, you ought to be drug-\nfree. When you go to work in the private sector, this is the standard. \nAs the chart behind me indicates, even in small firms with 1 to 500 \nemployees, 62 percent test for drugs. Similarly, 88 percent of all \nfirms employing over 10,000 people in America require drug testing.\n  Now, I ask a simple question: What good does it do for us to allow \npeople to remain on drugs if they have little or no capacity to be \nplaced in the private sector? If you are on welfare, you should be off \ndrugs. Period.\n  That is the point that I make, that the American people should not be \nasked to spend their hard-earned resources supporting the drug habits \nof uninterested addicts. Under my amendment, each State would be \nrequired to create a random drug-testing program as well as sanction \nthose individuals who test positive.\n  It does mandate that the States require drug testing. No question. It \nis time, however, for us to stop funding the drug habits of individuals \nwho have no intention of working toward a job.\n  I am pleased, then, to send this amendment to the desk, and to say to\n\n[[Page S8106]]\n\nthose individuals who are on welfare, it is time to move from \ndependence to independence and opportunity. I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Madam President, I listened with interest to the presentation made by \nthe Senator from Missouri regarding his amendment. I bring to the \nattention of the membership that the amendment says ``notwithstanding \nany other provision of law, States shall''--not may, but ``shall''--\n``shall test welfare recipients.'' So, effectively this is a mandate. \nThe Senator has not commented about how much money these tests would \ncost and who would pay for them. We heard a good deal earlier this year \nabout unfunded Federal mandates. Well that's what this amendment is. \nThis amendment says that the States shall undertake this activity.\n  Now, if the Senator offered an amendment to provide that the \nGovernors, or the State legislatures and the Governors, may do this, I \nmight urge the Senate to support it. I might support giving States the \ndiscretion to test, within constitutional limits, provided that they \ncomply with the HHS guidelines which ensure maximum accuracy and \nappropriate safeguards.\n  But the Senator says we will not leave this matter up to the States. \nWe will not let the Governors make a decision or judgment about this. \nThis amendment provides no flexibility based on different State \nexperiences. This amendment says that every State shall do it.\n  I hope in the remaining time, the Senator from Missouri would explain \nto the Senate where the States will get the money to do it. If they use \nmoney from this bill, it is going to come out of other vital \nactivities. If they had discretion, Governors might decide that drug \ntesting was a sensible priority for these scarce funds, or they might \nnot. But this amendment provides no discretion. As a result, the money \nspent on drug testing will be money not spent on children's programs \nand expectant mother programs. We are going to cut back on those even \nfurther.\n  I would have thought the Senator would at least attempt to justify \nhis proposal by arguing that there is a higher incidence of substance \nabuse among AFDC recipients, but he has not made that point. He has not \nmade that point because there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that \nit is true. But evidently he believes that poor people need this kind \nof testing, but that other, different groups that get Federal benefits \ndo not. We do not drug test farmers applying for crop subsidies. We do \nnot drug test homebuyers applying for a federally guaranteed mortgage. \nWe do not drug test corporate executives applying for marketing \nassistance overseas. But we are singling out this particular group of \npoor people for this stigmatizing, intrusive procedure.\n\n  Now, the latest information from HHS is that it costs at least $35 to \nconduct a drug test, and that does not include the cost of an \nadministrative appeals process, or the cost of treatment for those who \ntest positive. There are some 5 million adults receiving AFDC, and that \nis only one category of welfare recipients. So we are looking ar a bare \nminimum price tag of $1.75 billion. That is $1.75 billion, without any \nassurance about what particular tests or laboratories we will have.\n  Madam President, it seems to me it would make more sense to say that \nthe States may go ahead and develop these programs if they choose \nwithin constitutional limits and in compliance with the HHS guidelines. \nLet the Governors make that decision. But that is not what this \namendment is about.\n  At an appropriate time, Mr. President, I will make a point of order \nagainst the amendment.\n  Madam President, just a brief comment on the underlying piece of \nlegislation that we are considering here this evening. It is shocking \nto me that after months of what I had hoped was progress, our \nRepublican friends are once again prepared to shed the fragile and \nfrayed safety net designed to protect nearly 9 million American \nchildren. As I said from the beginning, there is a right way and a \nwrong way to reform welfare. Punishing children is the wrong way. \nDenying realistic job training and work opportunities, is the wrong \nway. Leaving States holding the bag is the wrong way. We all want to \nmove families from welfare to work, but we should be clear that this \nbill is still not about real welfare reform but is simply more welfare \nfraud.\n  After more than 60 years of a good-faith national commitment to \nprotect all needy children, our Republican friends are still proposing \nlegislative child neglect, if not abuse. This measure, the broad \nmeasure, the underlying measure, is an assault on the youngest and most \nvulnerable Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in doing the right compassionate \nthing and eventually voting no. Granted, after being called on the \ncarpet for putting forward their home alone welfare bill, a proposal \nthat would have forced mothers into workfare programs even if they had \nno one to care for their children--this bill provides funding for child \ncare services. In addition, the Republicans have finally let go of \ntheir desire to dismantle existing protections for abused and neglected \nchildren. These are improvements.\n  The bill, nevertheless, poses many of the very same dangers to \nchildren as the bills that have already been vetoed. Madam President, \nhere are a few of the tragic consequences. Under the Republican bill, \ndestitute children would no longer be able to count on even the most \nbasic concern in a time of need. In 1935, Congress made a historic \npromise that no child would be left to face poverty, hunger, and \ndisease. This bill permanently breaks that promise. If the Republicans \nhave their way, when children need a helping hand, it will depend on \nwhether they are fortunate enough to be born in a State that has the \nresources and the will to provide that assistance. It will no longer be \na matter of national policy. It will be a gamble geography.\n\n  Under the Republican bill, more than 1 million adolescent children \nand 4 million parents would lose their currently guaranteed access to \nhealth care. We know that adequate health care is a major barrier to \nemployment. If we are serious about promoting work and reducing long-\nterm health care costs, this is a major step backward.\n  Under the Republican bill, food stamp payments would be reduced to 66 \ncents a meal. I do not know how many of my colleagues have tried to \nfeed a child for 66 cents, but it is just not possible. By slashing $27 \nbillion from critically important nutrition programs, the Republican \nbill will leave more than 14 million children at risk of hunger, \nmalnutrition, stunted development, and school failure.\n  Under the Republican bill, 300,000 children with serious \ndisabilities, including mental retardation, tuberculosis, autism, and \nhead injuries, will be denied SSI cash benefits and Medicaid \neligibility.\n  The Republican bill pulled back the welcome mat for legal immigrants \nwho enter this country under our laws, play by the rules, pay taxes, \nand contribute to our communities. It bans legal immigrants from SSI \nand food stamps. Even if their sponsors cannot help them, they still \ncannot help. Many immigrants, particularly those who come to fill needs \nrather than to unite with families, do not even have sponsors to turn \nto when they need help. Under this bill, if you are a legal immigrant \nand you fall on hard times, you are out of luck.\n  Madam President, I can think of no measure that expresses a greater \nhostility toward the immigrants that have made this country great than \nto ban legal immigrants from the ultimate safety net--Medicaid.\n  There is a solution to ensure that public assistance is truly a last \nresort for immigrants. We should hold sponsors accountable for the care \nof the immigrants they sponsor. But where the sponsor cannot shoulder \nthe burden, or where there is no sponsor, we should be prepared to lend \na helping hand, particularly to the children. There is much more.\n  The Republican bill provides far too few Federal resources to help in \nthe training, education, and services needed to help move families from \nwelfare to work. It prohibits the States from offering assistance to \nbabies born to families on welfare--unless and until they enact laws to \nexempt themselves from this requirement. These provisions are a direct \nassault on children and have nothing at all to do with meaningful \nreform.\n  Madam President, right here in the Senate, much of what America has\n\n[[Page S8107]]\n\nstood for is being dismantled and destroyed.\n  In the movie ``Independence Day,'' people go to the theater, the \nlights go down, and they sit in the dark to watch a battle between \naliens and America's best fighters, who win in the end. Here we are \ntalking about American children living in poverty, the innocent victims \nof fate. If this bill passes, they will be the innocent victims of \ntheir own Government.\n  Tonight, after the movies, when people shut out their lights, we \nshould all think about how fate has treated us and about what kind of \ncountry we want to live in, about what kind of children we want to grow \nup in this country. We do not need to worry about aliens; we need to \nworry about what we are doing to ourselves, our country, and our \nchildren. We may be reaching for the gold in Atlanta, but when it comes \nto caring for our children, we are certainly trailing the rest of the \nindustrial world here in Washington. Surely, we can do better.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I support random drug tests, and I have \nvoted for random drug tests for welfare and food stamp recipients--as \nrecently, in fact, as last May in Senate vote 133. But the big \ndistinction between that and what Senator Ashcroft is proposing here is \nthat he is making it mandatory--and not providing the money to pay for \nit. We spent the first part of this Congress in 1995 debating the \nentire issue of unfunded mandates. And, here is an unfunded mandate. If \nthis amendment had provided the funding or allowed States to do random \ndrug tests, I would have supported it, as I have similar proposals in \nthe past. But I cannot support this.\n  Madam President, I support the right of States to require welfare \nrecipients to submit to drug tests and to fulfill a commitment to \nremain drug free as a condition for receiving public assistance. Drug \nabuse is serious, and is all-too-often a heartbreaking problem, \nparticularly among young people. And we have to attack it on as many \nfronts as we can. Just yesterday, I joined my friend and colleague, \nSenator Hatch of Utah, in introducing a bill to crack down on the \nmanufacture and importation of methamphetamine, or crank.\n  But whether a State chooses to combat drug abuse among welfare \nrecipients through random testing and punishment, or through other \nmethods of screening drug use and efforts to help people get off drugs \npermanently, is a decision that should be left to the States. Random \ndrug testing is not cheap, and this amendment, as written, would force \nthe States to spend up to $200 million--even if they had in place \nanother means to go after drug use money recipients. While I support \nthe right of States to test welfare recipients for drug use, I cannot \nsupport this unfunded mandate.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I ask that the Senator from Oklahoma \n[Mr. Nickles] be added as a cosponsor, and I yield 4 minutes to the \nSenator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise tonight to join my friend from \nMissouri, Senator Ashcroft, in offering this amendment, which would \nrequire the States to sanction individuals testing positive for drug \nuse. This amendment would go a long way in restoring integrity into our \nsystem of public assistance.\n  Madam President, I trust there is not one Senator in this Chamber who \nwould stand here and argue that taxpayers should be forced to subsidize \nthe drug habits of other individuals. Yet, if the Federal Government \ncontinues to send cash payments to individuals using drugs, that is \nexactly what is happening. Not only is that directly contrary to the \nintent of the AFDC program, and others, and a complete waste of the \ntaxpayers' money, but it is also very harmful to the parents using \ndrugs and the children living in that environment.\n  Subsidizing the parents' drug habits will, in the end, destroy their \nchances for ever becoming self-sufficient. They will remain trapped on \nwelfare longer and will require substantial rehabilitation.\n  However, Madam President, think of what we are doing to the children \nliving in that environment. Giving cash to parents using drugs is one \nof the cruelest forms of Federal child abuse I can think of. By cutting \noff or limiting public assistance to those buying drugs, we are \nlimiting their ability to buy the drugs. That will improve not only \ntheir lives, but the lives of their children.\n  Madam President, I believe the amendment offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri will restore a great deal to our welfare system. \nI hope my colleagues will support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. The Senator from Missouri has 6 minutes \nand 10 seconds. The Senator from Massachusetts has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am more than glad to yield back 4 minutes of the time \nand just take 1 more minute if the Senator wants to yield back his \ntime. I am more than glad to do that. If he is going to retain the \ntime, I will retain mine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before the Senator does that----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will not do anything until I hear what Senator \nAshcroft is going to do. If he wants to yield time, I will as well. If \nhe does not, I will retain my time.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I would like to use my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield myself 4 minutes of the time remaining.\n  I have to say that I agree totally with the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts. This amendment is about children. As a matter of fact, \ndrug use has been damning to children. It has, as a matter of fact, \nbeen lethal.\n  I would like to introduce you to one such child. This young man is no \nlonger with us. His name was Jason. His mother was a 21-year-old \nrecipient of the welfare of which we speak, and she funded her drug \nhabit with the methamphetamine drug known as crank. Not only was her \nchild born drug-addicted, but as a result of the nursing, the child \nliterally died of an overdose of methamphetamine.\n  So, this amendment is about children. It is also about drug use and \nwhat that use does to children. It kills them. It is time for us to \nstop this killing.\n  This amendment is also about preparing for a job. If we are willing \nto say that people who are involved in job training should be subject \nto mandatory drug tests, as we did last October, it seems to me that \nwelfare recipients should be held to the same standard. That is what \nthis amendment would do.\n  Mr. President, let us not lure welfare recipients into a false sense \nof security; stay on drugs and we will still support you. Let us make \nit clear from the very beginning. If you are on welfare, you will be \noff drugs. The taxpayers and the children who aspire to a better \ntomorrow deserve nothing less.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we can all have a feel good vote and \nsupport Senator Ashcroft's amendment and think we are doing something \nabout children. But the underlying bill cuts back on nutrition support \nfor 14 million children in the United States. So who really favors \nchildren?\n  It is interesting listening to this Senator from Missouri. He says we \nknow better, Washington knows better, we ought to tell those States how \nto run their programs. Of course he tells us something entirely \ndifferent in another context. I hope we can let the Governors make this \ndecision.\n  And remember the backdrop against which this amendment is offered. \nThis Republican Congress has spent the last 2 years cutting back on the \ndrug treatment and prevention programs that are designed to help the \nfamilies whose lives have been affected by the scourge of drugs. We \nhave tens of thousands of individuals who need and want drug treatment \ntoday, to free themselves from addiction, but they languish on the \nwaiting lists of the treatment programs that still exist after the \nRepublican budget cut these programs almost 20 percent. So we can \npretend to be tough about drugs by voting for this amendment, but if we \nreally wanted to fight drugs we would provide treatment to the people \nwho need it and are begging for it.\n  The Senator from Missouri talks about substance-abusing mothers. But \nthere is no money in here to assist any of those individuals who might \ntest positive and want freedom from addiction. Does the amendment have \nany\n\n[[Page S8108]]\n\nmoney for treating these women so that they can be better mothers to \ntheir children? No. It is not provided.\n  Not only is money for treatment not provided. There is no money in \nhere for the testing itself. It is $1.75 billion, and the Senator does \nnot show where it comes from.\n  On the underlying measure, we have 1.3 million children who are going \nto be thrown off Medicaid. We are supposed to shed crocodile tears \nabout drug-abusing mothers under the Ashcroft amendment, but the bill \nsays to 1.3 million Americans, ``You are going to be denied any kind of \nhelp and assistance.'' Are we going to say to the 4 million mothers who \nare being denied Medicaid, many of them of childbearing age, that they \nare going to be denied prenatal care? The baby may get some care, but \nwe are denying the mothers the prenatal care? Do we care about \nchildren?\n  It is difficult for me to be persuaded by the Senator's argument \nabout how concerned we are about children when the underlying bill so \nbadly frays the social safety net for children.\n  In conclusion, the amendment is an unfunded mandate on the States. It \ndoes not provide the money to conduct the drug tests. And it is simply \ninhumane to test these people and throw them into the street when the \nRepublican budget so dramatically cuts back on the drug treatment \nprograms that provide assistance for those individuals who want to free \nthemselves from substance abuse.\n  I withhold whatever time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Are we clear on time on amendments yet?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes left for each side.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, thank you very much.\n  The case of Jason Allen is not an isolated case. I could fill the \nRecord with cases of children who are drug abused, or victims of the \ndrug abuse of their parents, all funded by a welfare system that is the \nsubject of this debate.\n  This amendment does nothing to impair our ability to care for \nchildren. Far from it. This amendment merely says that we ought to \nprovide incentives for our children to live in drug-free environments, \nnot drug-laden environments.\n  If we care about children, we cannot allow the current devastation to \npersist. It has occurred for too long. It has ruined families and \nruined children. This amendment is an important first step in the right \ndirection.\n  With that, Madam President, I thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we still have not heard from the \nSenator about what is going to happen to those children. What is going \nto happen if the mother is thrown off the welfare rolls for testing \npositive? Say she has been denied treatment, she is on a waiting list \nfor drug treatment, and so she tests positive for drug use and forfeits \nher family's welfare benefits. How does that possibly help the \nchildren? You are prohibiting these women from getting vouchers so that \nthey can get diapers, so they can get milk, or infant formula. So what \nhappens to these families? They get thrown out on the street, and they \nare made homeless. There is no provision in here to look after the \nchildren.\n  I just think this is a harsh proposal. It is directed toward the \nmother, but it hits the children. It is also reflective of the \nunderlying problem with the whole welfare bill. We are fragmenting the \nsafety net for children in this country, and I think that is why the \nunderlying measure should be defeated as well.\n  I withhold the remaining time. I have to withhold enough time to be \nable to make a point of order.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I would be pleased to yield the \nremainder of my time for raising the point of order by the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back all my time, and as I understand when all \ntime is yielded that it is appropriate to make the point of order that \nthe pending Ashcroft amendment is not germane. I raise the point of \norder that the amendment violates section 305(b) of the Congressional \nBudget Act.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I move to waive the Budget Act for \nconsideration of my amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbe yielded back on the motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. There is no objection on my part.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, before we proceed to a vote, could I \nask Senator Dodd? I understand he has an amendment. If the sponsor and \nthe opposition to the previous amendment would permit us, we would like \nto set the motion aside temporarily and take up the Dodd amendment. I \nthink the Senator is going to go to 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. DODD. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And there be no second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. DODD. Right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. After which time we will order a rollcall on it, and we \nwill then ask they be sequenced----\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Reserving the right to object, might the Senator from \nNew Mexico estimate the time at which a vote would occur on this \namendment, on the motion to waive the budget act?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It looks to me like it would be 6:10.\n  Does the Senator want that agreed to now so we do not violate that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. If it is possible, I would like to defer the vote until \nperhaps 8:30.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think maybe we better proceed to vote on the motion \nto waive right now, Mr. President. We will just do that and take \nSenator Dodd's up in due course.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague, we will try to get it done quickly. \nThe amendment is not a matter of great controversy. I know a lot of \npeople wanted to say something about the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator take less?\n  Mr. DODD. I will try to do it in 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The amendment was going to be agreed to, so I assume \nthe Senator is going to get a very big vote. Would the Senator want to \nagree to let us accept the amendment?\n  Mr. DODD. I want a vote, I say, with all due respect, to the \nChairman, on an issue that has gone back and forth.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Reserving the right to object, is there a reason the \nSenator wants to make his remarks in advance of the vote?\n  If the Senator from Connecticut needs to leave for other reasons, I \nwould indicate to him that that is the condition in which the Senator \nfrom Missouri finds himself.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I withdraw my unanimous-consent \nrequest and ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] \nis necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nOregon [Mr. Hatfield] would vote nay.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] \nand the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber who desire to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 50, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 203 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Frahm\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kassebaum\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n\n[[Page S8109]]\n\n\n     Smith\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Bradley\n     Hatfield\n     Pryor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 50, the nays are \n47. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, our leader will announce his intentions \nshortly, but I just want to say, from the best I can ascertain, there \nare 28 known amendments on the Democratic side, and that does not \ninclude the list of Byrd rule violations which could be considered to \nbe votes. And on our side, there are 22, as of the last count.\n  I think the longer we are here, I say to the leader, it is an \ninvitation for phone calls. We have about nine additional phone calls \nin our cloakroom from Senators who want to add amendments. So I do not \nbelieve it is going to be very easy to get this completed. We are going \nto need substantial time.\n  I yield to the leader, because I can't do anything about it at this \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first, I would like to inquire, are we in a \nposition where we can get a 20-minute time agreement, equally divided, \non the Dodd amendment and get a vote on that in 20 minutes?\n  Mr. DODD. I say to the majority leader, we had 30 minutes, and we \nwill try to use less than that. We have a number of people who want to \nspeak. That is the problem. I will try to keep it to no more than 30.\n  Mr. LOTT. Are you talking about a total of 30 minutes equally \ndivided?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, 30.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me lock this in.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a 30-minute time \nagreement equally divided on the Dodd amendment, with a vote to follow \nimmediately after that time, and no second degrees be in order.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thought this was an amendment they were \ngoing to accept.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We told the Senator we would accept it. He desires a \nrollcall vote and desires debate.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. If it is going to be accepted, how much debate is there \ngoing to be on the other side? Can you take 10 minutes?\n  Mr. DODD. We are wasting time debating. Why don't we get to the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I don't want to delay time here. There has \nbeen a suggestion made that we try to work together on both sides of \nthe aisle to get a reasonable list of amendments that would be debated \nand voted on. If we could get that done, then we could go to events \nthat are scheduled tonight. Some of the Senators would like to be at \nthe Olympics tomorrow at 12. Then we would have a series of votes on \nthose amendments beginning at 9:30 Tuesday. Basically that is the \noutline of what we were trying to do. But instead of the amendments \nshrinking, they are growing on both sides of the aisle.\n\n  I have suggested to the Democratic leader that we will get our list \ndown to five amendments on our side of the aisle for votes, which means \nthat some of them will be accepted, some of them will come up another \nday. I mean, that is reasonable. I hope there will be an effort on the \nother side. We debated this before. We made our points. You can make \nyour points on your five amendments and we can make whatever points we \nhave to on our five amendments or so. It does not have to be exactly \nthat number. But if we are talking about a series of 20 to 40 \namendments on Tuesday, that is no accomplishment.\n  We do have an alternative. That is to stay here tonight and stay \ntomorrow and complete the time that is remaining and vote on amendments \ntomorrow, which would suit me fine. But I would like to be able to \naccommodate Members on both sides of the aisle who have things that \nthey would like to do. I think that would be fair.\n  So at this point, I just ask everybody--we have 30 minutes here. Let \nus get serious. Let us get this agreement worked out. Then we can go on \nand do what we need to do tonight and tomorrow. We can take up the \nagricultural appropriations bill Monday. We can debate the amendments \ntonight, tomorrow, and 4 hours on Monday and we can vote on Tuesday. \nThat is a mighty good arrangement. We have been having good cooperation \nall week. Let us see if we cannot do it one more time on this very \nimportant piece of legislation that the President wants and both sides \nof the aisle want. With that, I plead with Members on both sides to \ncooperate with us and let us get a reasonable list worked out.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me reiterate as well my desire to see \nif we cannot work this list down in the next 30 minutes. I hope every \none of the colleagues on my side of the aisle will come to me and tell \nme, No. 1, when they intend to offer the amendment and, No. 2, whether \nthey really need a rollcall or whether they would be satisfied with a \nvoice vote.\n  If we cannot get it down to a reasonable list, I think it is fair to \nsay that within a half-hour we would be then in a position to say \nwhether we will be here tonight, tomorrow and Monday. So, if we \ncannot--I do not have any plans--we will be here tonight. I have no \nobjection to being here tomorrow and Monday, but there are a lot of \npeople who have expressed an interest in trying to accommodate the \nschedule that the majority leader has discussed, and I hope we can do \nthat, just to take into account some of the people who have already \nmade their plans. But we will have to make that decision within the \nnext 30 minutes. So, I hope everybody will come to me, and we will \ndecide within that 30-minute timeframe whether or not we will be here \ntomorrow and Monday or not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could we ask our side to do the same--30 minutes?\n  Mr. LOTT. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Just come into the Cloakroom and tell us. We want to \ndispose of them. Thank you.\n\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4902\n\n  (Purpose: To restore health and safety protections with respect to \n                              child care)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] for himself, Mr. \n     Coats, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Kassebaum, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Mikulski, \n     Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. \n     Cohen, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4902.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 628, strike clauses (vi) and (vii) of section \n     2805(2)(A).\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself \nand my colleagues, Senators Coats, Kennedy, Kassebaum, Snowe, Mikulski, \nHarkin, Kohl, Kerry, Murray, Kerrey, Cohen, Reid, and Leahy. As you can \nsee by this list, Mr. President, this is a bipartisan effort.\n  I have asked for a rollcall vote here because this is an issue that \nhas been adopted in the past and yet mysteriously ends up dropping out \nof the bill every time we turn around. So I am asking for a rollcall \nvote, and hopefully an overwhelming vote here, so that when we get to \nconference on this legislation, it stays in the bill. Despite the fact \nthat we passed this a number of times, every time we get it done, \nsomehow it manages to disappear from the bill again, as it did from the \nFinance Committee bill. For those reasons, we will ask Members to be \nrecorded on this issue.\n\n[[Page S8110]]\n\n  Mr. President, let me just briefly point out that what we are doing \nhere is restoring to the bill the child care health and safety \nstandards that we adopted now 6 years ago when the senior Senator from \nUtah and I offered the child care legislation and set up broad \nguidelines for health and safety standards, leaving to the States the \nspecifics on how they would achieve those particular goals.\n  I am thankful for the efforts of my colleague from Indiana, and \nSenator Snowe, Senator Kassebaum, and others who worked on this over \nthe years. We have felt that it has been very, very helpful to have \nthese standards in place. If we are going to have, as we must have, \nchild care resources as we move people from welfare to work, these \nchildren have to be in a safe place. We have standards by which we \nmaintain our pets and our automobiles. In this case here we are setting \nbasic minimum standards for children. It is something that we ought to \nall be able to agree on.\n  There was a study done, Mr. President, a few years ago that assessed \nthe health and safety standards at child care settings across the \ncountry. The conclusion of that study, Mr. President, was that in only \n14 percent of the cases was it where the child care centers provided \ngood quality care. In 85 percent of those settings, almost 86 percent, \nthe study concluded it was not good quality at all. So there is a \nnecessity for requiring that these children be in a healthy and safe \nsetting. We are talking about a setting where you are seeing to it that \nthere are not open electrical outlets, there is electrical safety, \nwater safety, basic requirements so that these children will be \nadequately protected.\n  Mr. President, as I pointed out earlier today, let us try to keep \nthis debate in perspective. Of the 13 million people on welfare, 8.8 \nmillion of those are children. And 78 percent of that 8.8 million are \nunder the age of 12. Almost 50 percent of the 8.8 million children are \nunder the age of 6. So there is going to be a substantial number of \nchildren who will need child care as their mothers or fathers who are \non welfare go to work.\n  There is money for child care. I would like more, but it certainly is \nan improvement over what existed in the past. But it is not just a \nquestion of having funding for child care. These children must also be \nin a safe environment.\n  A little later on this evening or tomorrow, or whenever, you are \ngoing to have another amendment offered by my colleague from Louisiana \ndealing with another aspect of children's safety. Let me urge my \ncolleagues here, many of whom support this amendment, to look at the \nBreaux amendment and look at the other amendments dealing with \nchildren. I do not think there is any debate in this Chamber about \ntrying to get adults from welfare to work. But there ought not to be \nany debate either, in our view, about trying to see to it that innocent \nchildren who through no fault of their own have been born into \ncircumstances where they need some help, whether it is in food or \nhealth care or child care, are protected.\n  So we urge the adoption of the amendment and also amendments that \nwould provide that safety net for these children.\n  At this point, if I can, Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to my \ncolleague from Maryland, and then I will yield to my colleague from \nIndiana. At that point we will try to wrap up the debate here, unless \nothers want to be heard, and get to a vote on this amendment.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Dodd-\nMikulski-Kassebaum-Coats, et al. amendment. This amendment is really \nquite simple. It restores basic health and safety standards for child-\ncare providers receiving Federal funds.\n  The bill before us repeals those modest standards. I think that is \nshocking. Safe child care is too important to be left to chance.\n  Mr. President, we have to make sure that what we explicitly state are \nour values we put in our legislative policy. This bill does that. It \nrestores the requirement that states have standards in place to protect \nchildren. These standards protect children from infectious diseases, \nmake sure their buildings and playgrounds are safe, and require the \npeople who take care of children to know first aid.\n  I hope that every Senator will support this amendment because in \nmoving families to work, we must ensure not only the adequacy of child \ncare, but that child care is safe. Sure, we often focus on debating the \namount of money we are going to spend on child care. And this is one \nSenator who believes we need to provide more funding for child care. \nHowever, we have to make sure that child care is not only affordable, \nbut that it is safe. There is a basic need for health and safety \nstandards for child care facilities and providers. We need standards to \nmake sure our kids are not around open electrical outlets, that there \nare not open manholes like little Jessica fell down some years \nago. This is basic. Child care has to be more than warehousing kids. \nParents have to have some assurance that their children are in a \nhazard-free environment, and that those who are taking care of them \nknow at least basic first aid, so they will know what to do if a child \nis hurt or becomes ill.\n\n  This is not an unfunded mandate. It is not even a mandate at all. It \nis common human decency. Requiring States to assure certain basic \nhealth and safety standards is the least we can do to give parents \npeace of mind, while they are working to provide for their children.\n  Mr. President, in 1990 the Congress enacted a major child care bill. \nWe had bipartisan support for that bill. It provided Federal funds for \ntax credits and grants to make child care more affordable. It also \nensured that providers who receive those funds had to meet minimum \nhealth and safety standards, which each State would establish.\n  We recognized that basic standards were needed to ensure that all \nchildren would be safe and well-cared for. The 1990 child care bill \nmade sense then and it makes sense now. Under that law, States set the \nstandards; they decide what will work best for their State.\n  In my own State of Maryland, we have a three tiered system of health \nand safety standards. Maryland felt it was important that child care \ncenters that care for lots of kids have a higher level of regulation \nthan someone who provides care in a home setting or in the child's own \nhome. Maryland also ensures background checks to screen providers for \ncriminal records.\n  Other States have different standards to meet the particular needs of \ntheir State. But this law ensures that each and every State must have \nat least a minimal level of safety and health standards. If we are \nserious about protecting children, we absolutely must maintain that \nrequirement.\n  It is what every mom and dad wants for their kids. We should vote our \nvalues and support the Dodd-Mikulski, et al, amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I will be brief. I know time is of the \nessence here, and we will yield back some of our time.\n  Let me state that I support very much what Senator Dodd and Senator \nMikulski are attempting to do here. This is essentially the same \nlegislation that we are attempting to restore that we enacted in the \n1990 child care legislation. This gives States a great deal of \nflexibility.\n  For instance, the State of California has a program called Trust Line \nwhich allows the State to require background checks, criminal \nbackground checks, of child-care providers. In those background checks, \nthey found 5 percent of those who had applied to be State-certified \nchild-care providers had criminal backgrounds and they had to \ndisqualify them. Not all States have chosen to operate on that basis, \nalthough I think that is a reasonable requirement that a State might \nwant to impose on a child-care provider. That is just one example of \nthe flexibility that a State has to impose, those minimal conditions \nfor safety and health, under child-care provisions.\n  Now, the House Ways and Means committee has supported this. The House \nEmployment Economic Opportunity Committee, President Bush supported \nthis in 1990, the Congress supported it on a bipartisan basis, the \nGovernors have supported this. What we are attempting to do is correct \nsomething that I believe was an error, maybe it was not, but I think \nall indications are that it was an error as it was put in the \nreconciliation bill. This\n\n[[Page S8111]]\n\nwould restore it to what, essentially, is current law and what the \nCongress agreed to in 1990. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that Senator Boxer of \nCalifornia be added as a cosponsor, as well as Senator Exon and Senator \nWellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I end on the note I began with here. I hope our colleagues \nwill look at some of the other amendments dealing with children, \nparticularly the voucher proposal from Senator Breaux. I believe we can \ndevelop a pretty good bill here.\n\n  I do not think there is much debate about moving 4 million adults in \nthe country from welfare to work, and I hope we could develop some \nconsensus, particularly on the children under the age of 12. I \nunderstand people make an argument for 16-, 17-, and 18-year-olds, but \nwhen you have 80 percent of the 8.8 million kids on AFDC under the age \nof 12, 50 percent under the age of 6, it seems to me we ought to find \nthe means to provide a safety net for them, whether in a child-care \nsetting or regarding adequate nutrition.\n  I do not think we need any real debate about ideological differences \non that point. While I think we will get a strong vote here, I urge my \ncolleagues to look at these other amendments and judge them on their \nmerits and decide whether or not you do not think this will help \nstrengthen and improve a welfare-to-work piece of legislation that \ndraws us all together in this body, makes it a stronger bill, and one \nthat I think will adequately give the kind of protection to children \nthat all of us want to give.\n  Do not blame the innocent child for the circumstances they have \narrived in. They ought not to go hungry without adequate health care \nand the protection of a child-care setting.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I commend the Senator and both sides of the aisle for \ntheir leadership here, and say as one who has fought hard and long with \nthe Senators from Maryland, Connecticut, and certainly Senator Pryor \nand others for nursing home standards, we have to take care of our \nvulnerable populations. This is a big step forward.\n  Mr. President, back in 1990, we passed a law in the reconciliation \nbill to enact basic health and safety protections for child care.\n  That current law now requires providers receiving funds through the \nchild care development block grant [CCDBG] to have basic health and \nsafety protections in place.\n  The Dodd amendment restores these basic health and safety protections \nwhich are otherwise repealed in the pending welfare bill.\n  What do we mean by basic?\n  Requirements regarding the prevention and control of infectious \ndiseases.\n  Building and physical premises safety.\n  Minimum health and safety training.\n  These standards ensure, for example, that children have up-to-date \nimmunizations. That poisonous substances stay out of the reach of young \nchildren. That electrical outlets have plugs in them.\n  Simply put, these basic standards reduce the numbers of accidents, \nincidence of illness, and safe childrens' lives.\n  Mr. President, we are about to make major changes to the way welfare \nprograms in our country are run.\n  We hope that these changes will mean a lot more people will be \ngetting off welfare and going to work.\n  I think the least we can do is give people some assurance that their \nchildren's caregivers meet a minimum level of health and safety \nstandards.\n  Spurred by the Federal health and safety standards we put in place in \n1990, California decided to pass a law to give even more protection for \nchildren from providers with a criminal record.\n  The law California passed created Trust Line.\n  Turst Line is a criminal background check for child care providers \nwho are exempt from State licensing requirements.\n  Through Trust Line, the State found that 5 percent of these providers \nhad criminal records--60 percent of which involved child abuse \nconvictions.\n  Repealing the Federal standards would be a huge step backward for \nprotecting our children.\n  Many of us here are parents. I think we understand that having piece \nof mind about our childrens' safety is literally priceless.\n  The least we can do for the welfare recipients we will be sending off \nto work is to assure them that some minimum health and safety standards \nare in place for their child's day care facility.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Dodd amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Have the yeas and nays been requested?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 30 seconds to my colleague from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I compliment my friend from Connecticut and \nour Republican colleagues.\n  Mr. President, it was not too long ago--1990-- that we first put the \nchild care health and safety standards in place. The Senator from \nConnecticut--who led the effort--remembers all too well the extensive \ndiscussion--and, bipartisan compromise--that went into enacting these \nstandards.\n  It would be unfortunate if we repealed them today. They were the \nproduct of a bipartisan effort 6 years ago. They were retained in the \nbipartisan Senate bill that passed here last September. And they are \nretained in the bipartisan Castle-Tanner bill.\n  Frankly, I am not sure why we are repealing them. Usually, we hear \nthe argument about Federal requirements being a burden on people.\n  But, in fact, in my State of Delaware, the people who are the \nstrongest supporters of these health and safety standards are the very \npeople who have to comply with them--the child care providers.\n  Yes, child care providers in Delaware have come to me and said, \n``Don't get rid of the safety standards. Don't get rid of the quality \nin day care.''\n  It may sound strange. But, think about it. They want Federal \nstandards and Federal requirements because they remember what it was \nlike before there were standards. And, they do not want to go back.\n  And at a time when we are increasing child care funding--and going to \nsee significant increases in the number of children in day care as \nwelfare mothers are required to work--it is crucial that the child care \nproviders who will be caring for kids meet minimum standards. I don't \nthink that's too much to expect.\n  In fact, I think every parent with a child in day care would expect \nno less. Parents who drop their children off every morning want to know \nthat their kids will be safe. They want to be sure that they are not \nleaving their child at some fly-by-night, shoddy, unsafe, unhealthy day \ncare center.\n  So, I just urge my colleagues to think about what is being proposed \nhere.\n  I add one point, I do not know how we can, in fact, have the kind of \nbill we want without this amendment. I think it is very important. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support, and as an original \ncosponsor, of the amendment by the Senator from Connecticut.\n  I agree with much of what is in the welfare legislation before us \ntoday and I plan to vote on it. We owe it to the low-income families of \nthis country to end a welfare system that keeps them down rather than \nhelps them up. We owe it to the taxpayers to spend their money in a way \nthat strengthens their communities. We owe it to ourselves to be honest \nwhen we have failed--as we have with our current welfare system. And we \nowe it to this country to develop a welfare system that respects and \nencourages this Nation's longstanding values of work and family. I \nthink this bill, on the whole, does that, and that is why I support it.\n  But before we send this bill out of the Senate, there is room for \nimprovement. One of my chief concerns with this bill is the unwise \nelimination of the bipartisan, minimal Federal standards that govern \nthe quality of child care. We ought to be doing exactly the opposite.\n\n[[Page S8112]]\n\n  Not only does the repeal of safety standards jeopardize quality of \ncare for children from welfare families, it threatens child care safety \nfor all children. Children of families from all income levels benefit \nfrom the current health and safety standards.\n\n  We need to return welfare to the States because the Federal program \nhas proven itself a disaster. But turning the program over does not \nmean turning our backs on the people and communities welfare is meant \nto help. We still have a responsibility at the Federal level to make \nsure that State-run welfare systems are able to succeed where the \nFederal system so dismally failed.\n  And that means doing everything we can to keep the national economy \nhealty--so there are jobs for welfare recipients to move into. And that \nmeans strengthening our child care infrastructure--so there are safe \nand stimulating places for the children of welfare recipients to spend \ntheir days as their parents go back to work.\n  As States begin to move mothers off the welfare rolls and into jobs, \nthe demand for child care is going to soar. Preliminary estimates done \nfor the city of Milwaukee have shown that welfare reform will create \nthe demand for 8,000 new child care slots--child care that does not \nexist today. Already in the State of Wisconsin, there are almost 6,500 \nchildren from 4,000 families on waiting lists for child care.\n  At the Federal level, there is much we can do to start putting a \nbroader child care infrastructure in place. But one thing I know we \ncannot do is move backward and eliminate the minimal Federal standards \nthat now regulate the quality of child care.\n  At the very heart of the welfare debate is the Government's \nresponsibility to the impoverished children of this county. We failed \nthem with our current welfare system, and today we rightly admit that \nfailure and ask the States to try and do better. As we turn welfare \nover to the States, we cannot fail those children again by ignoring the \nreal need they have for protection and education while their parents \nwork. We can--and should--turn over welfare. But we cannot turn away \nfrom the children who need and deserve quality day care.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Dodd amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President. I rise today as a proud cosponsor of \nSenator Dodd's amendment to restore child care health and safety \nstandards to this welfare reform bill. During consideration of last \nyear's welfare reform bill, I worked with my distinguished colleague \nfrom Connecticut to add crucial child care funds to the welfare reform \nbill. In fact, the $3 billion in child care funds which we succeeded in \nadding to the bill resulted in an overwhelming vote of 87 to 12 in \nfavor of the bill.\n  I am pleased to join my colleague once again, as we consider a new \nwelfare reform bill almost one year later, on another important child \ncare issue. Maintaining health and safety standards for federally \nsubsidized child care is a basic issue of accountability for Federal \ndollars. But above all, it is about guaranteeing the safety of this \nNation's youngest and most vulnerable children. The amendment is a \nsignificant step toward ensuring that American children from low-income \nand working families receive safe child care.\n  These health and safety standards were created as part of the child \ncare and development block grant in 1990, with broad support from \nPresident Bush, Congress, and the Nation's Governors. The 1990 \nlegislation did not dictate regulations governing child care \nfacilities. Instead, it required child care facilities receiving \nFederal funds to meet basic requirements set by the states in three \nareas: building premises safety; prevention of infectious diseases; and \ntraining for child care providers.\n  Again, I emphasize that these health and safety standards are set by \nthe States. And because they are set by the States, they allow States \nthe same State flexibility that motivates this welfare reform bill.\n  Six years after the creation of these health and safety standards, we \nknow that they work to protect this Nation's children. For example, \nCalifornia protects children through Trustline, which institutes \nbackground checks for providers that are exempt from State licensing \nrequirements. Through these background checks, the State found that 5 \npercent of these providers had criminal records--of which 60 percent \ninvolved child abuse convictions.\n  Yet despite their proven success, this welfare bill does not contain \nthese crucial protections for children. Instead, it simply requires \nStates to certify that they have State licensing requirements for child \ncare. However, a significant percentage of child care facilities are \nexempt from State licensing requirements. In fact, only 9 States \nrequire all family child care homes to be regulated regardless of size. \nThe children who attend these exempted facilities would do so with no \nassurances that these facilities met even minimal health and safety \nrequirements. And yet Federal funds would pay for this potentially \nsubstandard care where children are offered no protections for their \nhealth and safety.\n  This does not make sense. After all, we offer consumers protection \nwhen they buy food and cars, use public transportation on our highways, \nand have their hair cut. It does not make sense that this bill would \nleave the Federal Government with no way to ensure that children \nreceiving public child care funds are in minimally healthy and safe \nsettings.\n  This amendment simply ensures that when Federal child care funds are \nused they will not be in settings where poisonous substances are within \neasy reach of children; where electrical outlets are left exposed and \nopen; where unfenced play areas expose children to busy streets; where \nchildren are allowed to go unimmunized; and where child care providers \nhave a criminal record. How can we allow public funds--taxpayer \ndollars--to be spent in such a reckless and uncaring manner?\n  Finally, if we are talking about welfare reform helping people become \nself-sufficient, why wouldn't we want to ensure that children get off \nto a good start by having safe child care? Experts believe that the \nfirst few years of life--those years during which an increasing number \nof children are in child care --are the most crucial for a child's \ndevelopment. If children are to develop to their full potential, we \nneed to ensure that they are cared for in safe environments by \nresponsible adults who are knowledgeable about child development.\n  Research shows that unregulated child care is generally of lower \nquality than regulated care. This means that children are less likely \nto receive the care they need to enter school ready to learn. The \nchildren that will receive child care under this bill are some of the \nmost vulnerable children in our society. They should not be placed at \ngreater developmental risk because they begin life in substandard child \ncare.\n  As a Nation, it is the least we can do to ensure that Federally \nfunded child care meets minimum health and safety standards. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] \nand the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nOregon [Mr. Hatfield] would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] and \nthe Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, the \ntime to be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I want to say before I ask this unanimous consent request \nthat I appreciate the cooperation, again, from the Democratic leader. \nThere has been an effort on both sides to reduce the number of \namendments. We have not been able to get it reduced as much as we had \nhoped for on either side of the aisle. We worked on it. We will \ncontinue working on it. We are trying to accommodate as many Senators \nas we possibly can, with a variety of personal problems or needs, and \nto get our work done. It is very hard to get both of those done \nsimultaneously. So we have come up with a unanimous consent request \nthat I think will allow us to do our job and still allow for \nconsideration of as many Senators' needs as possible.\n  The summation of it is basically we will begin now and continue to \ntake up as many as nine amendments tonight for debate. Hopefully, some \ntime limitations could be agreed to on those. We will begin voting at 9 \na.m. tomorrow morning on those amendments taken up tonight. There will \nbe a series of votes on those amendments. Then we will return to debate \non amendments throughout the afternoon tomorrow and for 4 hours on \nMonday, at which point we will turn to the agriculture appropriations \nbill and make an effort to complete that bill, if it is at all \npossible, on Monday. All time on all amendments would be done Friday \nafternoon and Monday, during that time. Then we will go to the final \nvotes beginning at 9:30 on Tuesday and complete action on the \nreconciliation bill.\n  I think that is as fair a process as we can come up with because we \nstill have 13 hours of time remaining. We still have a long list of \namendments remaining. It does take time to debate those amendments, \nthough, so this will allow us to have a substantial portion of that \ntime used up tonight. We are going to be counting on Senators to stay \nand offer those amendments. We have offered at least three on our side \nand six on the other side. We will have the votes in the morning. I \nthink that is a fair arrangement.\n  I have submitted a unanimous-consent request. The leader is reviewing \nthat now, and I think we can achieve this.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent during the remainder \nof the Senate's consideration of S. 1956, the following amendments be \nthe only amendments in order and those amendments be subject to germane \nsecond degrees and all other provisions under the statute remain in \neffect and any rollcall votes ordered this evening with respect to \namendments offered tonight occur at 9 a.m. on Friday, July 19, in a \nstacked sequence, with 2 minutes for debate to be divided equally prior \nto each vote, and following the disposition of amendments the Senate \nproceed to further debate on the remaining amendments.\n  I further ask that following those stacked votes on Friday, any \nadditional rollcall votes ordered with respect to the amendments be \nstacked in the same fashion as described above beginning at 9:30 on \nTuesday, July 23, and following disposition of the amendments, the bill \nbe advanced to third reading and the Senate proceed immediately to the \nHouse companion bill, H.R. 3734, and all after the enacting clause be \nstricken, the text of S. 1956 as amended be inserted, and the bill be \nimmediately advanced to third reading and final passage occur, all \nwithout further action or debate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not object, but I ask if you could insert that \ntime on the amendments be no longer than 30 minutes, equally divided?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think in some cases we are not going to \nneed 30 minutes. I know at least in one case, the amendment to be \noffered by the distinguished Senators from Delaware and Pennsylvania, I \nthink they wanted 45 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I withdraw that request. We will work on it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would like to, if we could, at the end of the \ncolloquy, announce the list and the order in which the amendments are \ngoing to be taken so Senators will be put on notice as to when their \namendment could be expected.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could respond to that suggestion, Mr. President, we \nare working on a list right now. Of course, we will try to identify \nthem in order. We will try to go back and forth so you are getting your \namendments offered, although tonight there may not be exactly that \nnumber. We have three, I think, committed tonight. You may have as many \nas six.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Six.\n  Mr. LOTT. I urge the Senators to agree to time agreements, hopefully \nless than 30 minutes. If we have one that needs 40 minutes, we will do \nthat. But we will, at the end of this, try to identify the list \nsomewhat in the order they would come up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. May I ask the leader a question, please?\n  Mr. LOTT. That will be fine, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I have an amendment which is up near the top of the list. \nI greatly prefer if I did not have to debate that tonight. I will be \nperfectly prepared to debate it after we have completed our rollcalls \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. LOTT. I do not think there will be any problem. I know the \nSenator has a couple of problems tonight. We will accommodate that. We \nhave identified other amendments that can be offered tonight, and yours \ncould be one of the first tomorrow.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. As far as the time agreement, I am perfectly prepared to \nagree to 30 minutes. I do not know what the Senator from Delaware would \nsay, but I am agreeable to 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, if I understood the unanimous consent \nrequest, any amendment that would be offered would be debated either \ntonight, sometime on Saturday----\n  Mr. LOTT. Friday. Friday afternoon or Monday morning.\n  Mr. EXON. Or Monday.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. EXON. There would be no amendments debated--if you want to offer \nan amendment on this bill, you are going to have to do it by Monday, is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. EXON. But there would be 2 minutes of debate equally divided, on \nevery amendment that was offered, on Tuesday before the vote?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is the way it has been done, and that is what is \nincorporated in the request.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that all \namendments must be offered and points of order must be offered and \ndebated during the remainder of the session this evening, during \ntomorrow's session of the Senate, or Monday, July 22, between the hours \nof 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with that time for debate on Monday to be \nequally divided. That is in response to the question that the Senator \nfrom Nebraska just asked.\n\n[[Page S8114]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. So, for the information of all Senators, there will be no \nfurther votes this evening. The next vote will occur at 9 a.m. on \nFriday, July 19, 1996. Following those stacked votes, the Senate will \ncontinue to debate the reconciliation bill. The next voting series will \nbe on July 23, 1996.\n  Members are put on notice, if they intend to offer amendments under \nthe consent agreement just reached, they must be offered and debated \ntonight, during the session of the Senate on Friday, or on Monday \nbetween the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. No further amendments or debate \nother than the 2 minutes of closing debate will be in order.\n  I thank all Senators for their cooperation in this matter.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I understand it, tomorrow morning at 9 votes will \nstart. After those stacked votes, there will be no more votes after \nthat.\n  Mr. LOTT. We will shorten the time for votes by agreement, and there \nwill be no more recorded votes after that sequence of votes, which \ncould be as many as nine votes in a row.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am submitting for the Record a list of \namendments that we have identified. I still hope some of these will be \naccepted on a voice vote or be worked out, but we are submitting this \nlist for the Record. This would foreclose any other amendments on our \nside being offered, other than on that list.\n  I send the list to the desk and ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the last was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       1. Jeffords: LIHEAP.\n       2. McCain: Child support--Indians.\n       3. Chafee: Standards of eligibility.\n       4. Shelby: Adoption assistance.\n       5. Craig: Childcare.\n       6. Hatch: SOS EIC.\n       7. Helms: Food stamp--work.\n       8. Abraham: Illegitimacy ratio.\n       9. Faircloth: Funds for teenager mothers.\n       10. Faircloth: SSI outreach.\n       11. Ascrost: Children immunization.\n       12. Faircloth: Childcare work.\n       13. Bono/Abraham etc.: Waivers.\n       14. Gramm: Deny drug benefits.\n       15. Coats: Independent accounts.\n       16. Coats: Kinship.\n       17. Pressler: FS Fraud.\n       18. Nickles: Reports on small businesses.\n       19. Ascroft: Limit time.\n       20. D'Amato: Work requirement.\n       21. Lott: Manager's package.\n       22. Domenici: Manager's package.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. We would like to ask that a similar list be submitted from \nthe Democratic side.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That will be provided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. When will that list be provided, the overall list?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We will provide it within the next half-hour; even \nsooner. It is available. We just want to put it in a form that is \npresentable.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Presentable.\n  Mr. LOTT. You are not adding any more to it? I inquire how many that \nis? What number is that?\n  I will not put you on the record, because I hope whatever it is, it \nwill be less than that when it is submitted for the Record or, in fact, \nwhen they are brought up.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is our intention.\n  Mr. LOTT. We still have a real problem with the colleagues not being \ncooperative enough with us. There is no reason why we should have 40 \nvotes on amendments on this bill. We can make our points. Some of these \ncan be taken on voice votes. Senators insisted, ``I want a recorded \nvote.''\n  I remember one time, when Senator Daschle and I were in the House of \nRepresentatives, a Congressman who won on a voice vote insisted on a \nrecorded vote and lost. There is a great message in that.\n  I, again, ask our colleagues, cooperate with us. There is no reason \nwhy we should have more than 10 or 12 additional amendments voted on in \nthis process. Vote-a-ramas do not help anybody and it makes us all look \nvery bad.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if it is appropriate, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the first 15 minutes of this series of amendments to be \nconsidered be for the distinguished Senator from Washington, to be \njoined by the Senator from Illinois, and we will dispose of the first \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Daschle, I just checked \nas to what that amendment is. That is an amendment in the jurisdiction \nof the Agriculture Committee, not either Senator Roth or myself. We \nwere wondering if we could have someone from the Agriculture \nCommittee--we will proceed. Do you want to go for 15 minutes?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Can we do 15 minutes? I do not know if you need more.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will take up to 15 minutes. Let's get that locked in \nand proceed.\n  We will say to Senators around waiting to offer their amendments, we \nare going to use this 15 minutes to sequence eight or nine amendments \nso Senators can know when they are coming up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4903\n\n (Purpose: To strike amendments to the summer food service program for \n                               children)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4903.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 1206.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment that simply strikes provisions \nrelating to the Summer Food Program in the welfare bill that is in \nfront of us. I hope this can be accepted on a voice vote. If not, we \nwill have it be one of our recorded votes tomorrow.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point is well taken. The Senate is not in \norder.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Again, the amendment that I have sent to the desk simply strikes the \nprovisions that are related to the Summer Food Program. As all of the \nMembers of the Senate know, we debated the school lunch issue over the \nlast year and a half. Understand, the consensus across this country is \npeople believe we do need to make sure that our children get adequate \nnutrition. The Summer Food Program is the same argument.\n  The Senate bill that is before us makes an 11-percent cut to the \nreimbursement rate for lunches provided in the Summer Food Program. \nThis reduction is a 23-cent cut on each lunch that is provided. It will \nreduce the amount of money that is provided for these lunches from \n$2.16 to $1.93. That is a substantial cut, Mr. President, and will have \na dramatic impact on the programs offered across this country that \nassure each one of the children of those programs get adequate \nnutrition.\n  We have heard the arguments many times over the last year how \nimportant it is that a child get proper nutrition and, without that \nnutrition, is unable to learn. That is exactly what these cuts will do. \nThey will dramatically impact the ability of our kids to have a \nnutritious meal in these summer programs.\n  It also will mean many of these summer programs will not survive. If \nthey have to charge the people in these programs an additional $20 or \n$30 a month in order to make up the difference, it will mean that many \nof these programs will be lost, particularly in our rural areas where \ncosts are substantial and it is very difficult for parents to come up \nwith adequate money for these programs to begin with.\n  Estimates vary by State, but a recent report concluded that this cut \nthat is being proposed in this welfare bill will result in a 30- to 35-\npercent drop in the number of sponsors, most of them in our rural \ndistricts. It will result in a 20-percent cut in the number of children \nwho are able to participate, and many of the larger sponsors are going \nto have to drop their smaller sites.\n\n[[Page S8115]]\n\n  I think it is very critical that this Senate go on record saying that \nwe understand the nutrition needs of young children in this country \ntoday, and I urge my colleagues, hopefully by voice vote, to accept \nthis reasonable amendment to assure that young children in this country \ndo get the proper nutrition in the Summer Food Program that is in the \nwelfare bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nfor about 15 minutes. I probably will not use it all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  If the Senator will suspend, the Senate is not in order. The Chair \nsuggests that the negotiations that are going on take place in the \ncloakroom. It is making it very difficult for Senators to proceed.\n\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much, Mr. President, for restoring \norder.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak to the bill. Maintaining a \nsocial safety net for the poor has always been a complex and \nparadoxical challenge. How does one provide sufficient support for the \npoorest Americans while simultaneously promoting self-help and \nindividual initiative?\n  The bill before us offers one approach to the problem in the current \nwelfare system by implementing time limits on benefits, requiring \nindividuals to work and, at the same time, increasing parental \nresponsibility. However, the problem lies in that this bill does not \nfocus welfare reform on the people that welfare really serves. I know \nyou have heard me use these statistics before, but I think it is \nimportant to restate them.\n  There are 14 million people in this country on welfare; 9 million, or \n67 percent, of those people are children, almost 60 percent of whom are \nbelow the age of 6.\n  Is it fair that these children lose the safety net that the Federal \nGovernment and the States have maintained for 60 years, in the name of \nwelfare reform?\n  Whenever we cite problems with the current welfare system, such as \nencouraging family breakups or fostering dependence, I have never heard \nanyone arguing that we are giving children excessive resources as a \ncomplaint. Therefore, Mr. President, as we consider welfare reform \ntoday, my question remains the same as I posed months and months ago \nwhen this debate first started. What about the children?\n  Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order. Once again the \nChair requests that negotiations that are going on go on inside the \ncloakroom.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, there is room for staff to have seats in the \nback. That would help some.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point is well taken. If staff are not \nrequired on the floor, they can retire to the cloakroom.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank you again, Mr. President. I really \nappreciate it, and I appreciate Senator Ford's interjection.\n  My question remains the same: What about the children, our children? \nWhat about America's future? No one has answered that question, and all \nthe sponsors of this initiative can do is speculate, guess, come up \nwith hypothetical responses about the answer. What happens to the \nchildren is the great unanswered issue in this welfare reform debate.\n  I am sure that my colleague will recall the discussions about what \nhappened in this country before we had a safety net for children.\n  We found many children being left to their own devices. Subsequently, \nthe term ``homeless half-orphan'' was formed. I do not believe for a \nmoment, Mr. President, the architects of this bill want to move this \ncountry back to the bad old days with homeless half-orphans and \nfriendless foundlings and children left to their own devices begging in \nthe streets. I do not believe that.\n  But I am a bit dismayed with the Members' apparent ability to \nconclude, while they do not yet know what the implications are for \nchildren with this bill, we still must go forward, we still must reach \nclosure on this issue in spite of the fact that we have not answered \nthat great unanswered question.\n  Many of my colleagues seem to be willing to take the chances that the \nStates will do no harm to children. There is also, it seems to me, the \nperception that we have to do something no matter how misguided it may \nbe. Frankly, Mr. President, I am concerned. I do not agree it is better \nto do something bad than to do nothing at all. If any of us were \ndirectly affected by this bill, if we were directly affected by what \nhappens here, I believe we would all be a lot less willing to take that \nchance. That is a chance that we are now forcing on those who are the \nmost vulnerable in our society.\n  I want to take this opportunity to discuss two core implications of \nthis bill, its impact on children and the disproportionate impact on \nStates and communities.\n  First, what about the children? Currently, Mr. President, 22 percent \nof American children live in poverty. That is about 15 million \nchildren, or one in every five. That number is twice the number of \nchildren in poverty in Canada and Australia; four times that of France \nand Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden.\n  Consequently, there are 9 million children on welfare and about \n300,000 homeless children in our Nation. These facts are disheartening \nenough because America is the greatest country on Earth. There is no \nreason why we have so many kids, so many children stuck in poverty. As \na Nation, we are No. 1 in terms of gross domestic product, the number \nof millionaires and billionaires, health technology, and defense \nexpenditures.\n  It is shameful that we are number 16 in living standards among our \npoorest one-fifth of the children, number 18 in the gap between rich \nand poor children, number 18 in infant mortality rates, and number 19 \nin low-birthweight rates.\n  Mr. President, these children are not responsible for being born \npoor. They did not choose to have parents who refuse to play by the \nrules, nor do these children have the means of fighting a State or \nlocal decision made during difficult budget times.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services has estimated last year \nthat about 1.5 million children would be pushed below the poverty level \nby last year's passed Senate welfare bill. Essentially, the same \nprovisions that pushed children below the poverty line last year are \nincluded in this bill as well, and the result is likely to be the same.\n  Nearly 1.5 million American children pushed into poverty who are not \ntoday in poverty. This alone should set off the warning sirens that we \nare doing something wrong here, that there is something flawed with \nthis approach. The ramifications of welfare reform should not be to \npush more children into poverty than are already there.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, again, currently \nestimates that under a best-case scenario, which would be every State \nhaving 5-year time limits and exempting 20 percent of families, about \n2.6 million children would be cut off of subsistence that public \nassistance provides now--left with absolutely nothing.\n\n  This legislation even prohibits the States from providing in-kind \nassistance to children whose families reach the time limits. I cannot \nunderstand, Mr. President, the reasoning behind this provision. Efforts \nin the Finance Committee to restore even the State option to provide \nnoncash assistance to children were opposed and were defeated. The \nentire block grant approach is supposed to be--is supposed to be--\npredicated on State flexibility, and yet this policy in this bill says \nto the States that they cannot use funds, they cannot use their own \nmoney that they are already getting from the block grants to provide \nfor the children of their States through the best possible means that \nthey decide are the best possible means under the circumstances.\n  In other words, it is a mandate in a direction that cuts against \nflexibility. Again, it is stunning to me that that\n\n[[Page S8116]]\n\nwould happen in the context of a bill that is touted as giving local \nflexibility. Perhaps my colleagues are tired of the question, ``What \nabout the children?'' I cannot, however, help believing that the \nimplications of this welfare reform genuinely are not fully understood \nyet. And 1.5 million children will be pushed into poverty, and 2.6 \nmillion children cut off altogether. We are not talking about 1.5 \nmillion cars or 2.6 million trees. These are children. And they are \npoor through no fault of their own.\n  Should not we, as Americans, as the wealthiest nation in the world, \nprovide a safety net to ensure that our children do not go hungry, do \nnot become homeless--a minimum level beneath which no American child \ncan fall?\n  Adults, of course, must be held responsible and held accountable. \nEveryone who can work, should work. I mean, I do not think there is any \ndebate at all by anybody on that score. There are currently about 5 \nmillion adults on welfare, lower than the number of children. But of \nthe 5 million adults on welfare, 4 million of them, approximately, are \nable-bodied and can work. They, therefore, should work.\n  However, demanding that adult welfare recipients work is not enough. \nWe need also to recognize there has to be 4 million jobs for those 4 \nmillion people. It is unlikely, Mr. President, that the job market can \nso quickly absorb that number of people.\n  Again, a second unanswered question in this legislation. Where does \nthe job creation come from? How do these people find jobs? We have to \nbe careful. We have to be certain, Mr. President, that we do not punish \n9 million children based on unrealistic assumptions about the \nemployability of 4 million adults. And that is what this legislation \ndoes.\n  The Massachusetts welfare program that began in November of 1995 \ndemonstrates this fact. That program required 20,000 AFDC recipients to \nwork at least 20 hours a week. As of June of this year, only 6,000 had \nactually found work. I want to point out, of that 6,000 who actually \nfound work, 1,900 of those were working in subsidized jobs. Only 30 \npercent of the 20,000 individuals have found work of any sort, paid or \nunpaid.\n  Massachusetts has realized that a lack of education and skills among \nthese parents, half of whom have never completed high school, seems to \nbe a factor in the failure of that program so far. The State is \nencountering numerous unanticipated problems, including an inadequate \njob supply. So again, this legislation, which does not create any jobs, \nforces the 4 million adults into the job market, and then, thereby, if \nthey do not find jobs, if they cannot support their families, those 9 \nmillion children will suffer. I think that these assumptions ought to \nbe looked at very carefully as we rush to judgment on this legislation.\n\n  The second point I am going to talk about has to do with the State \nand community variation which I call the ``food chain'' argument. We \nhave all heard the expression that ``all politics are local.'' Well, \ncaring for the poor, dealing with poverty is also local. The needs of \nthe poor do not just stop because the Federal Government decides to \nstop paying for it. Again, this legislation moves in that direction. \nThe block grant program will lock in the Federal funding to the States. \nAnd no matter what happens--no matter what happens in the economy--that \nfunding will not change.\n  Currently, many States, particularly in the Midwest, are experiencing \nrevitalized growth, and welfare rolls are in fact declining. These are \ngood economic times in this country. We heard the discussion about that \nthis morning in committee. So, of course, many States weigh the \nflexibility of block grants versus the projected decline in needs and \nsay, ``Well, OK, this program, this new initiative is acceptable to \nus.''\n  I am not surprised that many Governors concluded that block grants \nwere acceptable because their budget estimates tended to indicate that \nfewer people will need welfare and that they can have this free block \ngrant money to play with. Financially, this probably looks like a good \ndeal to a lot of Governors.\n  But what happens when the business cycle takes its normal dip or, \neven worse, a recession? That is the time in which more difficult \ndecisions will have to be made. Will a State raise additional revenues \nto meet needs, shift responsibilities to localities, or reduce \nbenefits? That is the key question.\n  Although this bill includes a $2 billion contingency fund for States \nto tap into during economic downturns, the fine print on the access to \nthat fund makes it clear that it will be too little and too late to \nhelp people who lose their jobs when the economy turns sour.\n  Some States and communities do a better job of taking care of poor \npeople than others. Also, States and communities often start from very \ndifferent positions. The Federal Government and the States have \nmaintained a 60-year commitment to abolishing child poverty through the \nAFDC program. This bill would take this national problem, turn it over \nto the States, and say to the Governors, ``Here. Go fix it.'' I fear \nthat a system will develop in which Governors will be forced to say to \nmayors and county commissioners, local governments, ``Here is a \nproblem. Go fix it.''\n  The result will be of this pushing down of accountability, the \nsuccessive washing of hands, that our children will become victims of \ngeography. The benefits available to a child may depend on what State \nthat child lives in or what region of the State that child resides in.\n  I want to show you a national chart, Mr. President, about the \nvariation in child poverty rates between the States. The variation in \nchild poverty rates between the States reflects these likely \ndisproportionate impacts. The increase in color, from beige to red, \nindicates States with high poverty rates. These are the high-poverty-\nrate States.\n\n  You recall, I indicated 22 percent of children are below the poverty \nline. Well, there are great variances. In Virginia, it is a 14-percent \npoverty rate under the age of 6; Illinois, 18.9 percent poverty rate \nfor children under 6; Texas, 25.6 percent poverty rate of children \nunder 6. How can my State be expected to care for children under the \nsame conditions as a State like Virginia with such different needs?\n  In all likelihood, the provisions of the bill will force the States \nto handle the burden for those who simply cannot find work to local \nunits of government. Yet, there is even more in child poverty rates \namong counties within a State, more variation than among the States \ngenerally.\n  My own State of Illinois, Mr. President, is an illustration. We have \nan overall child poverty rate for children under 6 of almost 19 \npercent. However, as you can see, there is considerable variation among \nthe counties, ranging from less than 3 percent in DuPage County, to 57 \npercent down here in the south, Alexander County. Virginia and Texas \nshow a similar pattern. Texas goes from 7 percent in some counties to \nalmost 70 percent in others.\n  Again, the debate surrounding the solution to those living in poverty \nhas gone on and will probably go on for a long time. Yet, as we attempt \nto address this difficult issue, let us not relive a past where we turn \nover the problem and let children fend for themselves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. This bill aims to make people more responsible and \nmay have some minor success in achieving that objective. However, in \nteaching others responsibility, let us not forget our own \nresponsibility. Let us not just wash our hands of the responsibility we \nhave to the children of this Nation, as we hand it down to States and \nlocal communities. The existing disparities between State and local \ncommunities will only be exacerbated, and our children, these American \nchildren, will be the losers.\n  Mr. President, welfare reform is necessary. Few would argue that we \nneed to do something to encourage change here, to give people a chance, \nto give them the opportunity to pull themselves up by their bootstraps \nand take care of their own children. Welfare reform must be based on \nwelfare reality, not welfare mythology. We must not forget who the real \nvictims are, or beneficiaries are, depending on your point of view--our \nNation's children.\n\n[[Page S8117]]\n\n  In the absence of information, in the absence of real data about the \nimpact of this legislation, we should not abandon our responsibility to \nbe thoughtful as we approach our legislative duties.\n  I want to say in conclusion, Mr. President, I was with my son one \ntime and we were driving down the street. He asked why there were so \nmany homeless people. I tried to describe to him it was a function of \nfailed policy. Folks just did not pay attention to decisions they were \nmaking when we made some decisions in terms of the mentally ill. The \nresult is we have people laying in the gutters talking to themselves in \nthe alleys.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not want to look up 5 years from now and discover \nwe have children living in the gutters, sleeping on the streets, and \nbegging on the corners because we did not wait until HHS or anybody \nelse could come up with decent numbers regarding the impact of our \ndecision, that we did not think about the fact that counties within a \nState had variations, that we did not think about the economic impact.\n  Mr. President, I understand it is a popular issue. I understand it is \na political issue. I say, Mr. President, and I quote my colleague, \nSenator Moynihan, who said at one point that this is the most \nregressive social legislation we have seen in this century. It is for \nthat reason that I am going to oppose this, as I have opposed this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Murray amendment for a \ncouple of reasons. No. 1, there is no offset identified in the Murray \namendment. For the information of Members, what that means is we have \n$214 million of savings that the Agriculture Committee was required to \ncome up with that now we are going to have to come up with savings \nsomewhere else, in some other program, which, given where the big money \nis in the agriculture bill, we are talking about looking at the Food \nStamp Program.\n  We have already heard from many Members on the other side that the \nFood Stamp Program already has been squeezed, so we are back to a very \ntough decision. That is a very important reason to oppose this \namendment.\n  No. 2, really, this amendment is not necessary to continue to meet \nthe needs of the summer feeding programs for children. The reason I say \nthat is because the rates that are in the underlying bill for the \nSummer Food Service Program for lunch is $1.93 a meal. The ordinary \nrate for a lunch, a school lunch, in an ordinary school in America \nduring the year is $1.79. Let me repeat that: The ordinary rate for a \nschool lunch during the year, during the school year, is $1.79. The \nrate in the bill for a lunch during the summer is $1.93 for that lunch. \nThat, by the way, that reimbursement rate is roughly equivalent to the \namount we pay to severe-need schools. Those are schools that have at \nleast 60 percent of their children at the school who are in poverty. So \nwe are paying a rate, actually, slightly above the rate that we pay \nduring the school year for severe-need schools.\n  Now, I understand that the Summer Food Service Program for Children \nis targeted at poor communities, but we are paying a reimbursement rate \nhere which is equal to the rate we pay to poor communities during the \nschool year. So I guess we believe that this was a responsible place to \nfind a reduction, that we are still paying enough money for school \nlunches, to encourage venders to participate, schools to participate in \nproviding the service for children throughout the summer.\n  If we do not make a reduction in this program, and I think it is a \njudicious reduction, then we have to come up with money from someplace \nelse in the budget, which may, in fact, be tougher on children than the \nreduction proposed in the underlying bill.\n  I encourage Members to oppose the Murray amendment for those reasons. \nI reserve the balance of my time.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will be very brief because I know there \nare a number of Senators who want to offer amendments.\n  I heard two arguments, one that there is no offset. It is my \nunderstanding that when this Senate struck the Medicaid provisions in \nthis bill, that had a $70 billion impact, without worrying about where \nthe offsets were. So in this provision, it only affects $24 million. I \nsay because it is the right policy that we care for our children and \nmake sure they have nutritious foods, it seems legitimate and like-\nminded to do what we have done with the Medicaid provision in this \nbill.\n  Second, the other argument was that the price for these meals is \nhigher than what is offered during the school year. That is, of course, \ntrue, because during the school year the volume, the number of children \nthat are served is quite large, is much larger. In the summer, we are \nserving fewer students, and, therefore, the cost of meals goes up.\n  Second, during the school year, the facility is provided. During the \nsummer, programs have to pay for the sites, and the cost goes up \nprohibitively because of that. That is why the summer program costs \nmore than the school-year program.\n  It is a very legitimate concern. I will again say that the bill \nreduces the amount of the program by 23 cents on each lunch. That will \nhave a dramatic impact. We will lose sites, especially in rural areas, \nand see as much as a 35-percent drop in the number of programs that are \nable to offer this.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment tomorrow \nmorning. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My response to that, Mr. President, first, the Senator \nfrom Washington knows the fact is that the Agriculture Committee was \ngiven a reconciliation instruction, and by removing this part from that \nportion of the bill we will have to come up with money elsewhere. It is \nnot like Medicaid is part of that instruction. It is not. It is a \nseparate instruction, a separate area, an area that is gone for now. We \nare deeming with this portion of the bill.\n  We cannot just say we cut something somewhere else, and, therefore, \nwe should not worry about it here. It is apples and oranges. We do have \nto come up with the money somewhere else. I think this is a reasonable \nplace to come up with it. The rate of $1.93 was increased in the \ncommittee by Senator Leahy. He sought to increase it more himself, but \nhe recognized that to do that he would have had to find savings \nsomewhere else. It was his judgment--obviously, by his amendment--that \nthis was an area that could afford a reduction more than other areas of \nthe agriculture budget. And so I think, going from the attempt that he \nmade in committee, that this was probably the best place to find the \nreduction at the time. So I ask, again, that Members oppose the \namendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, has the Senator yielded back her time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 5 minutes left.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will simply conclude by saying that we \nhave had this argument about the importance of providing nutritious \nmeals for our kids so they have the ability to learn and learn well.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember those children when we vote on this \namendment tomorrow morning.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to try to just informally \nestablish a little bit of the order, so that Senators who know they are \ngoing to offer amendments tonight will kind of know the sequencing. The \nfirst thing we would like to do, however, is to ask the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee to shortly offer three amendments, en \nbloc, which have been cleared on both sides.\n  The order would be as follows: We have just completed debate on \nMurray. Next would be Senator Faircloth on our side. He has two \namendments. We will have the first Faircloth amendment. Senator Breaux \nwould be next.\n  Mr. FORD. If the Senator will yield, are we going to try to have time \nagreements on these?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I tried that a while ago, and we decided to just wait \non each one.\n\n[[Page S8118]]\n\n  Mr. FORD. I was just hoping.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am hoping, too. Senator Faircloth is not going to \ntake much time. Maybe we can get an agreement now. While we are waiting \nfor him, to put everybody on notice, Senator Breaux would follow \nSenator Faircloth.\n  There will be a second Faircloth amendment, to be followed by Senator \nBiden. And then we would have a Santorum-Frist amendment with reference \nto waiver. Then there will be a Senator Harkin amendment and then an \nAshcroft amendment. Then we would have Senator Wellstone, who, I \nbelieve, has two. We would be pleased to let him proceed with two in \nsequence. And then we would have Senator Graham of Florida and Senator \nDodd.\n  If we can complete those, we will be set up for a vote in the morning \non 11 amendments. Senator Faircloth will be right along. We will ask \nfor 15 minutes to a side, if that is satisfactory.\n  Mr. FORD. That suits me. If we can get a finite time or an \nunderstanding, it would be helpful to all concerned.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If the Senator is prepared, can Senator Faircloth agree \nto 15 minutes on his amendment?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I can do it in about 3 minutes. They are bringing it \nover from the office.\n  Mr. FORD. Would it be all right for Senator Breaux to go ahead with \nhis?\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I only need about 3 minutes for just a brief \ndescription.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Faircloth wants 3 minutes. How much does the \nopposition want?\n  Mr. FORD. I do not know whether we will oppose it. Give us 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that there be 3 minutes to a \nside on the Faircloth amendment, and that it be the next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that no second-degrees be in \norder to the Faircloth amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time would Senator Breaux like on his \namendment?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I think 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that there be 10 minutes on \neach side on the Breaux amendment, with no second-degrees in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Faircloth has a second amendment. While we are \nwaiting for him, does anybody know if 15 minutes will be satisfactory \nfor Senator Biden?\n  Mr. FORD. He has a total substitute, so it will be a little longer, \nprobably.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On Senator Faircloth's second amendment, I ask \nunanimous consent that there be 3 minutes on a side, with no second-\ndegrees in order to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have Senator Biden's amendment, and we are trying to \nfind out what he would like. In the meantime, will Senator Santorum, \nSenator Frist, and Senator Abraham decide what they need? And then we \nwill lock that in shortly. Those three Senators are participating in \nwaiver amendments.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the time be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent agreement to \npropound to dispose of four amendments which have been agreed to on \nboth sides of the aisle. These amendments are Senator Jeffords' \namendment to protect recipients of Federal energy assistance; the \nsecond is Senator Gregg's amendment to require administrative summons \nto request child support information from public utilities; the third \nis Senator McCain's amendment to allow child support agencies to enter \ninto cooperative agreements with Indian tribes; and the fourth, Senator \nCoats' amendment relating to placing children separated from their \nparents with a relative. Senator Wyden is a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to \noffer these four amendments, which I now send to the desk en bloc, that \nthey be considered and agreed to en bloc, and that the motions to table \nand the motions to reconsider be agreed upon en bloc, and that they \nappear on the Record as if considered individually.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I apologize. \nWe have failed, and those on the other side have failed, to talk to the \nranking member of the Indian Affairs Committee, Senator Inouye. It has \nnot been cleared with him yet. I suspect that it will be. But I hope \nthat the Senator will withhold this until such time as we might contact \nhim. And that would be within a minute or two.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I withhold my request until such time as we \nhear from the senior Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, why don't we ask unanimous consent that this \nmotion be set aside? It would automatically come back, I say to the \nSenator, if that is all right. I ask unanimous consent, then, that this \namendment be set aside so that we might proceed to the Faircloth \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Under the previous order, Senator Faircloth is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4905\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit recruitment activities in SSI outreach programs, \n      demonstration projects, and other administrative activities)\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, this is a very simple one but is a very \ndirect one and I think a very important one to the American taxpayers.\n  I am offering an amendment which clarifies that no Federal funds \nshould be used for recruitment activities in the SSI program.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Faircloth) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4905.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 399, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n                     Subchapter F--Other Provisions\n\n     SEC. 2241. PROHIBITION OF RECRUITMENT ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1631 (42 U.S.C. 1383) is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n\n\n                ``prohibition of recruitment activities\n\n       ``Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize \n     recruitment activities under this title, including with \n     respect to any outreach programs or demonstration \n     projects.''.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, this amendment says very simply that we \nwill not use the taxpayers' money to solicit people to come into the \nSSI program, which we are doing, and spending massive amounts of \ntaxpayers' dollars to solicit people to come and sign up for SSI \nbenefits. We are doing it through mailing, advertising, and even door-\nto-door solicitation with people who are hired and paid by the Federal \nGovernment. SSI outreach programs are used to try to maximize \nparticipation in the SSI program.\n  I believe we owe it to the American people to assure them that we are \nusing the hard-earned dollars that we spend on welfare programs only to \nprovide assistance to the truly needy and that we are not out spending \nmore of their money and hiring bureaucrats to solicit people to come \nget their money.\n  So this is a very simple program. It forbids the use of Federal funds \nfor the recruitment of people into the SSI program. I do not think we \nshould be hiring people to solicit people to come get welfare.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I was just looking at the amendment. It is the first \ntime I\n\n[[Page S8119]]\n\nhave had the opportunity to see it and read it. The Social Security \nDisability Program that the Senator is referring to is essentially cash \nbenefits for disabled people, most of which are elderly.\n  The question I am concerned about when the Senator's amendment says \n``nothing shall be construed to authorize recruitment activities, \nincluding any outreach program, or demonstration projects,'' I think it \nis important that the agencies let people know what the program is \nabout.\n  I tend to agree with the Senator about going out and trying to \nrecruit people to come in and engage in a program that is there. But is \nthe Senator's amendment intended to prohibit trying to let people know \nwhat is in the program? Would they be prohibited under the Senator's \namendment from telling people about what the program does and how it \nworks?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. It would not prohibit them from telling them if they \ncome in and ask about it. They can come into the Social Security office \nand ask about the program. They would be told.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Let me ask the Senator something further. We have a lot \nof Federal programs that provide benefits and loans. For instance, the \nSenator is aware of the farm programs. The Farmers Home Administration \nhas loan programs and things that are beneficial to farmers. They try \nto communicate that information to the farm community to let them know \nthat we have a program that does the following three things. ``If you \nare interested, come in and talk to us.''\n  Would this prohibit the Social Security people from doing the same \nthing that other Federal programs are able to do with regard to \ninforming people about the benefits of the program?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I am not sure how they inform all the people about the \nprograms because there are many Federal programs and many, many ways of \ninforming people. But we have simply created here an issue that we \ncould simply go out and solicit door to door. We bring people in to try \nto get the benefits. If they come to the office and ask about the \nprogram, then it certainly is perfectly all right.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Would his amendment prohibit publishing a brochure \ndescribing what the program does?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. No, not if they kept it in the office, but not start \nmailing them and delivering them door to door.\n  Mr. BREAUX. The concern I have is that it is sort of like we will \nhave a Federal program, but we are going to hide it; that we are not \ngoing to let anybody know about it. I do not think that a Federal \nagency should go out and recruit people to benefit from a program. If a \nprogram is a legal program, I am concerned about getting to the point \nof trying to say we are going to have this program but we do not want \nto tell anybody about it. If you are lucky enough to find out about it \non your own, maybe you could come and apply for the benefits. We are \ntalking about people who are disabled. A lot of them are disabled. They \ncannot get anywhere. How do they find out about it?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. The Senator is well aware that we have never had a \nGovernment program in which we have given away money that was not well \nadvertised.\n  Mr. BREAUX. My concern is we are taking about a disabled person who \nmay be homebound and who cannot get out. They are disabled. We are \ntalking about disabled people. That person is disabled. How are they \ngoing to find out about the program if you cannot tell them about it?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. They are going to find out about the program.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I am wondering how they would find out about the program. \nHow?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Innumerable ways; family members. They will find out \nabout the program. But we have gone out soliciting people door to door \nthat are not homebound, that are not sick.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Let me ask the Senator this question.\n  Would his amendment prohibit the Social Security Administration from \ngetting a list from the county health authority on people who are \ndisabled and then sending them a brochure telling them about the \nbenefits?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Getting this from where?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Would the Senator's amendment prohibit the Social \nSecurity Administration from getting a list of people who are disabled \nfrom the county health authority and then sending them a brochure \ndescribing what the benefits are?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. No, the amendment would not prohibit that. I would be \nwilling to amend it so we could do that. That is certainly within the \nrealm of what we could do. But door-to-door solicitation, big ads in \nthe newspaper, come-and-get-it type ads, that is what I am trying to \nget at.\n  Mr. BREAUX. The Senator is aiming at door-to-door solicitation and \nrunning ads advertising the program, but other than that, communicating \nby any other means would be legitimate communication?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. They can do it if they do not use Federal funds. There \nare many advocacy groups that are working and soliciting--I am saying \nadvocacy groups cannot use Federal funds.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Is the Senator saying the Social Security Administration \ncould not use funds to print a brochure to describe the benefits?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. They can print the brochure, they can mail it, but \nthey cannot give money to advocacy groups going door to door.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Could they mail it to the disabled?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Certainly. Who else would you mail it to?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I just want to make sure we are not trying to hide the \nprogram so well nobody will ever find out anything about it.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I do not think there has ever been a Federal program \nin which we gave away money like we have with SSI that was very well \nhidden.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I wonder under the unanimous-consent agreement whether \nthe Senator's amendment would be amendable.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. It would be amendable, yes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. It would be. Would it take unanimous consent to amend it?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. It would not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Chair would inform the \nSenators the time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. May I ask the distinguished Senator from North Carolina a \nquestion. I understood the Senator to say to the Senator from Louisiana \nhe would be able to amend it to be sure that door-to-door solicitation \nand that sort of thing was not acceptable but what he explained would \nbe. Is there a chance we might set it aside and work out an agreement \nso it could be accepted and we would not have a vote?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. That would be agreeable, yes.\n  Mr. FORD. I ask unanimous consent then that the Faircloth amendment \nbe set aside temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Now, Mr. President, as I understand it, the Roth proposal \nis now the pending business?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I do not think so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Roth amendment was withdrawn by consent. \nThe Senator can renew the request.\n  Mr. FORD. All right, I ask him to renew it then, because at the time \nI was the culprit because we had not checked completely with the \nranking members and now it has been cleared and we are in full support \nof Senator Roth's proposal.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Delaware? Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and it \nis so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 4906 Through 4909, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would ask permission to renew my request \nthat the four amendments which I identified earlier be agreed to en \nbloc, they be considered and agreed to en bloc, that the motions to \ntable the motions to reconsider be agreed to en bloc, and that they \nappear in the Record as if considered individually.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendments by number.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S8120]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth] proposes amendments en \n     bloc numbered 4906 through 4909.\n\n  The amendments (Nos. 4906 through 4909), en bloc, are as follows:\n\n                           amendment no. 4906\n\n     (Purpose: To protect recipients of federal energy assistance)\n\n       Beginning on page 1-5, strike line 18 and all that follows \n     through page 1-7, line 12, and insert the following:\n       (a) In General.--Section 5(d) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 \n     (7 U.S.C. 2014(d)) is amended by striking paragraph (11) and \n     inserting the following: ``(11)(A) any payments or allowances \n     made for the purpose of providing energy assistance under any \n     Federal law, or (B) a 1-time payment or allowance made under \n     a Federal or State law for the costs of weatherization or \n     emergency repair or replacement of an unsafe or inoperative \n     furnace or other heating or cooling device,''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 5(k) of the Food Stamp \n     Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2014(k)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``plan for aid to \n     families with dependent children approved'' and inserting \n     ``program funded''; and\n       (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``, not including \n     energy or utility-cost assistance,'';\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by striking subparagraph (C) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(C) a payment or allowance described in subsection \n     (d)(11);''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) Third party energy assistance payments.--\n       ``(A) Energy assistance payments.--For purposes of \n     subsection (d)(1), a payment made under a State law to \n     provide energy assistance to a household shall be considered \n     money payable directly to the household.\n       ``(B) Energy assistance expenses.--For purposes of \n     subsection (e)(7), an expense paid on behalf of a household \n     under a State law to provide energy assistance shall be \n     considered an out-of-pocket expense incurred and paid by the \n     household.''.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I wish to correct what I think is a \nserious problem with this bill. I ask my colleagues to support my \namendment to remove from the welfare section of this bill those \nprovisions that unfairly burden poor families who rely on both food \nstamps and Federal energy assistance. Not only does the bill change a \nlong-standing bipartisan policy, it does so without bringing any \nsavings to the bill.\n  As it's currently drafted, S. 1956 will cut the food stamp benefits \nof poor families and elderly people who receive Federal low-income \nenergy assistance. The bill achieves this end by counting LIHEAP \nbenefits as though they were income available to families to purchase \nfood. The result is that any time a poor family with children or an \nelderly person receives Federal help to pay a fuel bill, they'll get \nless in food stamp benefits that month.\n  The good news is this is a very easy provision to fix. Linking LIHEAP \nbenefits to food stamp eligibility doesn't add any savings to the bill \nbecause under new scoring policies, CBO doesn't score any savings to \nthis provision. We can remove this harsh provision from the bill \nwithout reducing our welfare savings.\n  I'd like to take a few minutes now to remind my colleagues of the \nimportance of both the Food Stamp Program and the energy assistance \nprogram to our most vulnerable populations.\n  Who is receiving food stamps?\n  Households with children--80 percent of the food stamp population.\n  Elderly people--another 7 percent.\n  People living at half the poverty level--more than half of all food \nstamp benefits go to people living at half the poverty level.\n  That's who's getting food stamps--families with children, the \nelderly, and extremely poor people, Food stamps benefit our most \nvulnerable populations. We can't lost sight of that fact.\n  LIHEAP, too, serves the poorest of the poor:\n  Households with incomes less than $8,000--two-thirds of LIHEAP funds \ngoes to these households.\n  Half of the households receiving LIHEAP have incomes below $6,000.\n  One-third of LIHEAP households have elderly people living in them.\n  One-third of LIHEAP households have disabled people living there.\n  LIHEAP is the program that prevents many disadvantaged households \nfrom having to choose between putting food on the table or heating or \ncooling their homes.\n  What we've done in the bill as drafted is force people to make that \nchoice again. If they need help heating or cooling their homes, there \nwill be less food stamp benefits available to them. In households with \nincomes of less than $8,000, we shouldn't be forcing people to make \nthat choice.\n  Food and shelter are very basic human needs. On $8,000 a year, there \ncan be no doubt that the entire household income must be devoted to \nmeeting the needs of basic human existence: clothing, medical care, and \nmaybe transportation. In my mind, it's simply bad policy to force those \nbasic needs to compete with each other.\n  This welfare reform package is about helping people to get back on \ntheir feet: helping them to move beyond poverty and dependence into \nproductive and contributing citizenship. To the extent that we're \ntalking about populations we don't expect to hold down jobs: the \nseverely disabled, the elderly, and children--this policy is even more \nproblematic. Either way, we need to make sure that people have the fuel \nthey need to heat their homes, or cool them if that's necessary. We \nneed to make sure people have food for their children and for \nthemselves. It's not a one or the other proposition--people need both. \nFederal law has recognized this fact since the mid-1980's, and there's \nno reason to change the policy now.\n  For many years, it has been our policy to not count aid provided \nunder LIHEAP assistance as income. Members of both parties have \nrecognized in the past that reducing the food stamps of LIHEAP \nrecipients would be counterproductive. Do we really want a policy that \nsays ``whenever LIHEAP helps a poor family or elderly person pay high \nutility bills, they well have their food stamps cut?'' I don't believe \nwe're really helping if we implement this policy. People will still \nface major difficulty in paying basic bills and securing adequate food \nat the same time.\n  According to CBO estimates, the welfare bill already cuts the Food \nStamp Program by $28 billion over the next 6 years. The food stamp cuts \nin this bill are $4 billion deeper than the cuts in those years under \nlast year's Senate welfare bill. The cuts in the benefits of the \nhouseholds receiving energy assistance would be on top of the food \nstamp benefit reductions already in the bill. Since the provision \ncutting the food stamps of poor households that receive LIHEAP doesn't \nscore any savings, we should remove this link from the bill and retain \ncurrent law.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to join me and my colleagues, Senators \nSnowe, Chafee, Cohen, Leahy, Lieberman, Simon, Kennedy, Kohl, and \nWellstone in supporting this amendment.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 4907\n\n    (Purpose: To modify the requirement for expedited procedures to \n   establish paternity and to establish, modify, and enforce support \n                              obligations)\n\n       Beginning on page 467, line 22, strike all through page \n     469, line 18, and insert the following:\n       ``(D) Access to information contained in certain records.--\n     To obtain access, subject to safeguards on privacy and \n     information security, and subject to the nonliability of \n     entities that afford such access under this subparagraph, to \n     information contained in the following records (including \n     automated access, in the case of records maintained in \n     automated data bases):\n       ``(i) Records of other State and local government agencies, \n     including--\n       ``(I) vital statistics (including records of marriage, \n     birth, and divorce);\n       ``(II) State and local tax and revenue records (including \n     information on residence address, employer, income and \n     assets);\n       ``(III) records concerning real and titled personal \n     property;\n       ``(IV) records of occupational and professional licenses, \n     and records concerning the ownership and control of \n     corporations, partnerships, and other business entities;\n       ``(V) employment security records;\n       ``(VI) records of agencies administering public assistance \n     programs;\n       ``(VII) records of the motor vehicle department; and\n       ``(VIII) corrections records.\n       ``(ii) Certain records held by private entities with \n     respect to individuals who owe or are owed support (or \n     against or with respect to whom a support obligation is \n     sought), consisting of--\n       ``(I) the names and addresses of such individuals and the \n     names and addresses of the employers of such individuals, as \n     appearing in customer records of public utilities and cable \n     television companies, pursuant to an administrative subpoena \n     authorized by subparagraph (B); and\n       ``(II) information (including information on assets and \n     liabilities) on such individuals held by financial \n     institutions.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my amendment will bring the child support \nenforcement language in this bill\n\n[[Page S8121]]\n\nin line with Federal law on privacy protections. I understand it has \nbeen accepted by the committee, so I will keep my remarks brief. I \nsincerely appreciate the help and support of the chairman, Senator \nRoth, and the ranking member, Senator Moynihan.\n  Mr. President, part of our effort to reform the welfare system in \nthis country has been to ensure that parents are responsible for the \nfinancial support of their children. Efforts to streamline the ability \nof States to identify and collect child support payments from dead-beat \nparents is a big part of the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Act of 1996. In our ardent effort to accomplish this, \nhowever, we must also remain mindful of legal protections that should \nbe provided for private entities that would be required to supply \nnecessary information for the enhanced enforcement of child support \npayments.\n  It is important to note that the private entities that will be \nrequired to participate in the bill's support enforcement efforts \nshould be able to operate within the constraints of existing laws \ndesigned to protect privacy.\n  Current privacy protections in Federal law (18 U.S.C. Sec. 2703), \nrequire that private information can be provided only pursuant to a \nwarrant, court order, or administrative subpoena. The bill's current \nprovisions, which allow States to obtain information by merely \nrequesting it, would be in conflict with this Federal statute. Without \naddressing this issue, the bill would put private entities such as \ntelephone companies in a needlessly difficult situation. My amendment \nwill resolve this problem.\n  In short, Mr. President, what my amendment would do is allow States \nthe ability to obtain this information in the simplest manner, while \ncomplying with Federal statute, by requiring only an administrative \nsubpoena for the procurement of private information for the purposes of \nchild support enforcement. It will also provide these private entities \nwith the necessary protection from lawsuits.\n  An administrative subpoena is not an onerous or time-consuming \nrequirement for State agencies. In fact, in the States where it is \ncurrently used, the device actually streamlines the process of \nobtaining necessary information. Under an administrative subpoena, if \npreapproved conditions and standards are met, an agency has the \nauthority to issue a subpoena without having to submit individual cases \nfor a court's approval. In fact, it is my understanding that some \nStates allow certain individuals, within an appropriate agency, the \nauthority to issue subpoenas. For example, that could include a \ncaseworker, who is working directly with the issue, to issue an \nadministrative subpoena. This procedure is recognized by courts, and \nallows agencies to quickly obtain information, while providing private \nentities the necessary protection from lawsuits based on the \nunauthorized release of private information.\n\n  Mr. President, the private entities involved, such as telephone \ncompanies, have a good record of complying with these requests, and \nworking with agencies within the constraints of the law. Given that \nfact, and an expressed desire on the part of industry to be able to \ncontinue those efforts under this legislation, this minor change needs \nto be made. Otherwise, we could see a new problem arise with less \ntimely compliance on the part of industry, if the protections of an \nadministrative subpoena are not guaranteed.\n  As I mentioned before, I thank the committee for their assistance and \nfor accepting this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4908\n\n (Purpose: To provide for child support enforcement agreements between \n         the States and Indian tribes or tribal organizations)\n\n       On page 411, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       ``(4) Families under certain agreements.--In the case of a \n     family receiving assistance from an Indian tribe, distribute \n     the amount so collected pursuant to an agreement entered into \n     pursuant to a State plan under section 454(33).\n       On page 411, line 3, strike ``(3)'' and insert ``(4)''.\n       On page 554, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2375.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senators Inouye, \nDomenici, and Daschle, for joining me in offering this important \namendment.\n  The amendment is similar to provisions adopted by the Senate during \ndebate last year on H.R. 4, the original welfare reform bill. The \namendment has bipartisan support, and as revised, is now endorsed by \nthe National Council of State Child Support Enforcement Administrators.\n  The non-controversial amendment I am offering should be adopted \nbecause it addresses a long-standing problem which Indian tribes and \nStates have both experienced in providing child support enforcement \nservices and funding affecting Indian children.\n  The amendment would further the goals of enforcing child support \nenforcement activities by encouraging State governments with Indian \nlands within their borders to enter into cooperative agreements with \nIndian tribal governments for the delivery of child support enforcement \nservices in Indian country. Let me repeat--the cooperative agreements \nwould be encouraged; they would not be mandated.\n  The amendment provides funding to achieve these purposes within the \noverall spending allocated to this effort. It gives the Secretary the \nauthority, in specific instances, to provide direct Federal funding to \nIndian tribes operating an approved child support enforcement plan. \nThis approach is consistent with the government-to-government \nrelationship between tribal governments and the Federal Government, and \nthe other provisions contained in the reconciliation measure.\n  Mr. President, the problem is this--title IV-D of the Social Security \nAct\n\n[[Page S8122]]\n\nwas enacted to assist all children in obtaining support and moving out \nof poverty. Under title IV-D, State child support offices are required \nto provide basic services to parents who apply for these services, \nincluding those that receive welfare assistance. These services include \ncollecting and distributing child support payments from dead beat dads. \nYet this program has been of little assistance to Indian children \nresiding in Indian country because under title IV-D, only States are \neligible to receive Federal funds to operate IV-D programs under \nFederal regulations which, as a practical matter, all but prohibits \nthem from providing services to Indian children on reservations. \nBecause of this, Indian children have lost, and will continue to lose, \nvitally-needed services.\n  Mr. President, there is a great need for child support enforcement \nfunding and services in Indian country. There are approximately 557 \nfederally-recognized Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages in the \nUnited States. According to the most recent Bureau of Census data, \nchildren under the age of 18 make up the largest age group of Indians. \nApproximately 20.5 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives are \nunder the age of 10 compared to 14 percent for the Nation's total \npopulation. In addition, one out of every five Indian households are \nheaded by single females. This data reveals that the need for \ncoordinated child support enforcement and service delivery in Indian \ncountry exceeds the need in the rest of America.\n\n  There are also jurisdictional barriers to effective service delivery \nunder IV-D programs on Indian reservations. Federal courts have held \nthat Indian tribes, not States, have authority over Indian child \nsupport enforcement issues and paternity establishment of tribal \nmembers residing and working on the reservation. These jurisdictional \nsafeguards, although necessary, have hampered State child support \nagencies in their efforts to negotiate agreements for the provision of \nservices or funding to Indian tribal governments. The types of services \nprovided under title IV-D include genetic blood testing and other \nmeasures used to establish paternity, and the establishment and \nenforcement of child support obligations through wage withholdings and \ntax intercepts. These activities fall within the exclusive jurisdiction \nof the Indian tribes for reservation residents. Yet there is no \nmechanism to enable tribes to receive Federal funding and assistance to \nconduct these activities.\n  This amendment in no way forces or compels an Indian tribe or State \nto act, nor does it affect well-established State or tribal \njurisdiction to establish paternity or support orders. It merely \nrecognizes the problems of child support collection and distribution \nbetween States and tribes as they exist under the current system. \nSimply put, this amendment encourages cooperative agreements between \ntwo governments to satisfy the goals and purposes of uniform child \nsupport enforcement. Let me just point out that some of these \nagreements are already in place in States like Washington and Arizona.\n  State administrators, such as in my own State, have attempted to meet \nthe goals of uniform child support enforcement by extending their \nefforts to Indian country, but the administrative and jurisdictional \nhurdles make it all but impossible to get these services out to the \nchildren in need. These obstacles have lead to costly litigation. The \nability of State governments to work with tribal governments to provide \nthese services is quite limited because Indian tribes are not mentioned \nin title IV-D. The amendment would clarify that Indian children are \nentitled to the same protections from deadbeat dads as all other \nchildren in our country.\n  Mr. President, this problem is not new to those involved in State \nchild support enforcement agencies or national organizations concerned \nwith these issues. For instance, in 1992, the American Bar Association \nand the Interstate Commission on Child Support Enforcement recognized \nthe problems created by the omission of Indian tribes from the title \nIV-D legislation. In fact, the American Bar Association issued a \nhandbook for States and tribes to use in attempting to negotiate State/\ntribal cooperative agreements for child support enforcement. Also in an \nextensive report issued in 1992, the Interstate Commission on Child \nSupport Enforcement recommended that the Congress address this problem \nin Federal legislation. Until now, nothing has been done to implement \nthis recommendation.\n\n  More recently, I received a letter from the President of the National \nCouncil of State Child Support Enforcement Administrators in support of \nthe amendment I am offering. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of the letter appear in the Record following my remarks.\n  I will also say that there are several other weaknesses in our \nwelfare reform bill that I remain very concerned about, issues raised \nby Indian tribes that have not been adequately addressed. The amendment \nI am offering does not address those concerns. But I want to take this \nopportunity to briefly outline the deficiencies I see.\n  The welfare reform legislation we have before us eliminates the Child \nProtection Block Grant Program. I am concerned because the elimination \nof this program takes away the funding that tribes currently receive \nunder the title IV-B child welfare programs.\n  Currently tribes receive funding under the title IV-B, subpart 1 \nprogram, known as child welfare services. The Secretary is directed to \nmake grants to tribes, but the law does not specify a particular \namount. Previous HHS regulations were very restrictive, and required \nthat only those tribes which contracted under the Indian Self-\nDetermination Act for all BIA social services were eligible for the IV-\nB, subpart 1 program. The result was that relatively few tribes were \nable to access this program. But HHS has recently revised, and greatly \nimproved, the regulations for funding to tribes. Beginning in fiscal \nyear 1996, HHS changed the IV-B Subpart 1 regulations to drop the \nrequirement that only those tribes which contract for BIA social \nservices would be eligible. The new regulations also increased the \nweight given to tribes in the formula, and they combined the IV-B \nincentive funds with the regular program, thus making more money \navailable. Tribes are still in the process of applying for Title IV-B, \nsubpart 1 funds under the new regulations. HHS Region X reports that \nthe fiscal year 1996 applications from tribes thus far represent a 3-\nfold increase over those of 2 years ago. And they expect more tribes to \napply before the end of the fiscal year.\n  Tribes also receive under current law a statutory 1 percent \nallocation under the title IV-B, subpart 2, Family Preservation and \nSupport Services. But the welfare reform bill under consideration in \nthe Senate today removes all funding for the child protection block \ngrant program, meaning that Indian tribes will likely lose these funds.\n  The House version of the bill, however, does provide for funding for \nthe Child Protection Block Grant, including Indian tribes. Under the \nHouse bill, there are two streams of funding for the Child Protection \nBlock Grant. First, under the House bill, Indian tribes would receive 1 \npercent of funds under the mandatory money, or about $2.4 million \nannually. And tribes would be authorized to receive .36 percent, or \nabout \\1/3\\ of 1 percent of the discretionary stream of funding. If the \ndiscretionary program is fully appropriated, tribes would receive about \n$1 million under this section of the Child Protection Block Grant. This \n.36 percent reflects the amount tribes received under the very \nrestrictive title IV-B, subpart 1 regulations.\n  I urge the conferees to adopt a figure which would reflect the amount \nof IV-B, Subpart 1 funds tribes would receive under the new \nregulations. As a rule, the relative funding levels provided to Indian \ntribes should, at the very least, not be reduced below previous levels. \nI have refrained at this time from offering amendments in the Senate in \nthe hope that the conferees will ensure that Indian tribes are at least \nheld harmless on these funds in the final version of the bill at \nconference. I urge the conferees to adopt the House approach in \nproviding direct funding to tribes under the Child Protection Block \nGrant. We should make the funding under the discretionary program \nconsistent with the mandatory funding in the Child Protection block \ngrant and provide at least 1 percent for tribes.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues accept the \namendment I am offering today that would allow\n\n[[Page S8123]]\n\nStates and Indian tribes to cooperate on child support enforcement \nactivities.\n  There being no objection, the letter referred to was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n         National Council of State Child Support Enforcement \n           Administrators, July 18, 1996.\n     Re Senator McCain's Senate Floor amendment to Senate bill \n         1956, the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act.\n\n     Hon. John McCain, Chairman,\n     Senate Committee on Indian Affairs,\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Chairman,\n     Senate Finance Committee,\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici, Chairman,\n     Senate Budget Committee, Washington, DC\n       Gentlemen: I am writing you on behalf of the National \n     Council of State Child Support Enforcement Administrators \n     (NCSCSEA) in reference to the amendment offered on the Senate \n     floor by Senator McCain regarding child support enforcement \n     services to Native Americans.\n       The amendment has been reviewed by the members of NCSCSEA's \n     Committee on Native American Children. Although not all \n     members of the Committee have responded on the amendment, a \n     majority of the Committee members have indicated their \n     support of it. Therefore, I feel comfortable expressing \n     NCSCSEA's support for this amendment.\n       We feel this is an important step toward the goal of \n     providing all children the benefits of child support \n     enforcement. On behalf of NCSCSEA, I want to express our \n     appreciation to Senator McCain for his efforts on this \n     important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Leslie L. Frye,\n                                                        President.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 4909\n\n    (Purpose: To require a State plan for foster care and adoption \n  assistance to provide for the protection of the rights of families, \nusing adult relatives as the preferred placement for children separated \n from their parents where such relatives meet the relevant State child \n                         protection standards)\n\n       At the end of chapter 7, of subtitle A, of title II, add \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. KINSHIP CARE.\n\n       Section 471(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     671(a)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (16);\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (17) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(18) provides that States shall give preference to an \n     adult relative over a non-related caregiver when determining \n     a placement for a child, provided that the relative caregiver \n     meets all relevant State child protection standards.''.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, each year, scores of abused, neglected, and \nabandoned children are herded into the world of child protection to be \ncared for by strangers. For many of these children, foster care will be \na refuge, for others, a nightmare. Being separated from a parent is \nnever easy, but we can make the transition smoother by looking to \nrelatives when a child must be removed from his home.\n  And so I wish, with my colleague from Oregon, to introduce the \nkinship care amendment. This amendment encourages States to use adult \nrelatives as the preferred placement option for children separated from \ntheir parents. We are introducing this amendment because we feel \nstrongly that if a child has to be separated from their parents for a \nperiod of time, that separation should be as smooth as possible.\n  Kinship care is a time honored tradition in most cultures. Care of \nchildren by kin is strongly tied to family preservation. These \nrelationships may stabilize family situations, ensure the protection of \nchildren, and prevent the need to separate children from their parents \nand place them in a formal foster care arrangement within the child \nwelfare system.\n  Yet, rather than encourage relative or kinship care some States have \nmade it increasingly difficult for relatives to provide care for their \nown. Immense financial, emotional, and regulatory challenges are often \nbarriers willing kinship caregivers.\n  The amendment I am offering is consistent with current law. The \nAdoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, Public Law 96-272, \nrequires that when children are separated from their parents and placed \nin the custody of a public child welfare agency, the State must place \nthem in the least restrictive alternative available. While relatives \nare not expressly mentioned, this requirement has been interpreted by \nmany child welfare practitioners as a preference for placement with \nrelatives when separation from parents must occur.\n   Mr. President, this amendment is also consistent with previous \npositions I have taken on this matter. In S. 919, the 1995 amendments \nto the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act which was passed \nunanimously by the Labor Committee, includes a kinship care \ndemonstration project. This demonstration project, which is \nadministered by the Secretary of HHS, awards grants to public entities \nto assist in developing or implementing procedures using adult \nrelatives as the preferred placement for children removed from their \nhome, when those relatives are found to be capable of providing a safe, \nnurturing environment for the child.\n  Additionally, S. 1904, the Project for American Renewal, includes The \nKinship Care Act which creates a $30 million demonstration program for \nStates to use adult relatives as the preferred placement option for \nchildren separated from their parents.\n   Mr. President, this country is truly facing a very serious crisis \nconcerning many of our children.\n  By the end of 1992, 442,000 children were in foster care, up from \n276,000 in 1985, at a Federal cost in fiscal year 1993 of $2.6 billion. \nThe population of children in foster care is expected to exceed 500,000 \nby the end of 1996.\n  The National Foster Parent Association reports that between 1985 and \n1990, the number of foster families declined by 27 percent while the \nnumber of children in out of home care increased by 47 percent.\n  Children placed for foster care with relatives grew from 18 percent \nto 31 percent of the foster care caseload from 1986 through 1990 in 25 \nStates that supplied information to the Department of Health and Human \nServices.\n  Children in kinship care are less likely to experience multiple \nplacements than their counterparts in family foster care. Of the \nchildren who entered California's foster care system in 1988, for \nexample, only about 23 percent of those placed initially with kin \nexperienced another placement, while 58 percent of children living with \nunrelated foster families experienced at least one subsequent placement \nduring the following 3.5 years.\n  This amendment will: Ensure that grandparents and other adult \nrelatives will be first in line to care for children who would \notherwise be forced into foster care or adoption; strengthen the \nability of families to rely on their own family members as resources. \nIt will also help soften the trauma that occurs when children are \nseparated from their parents. Living with relatives that they know and \ntrust will give these children more immediate stability during this \npainful transition; and provide a hopeful alternative to traditional \nfoster care.\n  I hope that all my colleagues can see the critical importance of \nensuring that children who are in need of out-of-home placement will be \nplaced with relatives who they know and trust, rather than strangers. \nPlease join me and Senator Wyden in supporting the kinship care \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, those amendments now \nare agreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 4906 through 4909), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4910\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure needy children receive noncash assistance to \n  provide for basic needs until the Federal 5-year time limit applies)\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk under the \nprevious order and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4910.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Section 408(a)(8) of the Social Security Act, as added by \n     section 2103(a)(1), is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(E) Effects of denial of cash assistance.--\n       ``(i) Provision of vouchers.--In the event that a family is \n     denied cash assistance because of a time limit imposed under \n     this paragraph--\n\n       ``(I) in the event that a family is denied cash assistance \n     because of a time limit imposed at the option of a State that \n     is less\n\n[[Page S8124]]\n\n     than 60 months, a State shall provide vouchers to the family \n     in accordance with clause (iii); and\n       ``(II) in the event that a family is denied cash assistance \n     because of the 60 month time limit imposed pursuant to this \n     paragraph, a State may provide vouchers to the family in \n     accordance with such clause.\n\n       ``(ii) Other assistance.--The--\n\n       ``(I) eligibility of a family that receives a voucher under \n     clause (i) for any other Federal or federally assisted \n     program based on need, shall be determined without regard to \n     the voucher; and\n       ``(II) such a family shall be considered to be receiving \n     cash assistance in the amount of the assistance provided in \n     the voucher for purposes of determining the amount of any \n     assistance provided to the family under any other such \n     program.\n\n       ``(iii) Voucher requirements.--A voucher provided to a \n     family under clause (i) shall be based on a State's \n     assessment of the needs of a child of the family and shall \n     be--\n\n       ``(I) determined based on the basic subsistence needs of \n     the child;\n       ``(II) designed appropriately to pay third parties for \n     shelter, goods, and services received by the child; and\n       ``(III) payable directly to such third parties.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President and my colleagues, this is the amendment \nthat has been referred to as the so-called voucher amendment which we \nhave authored.\n  I would point out that the legislation which originally came to the \nSenate from the House was much more reasonable in this area than the \nbill that is now before the Senate, which is the reason for this \namendment.\n  What we are basically talking about is the situation of what happens \nto children after we cut off a parent from a welfare program. Everybody \nwants to cut the parent off if they are not doing what they are \nsupposed to be doing. We want to really be tough on parents. We are \nreally going to be tough about work. We want to put work first. But we \nshould not put children last.\n  That is what I am trying to get at. I do not think there is a lot of \ndifference between the position of my Republican colleagues and \nDemocrats on this issue. We have time limits on the bill. Everybody \nagrees we ought to have time limits now. At least most people agree we \nought to have time limits. We said in this legislation there was going \nto be a maximum period of time someone could be on welfare, and after \nthat, they are off.\n  A State under our legislation can pick a time limit of shorter than 5 \nyears. They can make it 24 months. My State is probably going to do \nthat. Many other States are going to make it a lot shorter than 5 \nyears.\n  So we are saying to parents, we are going to be very tough on you; we \nare going to make you realize that welfare is not forever, that it is \ntemporary. We want you to get a job. We want you to go to work. We want \nyou to earn a check and not just get a check.\n  That is what all of this debate is basically about, trying to get \npeople off welfare into the work force. I agree with that. I think most \npeople in this body share that desire as well. Let us face it. Most \npeople on welfare are not parents. Most people on welfare are children. \nAnd the majority of those children are young children. The majority of \nthose children cannot get a job. They cannot work. Most of them do not \neven go to school because they are too young.\n  So the point is, when we get tough on parents, fine, but how many \npeople want to get tough on innocent children who did not ask to be \nborn? I think we as a Nation have a responsibility to make sure that \nwhile we get as tough as we can on parents, we do not harm innocent \nchildren at the same time.\n  Here is the problem. Under the Republican plan that is now pending \nbefore the Senate, if, after 5 years, a person is taken off welfare, \nthere can be no assistance to children. There cannot be any vouchers to \nchildren. There can be no noncash assistance to children after 5 years. \nThey are gone. I can agree that the parent may be gone as far as \nFederal assistance or State assistance. I do not agree that a young, \ninnocent child, maybe 2 or 3 years old, should be neglected and \nforgotten by their country.\n  That is the principal problem, because it forbids any type of \nassistance even to children, which are the majority of the people on \nwelfare. Two-thirds of all people on AFDC assistance are children. In \nmy State of Louisiana, 34.5 percent of all children are living in \nconditions below the poverty line--34.5 percent of the children living \nin Louisiana are at the poverty level or lower. So why should I as a \nSenator say that after the parent is taken off welfare, I am also for \ntaking the child off any help or assistance?\n\n  Is that what America is all about? I suggest it is not. We ought to \nbe talking about putting children first in what we are trying to do for \nthe future. The Republican plan, if the State takes a 2, 3 or 4-year \nperiod, allows them to give assistance but does not require it. And \nthis is Federal money.\n  In my State, the State puts up 28 percent, and the Federal Government \nputs up 72 percent. Should we not, as managers of the money we raise, \nsay to the States they should use those funds to take care of innocent \nchildren?\n  So the Breaux amendment which is now pending says to States, after 5 \nyears, they can use funds that they are getting in their block grant to \nhelp children, and it requires the States to do that if they pick a \nperiod to cut off the parent in a period shorter than 5 years.\n  Let me tell you what we do with the amendment. It is absolutely, \ntotally flexible in what it would allow. No. 1, the State, as they do \nwhen they select people on welfare, does an assessment. They do an \nassessment that determines whether this family should be on welfare. \nThey know what the income level is; they know if they have a house or a \ncar or truck or clothes or what have you. They make an assessment. They \ndecide whether the person is eligible for welfare assistance or not. \nThey know things about the family already.\n  What my amendment simply says is that a voucher under conditions that \nwe have set out--for instance, mandating it if the period is less than \n5 years--shall be based on the State's assessment of the needs of the \nchild. The State makes the determination that the child is needy. If \nthey make a determination that the child is in need, then that State \nwill pay to third parties, for shelter, for goods, for services, \nclothing for the child if they need clothes, diapers if it is an infant \nand they cannot afford diapers in the family, a crib or medicine. How \nmany people want to say we are not going to provide medicine for an \ninnocent child because we kicked the child off welfare? How many people \nwant to say we do not want to pay for medicine you need to survive? Or \nhow many people want to say if the child wants to go to school and has \nno money to buy school supplies, that we, as a nation, are going to say \nto the children of America we are not going to help you buy school \nsupplies to go? That is all we are saying.\n\n  We are telling the State: You make the assessments. You determine if \nthere is a need. If you determine there is a need, for heaven's sake, \nlet us make sure we take care of the child. Not with cash. There is no \nmoney here. We are talking about in-kind vouchers so they could go to a \nthird party: Maybe it is a Wal-Mart, maybe it is the local drug store, \nmaybe it is a grocery store to get the food, but to take care of the \nchild. The parent does not get the cash. There is no cash. The third \nparty would get it, under my amendment, payable directly to third \nparties. The third party gets the money and uses those funds to take \ncare of the children who did not ask to be born, who are innocent \nvictims here. And we better start treating them better or we are going \nto have more people on welfare, not less.\n  Are we going to allow children to get sick and just neglect them? \nSome say there is Federal money available under title 20. Great, $2 \nbillion a year and it goes to the elderly and goes to programs like \nMeals on Wheels and child care and everything else. Some will say this \ntitle 20, they can use it for that. ``There ain't no money left.'' \nThere is no money in title 20. It has been frozen practically since we \ninstituted the program. If they have food stamps, then the State \ndetermines that if the child is getting food stamps they do not need \nany of this.\n  Really, what we are saying is let us be fair and treat children fair \nin this country. Let us be as tough as we possibly can on the parent \nwho refuses to work. But for heaven's sake, we as a nation owe \nsomething to the children of America. The Breaux amendment, I think, \nwould do just that.\n  I reserve any time I may still have left.\n\n[[Page S8125]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, this is a nice idea that is unnecessary. The current \nlegislation very well takes care of what problem the Senator from \nLouisiana has laid out in his vouchers for children amendment. The \nSenator from Louisiana suggests, and correctly suggests, in the first 5 \nyears of the program, when someone enters the program, under the \nRepublican bill the States are allowed--are allowed to provide a \nvoucher program for those who disqualify themselves, usually, in most \ncases, because they refuse to comply with the law there, by not \nworking. I should say those are people who are still eligible for a \nvoucher. The States can use Federal dollars to provide those vouchers. \nOK? So it allows the State to provide a voucher using Federal dollars.\n  What the Senator from Louisiana wants to do is, frankly, an \nadditional cost to the State and not a requirement of the State. What \nhe requires the State to do is an assessment after someone has broken \ntheir eligibility for welfare within the 5-year time period. He \nrequires the State to do an assessment of the family to determine \nwhether the children in that family are in need now, now that mom has \ndecided not to go to work.\n\n  So, an additional assessment is necessary under his plan. So they are \nrequired to do the assessment. What they are not required to do is \nprovide a voucher. It is up to the State whether they want to provide \nthat voucher or not. That, to me, is a cost and the State will say: \nLook, if you are going to make us do the assessment we will spend the \nmoney we would have spent maybe providing the vouchers, doing the \nassessment and not help anybody. So I think it is well intentioned but \nit could actually have the reverse effect, of getting fewer vouchers \napproved for those people within that 5-year window.\n  On the other side of the 5-year window, again I think the Senator \nfrom Louisiana has missed the mark. He is correct, his amendment allows \nStates to use the block grant funds for the AFDC block grant. It allows \nthem to use those funds for vouchers after 5 years. That is what his \namendment does. Our bill does not allow you to use the block grant \nfunds in the AFDC block grant, now it is called the TANF block grant, \nfor vouchers. But what we do allow under current law is to use title 20 \nblock grant money for that provision of services.\n  So there are several block grants we are giving to the State. One is \nthe block grant to the States for social services. It is an existing \nblock grant and there is nothing in this law--in fact I will read it. \n``Services which are directed at the goals set forth in this section, \n2001, include, but are not limited to . . .'' and it includes child \ncare services and a whole bunch of other things. It is very clear \nwithin this block grant, the Governors, the legislature if they want to \nprovide it, can give Federal dollars for a voucher program after the 5-\nyear time limit is expired. They have Federal dollars right here to do \nit.\n  We are all talking about the same pot of money. The Senator from \nLouisiana does not put up more money to provide vouchers after 5 years. \nWe have the same pots of money here. All we are suggesting is we want--\nand here is the difference. If you want to know the difference between \nwhat the Senator from Louisiana wants to do and what the Republican \nbill wants to do--I should put it this way.\n  The Republicans want all the block-granted funds for AFDC to go in \nthe first 5 years, to concentrate that money to get people off welfare. \nWe do not want any of those funds diverted to maintain people on \nwelfare. We want all that money spent in the first 5 years. We believe \nwe want every conceivable dollar we can get to get people up and going \nand off so we do not have to worry about the next 5 years.\n  By spending less the first 5 you guarantee people will be there at \nthe end, and we do not want to do that. We want to make sure it is all \nspent. If there is a problem after the 5-year period, then we will say: \nLook, there are some other Federal dollars out here. If you want to use \nthose dollars, you are certainly welcome to use those dollars. In \naddition, obviously there is nothing in either of these bills that \nprohibits the State from using State dollars to fund a voucher program \nafter the 5-year period.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the distinguished Senator yield for one question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. FORD. Did the Republican welfare bill that was passed last year, \nthe one that was proposed last year, have in it the same thing that the \nSenator from Louisiana is trying to propose now? In this bill have you \nrestricted it more than the previous bill?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. You have two questions there, actually, in order to \ngive the answer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will say to the Senator, the time of \nthe Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.\n  It is restrictive in some respects; in some it is not. We do not \nrequire in the first 5 years--in the original bill you have to do these \nreviews and have to provide some service, so that is not the same. The \nBreaux amendment in fact goes further. In the second 5 years there was \nan allowance in the conference report, I believe, and I can check on \nthat, that after 5 years they could use Federal funds.\n  Mr. FORD. I say to the Senator I do not believe--you allowed \nnoncash----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Correct.\n  Mr. FORD. At the discretion of the State. Now you are not allowing \nit, you are cutting it off at the end of 5 years.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I think that was in the conference report and not the \nSenate bill, but I will check on that.\n  Mr. FORD. It was somewhat different. You allowed it before and now \nyou say you cannot.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. But we do not go as far as, I believe in the wrong \ndirection, the Breaux amendment goes at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has 2 minutes and \n50 seconds.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, let me just make a couple of comments. I \ndo not want to belabor this point. When the Senate votes tomorrow, it \nis going to be faced with the question of how do we do welfare reform? \nDo we do welfare reform by being tough on parents who refuse to work? \nOr are we going to be tough on kids who do not have a choice in life?\n  I think this country, as strong as we are, should be as tough as we \npossibly can on deadbeat parents or parents who do not want to work or \nrefuse to work, whatever the reason. But we should not take it out on \ninnocent children who did not ask to be born.\n  This amendment simply says that, after a family has been taken off \nAFDC assistance, we should at least allow the States to use their block \ngrant money they already get to pay for vouchers to give to third \nparties to provide for the needs of children whose parents have been \nkicked off AFDC assistance.\n  This is a child, and most of the people on welfare are children. Over \ntwo-thirds are children, and those children are poor children. I am \nmerely saying with my amendment that we should at least allow--and the \nRepublican bill says it is forbidden--at least allow a State to use its \nblock grant money to aid a child with in-kind assistance, not with cash \ndollars to the parent, not with cash money to the child, but in-kind \ncontributions to help that child survive, in many cases in terms of \ngetting food, in terms of getting clothing, in terms of getting \ndiapers, yes, or in terms of getting medicine.\n  The Republican bill forbids it. This amendment says we allow the \nState to do it. It simply says, if the State is going to cut them off \nafter a shorter period of time, we ought to require them to do that. \nThe State makes a determination whether there is a need. The State \nmakes a determination what kind of benefits they get, how much and for \nhow long. This is truly in keeping with the block grant concept that \nthe States should have the maximum flexibility in this particular area.\n  The National Governors' Association endorses this, and a majority of \nthem are Republicans. They said, ``Don't prevent us from doing this if \nwe want to do it.'' That is the NGA position. They have sent a formal, \nwritten letter to those of us on the committee which\n\n[[Page S8126]]\n\nsays, ``Please do not prohibit us from helping children if we want to \nhelp children.''\n  The Republican bill is absolutely contrary to the NGA position. Even \nmore, it is contrary to what this country is about, and that is give an \nopportunity for children to survive.\n  I think without this amendment we make a very strong statement that \nwe are going to be so tough we are going to step on the rights and \nfutures of the children of this country. That is not what this Congress \nis about; that is not what this country is about. I suggest this \namendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Louisiana has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to make two quick responses. No. \n1, the Senator from Kentucky is absolutely right, it was in the \nconference report, but I tell the Senator from Kentucky, it was not in \nthe House bill, it was not in the Senate bill, and I have been informed \nby staff it was a drafting error in the conference report. It was a \nmistake on the part of the drafters in putting that in. It was not \nintended policy by either body to include what the Breaux amendment \ndoes.\n  I think one of the reasons is--and I get back to the fact that there \nare Federal dollars out there for the States to use for that last 5 \nyears, and I think that is more than generous and complies with what \nthe Governors want to do, which is to have Federal dollars available \nfor the voucher program after the 5-year period.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may I just say to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, it is strange to blame staff.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 30 seconds remain.\n  The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I reiterate what my distinguished colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania has said. First of all, the States are still free to \nuse title XX money for whatever purpose they see fit. So it is not \naccurate to say that funds are shut off so that children cannot be \nhelped.\n  I point out that even with the 5-year time limit to implement the \nimportant welfare reforms we are considering, families receiving \nGovernment assistance will still be eligible for more than 80 means-\ntested programs. That is quite a few. These programs range from food \nstamps, WIC, health care, to section 8 low-income housing. In other \nwords, placing a 5-year time limit on implementing our welfare reform \npackage is not Government pulling away a lifeline; rather, it is \nGovernment encouraging people to swim and giving them the time \nnecessary to learn.\n  Mr. President, I believe we must keep the 5-year time limit, and I \nencourage my colleagues to see that we do. I encourage them to join me \nin seeing that real and necessary reforms take place in a real and \npositive way.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I make a point of order against the Breaux \namendment on the grounds that it is nongermane under sections 305 and \n310 of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive all applicable points of \norder under that act for the purposes of the Breaux amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will be delayed under the previous \norder.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, what is the order of business? Was there \nagreement as to the order? I was not sure whether the Senator from \nNorth Carolina--I am told he has 3 minutes; is that correct? I do not \nwant to usurp his order.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I think the order is Senator Abraham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will clarify it was not a unanimous \nconsent agreement, it was a general understanding that the Senator from \nNorth Carolina would proceed.\n  Mr. BIDEN. As I understand it, Mr. President, it was a general \nunderstanding that after the Senator from North Carolina finished, the \nSenators from Pennsylvania and Delaware would have the floor to offer \ntheir amendment. That was my understanding. I know it is not a UC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I have Senator Faircloth, Senator Biden, \nSenator Santorum.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I assume we will do that. If we do not, I will not yield \nthe floor.\n\n  So I ask unanimous consent that upon the completion of the 6 minutes \non the Faircloth amendment, then myself and Senator Specter be \nrecognized to offer our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to that?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have been trying to get----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator reserve the right to object?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, can I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be in order after the Biden-Specter amendment?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. No. I object.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We already placed the Senator from Minnesota and \nindicated when he is going to come up. We indicated that at least \ninformally.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. When is that? I might ask.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from Minnesota, \nthe Senator from New Mexico is correct. Under a general agreement, not \na unanimous-consent agreement, the Senator is due to be recognized \nafter the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft.\n  The Chair will clarify: Senators Faircloth, Biden, Santorum, Harkin, \nAshcroft, Wellstone, Graham and Dodd.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Wellstone has two.\n  Mr. FORD. Wellstone has two.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am ready to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4911\n\n      (Purpose: To address multi-generational welfare dependency)\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I have an amendment that I send to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4911.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 245, line 22, insert ``and subparagraph (C),'' \n     after ``(B)''.\n       on page 249, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       ``(C) Requirement that adult relative or guardian not have \n     a history of assistance.--A State shall not use any part of \n     the grant paid under section 403 to provide cash assistance \n     to an individual described in subparagraph (B)(ii) if such \n     individual resides with a parent, guardian, or other adult \n     relative who is receiving assistance under a State program \n     funded under this part and has been receiving this assistance \n     for a 3-year period.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, this amendment is intended to address \nthe problem of multigenerational welfare dependency. In other words, \nthis is an attempt to cut off the money, to break the cycle of welfare \ndependency.\n  The bill before us requires that minor children be required to live \nwith the parent to receive assistance. I agree with this. But, \nunfortunately, in many cases that parent or, as it might turn out to \nbe, grandparent to the child to be born, has a history of dependency \nherself and has continuously for a long time been dependent upon \nwelfare and Aid to Families with Dependent Children, to cash payments. \nMy amendment says simply that if the parent is currently receiving \nwelfare, and has been for a 3-year period, that the minor may not \nreceive cash benefits.\n  This amendment is not intended to reduce benefits. States are not \nprohibited from giving noncash benefits. This amendment will simply \nprevent more cash from going to a household with a clear history of \nwelfare dependency. In its very simplest terms, if the grandmother of \nthis child to be born or that has just been born has been on welfare \nfor 3 continuous years, then the mother of the child cannot receive a \ncheck,\n\n[[Page S8127]]\n\na cash check benefit. She can receive all other benefits, food stamps, \ndiapers, whatever would be appropriate, medical care. But two cash \nchecks cannot go to the same household.\n  Mr. President, I think this is what we are trying to do, to cut out \nthe dependency upon direct Government taxpayers' cash money. This will \ndo it in this case. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nCarolina does have 30 seconds remaining. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I do not believe there is anyone on our side \nwho would like to take the 3 minutes. I understood the Senator from \nNorth Carolina yielded back his time.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. FORD. On behalf of the floor manager, I yield back the 3 minutes \non our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. All time on the \namendment has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4912\n\n            (Purpose: To provide for a complete substitute.)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], for himself and Mr. \n     Specter, proposes an amendment numbered 4912.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the pending amendment is the substance of \na bill which the distinguished Senator from Delaware, Senator Biden, \nand I introduced some time ago, Senate bill 1867. This bill was \nintroduced as a companion bill to H.R. 3266, which was a bipartisan \nbill introduced by Congressman Castle of Delaware and Congressman \nTanner.\n  The purpose of this effort was to try to find a bipartisan way to \nmove to agreement on welfare reform. At that time, in the context of \nthe muddled situation which was then presented, welfare reform was \nstalled because, after the Senate approved a welfare reform bill by a \nvote of 87 to 12, and the House passed its own bill, and then the \nconference report produced legislation which was divided pretty much \nalong party lines, when the conference report came out of the Congress \nthat bill was vetoed by the President.\n\n  There has been a general consensus in America that welfare reform is \nnecessary with President Clinton's famous statement, ``We need to \nreform welfare as we know it.'' There has been a very considerable \neffort in both Houses to have welfare reform. When welfare reform was \nstalled, Congressman Castle and Congressman Tanner introduced the \nbipartisan bill in the House, and Senator Biden and I followed suit \nwith a bipartisan bill in the Senate.\n  Thereafter, the Budget Committee reported out a new welfare reform \nbill, Senate bill 1956. Having started with a bipartisan effort with \nSenator Biden, I intend to continue that. It is my view that, in a \nside-by-side comparison of the committee report contrasted with the \noriginal Biden-Specter bill, our bill is preferable, although candidly \nthey are very close.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my \nremarks, a 7-page summary of the comparison of the welfare reform \nproposals, of the budget reconciliation bill, S. 1956, compared to the \nBiden-Specter, bill be printed in the Record, together with a 1-page \nsummary of the major differences in the welfare proposals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Briefly, Mr. President, I will itemize six of these \nissues which I believe show the superiority of the Biden-Specter bill \nover the committee report as embraced in Senate bill 1956.\n  The first difference is that the budget reconciliation bill \neliminates child-care safety standards from existing law, whereas the \nBiden-Specter bill maintains those child-care safety standards, which I \nsubmit are very important.\n  The second significant difference in provisions is that in the Biden-\nSpecter bill there is an individual responsibility contract, while the \nbudget reconciliation bill has none. This individual responsibility \ncontract is an agreement entered into by the Government on one side and \nthe welfare recipient on the other, which specifies the \nresponsibilities of each, which I submit is a significant step forward \nand is desirable to have in the legislation.\n  The third significant activity is that the Biden-Specter bill \nprovides funding for work-activities funding, which is a very important \nelement. There is some contention that this may put us out of order in \nterms of funding, but it is my understanding that on the Castle-Tanner \nbill, the identical bill, there was a budget estimate which puts us \nwithin the appropriate range.\n  The fourth significant difference is on the safety net provisions. \nThe budget reconciliation bill has the States prohibited from using \nFederal funds to provide vouchers after the 5-year time limit. Under \nBiden-Specter, there is a State option for such benefits, to both \nchildren and adults, after 5 years. It is my submission that leaving \nthe State option is preferable to having an absolute Federal \nprohibition in line with the general theory of leaving the State \noptions.\n  The fifth significant difference relates to food stamps, where there \nis a retention of the entitlement under the Biden-Specter bill, \ncontrasted with the budget reconciliation bill, which gives a State \noption for a block grant.\n  Overall, the Biden-Specter bill does not contain entitlements. But on \nthis one item, food stamps, there is a retention of this existing \nentitlement because of our consideration that food stamps are so \nimportant, so basic that there ought not to be the option for the \nStates to eliminate food stamps.\n  The Sixth item relates to immigrant exceptions, where the Biden-\nSpecter bill retains the exemptions or has an identical provision as to \nthe retention of immigrant exceptions under the budget reconciliation \nbill as to exempting refugees, veterans, and military personnel. But we \nadd to it disabled children, victims of domestic abuse, and all \nchildren in the case of food stamps.\n  Mr. President, we are in a very complex matter here. It is my hope \nthat the Congress will adopt welfare reform legislation which will be \nsigned by the President and that the gridlock will not continue. In \nmaintaining my support for Senate bill 1867, I understand that the \nbudget reconciliation bill, Senate bill 1956 has the support of a \nmajority of Republicans, but having started all this effort to have a \nbipartisan legislative proposal with Congressmen Castle and Tanner \njoining Senator Biden and I, I intend to stay there.\n  I do believe there are some beneficial provisions which are included \nin Biden-Specter which are not present in the budget reconciliation \nbill. For these reasons, I urge Members to support this amendment which \nSenator Biden and I are proposing this evening.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                 COMPARISON OF WELFARE REFORM PROPOSALS                 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     Budget                             \n                               reconciliation (S.

It is not a complete listing of all differences in the two\n  proposals.                                                            \n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. For the benefit of my colleagues who are waiting in line \nto introduce their amendments, we had 45 minutes on this amendment, and \nwe will not take that amount of time, but will probably take \nconsiderably less than half of that.\n  In offering this amendment with Senator Specter, the reason we \noffered it is I believe we have gotten off track on welfare reform. We \nneed to return to bipartisanship on this issue and, quite frankly, on \nmany others.\n  This amendment is the text of the only bipartisan welfare reform bill \nthat has been introduced in this Congress and the only bill that \nPresident Clinton has promised he would sign. It is not to suggest it \nis the only bill he will sign, but it is the only bill he has promised \nto sign, and the only bill I am aware of that has relatively wide \neditorial support from the leading papers in the country.\n  My colleagues will probably know it as the Castle-Tanner welfare \nreform bill. I, frankly, like to call it the Biden-Specter bill because \nSenator Specter and I did introduce it on the Senate side. But, the \nheavy lifting on this bill and the drafting of the legislation was done \nby Congressmen Castle and Tanner. It is perhaps appropriate that \neveryone know it as the Castle-Tanner bill, and they did a first-rate \njob.\n  Before talking about the substance of the proposal, I want to briefly \nreview how we got to this point of offering the amendment. Last \nSeptember, the Senate passed a bipartisan welfare reform bill by an \noverwhelming majority, as my colleague, Senator Specter, indicated. We, \nalong with the vast majority of our colleagues, voted for it. Since \nthen, however, we have been faced with gridlock, politics, and \nparalysis. Both sides of the aisle have been using welfare reform as a \npolitical football, and we have accomplished nothing thus far.\n  Last April, Congressmen Castle and Tanner, and several other \nmoderates from both parties in the House, decided to leave the \nbickering behind, sit down, and write a bipartisan welfare plan. This \namendment is that bill. There is nothing shocking or hidden in this \nbill. It has all been out there before. Block grants to the States, a \n5-year time limit, work requirements, child care, and child-support \nenforcement. The genius of this particular amendment is that it is \nbipartisan and has been from day one.\n\n[[Page S8130]]\n\n  Let me mention just a couple of differences between this amendment \nand the underlying bill. Before I do, I want to compliment my senior \ncolleague from Delaware, Senator Roth, for the changes that he has made \nin the bill in the Finance Committee. When I introduced the Biden-\nSpecter bill, or Castle-Tanner bill, in the Senate last month, the \ndifferences between the Finance Committee proposal and what we are \nproposing today were much larger than they are today. There is still, \nin my view, much room for improvement in the so-called leadership bill, \nand I believe we should still go forward with the bipartisan bill. \nHowever, I want to recognize Senator Roth's effort at accommodating \nsome bipartisan changes.\n  Some of the major differences that remain--one we settled just a \ncouple hours ago, the child care health and safety standards, to ensure \nthat kids are being cared for in a safe environment. We accepted that \namendment. I guess we voted, actually, overwhelmingly, for the \namendment to become part of the leadership bill.\n  Second, the Biden-Specter bill provides States with additional funds \nto set up work programs, because getting welfare recipients into jobs \nis going to cost a little bit of money on the front end.\n  Third, the Biden-Specter bill allows--not requires, but allows--\nStates to provide noncash benefits for those who reach the time limit, \nso that States have the flexibility to design a program that meets the \nneeds of the children in their State. This provision is the same as an \namendment which was independently introduced by the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana, and just discussed.\n  Fourth, the Biden-Specter bill would not allow food stamps to be \nconverted into block grants, so that the ultimate safety net, ensuring \nthat all Americans have food on the table, will not be taken away.\n  Fifth, the Biden-Specter bill would retain for all families, not just \nthose who are below the poverty line, the transitional Medicaid \ncoverage, where those who go to work can keep their health insurance \nfor 1 year. It is acknowledged that the vast majority of welfare \nrecipients in that first year in jobs will not have jobs that, in fact, \nprovide health insurance for their children.\n  Welfare recipients are not stupid; they know most of the jobs will \nnot have any health insurance for their kids. If we really want to move \nthem off of welfare and on to work, and not just on to the streets, an \nextra year of health care, in my view, and in the view of the \nbipartisan group, is critical.\n  Sixth, the Biden-Specter bill says that anyone who wants to receive \nwelfare must sign an individual responsibility contract, so that they \nare forced to agree up front to the conditions placed on receiving the \nbenefit, and so that they will have a plan from day one on how to get \nthemselves off of welfare.\n  Again, Mr. President, these are not all of the differences that exist \nin the bills, but they are among the most important.\n  Now, I know that every Member of the Senate will be able to find \nsomething that he or she does not like in the Biden-Specter proposal \nand all other proposals. I can do that, too, and it is my own \namendment. The point is this: If we really want welfare reform, and not \na political issue, we must do it in a bipartisan way, with each of us \ncompromising and doing it in a form the President can sign.\n  This amendment fits that bill. It is the only bipartisan welfare \nreform bill to be introduced in Congress. It is a bill the President \nsaid he would sign, a bill that has gotten wide editorial endorsement, \nand a bill that makes compromises by definition of being bipartisan on \nboth sides.\n  I do not like the idea that we are block granting welfare and that it \nis no longer an entitlement, but in return for that, my Republican \ncolleagues agreed they would come up with sufficient dollars for a 1-\nyear transition for health care and they would come up with money for \nchild care, and so on.\n  It is a genuine compromise that I think is a solid proposal. I \nproposed a concept of welfare to work in 1987, and I was pilloried by \nmy colleagues on the Democratic side at the time for suggesting that \nthere be mandatory a work requirement for anyone receiving welfare. We \nhave all sort of come to the same general proposition.\n  The issue is, are kids going to be left out there? Are women going to \nbe able to go to work, or single fathers be able to go to work, knowing \nthat there is no reasonable prospect for anyone to take care of that \nchild, and not have day care? And are they going to make that judgment \nto do it, knowing once they do, they are going to lose their Medicaid--\nwhich is translated as health care for their children--by going to a \njob where they will not get health care for their children?\n  This is not just about money, although the Biden-Specter bill is \nestimated to achieve savings of $53.1 billion. But that is only one of \nthe purposes, I thought, of this legislation, this change. We hear \nspeech after speech after speech about changing the ethic that is \ninvolved in the welfare syndrome. We just heard our good friend from \nNorth Carolina talking about the generational nature of this problem \nand how to break the spiral, and so on. Part of this effort is to, in \nfact, not just take people off of welfare and put them on the streets, \nbut put them to work and make them want to go to work and make it \nreasonable for them to go to work.\n  I respectfully suggest it is not just about money. It is about \nchanging attitudes.\n  It is time to say that we do not care who gets credit for reforming \nwelfare. It is time to just do it in a bipartisan fashion. For the sake \nof the American people and the sake of the people on welfare, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bipartisan Welfare Reform Act. And depending \non what my friends on the other side have to say in opposition, I \nreserve the remainder of my time. I do not expect to use any more time \nif there is no reason to respond.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, let me thank Senators Specter and Biden for their \nimportant contribution to the welfare debate before us. The tremendous \neffort it takes to find common ground is always welcomed and \nappreciated.\n  There are many similarities between the Specter-Biden legislation and \nthe welfare reform legislation reported by the Finance Committee. We \nare very close, for example, on issues such as ending the individual \nentitlement to benefits, work participation rates, supplemental grants \nfor States with high population growth, the family cap, and the 20-\npercent hardship exemption.\n  The Specter-Biden bill includes provisions from our welfare reform \nbill regarding funding for abstinence education, SSI reforms, and child \nsupport enforcement to mention a few more of the policy areas we share.\n  But the substitute offered by Senators Specter and Biden also \nincludes a number of provisions which I cannot support. Working with \nthe Governors over these past months, I have learned a firm lesson that \nthey are willing to accept the risks associated with a block grant. But \nin exchange, the states must have the requisite flexibility to redesign \nand manage the programs.\n  I am concerned that the Specter-Biden provisions regarding \nMaintenance of Effort, transferability of funds mandatory individual \nresponsibility plans, would break the fragile balance the Governors \nseek.\n  The substitute also opens up the Federal checkbook for a $3 billion \nwork program. Both bills provide for a $2 billion contingency fund. \nThis is a $1 billion increase from last year. But the Specter-Biden \nsubstitute appropriates additional Federal funds subject to \nunemployment or Food Stamps triggers. This additional spending does not \nachieve the savings necessary. In other words, the Specter-Biden \nsubstitute breaks the budget. And for this reason alone was must oppose \nit.\n  However, Mr. President, breaking the budget is not the only problem \nwith this substitute.\n  The Specter-Biden substitute severely weakens the goal of setting \ntime limits.\n  Vouchers are mandatory, subject to a reduction in the State grant for \nnoncompliance.\n  The Specter-Biden substitute also undermines the goal of curbing \nFederal benefits to noncitizens. Under this substitute, even illegal \naliens could qualify for Medicaid, a liberalization of the\n\n[[Page S8131]]\n\nprogram beyond current law. Under the Specter-Biden plan, middle- and \nlow-income American families would be put in a position of subsidizing \nindividuals who are openly breaking the law. This is not fair.\n  Under Specter-Biden, the limitations on Medicaid benefits for other \nnoncitizens under the finance bill would be lifted as well. While I \nrespect the good intentions of the sponsors, I simply believe these \nprovisions to too far.\n  Mr. President, I must therefore oppose the Specter-Biden substitute. \nLet me also hasten to add that there is no need to look any further for \na bill which has bipartisan support.\n  The finance bill is identical in many of the most critical aspects to \nH.R. 4 which originally passed the Senate by a vote of 87 to 12 last \nSeptember.\n  The finance bill was crafted with the help of Democratic and \nRepublican Governors alike.\n  It includes a number of Democratic amendments which were offered in \ncommittee. Over the past several weeks, we have been told in a variety \nof ways that Medicaid was the stumbling block to welfare reform. We \nhave removed that stumbling block. This is no time to erect new \nbarriers to welfare reform. This is no time to turn back from authentic \nwelfare reform.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will yield back my time if the Senator \nfrom Delaware is prepared to yield back his time.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, since the pending amendment, if adopted, would have \nthe effect of reducing outlays by $10 billion less than the legislation \nbefore us, I make a point of order against the amendment under section \n310(d)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, pursuant to Section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive all applicable points of \norder under the act for the purposes of the Biden-Specter amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the vote will be \ndelayed until tomorrow.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4914\n\n (Purpose: Expressing the sense of Congress that the President should \n               ensure approval of State waiver requests)\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist], for himself, Mr. \n     Abraham, Mr. Santorum, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. Thompson, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4914.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF CONGRESS\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services has not \n     approved in a timely manner, State waiver requests for \n     programs carried out under part A of title IV of the Social \n     Security Act or other Federal law providing needs-based or \n     income-based benefits (referred to in this resolution as \n     ``welfare reform programs'');\n       (2) valuable time is running out for these states which \n     need to obtain the waivers in order to implement the changes \n     as planned;\n       (3) across the country there are 16 States, with 22 waiver \n     requests for welfare reform programs, awaiting approval of \n     the requests by the Secretary of Health and Human Services;\n       (4) on July 21, 1995, in Burlington, Vermont, President \n     Clinton promised the Governors that the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services would approve their waiver requests within \n     30 days; and\n       (5) despite the President's promise, the average delay in \n     approving such a waiver request is currently 210 days and \n     some of the waiver requests have been pending since 1994.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should ensure that the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services approved the following waiver requests for \n     Georgia--Jobs First Project, submitted 7/5/94; Georgia--Fraud \n     Detection Project, submitted 7/1/96; Indiana--Impacting \n     Families Welfare Reform Demonstration, submitted 12/14/95; \n     Kansas--Actively Creating Tomorrow for Families \n     Demonstration, submitted 7/26/94; Michigan--To Strengthen \n     Michigan Families, submitted 6/27/96; Minnesota--Work First \n     Program, submitted 4/4/96; Minnesota--AFDC Barrier Removal \n     Project, submitted 4/4/96; New York--Learnfare Program, \n     submitted 5/31/96; New York--Intentional Program Violation \n     Demonstration, submitted 5/31/96; Oklahoma--Welfare Self-\n     Sufficiency Initiative, submitted 10/27/95; Pennsylvania--\n     School Attendance Improvement Program, submitted 9/12/94; \n     Pennsylvania--Savings for Education Program, submitted 12/29/\n     94; Tennessee--Families First, submitted 4/30/96; Utah--\n     Single Parent Employment Demonstration, submitted 7/2/96; \n     Virginia--Virginia Independence Program, submitted 5/24/96; \n     Wisconsin--Work Not Welfare and Pay for Performance, \n     submitted 5/29/96; And Wyoming--New Opportunities and New \n     Responsibilities--Phase II, submitted 5/13/96.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 45 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object. Would the Senator add that \nno amendments in the second degree be in order?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes, I have no objection to that. I ask unanimous consent \nthat there be no second-degree amendments in order to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. This amendment, submitted on behalf of myself and \ncolleagues, Senators Abraham, Santorum, Hutchison and Thompson, asks \nfor a sense of the Congress that President Clinton should ensure \napproval of a waiver request for Tennessee's Family First program, as \nwell as welfare programs in 12 other States.\n  Across this country this very minute, States are desperately awaiting \nthe Clinton administration's approval for local welfare state \ninitiatives. The State of Tennessee, like 12 other States, has \nsubmitted a waiver request to Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, to gain Federal approval for portions of a State-based \nwelfare plan. Tennessee submitted its waiver request on April 30, \n1996--78 days ago. This is not uncommon. Across this country, there are \n15 other States with 22 waiver requests currently pending.\n  Some of these States include Georgia, the Jobs First program; also in \nGeorgia, the Fraud Detection Project; in Kansas, Actively Creating \nTomorrow for Families Demonstration; in Minnesota, the Work First \nprogram and the AFDC Barrier Removal Project; in Oklahoma, the Welfare \nSelf-Sufficiency Initiative. Those are a few samples.\n  Mr. President, on July 31, 1995, the President promised the Governors \nthat the Secretary of Health and Human Services would approve their \nrequests ``within 30 days.'' That is what he said--30 days. It has been \n78 days since Tennessee's request was placed.\n  Mr. President, I remain committed to holding President Clinton to \nthis promise, ensuring that the Secretary of Health and Human Services \napprove these much-needed waiver requests, such as that for Tennessee's \nFamilies First welfare program, as well as for Michigan's and \nWisconsin's.\n  I urge every one of my Senate colleagues to join me in this effort. \nAcross this country States are fighting for the waivers that the \nPresident has promised to sign.\n  Time is running. Time is ticking. Time is running out for the people \nof Tennessee. The State needs to obtain this Federal waiver in order to \nimplement the changes by September 1, 1996 as planned. Tennessee needs \naction. The country needs action.\n  Mr. President, I would particularly like to thank the distinguished \nSenators from Michigan and Pennsylvania for their support in this \neffort, and also Senator Hutchison of Texas for her hard work in \nputting this effort together.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. ROTH. Does the fact that you are here asking that the President \nsign these waivers demonstrate the urgent need for welfare reform?\n\n[[Page S8132]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct. And States are calling out for this \nreform at the State level, and at the national level. These are waivers \nthat have been promised to these States to be considered within 30 \ndays. We need to fulfill that promise.\n  Mr. ROTH. And those waivers would not be necessary under our reform \nlegislation?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct. The bureaucratic nightmare, the barriers \nthat are placed with these States, would be removed by this piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the Senator for his answers.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield for an additional question, Mr. \nPresident?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. FORD. Is it not true that this President has issued 67 waivers to \n40 States, more than any President has issued?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct; 16 States are waived now, all over 30 \ndays at this point; 22 waiver requests are pending at this very minute.\n  I would like to yield 10 minutes to my colleague from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues from Tennessee and \nPennsylvania and other States, all of whom are trying find themselves \nin the same position as we do in Michigan. States across America know \nbest how to deal with the problems of the people who live in those \nStates. Places like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, \nTexas, and many other jurisdictions have attempted to address the \nproblems of their most needy citizens in thoughtful ways designed to \ntry to the best degree possible move people from dependency on \ngovernment programs to the economic ladder.\n  In Michigan we have been doing a variety of things over the past few \nyears on a bipartisan basis; I would add to try to establish a set of \nprograms that will work. These programs will work in Michigan. They \nmight not work in Tennessee, or they might not work in New Hampshire. \nThey might not work in Kentucky, or Pennsylvania. They are designed to \nwork in Michigan. That is the way we believe welfare reform needs to be \naddressed, giving States the kind of flexibility to design programs \nbest able to serve the constituencies in their jurisdictions.\n  It is interesting. The legislation which recently passed in Michigan \nwith respect to welfare reform passed the Michigan State senate by a \nvote of 30 to 7. It passed the State house of representatives by a \nmargin of 85 to 22. I promise my fellow Senators that is not a \nreflection of the partisan makeup of those legislative chambers. A 30-\nto-7 vote in the Michigan Senate and 85-to-22 vote in the Michigan \nHouse of Representatives reflects an overwhelming bipartisan decision \nto put in place a set of welfare reforms that will work for our State. \nThat is what has happened.\n  These reforms come on the heels of others that have been implemented \nin the last 2 years. The results of Michigan's welfare reforms to date \nhave been very impressive. Michigan's AFDC caseload has dropped from \n221,000 cases in September 1992 to 176,000 cases in May 1996, a \ndecrease of 45,000. The current AFDC caseload level is the lowest in \nnearly 25 years in Michigan. The caseload in our State have decreased \nfor 26 straight months, and has fallen by more than 20 percent over the \npast 2 years. During fiscal year 1994 alone, nearly 30,000 individuals \nwere placed into employment and since September 1992 over 90,000 AFDC \ncases have been closed as a result of earned income from employment.\n  In addition, by January 1996 the number of cases with earned income \nhad risen 31.1 percent compared to the 15.7 percent of cases with \nearned income in September 1992.\n  Mr. President, this reflects a successful effort undertaken on a \nbipartisan basis in my State of Michigan designed to address the \nconcerns and the problems of the neediest people in our State. We \nbelieve we have the best insight into solving Michigan's problems--a \nbetter insight than anyone in other States, and certainly a better \ninsight than those in the bureaucracies in Washington.\n  For that reason, Mr. President, I join in this amendment. We want to \ngive Michigan the chance to go further, to continue the success that we \nhave had, to build on that success to try to make sure that everybody \nin Michigan who in any sense desires the opportunity to move onto the \neconomic ladder gets the chance to do so. So that is why I join in this \namendment.\n  The legislation which was passed in Michigan that became then the \nwaiver sought from the Federal Government and that is part of this \namendment here tonight is, I think, the right solution for our State. \nIt is what the people of Michigan on a bipartisan basis have said is \nthe right solution for our State. It frees us to give us the \nflexibility to move forward and solve people's problems rather than \nspending too much time solving problems created by bureaucracy.\n  Just to put that in perspective, we did a study in Michigan. We \ntalked to the people on the front lines in the social services \ndepartment which we now call the Family independence department. We \ndiscovered, interestingly, that two-thirds of the time of the folks \nwhose job it is to help people get out of dependency is spent not \nhelping people get out of dependency but is spent handling paperwork \nand redtape, most of it emanating from Washington, and only one-third \nof this time is spent trying to actually assist the folks who they are \ntrying to help.\n  Our legislation will try to put the priorities where they ought to \nbe. The proposal that we include in this amendment, this waiver that \nwas sought, includes a number of innovations that will assist Michigan.\n\n  It will require attendance for all adult AFDC, food stamp, and State \ngeneral assistance applicants or recipients at a joint orientation \nmeeting with the family independence agency and Michigan's Jobs \nCommission personnel as a condition of eligibility.\n  It will require recipients to enter into a family independence \ncontract.\n  It will require compliance with work activity requirements within 60 \ndays.\n  Failure to comply will result in the loss of the family independence \nand AFDC benefits, and food stamps for a minimum of 1 month, and until \nthere is compliance with work requirements.\n  It will require teen parents to live in an adult supervised setting \nand stay in school. Failure to comply will result in case closure.\n  The proposal includes many other similar programs designed to place \nincentives into the structure for people who, in fact, want to get out \nof dependency and onto the economic ladder. But at the same time our \nwaiver is designed to give people some of the tools they need to be on \nthat ladder.\n  It provides greater employment-related services, guaranteed access to \nchild care, guaranteed transportation so people can get to the jobs we \nhope to create and make available to them, and guaranteed access to \nhealth care for anyone leaving welfare for work--in short, assistance \nand incentives for those seeking employment just as we also include \nincreased responsibility for individuals receiving assistance.\n  Third, our program will remove unnecessary and overly burdensome \nregulations; provides a vastly simplified application form reduced from \nthe current 30 pages down to 6; provides for the most dramatic \nsimplification of AFDC food stamp and medical assistance anywhere in \nthe country, and it streamlines services by establishing a single point \nof contact with the welfare office for each welfare recipient \nregardless of the mix of benefits received.\n  Finally, the program encompassed in this amendment will strengthen \nfamilies and increase community involvement.\n  It provides additional funding for prevention services to help keep \nchildren safe and strengthen families.\n  And, it will allow faith-based organizations to work with communities \nto address the needs of welfare recipients.\n  In short, it is a balanced approach tailor-made to assist those in \nMichigan who are needy, and those in Michigan who are currently \ndependent on Government support in the best way we can craft to get out \nof that dependency and onto the economic ladder.\n  We recognize how to do this in Michigan for our citizens. We have \ndeveloped a plan that has moved us a long way in the right direction.\n  If we were given the opportunities created by the waiver we have \nsought, which we embody in this amendment, we think we can go the final \nsteps it takes to give the people in our State opportunity regardless \nof where they\n\n[[Page S8133]]\n\nlive, regardless of economic condition, and regardless of their current \nstatus. We will give them hope.\n  That is what I believe this overall welfare reform bill before us is \ndesigned to do, to give States the flexibility, to give States the \nopportunity to design programs that will work for them, not programs \nthat work in one State but programs that work individually State by \nState, not programs dreamed up in Washington but programs designed in \nState capitals and in major cities of this country for the people who \nlive in those communities.\n  For that reason, I strongly support this amendment. I believe that if \nMichigan, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and other States are \ngiven this flexibility, given the chance to have the programs they have \ndesigned put into place, it will create the kind of opportunity we want \nfor every American citizen.\n  For that reason, I strongly support the amendment. I thank the \nSenator from Tennessee for bringing it before us this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, how much time does this side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The side of the Senator from Kentucky has \n22\\1/2\\ minutes and the Senator from Tennessee has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I have just had an opportunity to sit down \nand read this amendment. I have operated as a Governor and understand \nwhat Governors like to say and what Governors like to do. Governors \nwant the money now at the higher level but when we start decreasing the \namount of funds the State receives, it is going to be difficult for \nthem to reduce their expenditures or reduce the number, and so we find \nthat is going to be somewhat difficult for them to do.\n  I have some problem with us micromanaging any program. Mr. President, \nI looked at these projects that are here. Some of them sound good, \nothers not necessarily. Fraud Detection Project, that sounds \ninteresting. Actively Creating Tomorrow for Families Demonstration. I \ndo not know, are you supposed to look at these and just approve them \nwithout studying them some? AFDC Barrier Removal Project; Intentional \nProgram Violation Demonstration, Single Parent Employment \nDemonstration, Work-Not-Welfare and Pay For Performance, New \nOpportunities and New Responsibilities Demonstration.\n  Now, I am hopeful that we can get a welfare bill that the President \nwill sign. We hear a lot about 80-something to a few votes for a bill \nthat we passed. If that bill had gone to the President's desk, my \njudgment is that he would have signed it. I think we are close to \ngetting a bill that will be signed. I am one who wants to vote for \nwelfare reform. I hope we can listen to Senators like the Senator from \nLouisiana and others who are trying to protect children. I think we \nhave gone much, much too far in trying to be harsh on parents and then \nin turn being harsh on children.\n  So, Mr. President, in listening to the Governors, the other side of \nthe aisle, the Republicans are not listening to the Governors except in \ncertain cases where they want to listen to them. We have endorsements \nof the National Governors' Conference as it relates to vouchers and the \namendment of the Senator from Louisiana. The Governors have endorsed \nthat. But they do not pay any attention to that one. We are going to \nbe against it. I think it is wrong. So now the Governors want all this. \nAre we supposed to flip over and say, yes? You did not do that when I \nwas Governor. I had to come up here and cry a little bit, shed some \ncrocodile tears, try to get something more for my State.\n\n  So I hope we will not try to micromanage this particular operation. \nAs I say, the President has issued 67 waivers to 40 States. But none of \nthese waivers, in my opinion, in reading them, are all directly welfare \nconnected. Maybe they are. But some of the programs as they are listed \nlead me--work first, I like that. I like Gov. McWherter's program in \nTennessee. I thought Governor Ned McWherter did a good job. It took a \nlot of bumps; it took a lot of skin off his back, as we say \npolitically, but I thought Governor McWherter did a good job in \nTennessee.\n  So since I am here standing in for others, I hope that we will be \nvery careful with the vote as it relates to micromanaging welfare. If \nwe are going to give it to the States, let us give it to the States and \nlet us do it in a bill; let us do it legislatively; let us do it \nstatutorily, and let us not start telling the President what to do and \nwhat not to do, because their President did not do nearly as well as \nthis President. You have to look at the number of jobs that we have \nhad. That reduces the amount of welfare in a State--more jobs, less \nwelfare. And I can take credit for unemployment being at a low level in \nmy State. We are doing great. We have so many people off welfare. We \nare saving this kind of money. All these programs are working. But if \nthe economy is good, Mr. President, then all States are going to look \ngood, and as of now the economy is good and all States are faring \nsomewhat better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. I understand we have 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 8 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank my friend from Tennessee. I will not take the \nentire 8 minutes. I rise in support of this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bond from Missouri be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. In fact, Senator Bond has introduced legislation, \nfrankly, that goes further than the sense of the Senate. Senator Bond's \nlegislation would actually move the Senate to approve of the Wisconsin \nwaiver and a bill similar to what passed in the House of \nRepresentatives, passed through the Senate and actually forced the \nPresident's hand on the Wisconsin waiver.\n  That is the most publicized waiver, frankly, because the President \nsaid, and I will quote his words, in his Presidential radio address \nback on May 18:\n\n       All in all, Wisconsin has the making of a solid, bold \n     welfare reform plan. We should get it done.\n\n  ``Get it done,'' meaning approve the waiver.\n       I pledge that my administration will work with Wisconsin to \n     make an effective transition to a new vision of welfare based \n     on work, that protects children and does right by working \n     people and their families.\n\n  That is what the President said. He said he wanted to do it with the \nwaiver. He said he was for the waiver. In fact, he went so far as to \nmake it the real focus of his radio address to the American public. \nUnfortunately, his administration has not approved those waivers yet. \nHe set an artificial deadline, he has for quite some time, of a 30-day \nturnaround on all waiver requests by the States. He, as the Senator \nfrom Tennessee mentioned, has not met that 30-day requirement recently. \nIn fact, we have the Wisconsin plan and here we are in the middle of \nJuly and he has not approved what is now a 12-month-old waiver request.\n  Unfortunately, we learn that while the President is still running \naround the country talking about how good the Wisconsin plan is, the \nPresident's people are saying that they are not going to approve the \nplan, which led Governor Thompson the other day down at the National \nGovernors' Association to say, ``We are sort of shaking our heads, not \nknowing what's going on, who to believe.''\n  Well, in the end, I always found that it is best policy to believe \nwhat you see, not what you hear from this administration. And what you \nsee from this administration is not approving your waiver. That is \npretty concrete evidence of whether you are going to get it approved or \nnot. The fact that they are not approving it, in effect, the \nbureaucrats in the administration are saying the likelihood of your \ngetting through the approval process is not good. And it is not a \nsimple approval\n\n[[Page S8134]]\n\nprocess. It sounds like these waivers are no big deal; everybody gets \nthem approved. Remember, these get approved; they get modified; they \nget altered a little bit; they have to sort of work with the Federal \nGovernment to make changes that they in the Federal Government believe \nis best for the State. In the case of Wisconsin, in order to put the \nplan in effect, the State requested waivers from 83 Federal provisions \nadministered by HHS. So they needed 83 separate decisions by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to get those waivers. They \nneeded five from the Department of Agriculture to get their overall \nwaiver approved by the Federal Government. This is no small task. It is \na task that, under our bill, the bill that is before the Senate right \nnow, would be unnecessary.\n\n  The Senator from Delaware, I think accurately and perceptively, \nquestioned the Senator from Tennessee about whether this bill would \nmake all of this rather expensive, time-consuming and inefficient \nprocess of waivers necessary in the future. If, in fact, we are going \nto use the States, as the States have been used recently, as incubators \nfor changing the welfare system, we should give them more flexibility \nin dealing with this program.\n  We should give them the opportunity to design programs that fit their \nneeds, not judged by people in Washington who maybe have never set foot \nin that State, who do not know the particular problems in the \ncommunities, but by people who represent those communities, as Senator \nAbraham was talking about, the State legislators who live in those \ncommunities, who represent those people in a much smaller area, in a \ndistrict in those States--those are the people who should make \ndecisions about what the welfare system should look like; not people at \nHealth and Human Services.\n  So one of the reasons I wanted to sign on to this effort was to \nhighlight the inconsistencies--not surprising to my mind--but the \ninconsistencies between what the President says and what the President \nhas done on one of the most important issues before us, which is \nwelfare reform. We have, obviously, the President's record overall on \nwhat he says and what he does on welfare, which is he runs television \ncommercials all over the country saying he is for welfare reform and \nthen every chance he has to sign welfare reform, he finds a reason to \nveto it. I hope this is not the case this time around. I am confident \nwe will send him a bill that he certainly can sign. The question is \nwhether he will sign it, but he certainly will talk a good game up \nuntil that point. But when the rubber hits the road, whether it is \nwaivers or whether it is the actual bill, the President has fallen \nshort in the area of welfare reform.\n  Part of my reason for cosponsoring this legislation is that \nPennsylvania has just recently passed welfare reform legislation. They \nare going to be requesting a couple of waivers from the Federal \nGovernment. They will be submitting them shortly. I am hopeful the \nPresident will go along with what Pennsylvania has wanted to do with \nGovernor Ridge's plan to reform the welfare system and Medicaid system. \nTo try to reduce the strain on the State budget, frankly, is one \nreason; but also to provide a better future for the people in \nPennsylvania who are on welfare.\n  So I congratulate the Senator from Tennessee for his efforts. I hope \nwe can approve this amendment and send a very strong signal we want the \nadministration to move more quickly and more efficiently when it comes \nto granting waivers.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4914, As Modified\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. I ask unanimous \nconsent to modify my amendment No. 4914. I send that modification to \nthe desk. As part of that unanimous consent, I ask that Senator Bond be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment as modified is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF CONGRESS\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services has not \n     approved in a timely manner, State waiver requests for \n     programs carried out under part A of title IV of the Social \n     Security Act or other Federal law providing needs-based or \n     income-based benefits (referred to in this resolution as \n     ``welfare reform programs'');\n       (2) valuable time is running out for these States which \n     need to obtain the waivers in order to implement the changes \n     as planned;\n       (3) across the country there are 16 States, with 22 waiver \n     requests for welfare reform programs, awaiting approval of \n     the requests by the Secretary of Health and Human Services;\n       (4) on July 21, 1995, in Burlington, Vermont, President \n     Clinton promised the Governors that the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services would approve their waiver requests within \n     30 days; and\n       (5) despite the President's promise, the average delay in \n     approving such a waiver request is currently 210 days and \n     some of the waiver requests have been pending since 1994.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should ensure that the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services approves the following waiver requests for \n     Georgia--Jobs First Project, submitted 7/5/94; Georgia--Fraud \n     Detection Project, submitted 7/1/96; Indiana--Impacting \n     Families Welfare Reform Demonstration, submitted 12/14/95; \n     Kansas--Actively Creating Tomorrow for Families \n     Demonstration, submitted 7/26/94; Michigan--To Strengthen \n     Michigan Families, submitted 6/27/96; Minnesota--Work First \n     Program, submitted 4/4/96; Minnesota--AFDC Barrier Removal \n     Project, submitted 4/4/96; New York--Learnfare Program, \n     submitted 5/31/96; New York--International Program, Violation \n     Demonstration, submitted 5/31/96; Oklahoma--Welfare Self-\n     Sufficiency Initiative, submitted 10/27/95; Pennsylvania--\n     School Attendance Improvement Program, submitted 9/12/94; \n     Pennsylvania--Savings for Education Program, submitted 12/29/\n     94; Tennessee--Families First, submitted 4/30/96; Utah--\n     Single Parent Employment Demonstration, submitted 7/2/96; \n     Virginia--Virginia Independence Program, submitted 5/24/96; \n     Wisconsin--Work Not Welfare and Pay for Performance, \n     submitted 5/29/96; And Wyoming--New Opportunities and New \n     Responsibilities--Phase II, submitted 5/13/96; California--\n     Assistance Payment Demonstration Project, submitted 3/13/96; \n     California--Work Pays Demonstration Project, submitted 11/9/\n     94; Hawaii--Pursuit of New Opportunities, submitted 5/7/96; \n     West Virginia--West Virginia Works, submitted 7/1/96.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am about to yield back what time we have. \nIs the Senator yielding his time?\n  Mr. FRIST. I, too, am ready to yield back.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we have an amendment that has been agreed \nto. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], \nbe given 60 seconds to offer his amendment and get it modified so it \ncould be passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4913, As Modified\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I call up my amendment on child poverty \nwhich was submitted earlier tonight. I ask unanimous consent this \namendment be modified in a manner that has been agreed to by both \nsides. I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4913, as modified.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Section 413 of the Social Security Act, as added by section \n     2103, is amended by adding at the end thereof the following \n     new subsection:\n       ``(h) Child Poverty Rates.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this part, and annually thereafter, the \n     chief executive officer of a State shall submit to the \n     Secretary a statement of the child poverty rate in the State \n     as of such date of enactment or the date of such subsequent \n     statements. Such subsequent statements shall include the \n     change in such rate from the previous statement, if any.\n       ``(2) Increase in rate.--\n\n[[Page S8135]]\n\n       ``(A) In general.--With respect to a State that submits a \n     statement under paragraph (1) that indicates an increase of 5 \n     percent or more in the child poverty rate of the State from \n     the previous statement as a result of the changes made by the \n     Act, the State shall, not later than 90 days after the date \n     of such statement, prepare and submit to the Secretary a \n     corrective action plan in accordance with paragraph (3).\n       ``(3) Corrective action plan.--\n       ``(A) In general.--A corrective action plan submitted under \n     paragraph (2) shall outline that manner in which the State \n     will reduce the child poverty rate within the State. The plan \n     shall include a description of the actions to be taken by the \n     State under such plan.\n       ``(B) Consultation about modifications.--During the 60-day \n     period that begins with the date the Secretary receives the \n     corrective action plan of a State under subparagraph (A), the \n     Secretary may consult with the State on modifications to the \n     plan.\n       ``(C) Acceptance of plan.--A corrective action plan \n     submitted by a State in accordance with subparagraph (A) is \n     deemed to be accepted by the Secretary if the Secretary does \n     not accept or reject the plan during 60-day period that \n     begins on the date the plan is submitted.\n       ``(4) Compliance with plan.--\n       ``(A) In general.--A State that submits a corrective action \n     plan under this subsection shall continue to implement such \n     plan until such time as the Secretary makes the determination \n     described in subparagraph (B).\n       ``(B) Determination.--A determination described in this \n     subparagraph is a determination that the child poverty rate \n     for the State involved has fallen to, and not exceeded for a \n     period of 2 consecutive years, a rate that is not greater \n     than the rate contained in the most recent statement \n     submitted by the State under paragraph (1) which did not \n     trigger the application of paragraph (2).\n       ``(C) Labor surplus area.--With respect to a State that \n     submits a corrective action plan under paragraph (2)(B), such \n     plan shall continue to be implemented until the area involved \n     is no longer designated as a Labor Surplus Area.\n       ``(5) Methodology.--The Secretary shall promulgate \n     regulations establishing the methodology by which a State \n     shall determine the child poverty rate within such State. \n     Such methodology shall, with respect to a State, take into \n     account factors including the number of children who receive \n     free or reduced-price lunches, the number of food stamp \n     households, and the county by county estimates of children in \n     poverty as determined by the Census Bureau.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the welfare bill before us today would \nallow States to experiment with various welfare policies. Many States \nmay implement innovative welfare policies to move parents from welfare \nto work. But if we are sending Federal money to States, if we are going \nto take this risk and allow States to experiment, let's be sure that \nchild poverty does not increase.\n  This amendment, which I introducing with Senator Murray, says that if \nchild poverty increases in a State after the date of enactment of this \nwelfare bill, that State would be required to submit a corrective \naction plan.\n  There is nothing more important to this debate than constantly \nreminding ourselves that our focus is--or ought to be--this Nation's \nchildren. That was the focus when under Franklin Roosevelt's leadership \ntitle IV-A of the Social Security Act was originally enacted. The \nobjective here is to help impoverished children.\n  Let me acknowledge right up front that this amendment will be subject \nto a point of order under the Byrd rule and will require 60 votes to \npass. I want to say to my Republican colleagues that it is outrageous \nthat we are debating welfare reform under budget reconciliation rules. \nWe should not be considering such major changes affecting millions of \nchildren and families and cutting more than $60 billion from human \nservice programs under budget rules that make almost any substantive \namendment out of order. There is no reason to debate welfare reform \nunder budget reconciliation except for the majority to make it \nsignificantly harder to make any changes to this bill, even changes \nsupported by a majority of members. But despite this unreasonable \nhurdle erected by the majority party, we must attempt to remedy \nproblems in the bill.\n  What does this amendment do? This amendment says that if the most \nrecent State child poverty rate exceeds the level for the previous year \nby 5 percent or more then the State would have to submit to the HHS \nSecretary within 90 days a corrective action plan describing the \nactions the State shall take to reduce child poverty rates.\n  Mr. President, I want to be clear that this amendment in no way \nintrudes on a State's ability to design its own welfare program. State \nflexibility would not be decreased in any way. This amendment simply \nsays that if a State's welfare system increases child poverty, that \nState must take corrective action.\n  Mr. President, there are many very different views of welfare in this \nChamber. But I believe all of us regardless of party can agree on two \nthings at least: we can all agree that the child poverty rate in this \ncountry is too high. The fact is that 15.3 million U.S. children live \nin poverty. This means that more than one in five children--21.8 \npercent--live in poverty. In Massachusetts, there are more than 176,000 \nchildren who live in poverty. And despite the stereotypes, Mr. \nPresident, the majority of America's poor children are white--9.3 \nmillion--and live in rural or suburban areas--8.4 million--rather than \ncentral cities--6.9 million.\n  The other thing on which we can all agree, because it is a fact \nrather than an opinion, is that the child poverty rate in this country \nis dramatically higher than the rate in other major industrialized \ncountries. According to an excellent, comprehensive recent report by an \ninternational research group called the Luxembourg Income Study, the \nchild poverty rate in the United Kingdom is less than half our rate, \n9.9 percent, the rate in France is less than one-third of our rate, 6.5 \npercent, and the rate in Denmark 3.3 percent is about one-sixth our \nrate.\n  Mr. President, we know that poverty is bad for children, This should \nbe obvious. Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Solow and the \nChildren's Defense Fund recently conducted the first-ever long-term \nimpact of child poverty. They found that their lowest estimate was that \nthe future cost to society of a single year of poverty for the 15 \nmillion poor children is $36 billion in lost output per worker. When \nthey included lost work hours, lower skills, and other labor market \ndisadvantages related to poverty, they found that the future cost to \nsociety was $177 billion.\n  With this amendment, I want to make sure that, at the very least, if \na State's welfare plan increases child poverty--instead of increasing \nthe number of parents moving from welfare to work and self-\nsufficiency--that State will take immediate steps to refocus its \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, I also want to say that I hope that our extremist \ncolleagues on the House side do not ultimately prevail again in \nconference. This effort to reform welfare should not be scuttled by a \nconference report they call welfare reform but that children will only \nknow as their ticket to empty stomachs and hopelessness.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Roth and his staff, Senator \nMoynihan and his staff, and Senator Exon and his staff for their \nassistance and their willingness to accept this amendment that I \nbelieve will benefit children across the Nation.\n  Mr. President, as we know, the child poverty rate in the United \nStates is dramatically higher than that in other industrial countries. \nIt is in our obvious interest, in whatever we do with respect to \nwelfare reform, that whatever we do here not increase that rate.\n  This seeks, by agreement on both sides, to simply measure where we \nare today with respect to child poverty and, if there is an \nascertainable difference as a consequence of the measures of this act \nthat increases it, then the Secretary of Health and Human Services has \nthe ability to ask that particular State to come up with a remedy. \nThere is no forced remedy. There is no mandate. It is simply a \nrequirement to try to deal with the obvious negative consequences or \nunintended consequence of anything we might do here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  If there be no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4913), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S8136]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 4915\n\n (Purpose: To require each family receiving assistance under the State \n program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act to \n            enter into a personal responsibility agreement)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have a couple of amendments. I send the \nfirst one to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. I send \nthis amendment to the desk on behalf of myself and Senator Coats of \nIndiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself and Mr. \n     Coats, proposes an amendment numbered 4915.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Section 408 of the Social Security Act, as added by section \n     2103, is amended by adding at the end thereof the following \n     new subsection:\n       ``(d) State Required To Enter Into a Personal \n     Responsibility Agreement With Each Family Receiving \n     Assistance.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Each State to which a grant is made \n     under section 403 shall require each family receiving \n     assistance under the State program funded under this part to \n     enter into a personal responsibility agreement (as developed \n     by the State) with the State.\n       ``(2) Personal responsibility agreement.--For purposes of \n     this subsection, the term `personal responsibility agreement' \n     means a binding contract between the State and each family \n     receiving assistance under the State program funded under \n     this part that--\n       ``(A) contains a statement that public assistance is not \n     intended to be a way of life, but is intended as temporary \n     assistance to help the family achieve self-sufficiency and \n     personal independence;\n       ``(B) outlines the steps each family and the State will \n     take to get the family off of welfare and to become self-\n     sufficient, including an employment goal for the individual \n     and a plan for promptly moving the individual into paid \n     employment;\n       ``(C) specifies a negotiated time-limited period of \n     eligibility for receipt of assistance that is consistent with \n     unique family circumstances and is based on a reasonable plan \n     to facilitate the transition of the family to self-\n     sufficiency;\n       ``(D) provides for the imposition of sanctions if the \n     individual refuses to sign the agreement or does not comply \n     with the terms of the agreement, which may include loss or \n     reduction of cash benefits;\n       ``(E) provides that the contract shall be invalid if the \n     State agency fails to comply with the contract; and\n       ``(F) provides that the individual agrees not to abuse \n     illegal drugs or other substances that would interfere with \n     the ability of the individual to become self-sufficient, or \n     provide for a referral for substance abuse treatment if \n     necessary to increase the employability of the individual.\n       ``(3) Assessment.--The State agency shall provide, through \n     a case manager, an initial and thorough assessment of the \n     skills, prior work experience, and employability of each \n     parent for use in developing and negotiating a personal \n     responsibility contract.\n       ``(4) Dispute resolution.--The State agency shall establish \n     a dispute resolution procedure for disputes related to \n     participation in the personal responsibility contract that \n     provides the opportunity for a hearing.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, when individuals are hired for a job they \nare handed a job description, a job description which outlines their \nresponsibilities so on day one they know what is expected in order to \nearn a paycheck. However, when individuals go into a welfare office to \nsign up for benefits, they fill out an application and then the \nGovernment sends them a check. There is no job description, nothing is \nexpected on day one. The individual goes home and collects a check. I \nbelieve that is wrong. It saps an individual's self-esteem and makes a \nfamily dependent.\n  We must fundamentally change the way we think about welfare. We \nshould be guided by common sense and build a system based on a \nfoundation of responsibility. If you want a check, you must earn it and \nyou must follow the job description. We need to stop looking at welfare \nas a Government giveaway program. Instead, welfare should be a \ncontract, demanding mutual responsibility between the Government and \nthe individual receiving the benefits. The contract should outline the \nsteps a recipient will take to become self-sufficient, and also a date \ncertain by which benefits will end. Responsibility should begin on day \none, and benefits should be conditioned on compliance with the terms of \nthe contract. Essentially, the contract would outline the \nresponsibilities for an individual, just like a job description \noutlines a worker's duties. It builds greater accountability in the \nwelfare system and sends the clear message that welfare as usual is no \nmore.\n  A binding contract of this nature makes common sense, and it works. \nHere is how I know. The Family Investment Agreement, or contract, is \nthe centerpiece of Iowa's innovative welfare reform program. The \nagreement or the contract is negotiated between individual recipients \nand their case workers. Failure to negotiate and sign a Family \nInvestment Agreement or to refuse to follow its terms results in \nelimination of welfare benefits.\n  I meet with welfare recipients and their case workers on a regular \nbasis in Iowa. I always ask them what they think about the requirement \nfor this contract. An overwhelming number credit the contract for \ncreating a fundamental change of the welfare system in Iowa, change \nwhich has meant fewer families on welfare and an increase in the number \nof families working and earning income and a decrease in the amount of \nmoney spent on cash grants. The results have been truly impressive in \nIowa.\n\n  Caseworkers say the family investment agreement, or contract, has \nhelped them guide families off welfare. Welfare recipients often say it \nis the first time that anyone ever asked them about their goals, and \nwith the contract, they get a clear picture of exactly what is expected \nof them. That is an important first step toward making families self-\nsufficient.\n  The amendment I am offering with Senator Coats is simple. It builds \non the successful reforms that are going on in our States; that welfare \nrecipients negotiate and sign an agreement which outlines what will be \ndone to move off welfare. A similar amendment was included in last \nyear's bipartisan Senate bill. That bill we adopted 87 to 12. This \nwould be a good improvement to the pending bill. Some changes were made \nin that amendment at the suggestion of Senator Coats, very good \nchanges, I might add.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support that amendment.\n  Mr. President, I do not know if this amendment is going to be agreed \nto or not. There is some talk that it will be. We do not really know \nyet.\n  I ask unanimous consent that if this amendment is not agreed to that \nit be put over until Tuesday so that Senator Coats can speak on it. He \ncould not be here this evening. So I ask unanimous consent that it be \nput over, that the vote on it be put over until Tuesday, and I will ask \nfor the yeas and nays, which, if it is accepted, we can vitiate the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me rephrase that request. I ask unanimous-consent \nthat this amendment, if it is not accepted, be put over to a vote until \nTuesday so that Senator Coats might speak on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I still hope the amendment will be \naccepted after it is looked at. I do want to thank Senator Coats for \nhis help in crafting this amendment and making changes to it. Again, I \nstill hope it will be accepted. As I said, something similar to it was \nadopted unanimously on the bill we put through last fall.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have a second amendment. It will not \ntake very long.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4916\n\n    (Purpose: To strike amendments to child nutrition requirements)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4916.\n       Strike section 1253.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment would strike the provision\n\n[[Page S8137]]\n\nin the bill that eliminates the existing program of grants for \ninitiating or expanding school breakfast or summer food programs. The \nprovision in the bill has nothing to do with welfare reform. It is \nmerely killing a good program to save only a relatively small amount of \nmoney in terms of the total amount of money involved in this bill.\n  In fact, I believe this provision in the bill will actually hinder \nwelfare reform, because it will mean more kids will be hungry during \nthe school year and over the summer months. That is a circumstance that \nwill make it harder for that family to get off welfare.\n  Many children having the greatest need for school breakfast and \nsummer food assistance do not get the opportunity they should have to \nreceive the benefits of these valuable programs. Currently, about 12 \nmillion low-income children take part in the School Lunch Program. Only \nabout 5.5 million children participate in the School Breakfast Program, \nand the number of participants in the Summer Food Program is only about \n2 million.\n  What these numbers mean is that a large proportion of low-income \nchildren who benefit from the School Lunch Program do not benefit from \nthe School Breakfast Program and even fewer from the summer food \nprogram. Less than half of the low-income kids getting school lunches \nnow receive breakfasts and less than 20 percent of low-income kids in \nthe lunch program receive summer meals. There are many children who \ncannot take part in these very important programs because they simply \nare not available in their neighborhoods due to a lack of community \nresources.\n  Startup and expansion funds have proven themselves as a means to get \nthese programs going in neighborhoods. What this program does is \nprovide modest amounts of assistance to allow schools and summer food \nsponsors to get programs started or expand them in low-income areas. \nThe school may need, for example, some equipment or some other resource \nthat will help them deliver meals to hungry kids. There is no other \nprogram that is in existence to help out on these equipment and \ninfrastructure needs. This is the only one.\n  The School Breakfast Startup and Expansion Program was begun by \nCongress to provide competitive grants for one-time expenses associated \nwith starting a School Breakfast Program in individual schools. In \n1994, the startup and expansion program was modified and made permanent \nand made to cover both school breakfast and the summer food programs.\n  The first grants under the new guidelines were announced in June of \n1995, just last year. Forty-eight States have applied for grants; 31 \nStates have received funding under this program. So it is needed, and \nit is helping to improve access of low-income kids to nutritious \nbreakfasts and summer meals across the country.\n  There has been a resounding consensus from State departments of \neducation that the availability of these funds has played a major role \nin increasing the availability of school breakfast and summer food \nprograms to low-income kids. These funds are for one-time startup \ncosts. Funding does not go on and on and on, but it provides schools \nand sponsors with the seed funds necessary to start or to expand to new \nsites these proven nutrition programs for children.\n  These startup and expansion funds have meant the difference between \nneedy children going hungry in the morning--because their schools are \ntoo poor to afford the startup costs of a breakfast program--and \nchildren ready to learn after eating a school breakfast.\n  This bill that we have before us cuts spending by over $50 billion. \nMy amendment would only have a minuscule effect on the magnitude of \nthose savings. Mr. President, I submit that the cost in human terms, \nthe cost in diminished futures for our Nation's children is far too \nhigh to pay in order to achieve the relatively minor spending \nreductions associated with the provision that my amendment strikes. By \nstriking this provision, my amendment will ensure we continue to make a \nmodest, sound investment in the nutrition, health, education and future \nof our children.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I believe that this amendment will actually \nsave money in the long run, because kids who are well-nourished grow up \nhealthy. They are able to learn and acquire the skills they need to \nlive as productive members of society. That means less welfare \ndependency, less crime, less poor health and less cost to our society \nin dealing with the various ills that result from poor nutrition and \nstunted human development.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Harkin \namendment. The underlying provision that the Harkin amendment attempts \nto amend actually has some commonality here, bipartisan support, I \nshould say.\n  The President, in his most recent welfare reform proposal, contained \na provision to repeal the expansion grants, the grants that the Senator \nfrom Iowa wants to put back in.\n  In addition, the Democratic substitute which we voted on earlier \ntoday also repealed expansion grants. And I think the reason was that \nthese expansion grants, at least for the school breakfast program, have \nbeen around for 6 or 7 years. With 6 or 7 years, that is a fair amount \nof time to have those grants on the table to use to grow the program. \nIf they have not grown by now, they are probably not going to grow with \nrespect to the summer food program. It has not been widely used.\n  The Senator from Iowa mentioned 31 States. But these are not State \ngrants. They are grants to very small discreet schools. If you only \nhave 31 in the entire country, that is hardly a significant expansion \nof the program. I think most everyone has recognized that we have sort \nof reached the end of the road with respect to expanding this program. \nAnd this money can be more efficiently spent elsewhere.\n  I remind Senators that this provision saves a substantial amount of \nmoney. What it is is $112 million that we were required to come up with \nin our reconciliation portion of the agriculture budget. And there is \nno offset provided for in this legislation. So if in fact we put these \ngrants back, we are going to have to find other places, food stamps, \nother kinds of programs that I think have more political support, and \nfor good reason, than these expansion grants. So I would urge my \ncolleagues not to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Just a small followup. I do not always agree with the \nPresident of the United States. These start-up and expansion grants \nstand on their own merits, without regard to what is contained in the \nPresident's or any other welfare reform proposal.\n  As the Senator from Pennsylvania says, this is kind of a modest \nprogram. But we did in 1994, as I said, make it permanent and modify it \nto include summer food start-up and expansion. We got the first of the \nnew grants out last year. It is a modest program. It is not a big, \noverwhelming program. But it allows really the poorest schools to get \nthe seed money.\n  As I said, it is a one-time infusion of money. Let us say they have \nsome sites they want to deliver meals to. They have a central kitchen \nand they want to delivery some meals to other sites. Maybe they do not \nhave a vehicle to do it. Well, this program would help them get the \nvehicle that will be able to deliver those meals to other sites, let us \nsay, around the area.\n  So it is a one-time cost that will enable them to go ahead and have a \nbreakfast program or a summer food program. It is needed. You say, \nwell, it is a modest program. I suppose if it was big, they would argue \nit is too big. But it is a modest program and it is needed.\n  Right now, I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, that in the ag \nfunction we have over $500 million in excess spending reductions beyond \nthe levels required by the budget resolution. CBO estimates that \neliminating this program will reduce spending over 6 years by $112 \nmillion. So there is plenty of excess savings in the Agriculture \nCommittee's portion of this bill to cover this amendment. I hope that \nwe will correct this bill to allow these very important start-up and \nexpansion grants for school breakfast and summer food programs to \ncontinue. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Just one of the reasons we had more savings than the ag\n\n[[Page S8138]]\n\nbill is because we had to meet a specific target in the last year. And \nto meet that target, we had to cut a little bit more than we needed to \nin the first few years to meet the outyear number. That is why if you \nchange the numbers, then we do not have the numbers in the outyears. I \nsay that in response.\n\n  I am willing to get the yeas and nays on this.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. May I ask the Senator from Iowa, did the Senator offer two \namendments?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. I offered two amendments.\n  Mr. FORD. Did we get the yeas and nays on the second one?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I did get the yeas and nays, but we had a unanimous \nconsent to hold off until Tuesday.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I say to the Senator from Iowa, in discussing the \nmatter with the Senator from Delaware, we are prepared to accept the \nfirst Harkin amendment, the one that was pushed off until Tuesday and \naccept the amendment without the need for a vote, if that is acceptable \nto the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That would be very acceptable.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the \nyeas and nays on the first Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on the \nsecond Harkin amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4915\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we are now ready to accept the Harkin \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Harkin \namendment No. 4915.\n  The amendment (No. 4915) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we have an amendment that is up from the \nRepublican side. I understand that the Senator is not here. It is going \nto be offered by the acting floor manager. I do not know that we have \nanybody on our side. If the Senator wants to introduce it, then we \nwould get the yeas and nays on it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4917\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that recipients or caretakers of minor recipients \n  of means-tested benefits programs are held responsible for ensuring \n    that their minor children are up to date on immunizations as a \n      condition for receiving welfare benefits from the taxpayers)\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] for Mr. \n     Ashcroft, proposes an amendment numbered 4917.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in chapter 9 of subtitle A, insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SANCTIONS FOR FAILING TO ENSURE THAT MINOR CHILDREN \n                   ARE IMMUNIZED.\n\n       (a) TANF.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, a State shall not be prohibited by the Federal \n     Government from sanctioning a recipient of assistance under a \n     State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social \n     Security Act for failing to provide verification that such \n     recipient's minor children have received appropriate \n     immunizations against contagious diseases as required by the \n     law of such State.\n       (2) Exception.--In the event that a State requires \n     verification of immunizations, paragraph (1) shall not apply \n     to a caretaker described in such paragraph who relies solely \n     or partially upon spiritual means rather than medical \n     treatment, in accordance with the religious beliefs of such \n     caretaker.\n       (b) Food Stamps.--\n       (1) In general.--A caretaker recipient of assistance or \n     benefits under the food stamp program, as defined in section \n     3(h) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, shall provide \n     verification that any dependent minor child residing in such \n     recipient's household has received appropriate immunizations \n     against contagious diseases as required by the law of the \n     State in which the recipient resides.\n       (2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a \n     caretaker described in such paragraph who relies solely or \n     partially upon spiritual means rather than medical treatment, \n     in accordance with the religious beliefs of such caretaker.\n       (3) Individual penalties.--The failure of a caretaker \n     described in paragraph (1) to comply with the requirement of \n     such paragraph within the 6-month period beginning with the \n     month that includes the date that the caretaker first \n     receives benefits under the food stamp program shall result \n     in a 20 percent reduction in the monthly amount of benefits \n     paid under such program to such caretaker for each month \n     beginning after such period, until the caretaker complies \n     with the requirement of paragraph (1).\n       (c) SSI.--\n       (1) In general.--A caretaker of a minor child who receives, \n     on their own behalf or on behalf of such child, payments \n     under the supplemental security income program under title \n     XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) shall \n     provide verification that the child has received appropriate \n     immunizations against contagious diseases as required by the \n     law of the State in which the child resides.\n       (2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a \n     caretaker described in such paragraph who relies solely or \n     partially upon spiritual means rather than medical treatment, \n     in accordance with the religious beliefs of such caretaker.\n       (3) Individual penalties.--The failure of a caretaker \n     described in paragraph (1) to comply with the requirement of \n     such paragraph within the 6-month period beginning with the \n     month that includes the date that the caretaker first \n     receives, on their own behalf or on behalf of such child, \n     payments under the supplemental security income program shall \n     result in a 20 percent reduction in the monthly amount of \n     each payment made under such program on behalf of the \n     caretaker or such child for each month beginning after such \n     period, until the caretaker complies with the requirement of \n     paragraph (1).\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, in 1994, one out of every four 2-year-\nolds had not received the proper vaccinations. This statistic worsens \nappreciably in urban areas. For example, a 1995 survey of State health \ndepartment clinics in Houston found that only 14 percent of the \nchildren were up-to-date on their immunizations.\n  Because these children are not being immunized, the Centers for \nDisease Control reported 1,537 needless and easily avoidable incidences \nof mumps in 1994.\n  Such a deplorable lack of basic preventive health care is \ninexcusable, particularly since immunizations are free in America.\n  The Vaccines for Children Program administered by the National \nImmunization Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nprovides free vaccines to children under 18 who are eligible for \nMedicaid, or are uninsured or underinsured.\n  When a child in America is not immunized, it is entirely the fault of \nthe parent. It is a blatantly irresponsible act not to immunize a \nchild.\n  We should not be paying welfare recipients to abdicate their \nresponsibility. The welfare system should encourage people to take care \nof their own.\n  Children are the future, and in order to break the cycle of \ndependence, children of welfare recipients need every break available.\n  All schools require immunization records for a child to be enrolled. \nAn unimmunized child can be denied admission to school. And a child \nthat doesn't go to school will probably end up on welfare.\n  What's wrong with requiring parents on welfare to have their children \nimmunized? We shouldn't be paying parents to neglect their children.\n  This amendment allows States to sanction welfare recipients of TANF, \nand other States programs who do not immunize their children.\n  This amendment also requires States to sanction Food Stamps and SSI \nrecipients who do not immunize their children.\n  Again, immunizations are free to Medicaid recipients and the \nuninsured\n\n[[Page S8139]]\n\nin hospitals and clinics across the Nation, so there is simply no \nlegitimate excuse for parents not to have their children \nimmunized. Additionally, States think immunization requirements for \ngovernment aid are a good idea.\n\n  According to the American Public Welfare Association 12 States have \nreceived Federal waivers to implement AFDC requirements for \nimmunization.\n  For example: Delaware, immunization is required for pre-school \nchildren. Failure to comply results in $50 decrease per month in AFDC \ngrant. Indiana, recipients must show proof within 12 months of AFDC \napplication that children are immunized. Families in noncompliance are \nsanctioned $90 per month. Michigan sanctions AFDC families $25 per \nmonth if parents fail to immunize pre-school-age children according to \nState policy. Mississippi children under 6 must receive regular \nimmunization and checkups or sanction of $25 per month applies. AFDC \npreschoolers in Texas must be immunized or the State may sanction the \nfamily $25 per child. And finally, in Virginia, AFDC recipients with \nchildren who have not been immunized receive fiscal sanctions of $50 \nfor the first child and $25 for each additional child.\n  This amendment is the best means to ensure that all children \neverywhere are immunized against deadly, but easily controllable \ndiseases such as mumps, tetanus, measles, polio, et cetera.\n  It is a first step to encouraging responsibility in a system that \nbreeds decadence and dependence--a step upward on the ladder of \nopportunity out of our current welfare system's net of ensnarement.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I yield back what time we might have on this \nside.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Likewise.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Ashcroft amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4918\n\n  (Purpose: To revise this legislation if it increases the number of \n                 impoverished children in this Nation)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] for himself and \n     Mr. Simon, proposes amendment numbered 4918.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       ``Impoverished Children Provision.--\n       ``(A) Report by the secretary, accompanied by legislative \n     proposal.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \n     develop data and, by January 30, 1999, shall report to \n     Congress with respect to whether the National child poverty \n     rate for Fiscal Year 1998 is higher than it would have been \n     had this Act not been implemented. If the Secretary \n     determines that this rate has increased and that such \n     increase is attributable to the implementation of provisions \n     of this Act, then such report shall contain the Secretary's \n     recommendations for legislation to halt this increase. The \n     Secretary's report shall be made public and shall be \n     accompanied by a legislative proposal in the form of a bill \n     reflecting said recommendations.\n       ``(B) Congressional action.--\n       ``(1) The bill described in (A) shall be introduced in each \n     House of Congress by the Majority Leader or his designee upon \n     submission and shall be referred to the committee or \n     committees with jurisdiction in each House.\n       ``(2) Discharge.--If any committee to which is referred a \n     bill described in paragraph (1) has not reported such bill at \n     the end of 20 calendar days after referral, such committee \n     shall be discharged from further consideration of such bill, \n     and such bill shall be placed on the appropriate calendar of \n     the House involved.\n       ``(3) Floor consideration.--Any bill described in paragraph \n     (1) placed on the calendar as a result of a committee's \n     report or the provisions of paragraph (2) shall become the \n     pending business of the House involved within 60 days after \n     it has been placed on the calendar of such House, unless such \n     House shall otherwise determine.''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment is on behalf of myself \nand Senator Simon. This amendment is a very simple and straightforward \namendment. And it is my fervent hope that this amendment will have \nstrong bipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, let me just assume--and I think it is probably a \ncorrect assumption--that there is not one Senator in this Chamber that \nwishes to impoverish any more children in America, that when people say \nthat they think the passage of this bill will not hurt children, they \nmean it. I accept that as having been said in good faith.\n  Mr. President, today the Washington Post, in an editorial, said that \nthis welfare reform bill could be a profound mistake and called upon \nall of us to be cautious, that one out of every eight children in \nAmerica is covered by the AFDC program, the welfare program.\n  Mr. President, let me give you the context, and then let me go right \nto the amendment. The context is as follows. I think we are going to be \nvery honest about this. As the old saying goes, people can be in honest \ndisagreement about this bill. But the fact of the matter is, we do not \nknow for certain. There are some ardent advocates for this welfare \nbill. And there are those who have spoken in strong opposition.\n  One of those Senators who has been most vocal in his opposition is \nSenator Patrick Moynihan from New York, who has been a giant in the \nfield, who has studied welfare longer than any of the rest of us, who \nis an acknowledged expert, and who has enormous intellectual and \npolitical and personal integrity.\n  Senator Moynihan argues that this in fact would mean that there would \nbe more impoverished children in America. That is his view. That is not \nthe view of every Senator.\n  Mr. President, what this amendment says is that Health and Human \nServices takes a look at what we have done over the next 2 years. I \nknow that Senators do not want this to be the case. But if, in fact, as \na result of some of the provisions in this legislation there are more \nimpoverished children in America, that report comes back to us, and we \nfast track it. It comes back to the Congress, we fast track it, and it \ncomes to the floor in 20 days, and we take action to correct the \nproblem.\n\n  Now, Senators, please understand what I am saying. I wish there was \ntime to summarize this tomorrow. I am assuming everybody in this \nChamber--and I believe it has been operating in good faith; we just \nhave some honest disagreements. But I do not think any of us know for \ncertain.\n  What I am saying in this amendment is, at least have some safety net \nhere or some fail-safe mechanism. At least be willing to evaluate what \nwe have done. We cannot know what we do not want to know. We cannot be \nunwilling to study what we have done. We cannot be unwilling to have \nsome sort of evaluation, have Health and Human Services study this, \nbring it back to us, and if, in fact, because of some of the provisions \nin this legislation, there are more impoverished children in America--\nthat is what the Office of Management and Budget said about the last \nbill we passed--then we would take a look at that study, and we, not \nHealth and Human Services, we, as legislators, would take the kind of \ncorrective action that would be necessary to make sure we do not \ncontinue to cause this poverty among children in America.\n  Mr. President, I am really hopeful that there will be strong support \nfor this. I think it is a most reasonable amendment. I think it would \nbe reassuring to people in the country. Frankly, I think it is a way we \ncan reassure ourselves. I offer this amendment, and I hope that it will \nbe accepted.\n  I withhold the balance of my time and ask for a response from the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I do not see anything in this amendment \nthat is necessary. We already get a variety of information from the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, the Labor Department, and a \nwhole lot of other agencies with respect to statistical information \nwith respect to poverty rates and a whole variety of other factors \ndealing with children in poverty.\n  That information is compiled regularly and is made available to the \nCongress. So to have the Secretary of\n\n[[Page S8140]]\n\nHealth and Human Services redo that in some report as requested by the \nSenator from Minnesota seems to me to be unnecessary.\n  If, in fact, the poverty statistics over the 2-year-period, as \ndescribed in this legislation, show an increase in the poverty rate \namong children, I guarantee you that there will be Members, maybe from \nboth sides of the aisle if it is dramatic, who will come here to the \nfloor and will be looking to make some changes in the welfare program.\n  I suggest we have seen increases in poverty with the current system \non many occasions, almost continually over the past 30 years, and we \nhave never done anything as dramatic as what the Senator from Minnesota \nis suggesting with this proposal. I think what we are seeing here is \nreally nothing more than putting in some sort of structure in some very \nlimited and constrained timing. Why not 2 years? Why not 5 years? Why \nnot 1 year? It is hard to pull a number like 2 years out of the hat.\n  This is a program that, once implemented, will be implemented \ndifferently across this country because of the flexibility given in \nthis bill. There will be programs that I think will be dramatically \nsuccessful which will have tremendous impact on the poor in this \ncountry. There are those, in all likelihood, that will have modest \nsuccess. I think it is important to let that play out. It is important \nto give the Congress the flexibility to be able to deal with that in a \nrational, measured way, by debate, instead of forcing them into a \nrather tight timeframe that is being designed here by the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n\n  For those reasons, I oppose the Wellstone amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania evades \nthe point. This amendment is not about collecting statistics about \npoverty in general. It is about this piece of legislation and doing \nsomething in the affirmative for children if, in fact, provisions in \nthis piece of legislation should lead to an increase in poverty among \nchildren. Two years is hardly too tight a time line for children who \nmight find themselves in more difficult economic circumstances because \nof what we have done.\n  In all due respect, I find it absolutely amazing that Senators who \nmake the argument that this is going to be a piece of legislation that \nwill not hurt children would now be unwilling to support a study to see \nwhether, in fact, provisions in this piece of legislation are going to \nimpoverish more children. You cannot evade the point.\n  I ask my colleague, what would be the harm in such a study? Gunnar \nMyrdal said, ``Ignorance is never random.'' Sometimes I guess we do not \nknow what we do not want to know.\n  Before I move on to my other amendment, is there any particular \nresponse as to why?\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. FORD. We are starting something new, and it is down a path that \nwe are not sure how it will turn out. I think that is the Senator's \npoint.\n  The States will be doing this and not the Federal Government, as \nsuch, because in this legislation we would be giving block grants. I \nthink we ought to know how that is faring out there.\n  I remember when the States were in charge of nursing homes. Because \nit was so bad, the Federal Government took it over and set higher \nstandards so we could take care of our senior citizens better. Is it \nnot the point that we do not know what will happen?\n  Like the Senator from Pennsylvania said, some programs may be good, \nsome may be mediocre, some may flunk. Do we not need to know and \nrespond, particularly for children? Is that not the point the Senator \nis trying to make?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Kentucky, absolutely.\n  I will give but one other example. It was President Richard Nixon, a \nRepublican, who said we better have some national standards for food \nstamps, because we had all these reports in the mid and late 1960's. I \nam sure my colleague from Pennsylvania has read about those reports on \nchildren with extended bellies and children suffering from rickets and \nscurvy. We decided there better be some national standards.\n  If we are going to do something quite new, and we have Senators of \nthe stature of Senator Patrick Moynihan who say this will impoverish \nmore children, and we have two studies from OMB and Health and Human \nServices saying the same thing, I do not wish to cast judgment on it, \nbut I cannot for the life of me understand why my colleagues would not \nwant to at least have Health and Human Services study it and bring back \na report to us, and if, in fact, some of the provisions of this \nlegislation have increased poverty among children, we take corrective \naction.\n\n  My colleagues have said that will not happen, so why would you want \nto vote against this? Why would you not want to have a study? Why would \nyou not want to have some measuring of statistics? Why would we not \nwant to err on the side of caution when it comes to what we are doing, \nas it affects the poorest children in America? Why would we not want to \nerr on the side of caution?\n  The silence is deafening; is there a response?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am happy to respond to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota. The answer simply is, like every other welfare program \nthat has been instituted in this country, there are volumes of studies \nas to its impact by a variety of organizations from the left to the \nright, including the Government. I do not think there will be any \nshortage of information as to the efficacy of this new direction in \nwelfare. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, what your amendment provides for is not only reports, and I \nsuggest duplicative reports, but congressional action, discharge for \nconsideration, an expedited procedure, very expedited procedure for \nlegislation, which is, again, I think, an overreaction and just not \nnecessary.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Well, Mr. President, I will finish up with one other \nquick amendment with my time slot. First, I will respond by saying one \nmore time that it just evades the point. It is not a question of \nacademics or whether there will be studies. It is a question of whether \nor not we are willing, as an institution, as a body, to say we are \ndoing something very different. We want to make sure that in this \nlegislation we pass we have some provision here to take a look at what \nwe have done, so that the results will come back to us, so that if in \nfact, God forbid, we have done something that impoverished more \nchildren, we will take quick action to correct the problem. I cannot, \nfor the life of me, understand the opposition to such a proposal. I am \nreally shocked. Excuse me for my indignation, but I am.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay this amendment aside \nand to offer my other amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, but I want to make some comments.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am sorry. I yield for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withdraw the unanimous \nconsent request for the moment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, every Senator here is concerned about the \nchildren of America, and we are particularly concerned about those \nchildren that are not having the kind of opportunity we all think they \ndeserve. So I do not think the comments should be that we do not all \nseek the same benefits for the children in our country.\n  Just let me point out that the legislation reported out by the \nFinance Committee already provides for research, evaluation, and \nnational studies. In section 413(a), we specifically provide that the \nSecretary shall conduct research on the benefits, efforts, and costs of \noperating different State programs funded under this part, including \ntime limits relating to eligibility. Not only do we provide for \nstudies, but we provide $15 million for each of the fiscal years from \n1998 through 2001, with the purpose of paying the cost of conducting \nsuch research, for the cost of developing and evaluating innovative \napproaches for reducing welfare dependency and increasing the well-\nbeing of minor children under section (b).\n  So we already have in the legislation ample provisions for studies to \nbe made to determine how effective our reform\n\n[[Page S8141]]\n\nprograms are. We all want that information. That is the reason it is \ncontained in this bill.\n  However, we do object to the expedited procedure, whereby the \nSecretary of Health makes recommendations and they are put on an \naccelerated track to be considered by the Congress. I know of no \ninstance where this kind of procedure has been used. Yes, we have had \naccelerated procedures in certain limited circumstances, such as trade \nbills. But the recommendations come from the President of the United \nStates. I, for one, think that it is appropriate for the \nrecommendations of these studies to go through the regular process of \nCongress.\n  My distinguished friend and colleague from Minnesota talks about the \ntimeframe. Just let me point out that the present program has been in \neffect for about 30 years, and we have studies and recommendations from \nthe CBO that show that if we do not do something about reform, that \nanother 3 million children will be on welfare in the next 9 years. So \ndo not talk to me about the timeframe. Let us all agree that we do want \nthe studies, and we do want the independent analyses as to how these \nprograms are working. But let us use the Congress and its normal \nprocesses, including its committees, to determine what is appropriate, \nrather than to give this kind of authority to a nonelected Member of \nthe Cabinet.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have just a quick response, and we \nwill move on. First of all, I say to my friend from Delaware that to \ntalk in general terms about studies and evaluations and not to connect \nit specifically to the issue that I raised in this amendment, as to \nwhether or not we will in fact be willing to look at the very real and \nimportant questions as to whether this legislation or provisions in \nthis legislation have impoverished more children, and then take \ncorrective action, again, it misses the point. It is not a response to \nthat very real concern.\n  Second of all, this it is not an agency that takes the action. Health \nand Human Services reports back to this body, and we are the ones that \ncorrect the problem. We are the ones that correct the problem. So, \nagain, I do not really believe that the comments of my colleague are \nresponsive to what this amendment speaks to.\n  Finally, on welfare--I cannot resist--and then we can move on. But \nthis reference to the CBO study. With all due respect, when I hear my \ncolleagues talk about welfare and how welfare caused poverty, it is \ntantamount to making the argument that Social Security caused people to \ngrow old. You have the cause and effect mixed up. Every 30 seconds, a \nchild is born into poverty in this country. We are getting close to one \nout of every four children. That is true. There are a whole host of \nreasons why we have this poverty. Welfare is a response to it. To argue \nthat the welfare system causes the poverty is like saying the Social \nSecurity system causes people to be aged. You just have the cause and \neffect mixed up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield back all our time on the \namendment.\n  The amendment is not germane to the provisions of the reconciliation \nbill pursuant to 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act. I raise a point of order \nagainst the pending amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsection of that Act for the consideration of the pending amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4919\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that States which receive block grants under Part A \n    of title IV of the Social Security Act establish standards and \n procedures regarding individuals receiving assistance under such part \n   who have a history of domestic abuse, who have been victimized by \n  domestic abuse, and who have been battered or subjected to extreme \n                                cruelty)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself and \n     Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered 4919.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of section 402(a) of the Social Security Act, as \n     added by section 2103(a)(1), add the following:\n       ``(7) Certification of standards and procedures to ensure \n     that the state will screen for and identify domestic \n     violence.--\n       ``(A) In general.--A certification by the chief executive \n     officer of the State that the State has established and is \n     enforcing standards and procedures to--\n       ``(i) screen and identify individuals receiving assistance \n     under this part with a history of domestic violence while \n     maintaining the confidentiality of such individuals;\n       ``(ii) refer such individuals to counseling and supportive \n     services; and\n       ``(iii) waive, pursuant to a determination of good cause, \n     other program requirements such as time limits (for so long \n     as necessary) for individuals receiving assistance, residency \n     requirements, child support cooperation requirements, and \n     family cap provisions, in cases where compliance with such \n     requirements would make it more difficult for individuals \n     receiving assistance under this part to escape domestic \n     violence or unfairly penalize such individuals who are or \n     have been victimized by such violence, or individuals who are \n     at risk of further domestic violence.\n       ``(B) Domestic violence defined.--For purposes of this \n     paragraph, the term `domestic violence' has the same meaning \n     as the term `battered or subjected to extreme cruelty', as \n     defined in section 408(a)(8)(C)(iii).\n       ``(8) Certification regarding eligibility of individual who \n     has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty.--A \n     certification by the chief executive officer of the State \n     that the State has established and is enforcing standards and \n     procedures to ensure that in the case of an individual who \n     has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty, as \n     determined under section 408(a)(8)(C)(iii), the State will \n     determine the eligibility of such individual for assistance \n     under this part based solely on such individual's income.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will try to be brief. This amendment \nspeaks to an issue that we, as the Senate, have really, I think, taken \nsome important steps and major strides forward in addressing, and that \nis domestic violence in our country, violence within families that \neffect women, children, and sometimes men--usually women and children.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would ensure that States that receive \nthe block grant under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act \nestablish standards and procedures regarding individuals receiving \nassistance who have a history of domestic abuse, who have been \nvictimized by domestic abuse and have been battered or subjected to \nextreme cruelty.\n  There was a study done by the Taylor Institute in Chicago that \ndocumented that between 50 to 80 percent of women receiving AFDC are \ncurrent or past victims of domestic abuse. In other words, for all too \nmany of these women and children welfare, imperfections and all, is the \nonly alternative to a very dangerous home.\n  So what this amendment would say is that States would be required to \nscreen and identify individuals receiving assistance with a history of \ndomestic violence, refer such individuals to counseling and supportive \nservices, and waive for good cause other program requirements for so \nlong as necessary.\n  This is what the States would essentially end up doing. It would all \nbe done at the State level.\n  Mr. President, we cannot have ``one size fit all,'' as I have heard \nmany of my colleagues so say. It took Monica Seles 2 years to play \ntennis again. Can you imagine what it would be like as a result of her \nstabbing--to be beaten up over and over and over again; can you imagine \nwhat it would be like to be a small child and see that happen in your \nhome over and over again?\n  I want to make sure that these women and these children throughout \nour country, for whom the welfare system has been sometimes the only \nalternative to these very dangerous homes, receive the kind of special \nservices and assistance that they need. In the absence of the passing \nof this amendment, all too many women and children could find \nthemselves forced back into these very dangerous homes.\n  So it is a reasonable amendment. It is one that speaks to the very \nreal problem of violence within homes in\n\n[[Page S8142]]\n\nour country. It would be an extremely important, I think, modification \nof this welfare bill that would provide assistance that is really \nneeded by many women, many children, and many families in our country.\n  I hope that this amendment would be agreed to and would receive \nstrong support, bipartisan support.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, there is no objection to this amendment \non this side. We are willing to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The amendment (No. 4919) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent agreement to \npropound to dispose of two amendments which have been agreed to on both \nsides of the aisle. They are Senator Faircloth's amendment to clarify \nthat a welfare recipient may provide child care services to satisfy the \nbill's work requirements.\n  The second one is Senator Coats' amendment allowing welfare \nrecipients to establish individual development accounts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to \noffer these two amendments which I now send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, has this \namendment been cleared?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes. Both have been cleared.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have been informed that the first \namendment has not been cleared on this side.\n  Mr. ROTH. I understand that, although they have been cleared, a \nquestion has been raised.\n  So I withdraw my request until clarified.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 4920, Withdrawn\n\n    (Purpose: To amend the Social Security Act to clarify that the \nreasonable efforts requirement includes consideration of the health and \n                          safety of the child)\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4920.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of chapter 7 of subtitle A of title II, add the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 2703. CLARIFICATION OF REASONABLE EFFORTS REQUIREMENT \n                   BEFORE PLACEMENT IN FOSTER CARE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 471(a)(15) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 671(a)(15)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(15) provides that, in each case--\n       ``(A) reasonable efforts will be made--\n       ``(i) prior to the placement of the child in foster care, \n     to prevent or eliminate the need for removing the child from \n     the child's home; and\n       ``(ii) to make it possible for the child to return home; \n     and\n       ``(B) in determining reasonable efforts, the best interests \n     of the child, including the child's health and safety, shall \n     be of primary concern;''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n     amendment made by subsection (a) shall be effective on the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Exception.--In the case of a State plan for foster care \n     and adoption assistance under part E of title IV of the \n     Social Security Act which the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services determines requires State legislation (other than \n     legislation appropriating funds) in order for the plan to \n     meet the additional requirement imposed by the amendment made \n     by subsection (a), such plan shall not be regarded as failing \n     to comply with the requirements of such title solely on the \n     basis of its failure to meet this additional requirement \n     before the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning \n     after the close of the first regular session of the State \n     legislature that begins after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act. For purposes of the previous sentence, in the case \n     of a State that has a 2-year legislative session, each year \n     of such session shall be deemed to be a separate regular \n     session of the State legislature.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I intend to talk for approximately 10 \nminutes about this amendment, and then, for reasons which I am going to \ndiscuss in just a moment, withdraw the amendment. But I want to discuss \nit. I inform my colleagues that it will take approximately 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, my amendment deals with the issue of foster care. It \nis my understanding that because the Senate bill has no language in \nthis bill on the issue of foster care that my amendment would be \nconsidered not to be germane. The House bill does deal with foster \ncare. Therefore, if we had a House bill before us it obviously would be \ngermane. Because of this, after a few brief remarks, I am going to \nwithdraw this amendment.\n  But I would like to discuss tonight what I consider to be a very \nimportant issue. It is the issue that my amendment addresses. It is the \nsubject of a freestanding bill that I have just a few moments ago \nintroduced. I believe that the idea contained in the bill, the idea \ncontained in my amendment, must be acted upon; if not in this bill then \nin a subsequent bill. And I have previously discussed this issue at \nlength on the Senate floor. I want to take just a few moments now to \nrevisit the issue, and to talk to my colleagues about it.\n  In 1980, Congress passed the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare \nAct, known as CWA. That 1980 act has done a great deal of good. It \nincreased the resources available to struggling families. It increased \nthe supervision of children in the foster care system, and it gave \nfinancial support to people to encourage them to adopt children with \nspecial needs.\n  Mr. President, while the law has done a great deal of good, many \nexperts are coming to believe that this law has actually had some bad \nunintended consequences. The bad unintended consequences were not \nbecause of the way the law was written and not because of the way the \nlawmakers intended in 1980 that it happen, but, frankly, because the \nlaw has been grossly misinterpreted.\n  Under the 1980 act, for a State to be eligible for Federal matching \nfunds for foster care expenditures, the State must have a plan for the \nprovision of child welfare services. And that plan must be approved by \nthe Secretary of HHS. This plan must provide, and I quote. Here is the \npertinent language, referring now to foster care:\n\n       In each case reasonable efforts will be made, (A), prior to \n     the placement of a child in foster care to prevent or \n     eliminate the need for removal of the child from his home; \n     and, (B), to make it possible for the child to return to his \n     home.\n\n  In other words, Mr. President, the law very correctly says we should \ntry family reunification. The law put money behind that. That is the \nright thing to do. But, Mr. President, this law has been \nmisinterpreted. In other words, Mr. President, no matter what the \nparticular circumstances of the household may be, the State must make \nreasonable efforts to keep it together and to put it back together, if \nit falls apart.\n  What constitutes reasonable efforts? Here is where the rub comes. How \nfar does the State have to go? This has not been defined by Congress \nnor has it been defined by HHS. This failure to define what constitutes \nreasonable efforts has had a very important and very damaging practical \nresult. There is strong evidence to suggest that in the absence of a \ndefinition reasonable efforts have become in some cases extraordinary \nefforts, unreasonable efforts; efforts to keep families together at all \ncosts. These are families, Mr. President, that many times are families \nin name only and parents that are parents in name only.\n  In the last few months I have traveled extensively throughout the \nState of Ohio talking to social work professionals; talking to people \nwho are in the field every day dealing with this issue.\n  In these discussions, I have found that there is great disparity in \nhow the law is being interpreted by judges and by social workers. In my \nhome State of\n\n[[Page S8143]]\n\nOhio we have 88 counties, and I would venture to say the law is being \ninterpreted 88 different ways and in some counties with many juvenile \njudges it is interpreted differently within that same county by \ndifferent judges.\n  Let me give you an example. This is the easiest way that I can \nexplain it. I posed this hypothetical, which it turns out in some \ncases, unfortunately, is not a hypothetical, but I made it up, I posed \na hypothetical to representatives of children's services in both rural \nparts of Ohio and urban counties.\n  Here is my hypothetical. The mother, Mary, is a 28-year-old, crack-\naddicted individual who has seven children. Steve, the father, 29-year-\nold father of the children, is an abusive alcoholic, and all seven of \ntheir children have been taken away, taken away permanently by the \ncounty, by the State over a period of time. In each child's case, \ncourts have decided these people cannot have this child; they are \nabusive; it is dangerous for the child. Not only that, we are taking \nthem away permanently. The mother gives birth now to an eighth child. \nThis newborn tests positive for crack. Therefore, it is very obvious \nthat the mother is still addicted to crack. The father is still an \nalcoholic. Those are the facts.\n  Pretend for a moment that you work for the county children's services \ndepartment. Here is the question, the question I posed to numerous \npeople across Ohio. Does the law allow you to get the new baby out of \nthe household, and if you do, should you file for permanent custody so \nthat baby can be adopted? Can you file for permanent custody so that \nbaby can be adopted?\n  The answer, I believe, will surprise and shock you. In fact, I was \nsurprised at the response I got when I asked a number of Ohio social \nwork professionals that very question. The answer varied from county to \ncounty but I heard too much ``no'' in the answers I got. Some officials \nsaid they could apply for emergency custody of the baby, they would get \nemergency custody and take the child away on a temporary basis, but \nthat they would have to make a continued effort--do you believe this? \nThey would then have to make a continued effort to send the baby back \nto the family, back to the mother, back to the father.\n  Other social workers said if they went to court to get custody of the \nbaby, they probably would not be able to get even temporary custody of \nthis little child. Most shocking of all, Mr. President, is the issue of \nadoption. I asked then with this hypothetical, with the seven children \nalready having been taken away, with the eighth child now testing one \nday positive for crack, mother clearly still on crack, showing no signs \nshe is going to get off, father continues to be an alcoholic, continues \nto be an abusive alcoholic, with all of those facts, how soon could I \nexpect that this poor little baby would be eligible to be adopted?\n  Most shocking of all is the answer I got. The lowest figure I got was \n2 years. That was the best I got; it would take 2 years for this child \nto be eligible to be adopted. In one urban county in the State of \nOhio--and this is not unusual to Ohio--I was told it would take 5 years \nbefore that child was eligible to be adopted--5 years.\n  One social worker, just one out of the ones I asked, told me that her \ndepartment would move immediately for permanent custody of the baby, \nbut she said their success would depend on the particular judge that is \nassigned to the case.\n\n  Mr. President, should our Federal law really push the envelope this \nfar? Should this Federal law really require extraordinary efforts? \nShould it require extraordinary efforts be made to keep that family \ntogether, efforts that any one of us clearly would not consider to be \nreasonable based on past history? I had one social worker look me in \nthe eye and say, ``Senator, the problem is the way our courts interpret \nthis law, we can't look at any history. We can't learn from the history \nof that family. We can't learn from the history of that abusive father \nor that abusive mother. We have to start over again each time.''\n  It is clear that after 16 years of experience with the law, there is \na great deal of confusion as to how the act applies. Again, I do not \nbelieve that is the fault of the authors. I think that is just the way \nit has been interpreted. I would not interpret the law that way, but \nthe fact is after 16 years we know it is being interpreted that way and \nis going to be interpreted that way.\n  My legislation is very simple, very short. My legislation would \nclarify once and for all the intent of Congress in the 1980 act. My \nlegislation would amend that language in the following way. I am going \nto read in a moment what my language would add. I want to first state \nto the Senate that I would not change any of the language in the \ncurrent law. I would add to it, but I would not change it. I would not \nchange the requirement for reasonable efforts to be made to reunify a \nfamily. That is a positive thing. That is something that we should try \nwhenever it is reasonable to do so. The people who make that decision \nare the people on the front lines, the social workers, the children's \nservice agencies, the people who have to make life-and-death decisions. \nThey are the ones who are going to have to make the decision. I just \nwant to clarify the law and to get it back to where I think the framers \nof the law, people who wrote the law in this Congress in 1980, intended \nit to be. So I would add the following, after the current language:\n\n       In determining reasonable efforts, the best interests of \n     the child, including the child's health and safety, shall be \n     a primary concern.\n\n  Let me read it again:\n\n       In determining reasonable efforts, the best interests of \n     the child, including the child's health and safety, shall be \n     a primary concern.\n\n  I think that settles it; it clarifies it. Again, I think it does what \nthe framers wanted.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, the 1980 act was a good bill. There are \nsome families that need a little help if they are going to stay \ntogether, and it is right for us to help them. That is what the Child \nWelfare Act did. But by now it should be equally clear that the framers \nof the 1980 act did not intend for extraordinary, unreasonable efforts \nto be made to reunite children with their abusers.\n  As Peter Digre, the Director of the Los Angeles County Department of \nChildren and Family Services, testified at a recent House hearing, ``We \ncannot ignore the fact that at least 22 percent of the time infants who \nare reunited with their families are subjected to new episodes of \nabuse, neglect or endangerment.''\n  That was not the intent of Congress in the 1980 law, but too often \nthat law is being misinterpreted in a way that is trapping these \nchildren in abusive households.\n  I believe we should leave no doubt about the will of the American \npeople on this issue affecting the lives of America's children. The \nlegislation I am proposing today would put the children first.\n  Now, Mr. President, for the reasons that I have stated in the \nbeginning, I reluctantly ask the Chair to withdraw the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the amendment withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 4920) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4911\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be in order \nto ask unanimous consent to order the yeas and nays on amendment 4911.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would make a series of notions to strike \nprovisions in S. 1956.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from Florida agree to a time agreement \nat this point?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, 40 minutes, equally divided.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent to have 40 minutes equally \ndivided on the Graham motion without a second-degree amendment in \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would modify that. It will require more than a single \nmotion in order to strike the sections which I intend to strike from \ntitle II,\n\n[[Page S8144]]\n\nchapter C, of S. 1956. So could the reference to ``motions'' be placed \nin the plural?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the purpose of the series of motions which \nI will make, which I hope will be considered as a single motion for \npurposes of our final vote, is to strike from this legislation those \nsections which relate to the eligibility of legal immigrants--legal \nimmigrants--to receive various Federal needs-based benefits. I do this \nbecause to have this language in this welfare bill is both redundant \nand punitive in terms of those communities which have large numbers of \nlegal immigrants and will have significant costs shifted to them as a \nresult of this legislation.\n  I am joined in this effort by Senators Simon, Murray and Feinstein, \nwho also recognize it would be inappropriate, and a duplication, to \nconsider matters which have already been resolved by this body.\n  As we will all recall, it was only a few weeks ago, May 2, to be \nprecise, that the Senate passed the Immigration Control and Financial \nResponsibility Act. This act, which had as its primary objective \ncontrolling illegal immigration into the United States, also contained \nprovisions that restrict the rights of legal aliens to a variety of \nFederal needs-based programs.\n  This legislation was the result of extensive hearings and markups in \nthe Judiciary Committee. It was subjected to exhaustive floor debate \nwhich lasted well over a week in the Senate. The majority of the time \nspent on the immigration bill dealt with the public benefits for legal \nand illegal immigrants. The availability of Supplemental Social \nSecurity Income, Aid for Families with Dependent Children, Medicaid and \nMedicare for immigrants, was examined during several floor votes which \nresulted in a comprehensive Senate bill.\n  I am going to say, I hope with not excessive arrogance, that this is \na subject which I know something about. I was Governor of Florida in \n1980 when over 125,000 immigrants in various legal categories came to \nmy State in a period of a few weeks. Since that time, it has been \nestimated that the total unreimbursed cost of that incident to the \nState of Florida was in excess of $1.5 billion. Those were costs \nassociated with health care, social services, education, housing, job \ntraining--a variety of activities which were necessary in order to \nfacilitate the assimilation of that large population into the \npopulation of the State of Florida.\n  The State of Florida has tried for the better part of 15 years to get \nrecognition of those costs which were incurred because of Federal \nimmigration decisions, but which ended up being an unreimbursed, \nunfunded mandate on the State of Florida. This case finally ended up in \nthe U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year. The decision of the U.S. \nSupreme Court: This is not a judicial issue. If the State of Florida, \nand other States which might be similarly affected, is to be dealt \nwith, it has to be dealt with by a political judgment, not by a \njudicial remedy.\n\n  What distresses me is after having spent weeks shaping the bill which \nwas intended to provide that type of structured legal response by the \nFederal Government when such impositions are placed by Federal action \non a particular community or State, we now, in a bill which is going to \nbe subject to 20 hours of debate--here it is after 10:30 at night--we \nare about to substantially rewrite, discard the fundamental policy \npremise of our previous actions and almost quadruple the amount of the \nunfunded mandate we are going to impose on affected States. In addition \nto the inappropriateness of us rejecting our previous work, we are \nmaking some very significant policy decisions without the kind of \nattention that we afforded to our earlier action on immigration.\n  What are some of those decisions we are about to make? In the \nprevious bill, we used the concept of deeming. I wish the Senator from \nWyoming were with us this evening, because he explained in great detail \nand on a repetitive basis what the theory of deeming is. It is that if \na person sponsors a legal alien to come into this country, that that \nperson should assume the financial obligations that will guarantee that \ntheir sponsored legal alien will not become a public charge.\n  Therefore, in terms of evaluating whether that legal alien \nqualifies--for instance, for Medicaid--you would add the income of the \nsponsor to the income of the legal alien. And if the combination of \nthose incomes exceeded the eligibility threshold, then the legal alien \nwould no longer qualify for that particular needs-based service. That \nconcept of deeming that we worked so carefully on in the immigration \nbill is largely replaced in this legislation by absolute prohibitions \nagainst legal aliens being able to access these Federal programs.\n  Much of the legislation that we considered earlier and passed on May \n2 was based on a recommendation of the U.S. Immigration Commission, \nwhich was established by act of Congress in 1990, and which issued a \nseries of reports in the mid-1990's. This report, issued in 1994, \nentitled ``U.S. Immigration Policy: Restoring Credibility,'' while it \nspoke well of the concept of deeming as a means of assigning \nresponsibility for legal aliens, went on to say:\n\n       However, circumstances may arise after an immigrant's entry \n     that create a pressing need for public health: unexpected \n     illnesses, injuries sustained because of serious accident, \n     loss of employment, death in the family. Under such \n     circumstances, legal immigrants should be eligible for public \n     benefits if they meet other eligibility criteria. We are not \n     prepared to remove the safety net from under individuals who \n     we hope will become full members of our polity.\n\n  That is precisely what this legislation does. It removes the social \nnet.\n  This also will make a very significant difference in the dollar \namount of unfunded costs shifted to the States. Under the bill we \npassed as immigration reform, the cost over 7 years was $5.6 billion.\n  This bill will impose an unfunded mandate of $23 billion over the \nnext 7 years on States. Mr. President, in deference to the limited time \nthat we have and the lateness of the hour, I will not unduly burden the \nSenate with the reports which I have, but I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a statement from the National Association of \nPublic Hospitals and Health Systems which outlines what the costs are \ngoing to be just in the one sector of health care institutions which \nare going to be a principal target of these unfunded mandates.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement of the National Association of Public Hospitals and Health \n            Systems in Support of Senator Graham's Amendment\n\n       The National Association of Public Hospitals and Health \n     Systems (NAPH) strongly supports Senator Graham's amendment, \n     cosponsored by Senator Simon, to strike Title IV from the \n     welfare reform legislation. NAPH is strongly opposed to the \n     legal immigrant provisions in the welfare reform bill because \n     barring legal immigrants from Medicaid eligibility for five \n     years and deeming legal immigrants out of Medicaid \n     eligibility until citizenship would jeopardize the health \n     care safety net in many urban areas.\n       Public hospitals would still treat immigrants but receive \n     no reimbursement. Most low income legal immigrants cannot \n     afford health insurance. Because of the legislation, however, \n     all legal aliens will be ineligible for Medicaid.\n       Public hospitals would have new burdens of uncompensated \n     care. The bar on Medicaid eligibility and Medicaid deeming \n     would lead to an increase in the number of uninsured patients \n     and exacerbate an already tremendous burden of uncompensated \n     care on public hospitals and other providers who treat large \n     numbers of low income patients. This is a cost shift from the \n     federal government to state and local entities and providers.\n       Public hospitals would bear the costs of welfare reform. \n     The cost shift created by the welfare legislation would \n     disproportionately fall on public hospitals in states with \n     large numbers of legal immigrants, such as Florida, \n     California, Texas, New York, and Illinois. Public hospitals \n     in states with lower levels of immigration would also bear \n     the costs, because legal immigrants are part of almost every \n     community.\n       There would be new public health risks. The loss of \n     Medicaid coverage means that the amount of preventive care \n     provided to legal immigrants would be drastically reduced, \n     thereby exposing entire communities to communicable diseases \n     while increasing the overall cost of providing necessary \n     care.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, there are two other aspects of the policy \nshifts in this legislation. The immigration bill contained the shift in \neligibility, the constriction of eligibility based on deeming for legal \naliens in order to generate funds that would then be used to finance \nthe programs\n\n[[Page S8145]]\n\nthat were authorized in the illegal immigration sections of that bill \nto better protect our borders. What we are about to do here is to take \nall the money that is in the immigration bill that is intended to be \nused for border enforcement and divert it for the purposes of this \nwelfare reform bill.\n  So all of the promises that we made, for instance, to the people \nalong the Southwest border, that we are going to have more Border \nPatrol agents, fencing, and other steps to enforce our borders against \nillegal immigration are going to be ashen, because we, by this action, \nhave taken all the money that we have provided to finance those \nenhancements to our borders. It is, in part, for that reason, I \nsuspect, that Senator Feinstein, who has been such a leader in the \nefforts to protect our borders, is a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Finally, I suggest, Mr. President, that this is a very clear back-\ndoor way to accomplish the same objective that this Senate on several \noccasions rejected when we were debating the immigration bill, and that \nis a sharp reduction on the rights of legal immigration into this \ncountry which we know is primarily the right to reunify families.\n  Why is this a back-door constraint on legal immigration and \nparticularly family reunification? The reason is because we are making \nit so financially onerous for sponsors. We are raising the specter of \ntheir own impoverishment as a result of bringing a loved one, a child, \na spouse, a parent into this country that we are going to effectively, \nthrough coercion, accomplish the same thing that this Senate, by direct \naction, refused to do, which was to make it more difficult for legal \naliens to reunite with their families.\n  So, Mr. President, this amendment, this series of motions to strike \nwill eliminate those sections of the legislation that relate to the \neligibility of legal aliens to a variety of Federal benefits. I \nunderscore that this is not to say that we are not going to restrain \nthose benefits, but we would do so through the immigration bill that we \nhave passed, a bill that had the considered judgment of this Senate as \nopposed to doing it through a welfare reform bill where this matter is \ngetting virtually no consideration.\n  We are going to do it through the concept of deeming rather than the \nconcept of a total prohibition. We are going to do it at a reasonable \nlevel of $5.6 billion which I personally think is, in itself, \nexcessive, but pales in comparison to the $23 billion of reduction that \nis contained in this welfare bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4921\n\n   (Purpose: To strike the provisions restricting welfare and public \n                          benefits for aliens)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the time I have used thus far be counted against \nmy time on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for himself, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, Mr. Simon, Mrs. Murray and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4941.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 562 strike line 5 through the end of line \n     23 on page 567.\n       Beginning on page 567 strike line 14 through the end of \n     page 582 line 2.\n       Beginning on page 585 line 13 strike all through the end of \n     line 25 on page 587.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I think this is an area where there is \njust a disagreement in philosophy. I respect the Senator from Florida, \nand there probably is not a Member in this Chamber who knows more about \nthe difficulty in dealing with a large number of legal immigrants in \nthis country than the former Governor of Florida. But I think there is \njust a philosophical difference here, or a difference of what we \nbelieve is fair and equitable in this country.\n  What we are talking about is a particular class of legal immigrants. \nWe are not talking about refugees, people who come to this country \nseeking refuge from persecution in their homeland. All refugees are \nexcluded from the provisions of this bill. In other words, they are \nfully entitled to the array of social welfare benefits provided by the \nFederal Government.\n  Asylees, for example, the two Cuban baseball players--they are \nprobably not going to need any social welfare benefits given their \ntalent level, but if they were not so talented and were here in this \ncountry claiming political asylum, they would continue to be eligible \nfor a variety of welfare benefits.\n  We are, in a sense, to my understanding, unique in that respect \naround the world. There are, to my knowledge, no other countries that \ndo provide welfare benefits to legal immigrants and their noncitizens \nin their country. So, in a sense, we are keeping very much with the \ntradition of our country, with the Statue of Liberty when we suggest \nthat those who are under persecution at home, that those who are in \nneed of this country as a beacon of freedom are, in fact, provided for \nby this country. So I think that is something we should all agree on, \nbe proud of and, obviously, continue, and we do that in this bill.\n  What we do not continue in this bill, and I think wisely do not \ncontinue, is to continue to provide benefits to what are called \nsponsored immigrants. Sponsored immigrants are immigrants who come to \nthis country, and almost all come to this country through a family \nunification provision, which is to unify a family, whether it is a \nspouse or a child or a mother or a father or a sister or a brother. \nThey come to this country to unify a family, and when they do so, the \ncitizen of this country, who is the sponsor, signs a document. The \ndocument says that I will take financial responsibility for this person \nwho I want to bring to this country for a period of 5 years, and that \nall of my assets are deemed available and in the possession, so to \nspeak, constructive possession of the person coming into this country \nfor purposes of evaluating whether that person is eligible for welfare \nor other Government benefits. That is current law.\n  But the problem with this whole agreement is it is not legally \nenforceable, and they are not enforced. In fact, one hand does not know \nwhat the other hand is doing. The welfare department has no idea what \nthe immigration status is, and, in fact, these benefits are handed out \nwithout really much knowledge of the immigration status of the \nindividual involved.\n  What we are seeing--and the Senator from New York and the Senator \nfrom New Mexico discussed this earlier today--is a trend. I say it is \neven more than a trend, it is an avalanche, and the avalanche is \nelderly family reunification, elderly being the bringing over of mom or \ndad to this country.\n  Mom or dad being 60 or 70 or 80 years of age, coming to this country, \nyou know, the doting son signs the sponsor agreement. And lo and \nbehold, mom, who is disabled, ends up on SSI. Or if you are elderly, \nbecause you qualify when you are over 65, you end up on SSI. The \nFederal Government and the taxpayers of this country become the \nretirement village supporters of the entire world.\n  I do not think that is what the intent of these provisions was for. I \nthink we have seen a real pattern of abuse here of a document that is \nnot legally enforceable, which is the sponsorship agreement, and a \ntremendous number of people coming over here and using the SSI system \nas, in fact, the retirement system for many people all across the \nworld. So what we have said is that we do not want to continue to have \nthis incentive.\n  We, as members of the Ways and Means Committee over in the other \nbody, heard testimony on numerous occasions about how it was well \nknown--and in fact it went throughout many refugee camps in Southeast \nAsia and other places; that was one of the items of testimony--about \nhow this was this great system that America had, that you can get over \nhere and you could array yourself in all these wonderful benefits.\n  People should come to this country because they want the benefits of \nour society, not the benefits of our welfare system. I think that is \nwhere we really\n\n[[Page S8146]]\n\nhave to draw the line here. So I think we have held up our \nresponsibility to the fabric of our society, which is to invite those \nwho are in need to come here, and we will in fact help you get started.\n  But I think we have drawn the line saying, if you want to bring a \nmember of your family over and you sign a document saying that you will \ntake financial responsibility for them, live up to the document, \nprovide for them. In fact, if you want--after 5 years, under current \nlaw, you are eligible for citizenship. If you apply for citizenship, \nyou do what is necessary to prepare yourself for citizenship, and \ncomply and apply and pass all your tests, you can, too, be eligible for \nthe wide variety of welfare programs that we have in this country.\n  But, I mean, we talk in terms of people coming here for welfare. The \nfact is, the vast majority of people do not come here for welfare. They \ncome here because America is the land of opportunity, and unfortunately \nwhat we have seen is because of the abuse in this area, it has caused a \nlot of some of the anti-immigrant feelings that are seen in many areas \nof the country and by many people in this country.\n  I think what we have a responsibility to do--I joined with Senator \nDeWine and Senator Abraham on this side of the aisle, I know Senator \nGraham and others on the other side of the aisle, in not restricting \nthe caps on immigration. I am proimmigration. I am the son of an \nimmigrant. I am not one of these people who says, ``I'm in. OK. Close \nthe door.'' I believe immigration is important to the future of this \ncountry.\n  But I believe if we have programs that are abused, if we have \nprograms that in fact call into question the immigration policy in this \ncountry, that cast a broad shadow over immigration in general, we have \na responsibility to the taxpayers, No. 1, but also to the sentiment of \nimmigration in this country, No. 2, to clean up the mess, to put a \nbetter face on immigration, to show that we have our act together in \nproviding immigration to those who truly are in need, but not to those \nwho are abusing the system.\n  If we clean that up, I think we improve the image of immigration and \nthere is less pressure on lowering those caps and doing other things \nthat I think could be harmful with respect to the area of immigration \nand, I think, save the taxpayers a whole bundle of money in the \nprocess.\n\n  I think those are all very positive things that happen. That is one \nof the reasons that this provision that is in this bill is included in \nthe Democrat substitute and has been included in, I think, all the \nHouse bills that have been considered.\n  I think it has very strong bipartisan support. While I think the \nSenator from Florida is well-intentioned and certainly is, I think, \nsensitive to the needs of the many thousands of immigrants who are in \nthe State of Florida, I think we have taken a judicious swipe at this \nissue and have cut appropriately. I hope we will support the underlying \nbill and be in opposition to the amendment of the Senator from Florida. \nI reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Did the Senator from Pennsylvania state that these \nprovisions that are not bars to eligibility only apply to those persons \nwho come into the country with a sponsor who has assumed the financial \nobligation?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I mean, I have not combed over the Finance Committee \nbill, but that has been my understanding all along.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator please turn to section 2402, which is \none of the sections that my motion would strike?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Can you tell me what page that is on?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Page 234 on my copy, but at a different page--\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I have section 2402 before me.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It states that:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law and except as \n     provided in paragraph (2), an alien who is a qualified alien \n     (as defined in section 2431) is not eligible for any \n     specified Federal program (as defined in paragraph (3)).\n\n  So thus we then have to go to section 2431 to determine what the \ndefinition is of a ``qualified alien.'' Subparagraph (b) of that \nsection says:\n\n       For purposes of this chapter, the term ``qualified alien'' \n     means an alien who, at the time the alien applies for, \n     receives, or attempts to receive a Federal public benefit, \n     is--\n\n  Among other things--\n\n       (2) an alien who is granted asylum under section 208 . . . \n       (3) a refugee who is admitted to the United States under \n     section 207 . . .\n       (4) an alien who is paroled into the United States under \n     section 212(d)(5) . . .\n\n  None of these people have a sponsor. If I have misread the language \nof this section, I will appreciate being corrected. But that is a very \nfundamental issue as to who is intended to be covered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. What I think this provision says is they are eligible \nfor a 5-year exemption under the law, and then they have to become \ncitizens.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator said the only people this applied to were \nthose who had a sponsor who could assume responsibility. I understood \nthe Senator to say specifically, for instance, they did not apply to \nrefugees who were admitted because they are fleeing legitimate \npersecution.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes. The Senator is absolutely right. This is different \nthan I understood the provision to be. The difference is--and the \nSenator is correct--that aliens, refugees, et cetera, are eligible for \n5 years until they become eligible for citizenship, and then we expect \nthem to become citizens or they will not be eligible in the future.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I think this question precisely \nunderscores why I have offered this series of strikes. We spent a week-\nplus on this floor in April and May debating a comprehensive \nimmigration bill. We came to a studied judgment as to how, for whom, \nfor what time period benefits for legal aliens should be constrained. \nWe came to a judgment that said over the next 7 years the restraint \nshould have a dollar figure of $5.6 billion.\n  Tonight we are debating a provision that purports to reduce the \nbenefits of legal aliens by $23 billion, four times more than what we \nhad purported to do just a few weeks ago. Yet there is not the \nopportunity for careful scrutiny and study. Therefore, fundamental \nmisconceptions as to who this applies to are being presented on this \nlegislation on which our colleagues are going to be asked to vote.\n  I think the prudent thing to do is to adopt the motions to strike \nthat I have offered and let these issues be resolved in the conference \ncommittee which is now in place to settle the immigration bill and not \nattempt to do these things at now 11 o'clock at night on a bill that \nhas received not a scintilla of the kind of analysis insofar as it \nrelates to the impact on legal aliens as did that immigration bill.\n  That is the argument that I make in support of my motions to strike \nthese provisions. This has very serious implications, not only to the \nindividuals involved, but to the communities in which legal aliens \nelect to live.\n  As an example, in a study by Los Angeles County of what this will \nmean in terms of health care in that community, there are estimates \nthat they have 93,000 legal immigrants who would lose their SSI \nbenefits, making them automatically eligible for county funded general \nassistance. That would cost Los Angeles County $236 million a year in \nadditional costs. I do not think we ought to be imposing an unfunded \nmandate of $236 million on the citizens of Los Angeles County in the \ncavalier manner that I suggest we are about to do.\n\n  We have a process. The conference committee focused on immigration \nwith Senators and Members of the House who were selected because of \ntheir knowledge and background on that subject matter, several of whom \nhave served on these important commissions on immigration. That is the \nform which these issues ought to be resolved, not in this welfare bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is awfully late here. Our colleague from \nPennsylvania gets saddled with the responsibility of providing analysis \nfor I do not know how many pages in the bill, and it is not easy, but I \nthink our colleague from Florida, despite the late hour and the fact \nthere are only a\n\n[[Page S8147]]\n\nhandful of us here, is a classic example of offering insight that we \nprobably were not aware of.\n  I hope those who understand this bill would look carefully at the \nsuggestions our colleague has made, because, as I understood it, this \nis the kind of thing which none of us intended to be the case. We are \ntalking about a category of people who come here legally, who fall into \ncircumstances that all of us have agreed should not be denied benefits. \nThere is no debate about that. I think we have resolved that.\n  I urge staff and others who might look at this, so that tomorrow when \nwe are asked to vote on matters as we gather in the well, there will \nnot be the benefit that those of us sitting here today will have had of \nthe very careful analysis of the Senator from Florida. My hope is, and \nI say this so our friends from Pennsylvania and Delaware who are here, \nwho have staff here to look at this, so tomorrow when our colleagues \ngather we will have an opportunity to pass judgment on this, and if it \nis as our colleague from Florida has suggested, we might adopt that \namendment maybe by voice vote, go to conference, and try and resolve \nsome of the matters.\n  They may take an opposite point of view, but I urge that thought be \ngiven to that. Most of our colleagues, if they have any sense at all, \nare fast asleep by this hour. I see that our Presiding Officer is a \nsurgeon. He may make recommendations for all of us here. We all know \nwhat it is like when it comes time to vote. We come in, there are \npapers at the desk, we vote aye or we vote no, we do not have a chance \nto benefit from the exchanges that have occurred here.\n  I urge our staffs take a good look at this, and if the Senator from \nFlorida is correct, I urge, in the spirit of bipartisanship, that we \ntry and set that matter aside for conference so as not to unwittingly \nadopt some provisions that I think none of us would agree with.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, with all due respect to my friend and \ncolleague from Connecticut, I am not too sure there is anything \nunwitting going on here. This was a provision that was in the Senate \nbill when it passed 87 to 12. It was in the conference report; it was \nin the original bill that was introduced. This provision has really \nbeen unchanged for quite some time and has been, as I said, not only \nincluded in the Republican bill, but the Senator from Connecticut \nhimself stood up on the floor when the Senator from New Mexico and the \nSenator from New York said, ``What are you guys talking about? \nThis provision on illegal immigrants, it is in our bill. You should not \nbe talking about that.''\n\n  I think there has been very broad support of this issue. It saves a \nsignificant amount of money. It is $18 billion. Obviously, the Senator \nfrom Florida does not have any offset there to put us within our \nreconciliation target, so this puts us well beyond, well under our \nreconciliation target, No. 1.\n  No. 2, the Senator from Florida talks about the potential for an \nunfunded mandate. We have a CBO estimate here that there is no unfunded \nmandate here, including the provision in this bill that the bill does \nnot provide an unfunded mandate. So we have no unfunded mandate with \nthis provision included in the bill, No. 1.\n  No. 2, we lose $18 billion of a $50-some-odd-billion savings in this \nbill with this provision.\n  No. 3, it has been adopted on many occasions, included in both \nparties' bills, and we had a vote on it the last time we were here, and \nit was voted down.\n  I think to suggest that someone is being hoodwinked here or that \nthere is some substantial question as to whether this is a legitimate \nway to reform the system, I do not think is borne out by the history of \nthese provisions. I think these provisions have been tested. These \nprovisions have had broad bipartisan support. I am hopeful tomorrow \nthat broad bipartisan support will continue.\n  Mr. DODD. I will not dwell on this. I do not believe our colleague \nfrom Florida was on the floor when our colleague from New York, and the \nchairman, Senator Domenici, had a chart they raised and talked about \nlegal aliens, the parents of citizens, who under the deeming process--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be able to proceed \nfor 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. As I understood it, those were the parents of citizens who \nwould come in legally, and under the deeming process their children \nassumed, as my colleague from Pennsylvania properly described, the \nfinancial responsibility of those parents coming in. The exchange was \nthat both the Democratic proposal and the underlying bill prohibit that \nkind of situation from persisting. I think we all agree on that.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I suggest to the Senator from Connecticut that with the \namendment of the Senator from Florida, that would not be; it would \nstrike the provisions that eliminate that, that that situation could \ncontinue.\n  Mr. DODD. I understand that part of it. I think we would want to keep \nit. What I understood, this went beyond that, which I am not as \nknowledgeable as our colleague from Florida. In addition to that, you \nhave refugees, asylees and others who would not necessarily fall into \nthe category, or they did not have a sponsor and got here.\n  That is what he is trying to carve out. That is why I suggest staff \nget together. Maybe I misunderstood.\n  I yield to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, to be clear, my argument is that this is a \nredundant and inappropriate piece of legislation to be considering the \nissue of the eligibility of legal aliens for Federal benefits. That is \nexactly what we did in the immigration bill.\n  We spent days on the floor and weeks in the appropriate committee \nconsidering the nuances of that legislation, including its impact on \nthe communities, which would now have to carry the cost that previously \nhad been a partnership between the States, the communities, and the \nFederal Government.\n  I am suggesting what we ought to do is let that process come to \nfruition. The House has passed an immigration bill. The Senate has \npassed the immigration bill. They are in conference. They have been in \nconference since mid-May. Let that forum decide what should be the \nbenefits that the Federal Government would provide for legal aliens. Do \nnot do it in this welfare bill.\n  I think the very fact that we are proposing to reduce those benefits \nby $23 billion, when just a few weeks ago we thought the appropriate \nlevel of reduction was $5.6 billion, ought to raise in our minds \nwhether we really know what we are doing here.\n  The statement that this is not an unfunded mandate, how in the world \nis it not going to be an unfunded mandate when the Federal Government \ndenies coverage to large groups of people and imposes that cost for the \nsick, the elderly, those who require special other assistance, is going \nto end up being a responsibility of States and local governments.\n  If I could use one example, the U.S. Government has entered into an \nagreement with the Cuban Government which sets up a process by which \n20,000 Cubans each year will come into the United States. Most of them, \nwhen they come into the United States, come under the category of \nparolees. Currently, the Federal Government, which is the government \nthat signed this agreement, is responsible for the financial cost of \nthat group of new arrivals if they, for instance, become eligible for \nhealth care because they are indigent and they are in need of health \ncare.\n  This is going to say that, for the first year, that group of people \nwill not be eligible for any Federal assistance. Who is going to pick \nup those costs? Eighty percent plus of those people end up in Dade \nCounty, FL. I can tell you who is going to pick up the cost. Jackson \nMemorial Hospital and the other health care providers in the community \nare going to be paying for the costs, and it will become--in the \nclassic definition of an unfunded mandate--an unfunded mandate to \nrender services to a group of people who the Federal Government has \ndetermined shall enter the community without any Federal financial \nparticipation in paying those costs.\n  We dealt with that issue specifically in the immigration bill, and we \ndid not reach that, I think, quite unjust result. This would reverse a \ndecision that we have previously made.\n  So my argument, Mr. President, is a simple one--not that we should \nnot\n\n[[Page S8148]]\n\nface the issue and try to accomplish some of the objectives the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania strives to do; but we ought to do it in the proper \nform with the proper consideration and with the proper level of respect \nto the communities that are going to be most affected by the ultimate \ndecisions we will make. I believe striking these provisions out of this \nbill, which then turns to the more appropriate forum of the immigration \nconference committee as the means by which we would reach ultimate \njudgment, is the appropriate policy. I hope the Senate will concur when \nwe vote on this issue tomorrow.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would just like to point out that it is, \nof course, the Finance Committee that has jurisdiction over these \nprograms. I point out that the provisions that are contained in the \nlegislation before us were also contained in H.R. 4, as well as the \nBalanced Budget Act of last year. So this legislation has been acted \nupon in the Congress twice.\n  I further point out that the matter was considered in committee, and \non that committee we have a number of members of the Judiciary \nCommittee. On the Republican side, these provisions were supported.\n  So I do not think it can be said that this is a matter that just came \nup in the wee hours of this evening. It has been a matter carefully \nconsidered in committee, as well as on the Senate floor.\n  I also point out that much of these provisions, although not entirely \nin the same form, were included as part of the Democratic substitute.\n  So I think it is important that we bring this into the proper \nperspective. I want to point out that much of the savings that would \ncome about through this legislation are through the changes that are \nbeing made in welfare programs for noncitizens. These people came into \nthe United States on the basis that they would not become a public \ncharge. S. 1956 requires noncitizens to live up to their end of the \nbargain by requiring them to work or depend on the support of their \nsponsors and not rely on the American taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion \nto strike.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4922\n\n(Purpose: To correct provisions relating to quality standards for child \n                                 care)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Reid, and Mr. \n     Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 4922.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the amendment made by section 2807, strike ``3'' and \n     insert ``4''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Snowe, and others.\n  This deals with the child care section of the legislation. Let me \njust very briefly describe the amendment to my colleagues. The \nreconciliation bill reserves 3 percent of the child care funds to \nimprove the quality and availability of child care. Using current law \nprojections, Mr. President, this proposal would represent a reduction \nof approximately $400 million over 6 years for the quality and \nincreased availability of child care, and buildings and accommodations \nfor those children who will need it.\n  This amendment increases the funds reserved for quality from 3 \npercent to 4 percent, reducing the shortfall in funds to about $200 \nmillion over 6 years, about half of what the shortfall would be without \nthis amendment.\n  I point out, Mr. President, that the House has adopted a similar \nprovision of 4 percent, so we would be conforming with this legislation \nto what is already included in the House language.\n  Earlier in the day, Mr. President, I made a case for the importance \nof health and safety standards for our child care settings, and I \npointed out that in recent studies of child care facilities in this \ncountry, only 1 in 7 day care centers received a rating of good quality \ncare, with even fewer programs--8 percent--providing good quality care \nfor infants and toddlers. In the same study, 40 percent of rooms \nserving infants and toddlers provided less than minimum quality care in \nthe country.\n  I do not think I need to make the case here. I think we all agree and \nunderstand the implications of the legislation. There is unanimity here \non the concept of moving adults from welfare to work. We all understand \nthat many of these adults, of course, have children who are going to \nrequire child care of one kind or the other.\n  As I pointed out earlier in the day, of the 13 million people in this \nentire country who receive AFDC, 8.8 million of the 13 million are \nunder the age of 18; 78 percent of the 8.8 million are under the age of \n12; and 46 percent of the 8.8 million are under the age of 6. There are \n4.1 million adults who collect AFDC. So as we take the 2 million \nadults, of the 4 million that this bill requires we put to work over \nthe next 7 years, at least anyway, 78 percent of that 8.8 million, you \ncan argue actually a higher number will require some form of child care \nsetting--a significant amount. We are told the numbers will get larger \nin the coming years.\n  So we want to put adequate quality child care out there. We have made \nthe case that for automobiles and pets we have standards. If you leave \nyour pet someplace, certain standards have to be met. What we are \ntrying to say here is, when it comes to our Nation's children, minimum \nstandards should be met, and there should be some quality control.\n  We leave it to the States, Mr. President, to decide in specificity \nwhat those quality standards ought to be. We do not try to mandate here \nspecific requirements, except in a broader context. So we are not \nviolating the notion that States meet those standards. I point out, by \nthe way, that this is language that we adopted--my colleague from \nDelaware will recall--going back to 1990, under the Bush \nadministration, when Senator Hatch and I authored the Child Care Block \nGrant Program that was supported by the Bush administration and adopted \nhere. We included quality and health and safety standards.\n  Earlier today, with the support of Senator Coats, Senator Kassebaum, \nSenator Snowe, and others, we adopted the health and safety standards \nin the bill. This amendment offered by Senator Snowe and I would raise \nfrom 3 percent to 4 percent an allocation for quality, and I hope that \nmy colleagues will see fit to support this amendment. I think it \nimproves the bill.\n  With that, I would not necessarily ask for a rollcall vote because I \nunderstand that it may be acceptable to the majority. If that is the \ncase, I will not ask, obviously, for a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut that we are willing to agree to his amendment, and \nconsequently a rollcall vote would not be necessary.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I deeply appreciate my colleagues' support \nfor the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The amendment (No. 4922) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there is also an amendment. The Senator from \nNorth Carolina, Senator Faircloth, had an amendment he was going to \npropose, and it has to do with child care and the question of whether \nor not child care workers could be considered in the work sections of \nthis bill. There was some question as to whether or not we would clear \nthat.\n  As I understand it, all the health and safety standards and quality \nwould apply. If my colleague from Delaware would confirm that for me, \nwe would be more than willing to accept that\n\n[[Page S8149]]\n\namendment and move another amendment along.\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes. I do confirm that.\n  Mr. DODD. I would be more than happy to clear that amendment on our \nside. I do not know if the Senator has an amendment and he would like \nto offer it. If he does, we could remove one more amendment. I am sure \nSenator Domenici, who is sound asleep, would be grateful in the morning \nwhen he arrives to find out that we agreed to one more amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Actually, I had three more amendments.\n  Mr. DODD. Do not get carried away.\n  Mr. ROTH. Do you want more?\n  Mr. DODD. No.\n  [Laughter.]\n  Mr. ROTH. We had the two earlier agreements.\n\n\n             Amendments Numbered 4923 through 4925, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Let me start over.\n  Mr. President, I have a unanimous-consent agreement to propound to \ndispose of three amendments which have been agreed to on both sides of \nthe aisle. They include Senator Faircloth's amendment to clarify that a \nwelfare recipient may provide child care services to satisfy the bill's \nwork requirement; two, Senator Coats' amendment allowing welfare \nrecipients to establish individual development accounts; and, third, \nSenator Abraham's amendment modifying the illegitimacy ratio.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to offer these \nthree amendments that I send to the desk, en bloc, that they be \nconsidered and agreed to, en bloc, and that the motions to table and \nthe motions to reconsider be agreed to, en bloc, and that they appear \nin the Record as if considered individually.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I shall not \nobject--the Senator from Delaware is correct. These amendments have \nbeen cleared on this side. We are pleased to have them accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendments by \nnumber.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth] proposes amendments \n     numbered 4923 through 4925, en bloc.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments are agreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 4923, 4924, and 4925, en bloc) were agreed to, \nas follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4923\n\n   (Purpose: To encourage individuals to provide child care services)\n\n       On page 239, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       ``(i) Encouragement To Provide Child Care Services.--An \n     individual participating in a State community service program \n     may be treated as being engaged in work under subsection (c) \n     if such individual provides child care services to other \n     individuals participating in the community service program in \n     the manner, and for the period of time each week, determined \n     appropriate by the State.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4924\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the establishment of individual development \n                               accounts)\n\n       On page 221, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following \n     new subsection:\n       ``(h) Use of Funds for Individual Development Accounts.--\n       ``(1) In general.--A State operating a program funded under \n     this part may use amounts received under a grant under \n     section 403 to carry out a program to fund individual \n     development accounts (as defined in paragraph (2)) \n     established by individuals eligible for assistance under the \n     State program under this part.\n       ``(2) Individual development accounts.--\n       ``(A) Establishment.--Under a State program carried out \n     under paragraph (1), an individual development account may be \n     established by or on behalf of an individual eligible for \n     assistance under the State program operated under this part \n     for the purpose of enabling the individual to accumulate \n     funds for a qualified purpose described in subparagraph (B).\n       ``(B) Qualified purpose.--A qualified purpose described in \n     this subparagraph is 1 or more of the following, as provided \n     by the qualified entity providing assistance to the \n     individual under this subsection:\n       ``(i) Postsecondary educational expenses.--Postsecondary \n     educational expenses paid from an individual development \n     account directly to an eligible educational institution.\n       ``(ii) First-home purchase.--Qualified acquisition costs \n     with respect to a qualified principal residence for a \n     qualified first-time homebuyer, if paid from an individual \n     development account directly to the persons to whom the \n     amounts are due.\n       ``(iii) Business capitalization.--Amounts paid from an \n     individual development account directly to a business \n     capitalization account which is established in a federally \n     insured financial institution and is restricted to use solely \n     for qualified business capitalization expenses.\n       ``(C) Contributions to be from earned income.--An \n     individual may only contribute to an individual development \n     account such amounts as are derived from earned income, as \n     defined in section 911(d)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986.\n       ``(D) Withdrawal of funds.--The Secretary shall establish \n     such regulations as may be necessary to ensure that funds \n     held in an individual development account are not withdrawn \n     except for 1 or more of the qualified purposes described in \n     subparagraph (B).\n       ``(3) Requirements.--\n       ``(A) In general.--An individual development account \n     established under this subsection shall be a trust created or \n     organized in the United States and funded through periodic \n     contributions by the establishing individual and matched \n     by or through a qualified entity for a qualified purpose \n     (as described in paragraph (2)(B).\n       ``(B) Qualified entity.--For purposes of this subsection, \n     the term `qualified entity' means either--\n       ``(i) a not-for-profit organization described in section \n     501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt \n     from taxation under section 501(a) of such Code;

Burke, whose recent, tragic death at the young \nage of 57 has robbed America of one of its leading health care \npolicymakers.\n  Many of us in this body remember Tom Burke for his outstanding work \nat the Department of Health and Human Services. Indeed, I first came to \nknow Tom over a decade ago during the confirmation process for one of \nthe great HHS Secretaries of all time, Dr. Otis Bowen. I quickly came \nto admire Tom's forthright style, which some may have called gruff. But \neveryone respected Tom for his vigor, honesty, and impact.\n  In the early 1980's, Tom served as the staff director of the Advisory \nCouncil on Social Security, chaired by Dr. Bowen. When Dr. Bowen joined \nthe Reagan administration as Secretary of Health and Human Services in \n1985, he made a wise decision and chose Tom Burke as Chief of Staff of \nthe 110,000 employee department. This was a significant honor and great \nresponsibility--and Tom didn't let Dr. Bowen down. He stood as \n``Doc's'' top-most advocate, defender, and protector, until President \nReagan left office.\n  While many remember Tom for the Medicare catastrophic legislation, \nwhich I will discuss in a moment, Tom must be remembered for his many, \nmany other accomplishments at HHS, including initiatives to: Strengthen \npatient-outcomes and medical effectiveness research; launch a public \nawareness campaign against alcohol abuse; propose reforms in the \nmedical liability system; and, undertake managerial changes to elevate \nthe Indian Health Service and rejuvenate the Commissioned Corps of the \nPublic Health Service.\n  Tom Burke worked diligently on behalf of our Nation's seniors in the \narea of catastrophic health insurance. While we know that this \nlegislation proved to be controversial, there is one aspect of this \nissue about which there can be no disagreement: Tom Burke worked hard \nto accomplish what he thought was in the best interest of the American \npublic.\n\n  Indeed, the record must reflect that the original Bowen-Burke \nproposal was a much, much more modest proposal than that which the \nCongress ultimately expanded, approved and repealed. I remember well \nthe initial idea which Tom had such a large hand in bringing to the \nforefront of public debate. It was a small add-on to the amount seniors \npay for Medicare, under $5 a month, in exchange for which seniors would \nhave the peace of mind of knowing they had unlimited hospitalization \ncoverage. Unfortunately, this was not the provision which became law.\n  Tom was widely recognized by his peers for these accomplishments, a \nfact recognized by the special awards he received from Secretary Bowen \nand Surgeon General C. Everett Koop.\n  Tom Burke had a long career in public service. In addition to his \nwork at HHS, Tom was a member of the Green Berets and also became \nDirector of Health Policy Analysis for the Assistant Secretary for \nHealth Affairs at the Department of Defense. These two assignments \nserved him well in his later Government service.\n  Mr. President, after Tom's untimely passing, a number of us who \nworked closely with him wanted to express our admiration of his service \nto the government and of his achievements in health care policy. At \nthis time, I ask unanimous consent that the statements of two of this \nbody's most distinguished health care leaders--now retired--Senator \nDave Durenberger, and Senator George Mitchell, be printed in the Record \nat this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Statement of Senator David Durenberger\n\n       Tom Burke will always be my friend. He represents all that \n     is good in making public policy in Washington D.C. We made a \n     lot of it in the 1980's, especially through the Medicare \n     program. It was Republicans and Democrats, Senate and House.\n       Our most significant effort was Burke-Bowen or Bowen-Burke \n     or whatever. Neither was elected to Congress, but HHS \n     Secretary Otis Bowen and his Chief of Staff, Tom Burke, made \n     us who were in Congress make sense out of Medicare. They \n     insisted we protect every elderly and disabled American from \n     financial catastrophy because of medical, long-term care, \n     drug price or medigap premium expenses. They created a \n     ``Secretary's Task Force'' to iron out all the varied views; \n     they marched it through all the Committees and the finale--a \n     conference committee in the LBJ. Room on the Senate side of \n     the Capitol.\n       I was the most recent Republican chair of the Health Sub-\n     Committee of Finance, just replaced by George Mitchell, so \n     Tom treated me with just enough of the deference due my \n     office. But not so much that I didn't know he believed \n     strongly enough in what we were privileged enough to do for \n     America and that he'd find a way to get it done even if we \n     had some disagreements.\n       America misses the policy that legislation changed. Its \n     repeal has cost billions. And we all miss Tom now that the \n     Lord has repealed his lease on our lives. Our last joint \n     effort--a year ago--was his initiative too. When I retired \n     from the Senate he called and put me to work helping him \n     convince his beloved Indian University that its Otis Bowen \n     Health Policy Center could really impact Washington if it had \n     a presence here. And of course he'd carry on a part of that \n     presence. Doing all the policy reform work that was left \n     undone during his time with Secretary Bowen.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                  Statement of Senator George Mitchell\n\n       Tom was a very devoted public servant who I came to know \n     during the policy debates over Medicare Catastrophes Health \n     Insurance in the late 1980's. Tom believed in the need to \n     help the elderly better cope with the complexities and \n     shortcomings of health insurance. He helped design and \n     promote a Medicare Catastrophic benefit, even when doing so \n     made him unpopular with some members of his political party. \n     He cared deeply for the Medicare program and wanted to \n     improve it for all beneficiaries. Tom fought long and hard \n     for the passage of Medicare Catastrophic, and then renewed \n     his fight during the ultimate repeal of the legislation. He \n     took the defeat particularly hard,\n\n[[Page S8151]]\n\n     but refused to believe that he couldn't continue to serve the \n     public by turning his attention and expertise as an economist \n     to other public policy issues.\n       Tom brought a passion to public service. As Chief-of-Staff \n     under Secretary Otis Bowen, he was fiercely loyal to the \n     programs of the Department of Health and Human Services. Tom \n     devoted each day to finding ways to improve upon the services \n     provided to millions of Americans. He was especially \n     concerned with the Medicaid program, and believed that the \n     application of managed care principles could help the poorest \n     of our society. His style was often gruff and ``take no \n     prisoners,'' but his heart was always focused on the right \n     place. His need to be popular fell second to his belief that \n     through hard work he could make a difference to the people \n     served by government.\n       Seeing the need to get more value from America's escalating \n     health care expenditures, Tom firmly believed in the need for \n     more and better information about what treatments and \n     therapies work. He concurred with visionaries on the need for \n     a significant investment in health services research to bring \n     about more rationale and science-based medical care. He \n     strongly supported my legislation on outcomes research and \n     was a major force to help establish ``effectiveness \n     research'' as a bona fide organizational responsibility of \n     the Department.\n       I am sorry that we have lost such an unusually dedicated \n     and forward thinking public servant. He put politics aside in \n     order to accomplish goals he thought were in the best \n     interest of the public. he was a man of great ideas, the will \n     to make them reality, and a sense of humor that encased a \n     heart dedicated to the American people.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, one of the things I remember fondly about \nTom is that his measure of a man's judgment was often to look up and \nquestion, Is he a long-ball hitter? Judging Tom by his own measure, we \nall must conclude he could hit the home run ball.\n  More important than his many professional achievements, Tom Burke was \na good family man. I want to take this opportunity to offer my \ncondolences to his wife, Sharon; daughters, Rosemary, Heather, and \nKerry; and, son, Brendan. Although the love of a husband and father can \nnever be replaced, with God's help and strength, his family will make \nit through this trying time.\n  It seems to me that far too often in this institution we get so \nengrossed in partisan and policy battles that we forget that ultimately \nit is people that matter. In losing Tom Burke we have lost a good \npublic servant and a good man. We will all miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/18/senate-section/article/S8150-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO THE REVEREND DR. OTIS A. HERRING\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, with the death of the Reverend Dr. Otis A. \nHerring on Friday, July 12, the Wilmington, DE, community--and indeed a \nmuch larger community of family, friends and faith--suffered a loss we \ncan not help mourn.\n  It is the loss of a husband and father, a son and brother, a \ngrandfather and uncle, a nephew and cousin--a man who deeply loved and \nwas deeply loved by his family\n  It is the loss of a inspiring preacher and inspired pastor who \ndevoted 35 years of spiritual leadership of Wilmington's Union Baptist \nChurch and the surrounding community.\n  It is the loss a morally engaged citizen who spoke fearlessly and \nworked tirelessly for the less fortunate among us; the loss of a man \nwho created out of his own determined faith and the conscience of the \ncommunity resources to serve the poor and the disadvantaged.\n  It is the loss of a friend and mentor, whose example made better \npeople and a better community out of all of us.\n  But despite that catalog of loss we feel so keenly, Reverend \nHerring's death is not, in fact, an occasion fit only for grieving.\n  In the first place, if we can ever be sure that any man has attained \nthe spiritual goal that is the promise of the faith many of us share, \nOtis Herring was beyond a doubt just such a man.\n  His memorial service was rightly called a ``Homegoing Celebration,'' \nfor the most important thing about reverend Herring was that he \nbelieved. His whole life was an expression of that belief, and even as \nwe sorrow for our loss, we must celebrate the final victory that he \nnever for one moment doubted.\n  And we celebrate, too, with lasting gratitude, the living legacy of \nOtis Herring, a legacy that endures because he lived his faith with a \nsteadfastness and a power that literally reshaped the community to \nwhich he was so devoted.\n  It is a legacy that lives in Union Baptist Community Services, a \nnonprofit organization that Reverend Herring founded and served for 22 \nyears as executive director, and that counts among its neighborhood-\ndesigned programs a day-care center, anti-drug outreach, crisis \nassistance, mentoring and counseling for at-risk youth and families, \nhousing for the disabled, tutoring and job training, a housing \ncorporation, a neighborhood-improvement program, and a food closet.\n  It is a legacy that lives because Reverend Herring was a leader who \ncalled on us to come together as members of one community, a leader who \nmade us not only see but feel our common bond and common obligation to \none another as citizens and as children of God.\n  Reverend Herring's own exceptional citizenship earned wideranging \nrespect and recognition. In addition to high honors from the State of \nDelaware and the city of Wilmington, he received tributes from numerous \norganizations and institutions, including the University of Delaware \nand Delaware State University, the Delaware Businessmen's Association \nand the Brandywine Professional Association, the News Journal newspaper \nand the Jefferson Awards, the National Conference of Christians and \nJews, the Mental Health Association, the National Urban Coalition, and \nmany fraternal and civic organizations.\n  The record of Otis Herring's achievements and contributions, and the \nlist of awards and tributes recognizing them, is all the more \nextraordinary when we recall that he began to lose his eyesight when he \nwas just a senior in high school, and that he was blind throughout his \nadult life.\n  Otis Herring was, in fact, a magnificent irony among us.\n  He lived in darkness, yet he illuminated the world around him; he was \nblind, yet he saw his way through life with a clarity both humbling and \ninspiring to the rest of us; he lost his sight, but he never lost his \nway, and he never failed to lead us to a higher ground.\n  As an editorial in Delaware's News Journal paper said, accurately and \neloquently, of Reverend Herring, ``His vision of his role in the world \nwas unimpaired.'' And to that I would add only that our vision of our \nrole in the world is brighter, more challenging and more rewarding \nbecause of the way he lived his life among us.\n  In extending our sympathies to Reverend Herring's wife, Carol, to his \nson, Steven, to his mother, brother, sister, grandson, and loving \nextended family, we do indeed share their deep sadness and sense of \nloss.\n  But we also share their sure and certain faith that, long after the \nsadness of his death has passed, Otis Herring's life will stand as a \ntriumph and as a neverending cause for celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/18/senate-section/article/S8151-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8151-S8152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE REALITY BEHIND CANDIDATE BOB DOLE'S VOUCHER PROPOSAL\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Yesterday Candidate Bob Dole claimed to \noffer Americans an ``Education Consumer's Warranty.'' Today, we saw the \nreality behind the claim--a recycled plan called Opportunity \nScholarships that gives opportunity to the few at the expense of the \nmany.\n  Candidate Dole's $2.5 billion plan would pay $500 toward $1,000 \nvouchers for elementary school students and $750 toward $1,500 vouchers \nfor high school students. States would have to match the Federal \nvoucher.\n  Candidate Dole's new-found appreciation of the importance of \neducation comes on the heels of a long and distressing anti-education \nrecord, including opposition to public school choice and grants for \nhigher education.\n  Last year, as majority leader, Senator Dole voted to cut $25 billion \nfrom education programs that help 52 million students learn reading and \nmath skills, that help teachers to teach, and that prevent violence and \ndrug abuse in school. With strong leadership from President Clinton, \nCongress rejected those devastating Republican cuts.\n  Candidate Dole claims that his voucher plan is modeled after the G.I. \nBill of Rights and other Federal programs that help students afford \ncollege. But in Congress, Bob Dole has a 3-decade-long record of \nopposition to Federal college aid. In 1965, as a member of the House of \nRepresentatives, he voted against the creation of the first\n\n[[Page S8152]]\n\nFederal student loan program. Twice in the 1980s, he voted to cut Pell \nGrants, which he now endorses.\n  He claims that under his voucher plan, students will be able to go to \nthe private school of their choice. But private schools can decide \nwhether to accept a child or not. The real choice is made by the \nschools, not parents. The more exclusive the school, the more students \nwill be excluded.\n  Scarce Federal dollars should not go to schools that can exclude \nchildren they do not want. Public schools are already starved for \nfunds. The Dole voucher scheme will inevitably make their plight much \nworse. We do not have to destroy the public schools in order to save \nthem.\n  President Clinton and Democrats support true choice--public school \nchoice--where every child has an equal opportunity to go to the school \nof their choice within the public school system.\n  President Clinton has been and is a leader in the movement for public \nschool choice, which is supported by a vast majority of Americans. In \nthis year's State of the Union Address, President Clinton said, ``I \nchallenge every State to give all parents the right to choose which \npublic school children will attend.''\n  Candidate Dole has it wrong. Education is a national priority that \nrequires public effort and commitment to benefit the entire population, \nnot just the few.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/18/senate-section/article/S8151-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today I rise in opposition to the FY \n1997 Defense Appropriation bill. Once again Senate Republicans have \nsought to include over $10 billion extra dollars on military projects \nnot requested by the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Quite frankly, it is fiscally \nirresponsible to spend more than is needed on wasteful military \nprograms at a time when many domestic programs are being reduced \nsubstantially in order to balance the budget.\n  At the request of the Republican leadership, the Appropriations \nCommittee has authorized $10.1 billion more than was requested. That's \nright. The majority wants to spend $10.1 billion more than the Pentagon \nhas requested, or than they have indicated they will be able to \nresponsibly use, next year. Much of that figure was not even included \nin the Pentagon's 5-year plan, or on so-called wish lists that were \nsolicited by congressional defense committees. The Pentagon has said \nclearly: They don't need these funds now, the projects are not in their \n5-year plan, and they're not even on their wish lists.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that there is waste in the \nPentagon. In fact, about a year ago, the Pentagon's own spending \nwatchdog, its Comptroller General John Hamre, conceded that DOD could \nnot account for over $13 billion in spending. It's just been lost in \nthe ocean of paperwork at the Pentagon, and likely won't ever be sorted \nout. In fact, the Comptroller has all but given up on trying to find \nout what happened to most of the money, arguing it would be more \nexpensive than it would be worth to account for these funds. It is \nparticularly outrageous that the Appropriations Committee has proposed \nthese hefty increases at the same time that the Defense Department is \nbeing called to task for not being able to account for billions of \ndollars in its own spending.\n  Waste, possible fraud in Pentagon spending, certainly egregious \nabuses of basic accounting rules--this is a serious problem, and no one \nseems to be doing very much about it. Indeed, instead of vigorously \noverseeing spending in this budget, we are trying to foist off on the \nPentagon an extra $10.1 billion in military hardware, new weapons \nsystems, planes and ships, and other spending they have not even \nrequested so that certain Senators can protect jobs in their States \nthat depend on continued high levels of defense spending.\n  If we pass this bill, my Minnesota constituents will continue to pay \ntheir taxes to bolster the treasuries of bloated defense contractors, \nwho are building ships and planes and weapons systems that we don't \nneed, and can't use, and that won't make our Nation any more secure. So \nthat there is no mistake, let me repeat that for those who are \nlistening. We are considering today a defense spending bill that spends \na full $10.1 billion more than the President requested in his budget. \nWe are doing this despite the fact that there is no sudden, \nextraordinary threat to justify such an increase. And many of those in \nthis body who are pressing for such a huge increase are precisely the \nsame people who are out here on this floor, day after day, week after \nweek, month after month, howling about how we simply must get the \ndeficit under control.\n  They are doing this while at the same time larding defense bills with \nbillions in spending for their local shipyard, or weapons contractor, \nor plane manufacturer. Have we no shame, Mr. President? Is there no \nsense of limits in this body when it comes to wasteful and unnecessary \nweapons programs? Now, controlling the deficit is important, and I have \nsupported responsible, fairminded deficit reduction proposals totaling \nhundreds of billions of dollars. We heard yesterday that the deficit \nhas dropped from about $290 billion to an estimated $117 billion this \nyear, due largely to the President's fiscal policies. And now we again \nare faced with outrageous overspending on military programs that are \nnot even supported by the Pentagon.\n  For the past couple of years, we've heard from many of our Republican \ncolleagues who have sought to look like they were reducing the Federal \ndeficit through various schemes and non-specific formulas. And even \nwhen they have offered something specific, they tend to first go after \nfunding for education, Medicare and Medicaid; programs for those who \ncannot help themselves; programs which protect our air, lakes and \nrivers, and on and on.\n\n  While I have serious concerns even about some of the President's \nunderlying defense spending assumptions which require, for example, \nfighting two major regional conflicts at one time without help from our \nallies, at least his budget focuses on research and development, \nmaintaining a high level of readiness, and improving the quality of \nlife of our Armed Forces. We can meet our defense needs fully and \nresponsibly. My question is, Why aren't we applying the same standards \nto wasteful military spending that are being applied to domestic \nprograms that millions of average Americans rely on?\n  There are three arguments that I want to make to counter Republican \nassertions that the President's defense request is too low. First, the \nappropriations bill provides more to defense, in dollar terms, than \nlast year. This is in stark contrast to the fact that nondefense \ndiscretionary spending as a whole is frozen or declining precipitously \nin many areas.\n  Second, Republicans are claiming that defense spending in the bill \ndeclines in real terms and as such their budget recommendation is \nactually a cut from last year. Think about that argument--defense \nspending is declining in real terms. Now contrast it with the \nRepublican arguments as they seek to dismantle domestic spending \nprograms. Do they ever seek to portray their domestic cuts in real \nterms? Or do they consistently recite that they are spending the same \nor more in the current year than they did last year. They can't have it \nboth ways. Pick one methodology and stick with it, I say.\n  Third, the administration estimates that due to lower inflation \nestimates over the next few years, we can buy as much for our defense \ndollar as we had planned, but spend about $46 billion less for it than \nwas requested last year. By this calculation, the President's budget \nrequest actually represents a long-term increase over last year's \ndefense program.\n  The bottom line is this: The President's defense budget maintains a \nstrong defense, no matter how the Republicans choose to craft their \nargument. It takes into account all of our\n\n[[Page S8153]]\n\ncurrent and future defense needs, and makes tough choices. Adding \nbillions in additional pork barrel spending is unnecessary, wasteful, \nand wrong.\n  Even if one acknowledges that defense spending has decreased by some \nmeasures since the mid-1980's, and that the administration's request \ncontinues that trend, it must be placed into context. That is, much has \nchanged since the end of the cold war. And our country's priorities \nmust change accordingly--we must maintain a strong defense, but \naccommodate increasing concerns for better education, health care, \ncrime prevention, economy and the environment.\n  Maintain a strong defense, but do it by increasing burden-sharing by \nour allies, imposing cost and accountability controls called for by \nGAO, eliminating unnecessary weapons programs. We must also re-assess \nthe fundamental assumptions which continue to drive continued high \ndefense spending, like the requirement that we be able to fight two \nmajor wars at once, without the help or support of our allies.\n  We already spend vastly more on the military than all our potential \nmajor enemies combined--40 percent of the world's total military \nbudget. Along with our allies, we spend about $510 billion on defense \nof our interests worldwide. All our major potential enemies combined \nspend about $140 billion per year.\n  The billions spent on star wars, the Trident, the B-2 bomber, and the \n600-ship Navy are but a few of the reasons why our deficit rose so \ndramatically during the 1980's. This administration however, has sought \nto maintain a strong defense while addressing critical domestic needs \nand reducing the deficit as well. But while the President has made \ntough choices, the Republicans have refused to stare down military \ncontractors clamoring for even more than the Pentagon has said it \nneeds. If Members are so concerned about a looming procurement problem, \nthen maybe we ought to make some tough decisions about the size of our \nmilitary forces, and their dispersion around the world, and scale back \nhere. Instead, we are bolstering funding on fantastically expensive \nweapons programs, while we underfund key peacekeeping programs and the \ndual-use applications program that will benefit U.S. industry.\n\n  I recognize that there are still real dangers out there for which we \nmust prepare, including nuclear proliferation and terrorism. The need \nto combat weapons proliferation to rogue states poses new problems for \nthe United States, and must be addressed forcefully and directly. But \nwe can do that now. We have the largest and strongest military in the \nworld, and there is nothing in the administration's request that does \nanything to diminish that fact. To the contrary, the administration's \nbudget improves an already strong defense establishment.\n  So why do the Republicans persist in adding to the Pentagon's \nrequest? Do they perceive some previously unidentified emerging threat \nthat the intelligence or national security community has disregarded? \nNo. I think at its worst it is simply their desire to pour billions \nmore dollars into spending for large weapons programs, ships, fighters \nand the like built in the States of defense committee members. At best \nit is a misplaced desire to save jobs. Mr. President, we cannot afford \nthese kinds of pet projects.\n  How should we reduce wasteful military spending? I'll start with what \narguably must be the most difficult problem to attack--the Pentagon \nbureaucracy. Several of my colleagues have recently railed against the \nDepartment of Energy, the Departments of Education, Commerce and \nothers--but I hear a deafening silence on their part when it comes to \nthe Department of Defense, the largest and most wasteful bureaucracy in \nthe world. The same tough accountability standards should be applied to \nall Federal agencies, if we are to root out waste, abuse, and program \nduplication.\n  Let me give a few examples of the size and scope of the defense waste \nwe're talking about. The General Accounting Office, in a 1995 report on \nthe Defense travel process, concluded that the Pentagon could save \nhundreds of millions of dollars in travel processing costs simply by \nfollowing the examples of leading companies. This 1995 study identified \na myriad of travel agents, voucher processing centers, and over 1,300 \npages of regulations. DOD reported $3.5 billion in expenditures for \ntravel and perhaps as much as $1.0 billion more in processing costs. \nClearly, efforts to reform and streamline this process, and bring it \ninto control, is urgently needed.\n  I've already discussed the billions lost due to inadequate Pentagon \naccounting, so I won't rehash that here. But let's take a look at over \n$3.0 billion extra of procurement add-ons that were not even included \nin the Pentagon's 5-year plan. These items include procurement of four \nadditional F-16 fighters for the Air Force at a cost of over $107 \nmillion. These were not even on the Air Force wish list.\n  The Army gets an additional $120 million to purchase 12 more UH-60 \nBlackhawk helicopters than the Pentagon asked for. In true share-the-\nwealth tradition, the Navy receives an astounding $489 million in \nadditional funding for the F/A-18C/D Hornet. The list goes on and on.\n  The additional construction funds provided for the new attack \nsubmarine comes at a time when we're already building the Seawolf, \nafter fierce fights by its opponents over the wisdom of building more \nof these. Why then, are we financing an additional $700 million for \nadvance procurement of the new attack submarine, which is less capable \nthan the Seawolf and only slightly less expensive? To top it off, as \ndirected under the Defense authorization bill, the purchase has \npreempted any pretense of competition between shipyards by directing \nthese submarines be built in both Connecticut and Virginia.\n  At the same time that advance and unnecessary procurement costs are \nadded, the bill seeks to reduce by $150 million funding for the Dual-\nUse Applications Program that supports development of technologies that \ncan be applied to both commercial and defense systems, thereby reducing \nthe cost of defense systems. Full funding of this initiative would have \nmoved the Nation in the right direction as we seek to reduce Government \nspending and reliance on single source industries.\n\n  Make no mistake: the post-cold-war defense budget is becoming less \nand less focused on our real national security needs, and more and more \non the needs of particular members of Congress to sustain jobs in their \nhome States. American taxpayers are paying for costly, obsolete, \nfantastically expensive cold-war-era weapons systems that are no longer \njustifiable, basically to help preserve the political health of certain \nMembers of Congress. That is the sad, unvarnished truth. Many of the \nweapons systems we are still paying for were initiated during the \n1980's defense build-up, and have little or no relation to the changed \nstrategic situation we now face in the post cold-war-era. And yet we \ncontinue to fund them, terrified that scaling this spending back \nmodestly will cost jobs in our States. This, despite the fact that \nunder the authorization bill we accepted a proposal by Senator \nLieberman that calls for a new study to determine the threat as we \nenter the 21st century. This study will go a long way to determining \nthe weapons systems we will need to address the threat. I'll bet many \nof the weapons systems we are providing advanced funding for will be \ndeemed obsolete as the results of the study are released.\n  I believe that at a time when we are slashing budgets for hundreds of \nsocial programs that protect the vulnerable; protect our lakes and \nstreams; provide health care for the vulnerable elderly, and create \nexpanded opportunities for the broad middle class--such as student \nloans and job retraining--it is wrong to provide vastly more military \nspending than the Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff have \nrequested. We have dramatically reduced or frozen funding for many \nother non-defense programs, and yet we're pouring even more dollars \nthan the Department of Defense can use into expensive weapons systems.\n  In defense, as elsewhere in the Federal budget, there are responsible \nways to eliminate wasteful and unnecessary spending; by cutting \nobsolete cold war weapons systems, imposing money-saving reforms within \nthe bureaucracy, and streamlining procurement policy to make the system \nmore efficient and more cost-effective. Over and over, in recent \nmonths, I have offered or cosponsored amendments to address this \nproblem. These attempts have either\n\n[[Page S8154]]\n\nbeen voted down here on the Senate floor, or the bills to accomplish \nthese ends have been bottled up in committee.\n  In the end, there is little Pentagon streamlining, little elimination \nof waste provided for in this bill. Instead, when faced with difficult \nchoices between competing weapons systems, basic housing improvements \nfor our troops, and other readiness requirements, the committee decided \nsimply to appropriate funds to buy all of the big weapons systems, \nships, and planes that $10.1 billion could buy, larding the bill with \nspecial interest funding for defense contractors, and accelerating \npurchases not scheduled to be made for many years, if at all.\n  I believe this bill in its current form spends vastly more on defense \nthan we can afford. The Joint Chiefs and the President agree with me. \nAt a time when we are asked to spend billions less on education, health \ncare, our children and our elderly, I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst these huge and unwarranted increases in defense spending. If it \npasses, as I'm sure it will, I hope the President will veto it, and \nthen require Congress to come to the negotiating table to more fairly \ndistribute the burden of deficit reduction, eliminating defense pork \nwhile preserving our national security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/18/senate-section/article/S8152-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CENTENNIAL OLYMPIC GAMES\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President. I take this opportunity to join my \ncolleagues in recognizing the 1996 Centennial Olympic games to be held \nin Atlanta beginning Friday, July 19, and running through August 4.\n  The modern Olympics have seen a century of athletes from countries \naround the world coming together in the original spirit of the games--\n``international understanding and peace through sports.'' In 1896, \nAthens hosted the first modern Olympics, with 13 nations sending 311 \nathletes. The opening event was the triple jump, which was won by an \nAmerican, James B. Connolly, after he arrived in Greece only 12 hours \nbefore the start. This young athlete led America to win the first title \nat an Olympic games in more than 1,500 years, when the ancient Greeks \nlast awarded Olympic medals in 393 A.D.\n  The 1996 Olympic games is expected to be the largest and most widely \nattended in history. With 197 delegations being represented by almost \n11,000 athletes, this games is 40 percent larger than the 1992 Olympics \nin competitors alone. Over 1,900 medals will be awarded during 271 \nevents in 26 different sports. It is estimated that the between 1991 \nand 1997 the build-up to the games and the event itself will pump over \n$5 billion into the economy.\n  The Olympics hold a special place in my heart, as I was fortunate \nenough to represent our country in the 1964 games as captain of the \nU.S. judo team, a sport offered for the first time that year. Although \nI suffered injuries throughout the course of the games, it was an honor \nto carry the U.S. flag during the games' closing ceremonies. I am \nthrilled to know that my teammate from the 1964 games and fellow \nColoradan, Al Oerter, will be carrying the Olympic flame into the \nstadium during the opening ceremonies in Atlanta. Al is the only \nAmerican ever to win gold medals in four consecutive Olympics in the \ndiscus. He competing in 1956, 1960, 1964, and 1968.\n  There is no question that making a serious commitment to a sport at a \nyoung age gave my life purpose, channeled my energies, and taught me \nself-discipline. I was lucky to have had great coaches and mentors to \nnurture my love of judo and help me achieve my Olympic goals. For all \nof the athletes who strive to heights worthy of Olympic stature, I \ncommend you. I urge all of you to represent our country with dignity \nand respect, and the sportsmanship that has brought you to Atlanta.\n  In particular, I would like to name for the Record the athletes \nrepresenting Colorado. These are a varied group, with unique talents \nand skills. I join with all Coloradans in saying how proud we are of \nyou.\n  Mark Coogan, Boulder, marathon; Anthony Washington, Aurora, discus; \nRich Weiss, Steamboat Springs, slalom men's kayak; Susan DeMattei, \nGunnison, mountain bike; Alison Dunlap, Colorado Springs, women's road \nrace; Juli Furtado, Durango, mountain biking; Jeanne Golay, Glenwood \nSprings, women's road race.\n  Ned Overend, Durango, mountain biking; Elaine Cheris, Denver, women's \nfencing; Rebecca Snyder, Grand Junction, women's air pistol; Eric \nUptagraff, Lake Wood, prone rifle; Amy Van Dyken, Highlands Ranch, 50m, \n100m free, 100m fly, 400m relay in swimming; Laura Coenen, Peyton, team \nhandball; and Mujaahid Maynard, Denver Greco-Roman wrestling.\n  I would also like to offer my sincere congratulations to Mr. Todd \nRiech of Montana. Todd is the only Native American representing the \nUnited States in the 1996 games. After overcoming potentially career-\nthreatening injuries, he won his qualifying event for the javelin. Todd \nis setting an example of perseverance and commitment for all young \nNative Americans to follow. He is already a winner.\n  I wish all the best of these and the other athletes representing us \nat these centennial summer games.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/18/senate-section/article/S8154-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8154-S8155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:38 am., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hayes, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \ninsists upon its amendment to the bill (S. 1316) to reauthorize and \namend title XIV of the Public Health Service Act, commonly known as the \n``Safe Drinking Water Act'', and for other purposes, and asks a \nconference with the Senate on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses \nthereon; and appoints the following Members as the managers of the \nconference on the part of the House:\n\n       Resolved, That the House insist upon its amendment to the \n     bill (S. 1316) entitled ``An Act to authorize and amend title \n     XIV of the Public Health Service Act (commonly known as the \n     ``Safe Drinking Water Act''), and for other purposes,'' and \n     ask a conference with the Senate on the disagreement votes of \n     the two Houses thereon.\n       Ordered, That the following Members be the managers of the \n     conference on the part of the House:\n       From the Committee on Commerce, for consideration of the \n     Senate bill (except for sections 28(a) and 28(e)) and the \n     House amendment (except for title V), and modifications \n     committed to conference: Mr. Bliley, Mr. Bilirakis, Mr. \n     Crapo, Mr. Bilbray, Mr. Dingell, Mr. Waxman, and Mr. Stupak.\n       From the Committee on Commerce, for consideration of \n     sections 28(a) and 28(e) of the Senate bill, and \n     modifications committed to conference: Mr. Bliley, Mr. \n     Bilirakis, and Mr. Dingell.\n       As additional conferees from the Committee on Science, for \n     consideration of that portion of section 3 that adds a new \n     section 1478 and sections 23, 25(f), and 28(f) of the Senate \n     bill, and that portion of section 308 that adds a new section \n     1452(n) and section 402 and title VI of the House amendment, \n     and modifications committed to conference: Mr Walker, Mr. \n     Rohrabacher, and Mr. Roemer.\n       As additional conferees from the Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure, for the consideration of \n     that portion of section 3 that adds a new section 1471(c) and \n     sections 9, 17, 22(d), 25(a), 25(g), 28(a), 28(e), 28(h), and \n     28(i) of the Senate bill, and title V of the House amendment \n     and modifications committed to conference: Mr. Shuster, Mr. \n     Boehlert, Mr. Wamp, Mr. Borski, and Mr. Menendez: Provided, \n     That Mr. Blute is appointed in lieu of Mr. Wamp for \n     consideration of title V of the House amendment.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  At 11:18 am., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3161.

A bill to amend the National Museum of the American Indian \nAct to make improvements in the Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n   The National Museum of the American Indian Act Amendments of 1996\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to amend \nthe National Museum of the American Indian Act of 1989. I am very \npleased to be joined by Senators Inouye, Thomas and Campbell as \noriginal cosponsors of this legislation. I am particularly pleased to \nbe joined by my good friend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, the Vice-\nChairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, who, with his tireless \ndedication, has championed this particular issue for many years. This \nlegislation is intended to amend the National Museum of the American \nIndian Act to ensure that the requirements for the inventory, \nidentification and repatriation of Native American human remains, \nassociated and unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, and \nobjects of cultural patrimony in the possession of the Smithsonian \nInstitution are being carried out in a manner consistent with the \nNative American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. \n3001), so that these culturally important items can be returned to \ntheir rightful keepers and protectors, the Indian tribes.\n  The possession of Native American human remains, funerary objects, \nsacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony by various Federal \nagencies, museums, and private collectors has been a very contentious \nissue for Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Native Hawaiian \nOrganizations for many years. Native Americans, not unlike other \nAmericans, feel that the bones of their ancestors and the objects \nburied with them are sacred and rightfully belong under the protection \nand control of their descendants. Similarly, Native Americans feel \nstrongly that sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony, which \nhave been wrongfully acquired, should be returned to the appropriate \nIndian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization. On the other side of the \ndebate are archeologists, anthropologists, and others from the \nscientific community who feel that there is an overriding principle of \nscientific inquiry to unearth and study the remains of the Indians of \nthe past in order to understand past cultures and their histories. Over \nthe years, this debate has ranged from scholarly discussion to \nimpassioned arguments and finally to emotional demands by Indian people \nfor understanding and respect for their right to have these culturally \nand spiritually important items to be properly returned.\n  It is important to note that the Smithsonian Institution was the \nfirst museum to take the lead in establishing a process for the \nrepatriation of Native American human remains and funerary objects. \nUnder the National Museum of the American Indian Act (20 U.S.C. 80q, et \nseq.), Congress established a process for the inventory, \nidentification, and repatriation of Native American human remains and \nassociated funerary objects. This ground breaking legislation was a \ncritical first step in facilitating thoughtful dialogue between Indian \ntribes and museums regarding the proper treatment of Native American \nhuman remains, funerary objects, sacred objects and objects of cultural \npatrimony. These discussions resulted in the passage of the Native \nAmerican Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. Since the passage of \nthe Act, the Smithsonian Institution has continued to work diligently \nto fulfill the mandates of the National Museum of the American Indian \nAct regarding the repatriation of Native American human remains and \nfunerary objects. In fact, in certain areas the administrative policies \nof the National Museum of the American Indian and the National Museum \nof Natural History exceed the requirements of the National Museum of \nthe American Indian. Since 1991 the Museum of Natural History has \nadopted the categories and repatriation provisions described in Native \nAmerican Graves Protection and Repatriation Act as museum policy. Under \nthat policy, the museum has inventoried a substantial part of its \ncollection of Native American human remains and returned hundreds of \nhuman remains to Native American communities. The National Museum of \nthe American Indian has developed a substantive repatriation policy \nthat goes well beyond the requirements of the Native American Graves \nProtection and Repatriation Act in order to facilitate the \nidentification and repatriation of any Native American human remains \nand objects in its collections. Under its 1991 repatriation policy, the \nNational Museum of the American Indian has prepared and distributed \nboth the summary of ethnographic materials and the inventory of human \nremains and funerary objects within its entire collection to all of the \n557 federally recognized Indian tribes. The Museum's summary goes \nbeyond the requirements of Native American Graves Protection and \nRepatriation Act by not only including sacred objects and objects of \ncultural patrimony but also includes religious and ceremonial objects, \nand objects that are owned in common.\n\n  Under the repatriation provisions of the National Museum of the \nAmerican Indian Act, the Smithsonian Institution is required only to \ninventory and repatriate Native American human remains and associated \nfunerary objects. Although the Native American Graves Protection and \nRepatriation Act does not cover the Smithsonian Institution, the \nSmithsonian has endeavored to meet or exceed each of the requirements \nof the Act. Despite the absence of a statutory obligation to identify \nand repatriate Native American unassociated funerary objects, sacred \nobjects, and objects of cultural patrimony, the Smithsonian Institution \nhas committed to complete its identification and summary of Native \nAmerican unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of \ncultural patrimony by December 31, 1996. Similarly, the Smithsonian has \ncommitted to completing its inventory of Native American human remains \nand associated funerary objects before June 1, 1998.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today would provide the \nstatutory authority to the Smithsonian Institution to complete its \ninventory, identification, and repatriation process for the respectful \nreturn of the tribal ancestors and items of cultural importance to \nNative Americans. This legislation is consistent with the \nadministrative policies of the Smithsonian as it relates to \nrepatriation and it is consistent with the requirements of the Native \nAmerican Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. I would like to \ncommend the tremendous progress made by the Smithsonian Institution in \nimplementing a policy that respects Indian tribes and their deeply-held \nbeliefs by providing for the return of the remains of their ancestors \nand relatives and the culturally significant objects in its possession. \nI would like to add that representatives of the Smithsonian have worked \nclosely with the Committee in the preparation of this legislation and \nhave continued to demonstrate their serious commitment to returning \nthese sacred remains and objects to their rightful owners, the Indian \ntribes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nand the accompanying section by section analysis appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1970\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SUMMARY AND REPATRIATION OF UNASSOCIATED FUNERARY \n            OBJECTS, SACRED OBJECTS, AND CULTURAL PATRIMONY\n\n       This section amends the National Museum of the American \n     Indian Act by establishing a new section 11a. Section 11a \n     requires the Secretary of the Smithsonian to develop a \n     written summary of unassociated funerary objects, sacred \n     objects, and objects of cultural patrimony held by the \n     Smithsonian, based upon available information and consistent \n     with the requirements of the Native American Graves \n     Protection and Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. 3004). The summary \n     must be completed by December 31, 1996.\n       Subsection (b) requires the Smithsonian to expeditiously \n     return any Native American unassociated funerary object, \n     sacred object, or object of cultural patrimony where the \n     cultural affiliation has been established in the summary \n     prepared by the Smithsonian, or where a requesting Indian \n     tribe or Native Hawaiian Organization can show its cultural \n     affiliation with the items by a preponderance of the \n     evidence, and the requesting Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian \n     Organization can establish that the object was owned or \n     controlled by the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian \n     Organization, or by a member of the tribe or organization. \n     The Smithsonian shall expeditiously return any object to any \n     direct lineal descendent of the owner of the object.\n       Subsection (c) sets out the standard of repatriation under \n     the Act. It provides that if a known lineal descendant or an \n     Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization requests the \n     return of Native American unassociated funerary objects, \n     sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony and can make \n     a prima facie showing that the Smithsonian Institution did \n     not have the right of possession of such object, then the \n     Smithsonian must return such object unless it can prove that \n     it has the right of possession of such objects.\n       Subsection (d) provides that any museum of the Smithsonian \n     Institution, which repatriates an item in good faith shall \n     not be liable for any claims of fiduciary duty, public trust, \n     or violations of State law that are inconsistent with the \n     provisions of this Act.\n       Subsection (e) provides that nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to prevent the Secretary of the Smithsonian from \n     making an inventory or preparing a written summary or \n     carrying out the repatriation of objects under this Act in a \n     manner that exceeds the requirements of this section.\n       Subsection (f) defines the term ``Native Hawaiian \n     Organization'' as the term is used in this Act.\n\n\n                    SECTION FIVE. SPECIAL COMMITTEE\n\n       This section amends section 12 of the National Museum of \n     the American Indian Act by increasing the membership of the \n     Special Committee to seven and it shall include two members \n     who are traditional Indian religious leaders.\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my Chairman, \nSenator John McCain, in the introduction of a bill to amend the \nNational Museum of the American Indian Act.\n  The amendments that this bill proposes would fulfill a commitment I \nmade to other museums and scientific institutions at the time the \nCongress was considering the Native American Graves Protection and \nRepatriation Act.\n  At that time, Mr. President, the National Museum of the American \nIndian was newly authorized and was engaged in establishing the \nnecessary administrative structures and policies that would define its \ncharacter as an institution.\n  Amongst the issues to be addressed by the new museum was the \ndevelopment of a repatriation policy, and the\n\n[[Page S8159]]\n\nneed to reconcile that policy with the policies of other museums in the \nSmithsonian Institution.\n  Accordingly, while a general framework addressing repatriation was \nincluded in the National Museum of the American Indian Act that we \nadopted in 1989, the opportunity for the Smithsonian Institution to \ndevelop an institution-wide repatriation policy and the processes \nassociated with the implementation of such a policy was requested, and \nwe provided the time necessary to enable the development of that \ncomprehensive policy.\n  The other museums and scientific institutions that were to be covered \nunder the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act \nobjected in the strongest possible terms to the exclusion of the \nSmithsonian Institution from the act, but ultimately agreed not to \noppose passage of the act based in part upon my personal commitment \nthat the Congress would subsequently enact legislation to assure that \nthe Smithsonian Institution would be subject to Federal repatriation \nlaw.\n  The bill we introduce today is designed, as I have indicated, to \nfulfill that commitment and to assure that the policy objectives of the \nNative American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act are extended to \nthe Smithsonian Institution.\n  As I complete my service as a member of the Board of Trustees of the \nNational Museum of the American Indian this year, I am pleased that my \nChairman has seized the initiative to act upon the discussions in which \nwe have been engaged with the Smithsonian Institution and thereby given \nhis support for carrying out my promise.\n  I am hopeful that our colleagues in the Senate and the House will \nagree to act upon this legislation before the end of the 104th session \nof the Congress, and I thank my Chairman for his leadership.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Inouye and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 1972. A bill to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to improve \nthe provisions relating to Indians, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n          The Older Americans Indian Technical Amendments Act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenators Inouye and Stevens to introduce legislation to make various \ntechnical amendments to the Older Americans Act. This bill provides \ngreater flexibility to the Administration on Aging to assist Indian \ntribes in providing critically needed nutrition services to older \nnative Americans.\n  In most native communities, older native Americans are held in the \nhighest esteem because they serve a vital role in the community as the \nkeepers of culture, language, and tradition. native American elder \npopulations are growing rapidly throughout Indian country, representing \nalmost 9 percent of the total native American population. However, \nolder Native Americans also experience levels of poverty at rates \nsignificantly higher than the national level, ranging from 29 percent \nfor Indian elders aged 60 and older to 38 percent for rural Indian \nelders aged 65 and over. Older native Americans still live under some \nof the most remote and harsh conditions existing in Indian country.\n  In addition to high levels of poverty, native American elders \nexperience comparatively higher levels of immobility and disability \nwith severely limited self-care options. Native American elders often \nlive alone in remote areas with no access to transportation or \ntelephone services. In some cases, the nearest telephone or grocery \nstore is hundreds of miles away. Many older Native Americans who live \nin rural areas have not graduated from high school or have no formal \nschooling. Employment opportunities for older native Americans are \nextremely limited due to the remoteness of Indian communities and the \nlack of formal education.\n  The community-based services provided to native American elders \nthrough the Older Americans Act are of great benefit to many Indian \ncommunities. Through the act, many older Native Americans can earn \nincomes by serving their tribal communities through the senior \nemployment programs. The act also authorizes grants to Indian tribes \nand tribal organizations through title VI to administer important \nnutritional programs in remote areas such as those serving Alaska \nNative communities and rural areas on the Navajo Reservation in my home \nState of Arizona.\n  However, these programs can be strengthened to ensure that Indian \ntribes are able to tailor nutritional and supportive programs that are \nappropriate to the cultural and geographic characteristics of their \ncommunities. Often, employment and nutrition programs are difficult to \nadminister in Indian country because of the remoteness of the service \narea for Indian populations and the unique character of Indian \ncultures. The legislation I am proposing will ensure that Indian tribes \nand tribal organizations serving Native American elders will be \nafforded maximum flexibility in administering employment and nutrition \nprograms to provide critically needed services at the reservation \nlevel.\n\n  The bill modifies the definition of ``reservation'' to clarify that \nIndian tribes in Oklahoma and California, as well as Alaska Native \ncommunities, will maintain their eligibility to administer programs \nunder the act. Indian reservations and Alaska Native communities suffer \nfrom the highest unemployment rates in the United States and endure the \nlowest incomes of all Americans. The application of this requirement \nonly serves to frustrate the efforts of older Native Americans to work \nin their own communities.\n  The bill will also modify the requirement for certification by the \nBureau of Indian Affairs [BIA] in Section 3057e(b) to provide more \nflexibility to the administration and to tribal applicants by allowing \nthe BIA to certify population statistics for tribal grant applications \nthrough a written approval letter. This change is necessary to clarify \nthat the current procedure of obtaining written approval from the BIA \nis sufficient for tribal applicants to receive a grant award.\n  Finally, the act will simplify certain requirements that impose \nunreasonable and overly burdensome application and reporting \nrequirements for tribal applicants. The bill authorizes the Assistant \nSecretary for Aging to take into consideration the special \ncircumstances facing geographically isolated and small communities that \ndo not have the infrastructure or resources to meet strict and onerous \napplication and reporting requirements. Instead of providing much \nneeded services for small and rural Indian communities, tribal grant \nrecipients often find themselves preoccupied with complying with \nvoluminous paperwork requirements.\n  Mr. President, the Older Americans Act provides critically needed \nhuman and social services to older Native Americans on a daily basis. \nThe bill we are introducing today will simply ensure that older Native \nAmericans will continue to receive the assistance they need to stay in \ntheir own homes and communities, and continue to fulfill their vital \nrole as the keepers of culture, language and tradition.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this bill and the \nsection-by-section summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1972\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the settlement of the Navajo-Hopi land \ndispute, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n          The Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to ratify the \nsettlement of four claims of the Hopi Tribe against the United States \nand to provide the necessary authority to the Hopi Tribe to issue 75-\nyear lease agreements to Navajo families residing on the Hopi \nPartitioned Land. This legislation will ratify the settlement and \naccommodation agreements between the Department of Justice, the Hopi \nTribe, the Navajo Nation, and the Navajo families residing on the Hopi \nPartitioned Lands.\n  This settlement marks an important first step in bringing this \nlongstanding dispute between the Hopi Tribe, the Navajo Nation, and the \nUnited States to an orderly and peaceful conclusion. These agreements \nare the product of many years of negotiation under the auspices of the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals mediation process. While I understand \nthat there are factions in both the Hopi Tribe and the Navajo Nation \nwho have voiced their opposition to this proposal, I believe that these \nagreements represent the only realistic way to settle the claims of the \nHopi Tribe against the United States and to provide an accommodation \nfor the hundreds of Navajos residing on Hopi Partitioned Lands.\n  I believe it is imperative that the Congress take steps to bring this \nlongstanding dispute to a final resolution. It has been over 22 years \nsince the Navajo-Hopi Settlement Act was passed to settle the disputes \nbetween the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe. Since that time, the \nFederal Government has spent over $350 million to fund the Navajo-Hopi \nRelocation Program. The funding for this settlement has exceeded the \noriginal cost estimates by more than 900 percent. And yet, there are \nover 130 appeals still pending, which raises a great deal of \nuncertainty regarding who is and is not eligible for relocation \nbenefits under the act. I am convinced that future Federal budgetary \npressures will require that the Navajo-Hopi Relocation Housing Program \nbe brought to an orderly and certain conclusion. In light of the \ncurrent atmosphere in Congress, it is highly unlikely that the Federal \nGovernment will continue to provide benefits through the Office of \nNavajo and Hopi Indian Relocation much longer. In order to bring this \nprocess to an orderly conclusion, I will introduce separate legislation \nin the near future that will provide for an orderly phase out of the \nNavajo-Hopi Relocation Housing Program in 5 years. As an important \nfirst step, it is critical that the Congress pass legislation to settle \nthe outstanding claims of the Hopi Tribe against the United States.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will provide a resolution to \nthese outstanding claims while allowing those Navajo families who are \ninclined to remain on Hopi Partitioned Land the opportunity to do so \nfor 75 years under an accommodation agreement with the Hopi Tribe. The \nsettlement agreement provides that those eligible Navajo families \nwishing to receive relocation benefits will have a time certain in \nwhich to apply for and receive their benefits. The Agreement also \nrecognizes the Hopi Tribe's right to exercise jurisdiction over the \nHopi Partitioned Lands where Navajo families are residing.\n\n  The settlement agreement settles four claims by the Hopi Tribe \nagainst the United States. The first claim settled by the agreement is \nHopi Tribe versus Navajo Tribe, et al., pending in the U.S. District \nCourt in Phoenix, which is a claim for damages due to the failure of \nthe Federal Government to make timely rental value determinations \nrequired under 25 U.S.C. 640d-15(a).\n  The second claim settled by this agreement is Secakuku versus Hale, \net al., pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, \nwhich is a claim for damages against the United States for post-\npartition damages to the Hopi partitioned lands caused by overgrazing \nbefore the lands were partitioned.\n  The third claim settled by this agreement is Hopi Tribe v. United \nStates, pending in the United States Court of Federal Appeals, which is \na claim for damages for the failure of the Federal Government to \ncollect livestock trespass penalties, forage consumed fees, and \nproperty damages fees on behalf of the Hopi Tribe.\n  The last claim settled by the agreement is a claim against the United \nStates for the failure of the Federal Government to give the Hopi Tribe \nquiet possession of the Hopi lands that are used and occupied by Navajo \nfamilies.\n  In exchange for waiving these claims against the United States and \nfor providing an accommodation agreement for the Navajo families \nresiding on the\n\n[[Page S8161]]\n\nHopi Partitioned Lands, the United States will pay the Hopi Tribe $50.2 \nmillion under a structured settlement which is keyed to the performance \nof certain activities under the settlement agreement.\n  The settlement agreement provides that funds shall be paid out in the \nfollowing manner: First, the Hopi Tribe will receive $2.4 million once \nthe tribe files a motion to dismiss its appeal in the Ninth Circuit in \nSecakuku versus Hale; second the Hopi Tribe will receive $22.7 million \nonce legislation extending the tribe's leasing authority to 75 years \nhas been enacted and once the tribe's claims in the Court of Claims for \ndamages due to any Federal action which occurred before 1982 are \ndismissed; third, the Hopi Tribe will receive $10 million once 65 \npercent of the Navajo families residing on the Hopi reservation have \nsigned the accommodation agreement or request to be relocated and once \nthe Hopi Tribe's claims in the Court of Claims for livestock trespass \ndamages against the United States from 1983 through 1988 are dismissed; \nfourth the Hopi Tribe will receive $15.1 million once 75 percent of the \nNavajo families residing on the Hopi reservation have signed the \naccommodation agreements or request to be relocated and once the Hopi \nTribe's claims in the Court of Federal Appeals for livestock trespass \ndamages against the United States from 1989 through and including 1996 \nare dismissed.\n  This settlement has the support of the Navajo Nation, Hopi Tribe, the \nDepartments of Justice and Interior, and the State of Arizona. The \naccommodation agreement for the Navajo families was negotiated and \napproved by representatives of the Navajo families residing on the Hopi \nPartitioned Land. While I understand that this legislation ratifying \nthe settlement agreement does not completely resolve the disputes \nbetween the Navajo and Hopi Tribes, I believe the agreement represents \nsignificant progress toward an overall settlement of these highly \ncontentious and longstanding claims between the two tribes.\n  Finally, I would like to congratulate all the parties for their \ndedication and hard work in crafting these historic agreements. I am \npleased to note that the parties have been sensitive to the concerns of \nlocal government in negotiating this settlement agreement, which enjoys \nthe support of the Governor of the State of Arizona.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text ofthe bill \nand the accompanying section by section analysis appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1973\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

STATEMENTS OF NATIONAL POLICY CONCERNING WELFARE \n                   AND IMMIGRATION.\n\n       The Congress makes the following statements concerning \n     national policy with respect to welfare and immigration:\n       (1) Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United \n     States immigration law since this country's earliest \n     immigration statutes.\n       (2) It continues to be the immigration policy of the United \n     States that--\n       (A) aliens within the nation's borders not depend on public \n     resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own \n     capabilities and the resources of their families, their \n     sponsors, and private organizations, and\n       (B) the availability of public benefits not constitute an \n     incentive for immigration to the United States.\n       (3) Despite the principle of self-sufficiency, aliens have \n     been applying for and receiving public benefits from Federal, \n     State, and local governments at increasing rates.\n       (4) Current eligibility rules for public assistance and \n     unenforceable financial support agreements have proved wholly \n     incapable of ensuring that individual aliens not burden the \n     public benefits system.\n       (5) It is a compelling government interest to enact new \n     rules for eligibility and sponsorship agreements in order to \n     ensure that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with \n     national immigration policy.\n       (6) It is a compelling government interest to remove the \n     incentive for illegal immigration provided by the \n     availability of public benefits.\n       (7) With respect to the State authority to make \n     determinations concerning the eligibility of qualified aliens \n     for public benefits in this title, a State that chooses to \n     follow the Federal classification in determining the \n     eligibility of such aliens for public assistance shall be \n     considered to have chosen the least restrictive means \n     available for achieving the compelling governmental interest \n     of ensuring that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with \n     national immigration policy.\n              Subtitle A--Eligibility for Federal Benefits\n\n     SEC. 701.

The hearing revealed numerous \nissues affecting all segments of the liner ocean shipping industry that \nrequired further consideration.\n  Today, I am submitting an amendment (No. 4904) to S. 1356. By so \ndoing, I am putting out for public comment a proposed refined version \nof the bill which would institute comprehensive reforms in how the \nFederal Government regulates the liner trade in the foreign commerce of \nthe United States. This amendment addresses the concerns raised in the \nNovember hearing.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Gorton, Lott, Hutchison, \nInouye, Exon, and Breaux as cosponsors in this amendment. This \nbipartisan approach demonstrates just how serious we are about \nachieving meaningful reform.\n  The House has passed its version of ocean shipping reform \nlegislation. The Senate does not have much time left in this Congress \nto make its mark on this issue. I intend to hold a hearing on this \nlegislation in the near future. With the support of my fellow Commerce \nCommittee members and other Senators, we can pass ocean shipping reform \nlegislation this year.\n  Mr. President, 95 percent of U.S. foreign commerce is transported via \nocean shipping. Approximately half of this amount is shipped in bulk \nform, e.g., oil, grain, chemicals, etc., on an unregulated vessel \ncharter basis. The remainder is shipped by container on liner vessels--\nregularly scheduled service--under the Shipping Act of 1984, as \nregulated by the Federal Maritime Commission [FMC]. As the \ninternational liner shipping trade has evolved since 1984, many \nindustry segments have requested changes in the Shipping Act of 1984 to \nkeep pace with this evolution.\n  My amendment, the International Ocean Shipping Act of 1996, would \nimprove the Shipping Act of 1984 in several key areas.\n\n[[Page S8226]]\n\n  First, it would eliminate the filing of common carrier tariffs with \nthe Federal Government. Instead of requiring Government approval, \ntariffs would become effective upon publication through private \nsystems. My amendment also would increase tariff rate flexibility by \neasing restrictions on tariff rate changes and independent action by \nconference carriers.\n  Second, it would allow for greater flexibility in service contracting \nby shippers and ocean common carriers. The amendment would allow \nindividual ocean common carriers and shippers to negotiate confidential \nservice contracts. It also would allow shippers' associations and ocean \nfreight forwarders to negotiate service contracts as shippers.\n  Third, responsibility for enforcing U.S. ocean shipping laws would be \nshifted to the Surface Transportation Board, which would be renamed the \nIntermodal Transportation Board. The Federal Maritime Commission would \nbe terminated at the end of fiscal year 1997. A single independent \nagency would then administer domestic surface, rail, and water \ntransportation and international ocean transportation regulations. The \nGovernment would catch up to the carriers and shippers, who are already \nthinking intermodally.\n  Finally, the Intermodal Transportation Board would be given new tools \nto address predatory pricing ocean common carriers while ensuring \nincreased competition in the industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/18/senate-section/article/S8222-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, WORK OPPORTUNITY, AND MEDICAID \n                       RESTRUCTURING ACT OF 1996\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      FAIRCLOTH AMENDMENT NO. 4905\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1956, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 399, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n                     Subchapter F--Other Provisions\n\n     SEC. 2241.

FINDINGS.\n\n         The Congress makes the following findings:\n         (1) Marriage is the foundation of a successful society.\n         (2) Marriage is an essential institution of a successful \n     society which promotes the interests of children.\n         (3) Promotion of responsible fatherhood and motherhood is \n     integral to successful child rearing and the well-being of \n     children.\n         (4) In 1992, only 54 percent of single-parent families \n     with children had a child support order established and, of \n     that 54 percent, only about one-half received the full amount \n     due. Of the cases enforced through the public child support \n     enforcement system, only 18 percent of the caseload has a \n     collection.\n         (5) The number of individuals receiving aid to families \n     with dependent children (in this section referred to as \n     ``AFDC'') has more than tripled since 1965. More than two-\n     thirds of these recipients are children. Eighty-nine percent \n     of children receiving AFDC benefits now live in homes in \n     which no father is present.\n         (A)(i) The average monthly number of children receiving \n     AFDC benefits--\n         (I) was 3,300,000 in 1965;\n         (II) was 6,200,000 in 1970;\n         (III) was 7,400,000 in 1980; and\n         (IV) was 9,300,000 in 1992.\n         (ii) While the number of children receiving AFDC benefits \n     increased nearly threefold between 1965 and 1992, the total \n     number of children in the United States aged 0 to 18 has \n     declined by 5.5 percent.\n         (B) The Department of Health and Human Services has \n     estimated that 12,000,000 children will receive AFDC benefits \n     within 10 years.\n         (C) The increase in the number of children receiving \n     public assistance is closely related to the increase in \n     births to unmarried women. Between 1970 and 1991, the \n     percentage of live births to unmarried women increased nearly \n     threefold, from 10.7 percent to 29.5 percent.\n         (6) The increase of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and births \n     is well documented as follows:\n         (A) It is estimated that the rate of nonmarital teen \n     pregnancy rose 23 percent from 54 pregnancies per 1,000 \n     unmarried teenagers in 1976 to 66.7 pregnancies in 1991. The \n     overall rate of nonmarital pregnancy rose 14 percent from \n     90.8 pregnancies per 1,000 unmarried women in 1980 to 103 in \n     both 1991 and 1992. In contrast, the overall pregnancy rate \n     for married couples decreased 7.3 percent between 1980 and \n     1991, from 126.9 pregnancies per 1,000 married women in 1980 \n     to 117.6 pregnancies in 1991.\n         (B) The total of all out-of-wedlock births between 1970 \n     and 1991 has risen from 10.7 percent to 29.5 percent and if \n     the current trend continues, 50 percent of all births by the \n     year 2015 will be out-of-wedlock.\n         (7) The negative consequences of an out-of-wedlock birth \n     on the mother, the child, the family, and society are well \n     documented as follows:\n         (A) Young women 17 and under who give birth outside of \n     marriage are more likely to go on public assistance and to \n     spend more years on welfare once enrolled. These combined \n     effects of ``younger and longer'' increase total AFDC costs \n     per household by 25 percent to 30 percent for 17-year olds.\n         (B) Children born out-of-wedlock have a substantially \n     higher risk of being born at a very low or moderately low \n     birth weight.\n         (C) Children born out-of-wedlock are more likely to \n     experience low verbal cognitive attainment, as well as more \n     child abuse, and neglect.\n         (D) Children born out-of-wedlock were more likely to have \n     lower cognitive scores, lower educational aspirations, and a \n     greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves.\n         (E) Being born out-of-wedlock significantly reduces the \n     chances of the child growing up to have an intact marriage.\n         (F) Children born out-of-wedlock are 3 times more likely \n     to be on welfare when they grow up.\n         (8) Currently 35 percent of children in single-parent \n     homes were born out-of-wedlock, nearly the same percentage as \n     that of children in single-parent homes whose parents are \n     divorced (37 percent). While many parents find themselves, \n     through divorce or tragic circumstances beyond their control, \n     facing the difficult task of raising children alone, \n     nevertheless, the negative consequences of raising children \n     in single-parent homes are well documented as follows:\n         (A) Only 9 percent of married-couple families with \n     children under 18 years of age have income below the national \n     poverty level. In contrast, 46 percent of female-headed \n     households with children under 18 years of age are below the \n     national poverty level.\n         (B) Among single-parent families, nearly \\1/2\\ of the \n     mothers who never married received AFDC while only \\1/5\\ of \n     divorced mothers received AFDC.\n         (C) Children born into families receiving welfare \n     assistance are 3 times more likely to be on welfare when they \n     reach adulthood than children not born into families \n     receiving welfare.\n         (D) Mothers under 20 years of age are at the greatest \n     risk of bearing low-birth-weight babies.\n         (E) The younger the single parent mother, the less likely \n     she is to finish high school.\n         (F) Young women who have children before finishing high \n     school are more likely to receive welfare assistance for a \n     longer period of time.\n         (G) Between 1985 and 1990, the public cost of births to \n     teenage mothers under the aid to families with dependent \n     children program, the food stamp program, and the medicaid \n     program has been estimated at $120,000,000,000.\n         (H) The absence of a father in the life of a child has a \n     negative effect on school performance and peer adjustment.\n         (I) Children of teenage single parents have lower \n     cognitive scores, lower educational aspirations, and a \n     greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves.\n         (J) Children of single-parent homes are 3 times more \n     likely to fail and repeat a year in grade school than are \n     children from intact 2-parent families.\n         (K) Children from single-parent homes are almost 4 times \n     more likely to be expelled or suspended from school.\n\n[[Page S8230]]\n\n         (L) Neighborhoods with larger percentages of youth aged \n     12 through 20 and areas with higher percentages of single-\n     parent households have higher rates of violent crime.\n         (M) Of those youth held for criminal offenses within the \n     State juvenile justice system, only 29.8 percent lived \n     primarily in a home with both parents. In contrast to these \n     incarcerated youth, 73.9 percent of the 62,800,000 children \n     in the Nation's resident population were living with both \n     parents.\n         (9) Therefore, in light of this demonstration of the \n     crisis in our Nation, it is the sense of the Congress that \n     prevention of out-of-wedlock pregnancy and reduction in out-\n     of-wedlock birth are very important Government interests and \n     the policy contained in part A of title IV of the Social \n     Security Act (as amended by section 103 of this Act) is \n     intended to address the crisis.\n\n     SEC. 102. REFERENCE TO SOCIAL SECURITY ACT.\n\n         Except as otherwise specifically provided, wherever in \n     this title an amendment is expressed in terms of an amendment \n     to or repeal of a section or other provision, the reference \n     shall be considered to be made to that section or other \n     provision of the Social Security Act.\n\n     SEC. 103. BLOCK GRANTS TO STATES.\n\n         Part A of title IV (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n\n  ``PART A--BLOCK GRANTS TO STATES FOR TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY \n                                FAMILIES\n\n     ``SEC. 401.

STATEMENTS OF NATIONAL POLICY CONCERNING WELFARE \n                   AND IMMIGRATION.\n\n       The Congress makes the following statements concerning \n     national policy with respect to welfare and immigration:\n       (1) Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United \n     States immigration law since this country's earliest \n     immigration statutes.\n       (2) It continues to be the immigration policy of the United \n     States that--\n       (A) aliens within the nation's borders not depend on public \n     resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own \n     capabilities and the resources of their families, their \n     sponsors, and private organizations, and\n       (B) the availability of public benefits not constitute an \n     incentive for immigration to the United States.\n       (3) Despite the principle of self-sufficiency, aliens have \n     been applying for and receiving public benefits from Federal, \n     State, and local governments at increasing rates.\n       (4) Current eligibility rules for public assistance and \n     unenforceable financial support agreements have proved wholly \n     incapable of assuring that individual aliens not burden the \n     public benefits system.\n       (5) It is a compelling government interest to enact new \n     rules for eligibility and sponsorship agreements in order to \n     assure that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with \n     national immigration policy.\n       (6) It is a compelling government interest to remove the \n     incentive for illegal immigration provided by the \n     availability of public benefits.\n       (7) With respect to the State authority to make \n     determinations concerning the eligibility of qualified aliens \n     for public benefits in this title, a State that chooses to \n     follow the Federal classification in determining the \n     eligibility of such aliens for public assistance shall be \n     considered to have chosen the least restrictive means \n     available for achieving the compelling governmental interest \n     of assuring that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with \n     national immigration policy.\n              Subtitle A--Eligibility for Federal Benefits\n\n     SEC. 401.

Mr. President, yesterday the Senate approved S. \n704, a bill to create a National Gambling Impact Study Commission. I \nstrongly support this bill.\n  Legalized gambling of all kinds, casino gambling as well as State \nlotteries has often been touched as a way for States and localities to \nmake money for various good causes. In my own State of North Carolina, \nsupport for a State lottery has always been offered as a means of \nsupplementing the State education budget.\n  The North Carolina General Assembly has so far defeated several \nattempts to establish a State lottery.\n  Lotteries in particular, are held up as a means of filling State \ncoffers, a way of financing Government projects, not as a boon to \nindividual citizens. Mr. President, I for one am somewhat skeptical of \nany project which seeks to grow Government, for whatever purpose. \nGovernment--at the State, local, and Federal level--has been growing by \nleaps and bounds in recent years, reaching into areas of our lives it \nwas never intended for. The ever-increasing burden of taxes and \nregulation has placed tremendous strain on families and small \nbusinesses. It seems to me we need to concentrate on restraining \ngovernment, not expanding it.\n  It is becoming increasingly evident that gambling may not be the \neconomic boon it is held out to be. The North Carolina Department of \nCommerce commissioned a study of the potential economic and social \nimpact of gambling in western North Carolina. The study's conclusions \nwere dramatic: Casino gambling would likely create more problems than \nit solved for western North Carolina. Among them, congested roads, \nrising crime rates and the crowding out of traditional tourist business \nand the families who patronize them.\n  In addition, the human toll of gambling is just beginning to be \nassessed adequately. Compulsive gambling can lead to alcoholism, \nbankruptcy, and can lead to the destruction of individuals and \nfamilies.\n  If legalized gambling is the great economic boon its supporters make \nit out to be, they should not fear the results of this study. If it is \nnot, it deserves a closer look.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/18/senate-section/article/S8298-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8298-S8299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FISCAL YEAR 1997 LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss briefly the fiscal year \n1997 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act. This afternoon, the \nCommittee on Appropriations reported the bill unanimously, and I expect \nit to reach the floor prior to the August recess.\n  Mr. President, I would like to commend the chairman, Senator Mack, \nfor putting together a solid bill. His leadership on legislative branch \nissues has been terrific, and I have been excited to work with him on a \nbipartisan basis to manage the operations of Congress in a responsive--\nand responsible--way. He was bold last year, and it paid off. We have \nbeen able to reduce our spending by over $200 million--about 10 \npercent--in the past year.\n  This year, we continue the effort to streamline by reducing our \ninternal budget by nearly $20 million in fiscal year 1997. We have \ntaken testimony from legislative branch agencies affirming that they, \nunder the funding levels in the bill, can maintain a high level of \nquality services to Members. Senators in turn should be able to provide \nresponsive, high quality service to their constituents.\n  I would like to highlight one provision in the bill for Members of \nthe Senate. With the enthusiastic support of Chairman Mack, I have \nincluded language that will enable the Sergeant at Arms to transfer \nexcess or surplus computer equipment to schools.\n  In the past, the Senate sold its computers to employees at bargain \nprices. Fortunately, this practice has been terminated, and I commend \nthe Sergeant at Arms for doing so. For the past couple years, our \ncomputers have simply been transferred to GSA for disposal through the \nnormal surplus process.\n  I think Senators should be aware that the Senate disposes of over \n1,500\n\n[[Page S8299]]\n\ncomputers every year. Over the past 3 years, nearly 5,000 computers \nhave been let go. For the most part, these are IBM-compatible, 386, 16-\nmegahertz machines. They are a generation old, but they could be very \nuseful to schools, especially in rural areas, that may not have a big \nbudget to buy fancy new computers.\n  I am fortunate to represent Washington State, which is very \naggressive in trying to put computers in the classroom. Our companies \nhave been generous in donating software and hardware, and people are \nexcited about giving kids skills that will help them get an edge in \nlife.\n  But not every school district is moving aggressively on computers. \nMany don't even know how to go about it, and cannot afford it. I am \ncertain that every Senator is aware of how fast technology is evolving \nin our economy. I really believe that, in the future, a child's ability \nto compete in the work force will be measured in part by his or her \nfamiliarity with computers. In my view, the earlier they start, the \nbetter.\n  The Senate will debate the broad role of Government in education \ntechnology, and I look forward to having that debate. For now there is \na small, and I think constructive, role for the Senate to play. We can \nuse the bully pulpit. We can lead by example. We can help children by \ngiving our computers to schools that want or need them. By doing this, \nwe can help some kids, and we can show the country we think bringing \ntechnology to the classroom is a high priority.\n  Here is how it will work: the Sergeant at Arms will make sure that \nany excess or surplus computers are in good working order. Then he will \nmake them available to interested schools at the lowest possible cost \nto both the Senate and the schools. Most likely, he will transfer these \ncomputers to the General Services Administration. GSA, in turn, will \nprovide information to schools through its regional offices about \navailable inventory. The equipment eligible for transfer will include \ncomputers, keyboards, monitors, printers, modems, and other peripheral \nhardware as described in the bill.\n  I envision schools being able to obtain this equipment on a first-\ncome, first-served basis, for the cost of shipping and handling from \nGSA regional offices. The language provides the Sergeant at Arms with \nflexibility to determine the best way to complete the transfers.\n  Earlier this year, President Clinton issued an executive order \nstating that the GSA should document surplus computers in Federal \nagencies. And in May, I offered a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nexpressing the view that the Senate should also inventory its computers \nand create a process of getting Government computers into schools and \nother educational organizations. The language in the bill before us \nsets out a specific process so the Senate can play a role in this \nimportant effort.\n  Mr. President, I think this is a useful change in policy. I am \ngrateful the committee has acted today in a manner consistent with my \namendment as adopted last May. And, I welcome the support of Senator \nLeahy, who has taken an active and enthusiastic interest in this issue. \nHe has been a big help. Again, I appreciate the help of Chairman Mack \non this, and I look forward to working with him and the Sergeant at \nArms to make this work.\n Mr. LEAHY. I rise in strong support of Senator Murray's \nlanguage in the legislative appropriations bill. This language would \nrequire the Senate to streamline the transfer of excess and surplus \ncomputer equipment to our Nation's classrooms. It would require the \nSenate to follow the same guidelines that the Federal agencies must \nfollow in accordance with the President's Federal Executive Order.\n  President Clinton has set forth an ambitious goal to bring computers \nto every school in America. Congress should lead the way. Thanks to \nSenator Murray's efforts, the Senate will be participating in this \ninitiative.\n  Recently, I wrote several letters to the Sergeant at Arms to find out \nwhat our official Senate policy is concerning disposal of excess \nsurplus computer equipment. I was surprised to hear that the Senate \ndoes not have an official policy. In the past the Senate has sold \nexcess computer equipment or transferred it over to GSA for later sale. \nSince 1993, the Senate disposed of 4,400 pieces of computer equipment. \nOf that total 2,600 have been sold, 1,400 have been transferred to GSA, \nand 400 have been retained for parts. These computers would have been a \nwonderful resource to our Nation's schools.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join our efforts in creating a \npartnership with our nation's schools and bring computers to every \nclassroom in America so that all students may have the benefits of our \nnew educational technology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/18/senate-section/article/S8298-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8299-S8301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CBO ESTIMATE ON S. 1730, THE OIL SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE \n                            IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record \nsupplemental budgetary estimates on Calendar Number 466, S. 1730, the \nOil Spill Prevention and Response Improvement Act of 1996. Section 403 \nof the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act requires that a \nstatement of the cost of a reported bill be included in the report. \nWhen the Committee on Environment and Public Works filed the report to \nS. 1730 on June 26, 1996, we included only a portion of the estimated \nimpact of the bill. CBO had not completed the estimated impact at the \ntime of filing. I am pleased to report that the cost statements to be \nincluded in today's Record complete the CBO estimate for S. 1730.\n  The estimates follow:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 17, 1996.\n     Hon. John H. Chafee,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed mandate cost statements for S. 1730, \n     the Oil Spill Prevention and Response Improvement Act, as \n     reported by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works on June 26, 1996. CBO transmitted its estimate of the \n     impact of S. 1730 on the federal budget on June 26, 1996.\n       Enactment of S. 1730 would impose both intergovernmental \n     and private-sector mandates as defined by the Unfunded \n     Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4). The costs of \n     the mandates would not exceed the respective $50 million and \n     $100 million annual thresholds.\n       If you wish further details on these estimates, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James L. Blum\n                                            (For June E. O'Neill).\n\n    Congressional Budget Office Estimated Cost of Intergovernmental \n                        Mandates, July 17, 1996\n\n       1. Bill number: S. 1730.\n       2. Bill title: The Oil Spill Prevention and Response \n     Improvement Act.\n       3. Bill status: As reported by the Senate Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works on June 26, 1996.\n       4. Bill purpose: The bill would amend federal law dealing \n     with oil pollution by: imposing new operational, structural, \n     and safety requirements on tanker and towing vessels; \n     allowing more funds to be spent out of the emergency fund of \n     the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund; and limiting the \n     liability of certain tanker vessels that have double hulls \n     and are responsible for oil spills.\n       5. Intergovernmental mandates contained in bill:\n       Vessel Requirements. The bill would require the Secretary \n     of Transportation to incorporate additional measures in three \n     sets of rules being proposed by the Coast Guard. The rules \n     deal with navigational equipment for towing vessels and \n     operational and structural requirements for tanker vessels \n     that have a single hull and weigh more than 5,000 gross tons. \n     These requirements are intergovernmental mandates because a \n     small fraction of these vessels, less than 2 percent, are \n     owned by state, local, and tribal governments.\n       Under-Keel Clearance. S.1730 would preempt the authority of \n     captains of ports to establish minimum under-keel clearances \n     in their ports by requiring the Secretary of Transportation \n     to establish minimum under-keel clearances for each port. \n     This preemption constitutes an intergovernmental mandate \n     because ports are owned by state and local governments or \n     their subsidiaries. However, this preemption might occur \n     under current law. The Coast Guard is about to issue a final \n     rule regarding structural and operational measures for tanker \n     vessels that have a single hull and weigh more than 5,000 \n     gross tons. The Coast Guard's proposed rule would prohibit \n     vessels with an under-keel clearance of less than 0.5 meters \n     from entering or exiting a port without the approval of the \n     captain of the port.\n       6. Estimated direct costs of mandates to State, local, and \n     tribal governments:\n       (a) Is the $50 Million Threshold Exceeded? No.\n       (b) Total Direct Costs of Mandates: The new requirements on \n     tanker and towing vessels owned by state, local, or tribal \n     governments would have a negligible effect on their\n\n[[Page S8300]]\n\n     budgets. Preempting the authority of port captains to \n     establish a minimum under-keel clearance for their ports \n     would have no direct impact on the budgets of ports.\n       (c) Estimate of Necessary Budget Authority: Not applicable.\n       7. Basis of estimate:\n       Vessel Requirements. S. 1730 would modify three rulemakings \n     that the Coast Guard is currently carrying out. If the final \n     rules are not in place by the dates specified in the bill \n     (all of which are in the next six months), S. 1730 would \n     require that the proposed rules be in effect until the final \n     rules are put in place.\n       Based on information provided by the Coast Guard, CBO \n     expects that all the final rules will be in place by the \n     deadlines specified in the bill or by October 1, 1996, the \n     assumed enactment date of the bill. Enactment of S. 1730 \n     should therefore not result in the rules being imposed \n     earlier than they would otherwise be imposed under current \n     law. If the Coast Guard does not meet the deadlines, however, \n     the shipping industry would face about $15 million per month \n     in additional costs because it would have to comply with the \n     proposed rules at an earlier date than would occur under \n     current law. Vessels owned by state, local, and tribal \n     governments would bear a small fraction of these costs.\n       The bill would also require the Coast Guard to add \n     additional requirements to its final rules, such as fire \n     suppression equipment on towing vessels and safety measures \n     for single-hull barges. CBO estimates that the up-front costs \n     for the shipping industry as a whole would be no more than \n     $18 million and annual operational costs would be minimal. \n     Because less than 2 percent of these vessels are owned by \n     state, local, and tribal governments, the cost of these \n     intergovernmental mandates would be negligible.\n       Under-Keel Clearance. Preempting the authority of port \n     captains to establish a minimum under-keel clearance for \n     their ports would have no direct impact on the budgets of \n     ports. Ports could experience indirect costs, however; these \n     costs are discussed below in the section titled ``Other \n     Impacts On State, Local, and Tribal Governments.''\n       8. Appropriation or other federal financial assistance \n     provided in bill to cover mandate costs: None.\n       9. Other impacts on State, local, and tribal governments:\n       Under-Keel Clearance. The current proposed rule for tanker \n     vessels includes a minimum under-keel clearance that would \n     apply uniformly to all ports. Because the shipping industry \n     and port authorities have objected to a national standard, it \n     is unclear whether the final rule will set a minimum under-\n     keel clearance. The bill would settle the dispute by \n     requiring the Secretary of Transportation to establish a \n     separate minimum clearance for each port. CBO has no basis \n     for predicting whether these standards would be more or less \n     stringent than the standards that would be established under \n     current law.\n       If the clearance requirements are less stringent than the \n     requirement under current law, ports would not incur \n     additional costs. If the clearance requirements are more \n     stringent, ports could choose to increase their under-keel \n     clearance and could face additional costs for activities such \n     as dredging in order to avoid losing business to deeper \n     ports. Because the enforceable duty would be imposed on \n     operators of vessels, not on ports, such costs would be \n     considered an indirect effect of a mandate.\n       Spending from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF). \n     CBO estimates that federal direct spending from the emergency \n     fund of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF) would \n     increase by $40 million (from $20 million to $60 million) in \n     fiscal year 1997 and by $45 million (from $15 million to $60 \n     million) annually thereafter.\n       These increases would result from broadening how the funds \n     can be used and by increasing the overall cap on direct \n     spending from $50 million to $60 million. (Even though the \n     current annual cap is $50 million, we expect that spending \n     from the emergency fund will be between $15 million and $20 \n     million annually under current law.) CBO expects that some of \n     these additional funds would go to the states.\n       States currently have the legal and operational \n     responsibility to cap idle oil wells. This bill would allow \n     emergency funds from the OSLTF to pay for some of these \n     costs, but the states would have to pay at least half. In \n     addition, some of the costs associated with oil spills that \n     are often paid for by states, including the full cost of \n     assessing damages to natural resources and mitigating \n     ecological injuries, would now be an eligible use of OSLTF \n     emergency funds.\n       Limit on Oil Spill Liability. Current law caps the \n     liability of parties who are responsible for oil spills. \n     However, the cap does not apply to cases where federal \n     safety, construction, or operating regulations are violated. \n     S. 1730 would extend the liability cap to these cases if the \n     tanker involved has a double hull. State, local, and tribal \n     governments are often the recipients of awards from liability \n     claims. Because the bill would expand the cases to which the \n     liability cap applies, state, local, and tribal governments \n     may receive smaller awards in future liability cases.\n       10.

Sunshine, for Paul N. \n     Van de Water, Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n    Congressional Budget Office Estimate of Costs of Private Sector \n                        Mandates, July 17, 1996\n\n       1. Bill number: S. 1730.\n       2. Bill title: The Oil Spill Prevention and Response \n     Improvement Act.\n       3. Bill status: As reported by the Senate Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works on June 26, 1996.\n       4. Bill purpose: The bill would amend provisions of the Oil \n     Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) that address oil spill prevention \n     and safety measures.\n       5. Private sector mandates contained in bill:\n       S. 1730 would require the Secretary of Transportation to \n     incorporate additional mandates in the operational, \n     structural, and navigational rules currently proposed by the \n     U.S. Coast Guard. In addition, the bill would put into effect \n     the Coast Guard's current proposed rules by specified dates \n     (all of which occur within the next six months) if the Coast \n     Guard's final rules are not effective by deadlines specified \n     under current law. The rules address navigational and safety \n     equipment for towing vessels and operational and structural \n     requirements for tanker vessels that have a single hull and \n     weight more than 5,000 gross tons.\n       Based on information provided by the U.S. Coast Guard, CBO \n     assumes that the final rules will be effective by the \n     specified deadlines or by October 1, 1996, the assumed \n     enactment date of the bill. CBO also assumes that the Coast \n     Guard's final operational, structural, and navigational rules \n     will reflect the respective currently proposed rules. If the \n     Coast Guard does not meet the specified deadlines, the \n     shipping industry would incur additional costs because the \n     industry would have to comply with interim rules sooner than \n     under current law. In addition, S. 1730 would require the \n     final operational rule to include specific safety \n     requirements to prevent the grounding of single-hull barges \n     and the establishment of a minimum under-keel clearance for \n     those vessels. The final navigational rule would have to \n     include a requirement that towing vessels have fire-\n     suppression systems. Further, advertisements that currently \n     indicate the designation and procedures by which claims may \n     be presented would also have to announce that claimants may \n     present interim claims for short-term damages.\n       6. Estimated direct cost to the private sector:\n       S. 1730 would impose private-sector mandates that would \n     most likely fall below the annual threshold as defined in \n     Public Law 104-4. In the unlikely event that the Coast \n     Guard's operational rule is delayed seven months after S. \n     1730 is enacted, costs could exceed the $100 million \n     threshold in the first year.\n       Interim Rules. If S. 1730 were to be enacted before the \n     Coast Guard's final operational rule is effective, the bill \n     would impose interim private-sector mandates for operational \n     activities. The interim operational rule would be identical \n     to the proposed operational rule published by the Coast Guard \n     in the Supplemental Notice of proposed Rulemaking (60 Fed. \n     Reg. 55,904 (1995)), and would be in effect until the Coast \n     Guard's final rule is effective. Based on information \n     contained in the proposed rule, CBO estimates that the \n     mandates imposed by the interim rule would cost the private \n     sector approximately $15 million per month during the first \n     year the interim rule is in effect. After the first year, the \n     annual costs would decline. The costs imposed by the interim \n     operational rule would not exceed the $100 million threshold \n     unless the Coast Guard's final operational rule is still not \n     effective seven months after S. 1730 is enacted.\n       S. 1730 also would impose an interim rule on vessel \n     structure that would be identical to the proposed rule \n     published by the Coast Guard in the Notice of Proposed \n     Rulemaking (58 Fed. Reg. 54,870 (1993)) if the final \n     structural rule is not effective by December 18, 1996. In the \n     event that the final structural rule is not effective before \n     the deadline, compliance with the proposed structural rule \n     would not be required for three years. Therefore, the private \n     sector would not likely make structural changes during the \n     interim.\n       Similarly, the bill would impose an interim navigational \n     rule if the Coast Guard's final rule on safety equipment for \n     towing vessel does not become effective by September 30, \n     1996. The interim navigational rule would be identical to the \n     proposed rule published by the Coast Guard in the Notice \n     Proposed Rulemaking (58 Fed. Reg. 54,870 (1993)). In the \n     event that the final navigational rule is not effective \n     before the deadline, the private sector would not likely make \n     any significant changes during the interim since compliance \n     with some of the provisions would not be required for one to \n     five years.\n       New Rulemaking Requirements. Under section 101 of the bill, \n     the final rule on operational requirements must include a \n     provision requiring all single-hull barges over 5,000 gross \n     tons operating in open ocean or coastal waters to have at \n     least one of the following: (1) a crew member on board and an \n     operable anchor, (2) an emergency system on board the vessel \n     towing the barge, or (3) any other measure that provides \n     similar protection. Based on discussions with industry \n     representatives, CBO estimates that the incremental cost of \n     complying with this provision would be less than $1 million \n     over five years.\n       Section 101 of the bill would require that the final \n     operation rule include a provision requiring the \n     establishment of a minimum\n\n[[Page S8301]]\n\n     under-keel clearance for each port in which a single-hull \n     vessel operates. It is unclear if this provision would result \n     in more or less stringent requirements than the 0.5 meter \n     uniform under-keel clearance in the Coast Guard's proposed \n     rule. The effect of this requirement would be to impose \n     operational restrictions on such vessels not meeting the \n     port's established under-keel clearance when entering or \n     departing from the port and when operating in an inland or \n     coastal waterway. If the effect of the under-keel clearance \n     provision in the bill is to provide greater flexibility than \n     the 0.5 meter uniform under-keel clearance in the proposed \n     rule, then this provision of the bill would result in lower \n     private-sector costs compared to the costs associated with \n     the current proposed operational rule. However, if the bill \n     leads to more stringent under-keel clearance requirements \n     relative to current practice, this provision would result in \n     increased costs to the private sector since vessels would \n     have to lighter cargo or use alternative ports.\n       Section 103 would require that the final navigational rule \n     include a provision requiring a towing vessel to have a fire-\n     suppression system or other equipment to suppress an onboard \n     fire. Based on information provided by the Coast Guard and \n     the private sector, CBO estimates that this provision would \n     result in costs to the private sector between $6 million and \n     $18 million during the first year for installation and a \n     minimal amount for operating costs thereafter.\n       Advertising Requirements. S. 1730 would impose an \n     additional mandate concerning the advertising requirements in \n     the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Currently, the responsible \n     party or guarantor of an incident must advertise the \n     designation and the procedures by which claims may be \n     presented. Section 201 would require that such advertisements \n     must also announce that claimants may present interim claims \n     for short-term damages. CBO estimates that the additional \n     advertising requirement would impose minimal costs on the \n     private sector.\n       7. Previous CBO estimate: None.\n       8.

Mr. President, Prof. Garrison Nelson is one of our \ncountry's foremost experts on Congress and the Presidency, and Vermont \nhas been lucky to call him our own during his tenure at the University \nof Vermont. He recently wrote an interesting column for Roll Call about \nthe historical record of Senate leaders who run for president. It is an \nentertaining and informative analysis that I hope other Senators will \nhave a chance to read.\n  I ask that an article entitled ``Can Dole Escape Senate Leaders' Poor \nPresidential Record?'' be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n       Can Dole Escape Senate Leaders' Poor Presidential Record?\n\n       Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole's (R-Kan) decision to \n     resign from office in the midst of his presidential campaign \n     isn't so surprising when you take into account the history of \n     Republican Senate leaders in presidential contests.\n       That's because, almost without exception, a Congressional \n     leadership post has been the kiss of death for White House \n     aspirants.\n       Dole is the latest of several Congressional leaders \n     throughout the nation's history who have sought the \n     presidency. Whether he, by abandoning his post, will have \n     more success than others did remains to be seen.\n       In a recent assessment, I found some 112 broadly defined \n     ``blips'' made by Congressional leaders on the presidential \n     radar screen from 1856 through 1966. These ``blips'' \n     represent instances of Congressional leaders who appeared \n     anywhere on the presidential (or vice presidential) charts--\n     whether in delegate votes at the nominating conventions, or \n     popular votes during the presidential primaries, or in \n     discernible mentions in public opinion speculations about \n     candidacies.\n       Some of these ``blips'' were trivial: ``favorite son'' \n     votes at the convention or passing mentions in the opinion \n     polls. But others had real meaning.\n       Prior to the passage in 1912 of the 17th Amendment, which \n     instituted direct election of Senators, House leaders had a \n     clear edge over Senate counterparts in the presidential \n     calculus of the party kingmakers who put tickets together. \n     This was particularly true to Republican conventions, which \n     gave House leaders 20 considerations to only six for Senate \n     leaders during the selections made in some 15 conventions.\n       While the Democratic conventions in the 1856-1912 era may \n     have divided their presidential and vice presidential \n     considerations for Congressional leaders between the two \n     chambers equally--11 to 11--the point was relatively moot \n     because Republican nominees won 11 of the 15 presidential \n     contests.\n       Not until 1964 was a Democratic Congressional leader \n     nominated for president: Lyndon Johnson (Texas), who had \n     begun his executive service as vice president and was already \n     seated as president at the time of the convention.\n       Republican Congressional leaders have been more successful \n     at gaining the presidential brass ring. The first Republican \n     Congressional leader to be nominated for the top executive \n     post was House Speaker Schuyler Colfax (Ind), who was \n     nominated and elected as Ulysses S. Grant's first vice \n     president in 1868.\n       Four times in the 20 years between 1880 and 1900, past and \n     present House floor leaders were nominated for president by \n     Republican conventions.\n       Since then, almost a century has passed, and only one House \n     Republican leader has been nominated for either post and that \n     was Gerald Ford's 1976 selection as president. But Ford was \n     already president at the time, albeit unelected, and had not \n     made it onto the presidential screen at any time during his \n     nine-year stint as House Republican floor leader.\n       Senate leaders have been slow to develop as nominees. While \n     two sitting Senators were nominated and elected--Ohio's \n     Warren Harding in 1920 and Massachusetts's John Kennedy in \n     1960--it is important to remember that neither held a \n     leadership post.\n       It was not until 1928 that the nominating conventions took \n     serious note of sitting Senate floor leaders. That year, both \n     parties chose their respective Senate floor leaders as vice \n     presidential candidates. Republican Charles Curtis of Kansas \n     ran with Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover while Democrat \n     Joseph Robinson of Arkansas ran with New York Gov. Al Smith.\n       House Democrats were the least likely to be nominated, with \n     their 18 considerations generating only two vice presidential \n     nominations--both for Speaker ``Cactus'' Jack Garner of Texas \n     in 1932 and 1936. But both nominations were successful. \n     Running with FDR made the cantankerous former Speaker \n     electable.\n       House Republicans picked off six nominations for their 26 \n     considerations--double the rate of the House Democrats. But \n     only one occurred in the past 90 years.\n       Senate Democratic leaders garnered the most considerations \n     (41), as well as the most presidential and vice presidential \n     nominations (seven). All four of their victories came after \n     World War II. Among them were: Majority Leader Alben Barkley \n     (Ky.) for vice president in 1948; Majority Leader Johnson for \n     vice president in 1960 and president in 1964; and Whip Hubert \n     Humphrey for vice president in 1964.\n       But it is Senate Republican leaders who seem to have \n     encountered the most difficulty. They received 27 \n     considerations, but only five nominations--only one of which \n     was for president (Dole, this year, which has yet to be \n     officially confirmed).\n       Their four vice presidential nominations produced only one \n     victory--Curtis in 1928. So the 26 considerations which the \n     Senate Republican leaders received prior to 1996 produced one \n     vice presidential victory--a success rate of 4 percent, the \n     lowest for any of the four Congressional leadership \n     categories.\n       Even though it was a fellow Kansan who earned the lone \n     victory by a Senate Republican leader, clearly Dole made the \n     right move in getting out of the Senate. He has escaped the \n     Temple of Presidential Doom.\n       Now if he can just convince voters that he never held a \n     leadership post there, he might be able to move up in the \n     polls and avoid the kiss of death that those posts seem to be \n     in presidential politics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/18/senate-section/article/S8301-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8301-S8302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO TIMOTHY MARQUIS, JOANNE MILLETTE, SYMA MIRZA, AND KENNETH \n JOHNSON ON BEING SELECTED AS PRESIDENTIAL SCHOLARS FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nTimothy Marquis, Joanne Millette, Syma Myrza, and Kenneth Johnson and \ncongratulate them on being named White House Presidential Scholars. \nThese students were among the 141 students chosen for this prestigious \naward from more than 2,600 high school seniors. Last month, these New \nHampshire students were in Washington to participate in special events \nhighlighting Presidential Scholars National Recognition Week.\n  The Presidential Scholars Program was created by President Lyndon B. \nJohnson in 1964 to honor our Nation's most outstanding students. In \n1979, the program was expanded to include accomplished students from \nthe visual, creative, and performing arts. This year, the General \nMotors and Saturn companies sponsored the Presidential Scholars Program \nand the events in Washington.\n  Timothy, Joanne, Syma, and Kenneth are four outstanding New Hampshire \nstudents who have worked very hard to achieve academic excellence. \nTheir dedication deserves this special recognition. They were selected \nas Presidential scholars on the basis of academic success, essays, \nschool recommendations, leadership, character, and commitment to high \nideals. One of the primary goals of this program is to\n\n[[Page S8302]]\n\nhelp young people recognize the value of their accomplishments. In \naddition to receiving this award, each student was asked to name the \nteacher who most influenced them during their high school career. These \nteachers are named as a National Distinguished Teacher and are invited \nto participate in the National Recognition Week.\n  These students have worked hard to achieve excellence and this award \nhonors their hard work and perseverance. These students are remarkable \nbecause they have achieved not only academic excellence, but are also \nleaders in their schools and dedicated to community service. Each \nstudent has given back to the community that nurtured them. I am proud \nto recognize these four outstanding young people as New Hampshire's \nfinest and congratulate them on the receipt of the White House \nPresidential Scholars Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/18/senate-section/article/S8301-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HENRY PESTKA\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a man who has \novercome great adversity to become a pillar of his community, Henry \nPestka of Grand Rapids, MI.\n  Henry Pestka was born in Poland on July 29, 1922, the son of Saul and \nMarie Pestka. Saul Pestka was a builder and developer who taught his \nson his craft. After the Nazi occupation of Poland, Henry was interned \nin a number of concentration camps, including the notorious Auschwitz \nDeath Camp.\n  In 1944, Pestka and two other prisoners escaped during a forced death \nmarch, and were found by members of the Free French Army. Henry joined \nthe Polish Battalion of the Free French Army. He has the unique \ndistinction of being not only one of the few survivors of Auschwitz \nDeath Camp, but also a decorated combat veteran of the Allied cause in \nthe Second World War. Tragically, both his parents and siblings \nperished. Henry was the only survivor.\n  In 1946, at the urging of his only living relatives, Henry immigrated \nto the United States and settled in Grand Rapids, MI. When Henry \narrived, he could not speak English. He enrolled in night classes at \nUnion High School and was given employment by a friend of his father's \nfrom Poland. In short, Henry came to the United States without money, \nwith a very limited family, and unable to speak English.\n  In December 1948, Henry married Beatrice Bergman. Prior to the \nmarriage, Henry had started working at Bergman Auto Supplies, selling \nauto parts and installing seat covers. In the late 1950's, Henry and \nhis partner, Herman Bergman, began purchasing and developing property \nusing the lessons gleaned from his father as a boy in Poland. For the \npast 40 years, Henry has developed shopping centers, office buildings, \nrestaurants, apartment complexes, and industrial buildings. He has \nworked with major companies, both in the Grand Rapids area and across \nthe United States.\n  Henry's proudest achievement was his tenure as building chairman for \nCongregation Ahavas Israel. He devoted a year of his life to this \nproject and served without fee. Ultimately, in 1971, the beautiful \nstructure was completed. At the time, Henry was honored by the Grand \nRapids mayor, Bob Boelens, and by the entire congregation. In the foyer \nof the synagogue is an affecting mural depicting the 6 million innocent \nvictims of Nazi genocide. In his own way, Henry has contributed not \nonly to the memory of those who perished, but also built an institution \nto serve future generations including his own grandchildren.\n  Henry's philanthropy is legendary, particularly toward those \ninstitutions fighting bigotry or helping the sick and disabled. Among \nthe organizations which he has consistently supported are the Anti-\nDefamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the U.S. Holocaust \nMuseum, the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, \nthe Arthritis Foundation, St. Jude's Children's Hospital, and the \nSalvation Army. On a local level, Henry has supported Hope Network, \nProject Rehab, and many, many others.\n  His life has been a testament to overcoming horrific adversity and \nprevailing. He has built a uniquely American life, for which he can be \nforever proud. I know that my Senate colleague will join me in honoring \nHenry Pestka.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/18/senate-section/article/S8302-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8302-S8303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CALIFORNIA CITIES FIGHT JUNK GUNS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, earlier this year, I introduced \nlegislation to prohibit the sale and manufacture of Junk Guns, or as \nthey are also called, Saturday Night Specials. The importation of these \ncheap, easily concealable, and unsafe weapons has been prohibited since \n1968, but their domestic production continues to soar.\n  In 1995, eight of the ten firearms most frequently traced at crime \nscenes were junk guns. These guns are the criminals' choice, and we \nmust act now to get them out of our schools and our communities. \nNationwide, gun violence is now the second leading cause of death of \namong children. In California, gun violence is number one. For the sake \nof our children, we must pass the Junk Gun Violence Protection Act.\n  My bill has received strong support from California's law enforcement \nleaders. The California Police Chiefs Association has endorsed my bill \nalong with more than two dozen individual police chiefs and sheriffs \nrepresenting some of California's largest cities and counties.\n  Today, I want to report on an extraordinary event that occurred last \nweek in Oakland. On July 8, the mayors of 15 cities in California's \nEast Bay joined together and pledged to get junk guns off the streets \nof their communities. These mayors said that they were frustrated by \nthe 104th Congress' unwillingness to enact the common sense reforms \nthat my bill would make. Although they acknowledge that Federal \nlegislation would be more effective than local ordinances, they have \ndecided not to wait until Washington gets the message that these guns \nmust be taken off our streets.\n  The cities of West Hollywood, San Francisco, Oakland, and Alameda \nhave already passed ordinances to ban the sales of junk guns. More than \na dozen municipalities in Alameda and Contra Costa counties are \nexpected to follow soon. When junk guns are banned in these East Bay \ncommunities, it will create the largest junk gun-free zone in the \ncountry.\n  The courageous actions taken by these East Bay mayors provides real \nmomentum to the movement to ban junk guns nationwide. I commend these \ncommunities for their leadership, and once again, I urge my colleagues \nto support S. 1654, the Junk Gun Violence Protection Act.\n  I ask that the following articles be printed in the Record.\n  The articles follow:\n\n               [From the Oakland Tribune, July 18, 1996]\n\n        Alameda Joins East Bay Cities in Shooting Down Junk Guns\n\n                         (By Kathleen Kirkwood)\n\n       Alameda.--The City Council has joined other East Bay cities \n     in approving an ordinance banning the sale of junk guns; the \n     so-called Saturday night specials.\n       The ordinance is patterned after a similar law in West \n     Hollywood, now facing a court challenge on the grounds it is \n     preempted by state regulations.\n       Several gun owners appealed to the Alameda council Tuesday \n     to reject the law, saying it was a sham and couldn't be \n     enforced because of overriding state law. Even if it were \n     imposed, it couldn't stem the tide of gun-related crimes \n     anyway, Herb Leong of San Francisco said.\n       ``I don't believe this is a law that's worth your effort,'' \n     Leong said. ``What we need to do is change people. We can't \n     change what they do by taking away a tool.''\n       Local gun dealer James Figone said he doesn't sell junk \n     guns, which are usually cheap and unreliable. But he said the \n     city would be infringing on constitutional rights to bear \n     arms.\n       ``The whole point of these laws is to take guns out of the \n     public's hands,'' Figone said.\n       Figone and others also criticized the ordinance's lack of a \n     specific list of which guns would be targeted.\n       Instead, it states that the police chief will issue a list \n     of firearms, at a future date, that meets the description of \n     guns to be banned.\n       Generally, they're defined as cheap, poorly-manufactured, \n     short-barreled handguns, Police Chief Barry Matthews said.\n       Matthews passed around five junk guns to council members \n     that had been confiscated by Alameda police, calling them \n     ``garbage'' weapons and ``messengers of death.''\n       He said it was hard to tell what effect the junk gun ban \n     would have if imposed in Alameda.\n       ``There will be a difference--to what degree I can't say,'' \n     Matthews said.\n       In 1993, he said, junk handguns accounted for 8 out of 10 \n     firearms most frequently confiscated by police in California. \n     An estimated 90 percent of such guns available in the United \n     States are manufactured in California. Import of such guns \n     into the United States is already banned.\n\n[[Page S8303]]\n\n       The mayors and police chiefs of 21 cities in the East Bay \n     are backing the ordinance, hoping to send a signal to \n     legislators.\n       ``Maybe it won't stop smuggling or crime,'' Mayor Ralph \n     Appezzato said. ``Symbolic? Maybe, maybe not. But we've got \n     to try.''\n       Alameda was among seven cities along the I-880 corridor to \n     approve or at least study the junk gun ordinance ban in the \n     first reading of the law this week.\n       Oakland and Berkeley have given the ban approval on a \n     second reading, which is required for final passage.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              Region Takes the Lead to Corral `Junk Guns'\n\n       The new push by Bay Area civic leader's to take ``junk \n     guns'' out of circulation probably won't take the weapons off \n     the streets altogether. But it is likely to have some \n     success. And it stands as a powerful statement by those who \n     lead our local governments: We've had enough, and we're going \n     to work together, as a region, to solve this problem.\n       ``We are standing together, and sending a message that no \n     matter where you live, in what city or county, violence is \n     there and we need to do something about it,'' said Berkeley \n     Mayor Shidey Dean, chairwoman of the East Bay Public Safety \n     Corridor Partnership.\n       The partnership, the largest regional approach to fighting \n     junk guns in the nation, encompasses Fremont, Newark, Union \n     City, Hayward, San Leandro, Alameda, Berkeley, Oakland, \n     Piedmont, Albany, Emeryville, El Cerrito, Richmond, San Pablo \n     and Pinole. Dean wants other cities to join.\n       San Francisco and Alameda County have already outlawed the \n     weapons, and San Jose is considering a ban.\n       The regional approach is being taken up by Bay Area \n     politicians who have given up on the federal and state \n     governments. ``Politicians on the state and federal level, \n     quite frankly, are afraid of the gun lobby,'' said Oakland \n     Mayor Elihu Harris.\n       Junk guns, also known as Saturday night specials, are, \n     generally speaking, poorly constructed and therefore less \n     safe. They also are less expensive to buy. More technical \n     definitions will be refined by those who write the local \n     ordinances banning them. Suffice it to say, junk guns are \n     easy to get and dangerous to use. They are used by gangs and \n     considered status symbols.\n\n\n                           bay area homicides\n\n       People are dropping like flies in the Bay Area because of \n     the availability of guns. Between 1991 and 1993, six out of \n     every eight homicides in Alameda County involved a firearm, \n     according to the Alameda County Injury Prevention program. \n     Homicide rates were highest for those between 20 and 24.\n       If this push is going to succeed, other cities are going to \n     have to climb on board. Several are considering gun bans. We \n     urge them to follow through.\n       At least one East Bay civic leader, Dublin Mayor Guy \n     Houston, wants no part of the regional gun ban. Using \n     rhetoric that sounds as though it were written for him by the \n     National Rifle Association, Houston eschews a ban on \n     murderous weapons and says tougher penalties are the solution \n     to the gun problem. The ``Three Strikes, You're Out'' law is \n     taking care of the problem, Houston says.\n       Tougher penalties are fine, but by themselves they have not \n     done the job. More is needed. At least Houston didn't utter \n     the old NRA line, ``Guns don't kill people; people kill \n     people.'' That's true; people do kill people--with guns. \n     Fewer guns, fewer deaths.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/18/senate-section/article/S8302-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AUTHORIZING SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL REPRESENTATION\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, child abuse is a critical issue facing our \nNation. Each year, close to 1 million children are abused or neglected \nand as a result, in need of assistance and out of home care. CAPTA is a \nsmall but vital link in the provision of these services.\n  S. 919, which was unanimously reported by the Senate Labor Committee \nnearly 1-year ago, streamlines State plan and reporting requirements; \neliminates unnecessary research and technical assistance activities; \nand encourages local innovation through a restructured demonstration \nprogram.\n  Additionally, we have consolidated the Child Abuse Community Based \nPrevention Grants, Family Resource Centers, Family Support Centers into \nthe Community and Family Resource and Support Grants.\n  Finally, S. 919 repeals the Temporary Child Care for Children with \nDisabilities and Crisis Nurseries Act, Title VII (F) of the McKinney \nHomeless Assistance Act, and the Emergency Child Abuse Prevention \nGrants.\n  Mr. President, each day, hundreds of children and families come into \ncontact with, and are affected by, our nation's child protective \nsystem. For many, it is a frightening experience. For others--for those \non the front lines, it is sometimes an opportunity to rescue children \nfrom horrific circumstances.\n  Unfortunately, the issues facing this overburdened system are seldom \neasily resolved. Too often--overworked, under paid, untrained, and \nsometimes over-zealous caseworkers have a tremendous and devastating \nimpact on families.\n  Decisions are routinely made to remove children and place them in \nfoster care--into situations that are sometimes more dangerous than the \none they were removed from. Other times, because of mounting paperwork \nand case files, a serious case goes uninvestigated--or a decision to \nreturn a child to an unsafe home is made because there are no more out \nof home placements available. These are all difficult circumstances \nthat require balance, training, and resources.\n  Since 1974, CAPTA, through a relatively small program, has assisted \nstates in meeting child protection needs. It is a small, but important \nprogram, because it mandates have radically changed how we view child \nprotection.\n  Unfortunately, not all of these changes have been helpful. CAPTA has, \nuntil now, been viewed as a very prescriptive program, with States \njudged, not on how well they protect children, but on how close they \ncome to mirroring Federal requirements.\n  The 1995 CAPTA Amendments are an important first step toward \naddressing some of the problems in CAPTA while at the same time, \nbuilding upon its strengths. Most experts agree that what CAPTA can do, \nand do best, is provide guidance to states; assist States with training \nand technical assistance; and promote better research and dissemination \nof information while allowing for maximum flexibility in approach and \nresponse. With that in mind, S. 919:\n  Eliminates unnecessary bureaucracy by repealing mandates for a \nNational Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, the U.S. Advisory Board, \nand the Interagency Task force on Child Abuse. Instead, the Secretary \nmay use discretion in deciding whether or not they are an essential \nfunction.\n  Restructures and consolidates various research functions into one \ncoordinated effort.\n  Places a significant emphasis on local experimentation by expanding \nDemonstration Grants to encourage local innovation and experimentation. \nOne of these areas involves a triage system approach which we heard \nvery exciting reports about during a Subcommittee on Children and \nFamilies hearing. Others include training for mandatory reporters, \nfamilies, service providers, and communities and a demonstration \nprogram for kinship care as an alternative to foster care placements.\n  Reforms the Basic State Grant by allowing greater flexibility to the \nStates in determining the circumstances and intensity of intervention \nthat is required, while encouraging them to look to other preventative \nservices that can be provided to families, where intensive intervention \nis not called for.\n  Determining the appropriate level of intervention is a very important \nconsideration. We have studied closely the numbers of abuse and neglect \nreports that have been filed. Of the close to 3 million reports that \nhave been filed, only one-third are eventually substantiated. This \nmeans that over 2 million are either unsubstantiated or false. And \nwhile I know that these numbers and their interpretation are the source \nof some disagreement, the fact remains that for whatever reason, over 2 \nmillion investigations at some level, are occurring, and possibly \nresulting in inappropriate interventions--including removal of the \nchild from the home.\n  Members of the Labor Committee may recall the testimony of Jim Wade \nwho spoke of his three year ordeal, in which his daughter was \nwrongfully removed from his home. I have received many such reports and \ncomplaints, and while we should be mindful not to legislate by \nanecdote, these stories involve real people and are chilling.\n  With the State grant, we have worked to find ways to improve \nreporting so that caseworkers are able to assess and effectively \nrespond to cases of abuse and neglect with an appropriate response. S. \n919 stresses the importance of case workers using risk assessment \nprocedures to ensure that priority attention is given to those children \nwho\n\n[[Page S8311]]\n\nare at great risk of harm. I think particularly of the tragic case of \nElisa Izquierdo of Brooklyn, the 6 year-old girl brutally murdered by \nher mother on the day before Thanksgiving this past year. Elisa was \nwell known to the overburdened case workers who were assigned to \nmonitor her, however it appears that they simply didn't have enough \ntime to keep a close watch on Elisa, nor maybe enough training to \nrealize the tremendous seriousness of her situation. S. 919's focus on \nbetter training and the use of risk assessment procedures should help \nto improve the safety of children.\n  We have also ensured that persons who maliciously file reports of \nabuse or neglect will not longer be protected by CAPTA's immunity for \nreporting. Only good faith reports will be protected.\n  Finally, we have clarified the definition of child abuse or neglect \nto provide additional guidance and clarification to states as they \nendeavor to protect children from abuse and neglect.\n  Let me briefly mention the other programs authorized in the 1995 \nCAPTA Amendments: the Community and Family Resource Grants is the \nresult of nearly a full year's effort to consolidate the Community \nBased Prevention Grant, Respite Care Program, and Family Resource \nPrograms; the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act which \nprovides assistance to States primarily for shelters; the Adoption \nOpportunities Act which supports aggressive efforts to strengthen the \ncapacity of States to find permanent homes for children with special \nneeds; the Abandoned Infants Assistance Act which provides for the \nneeds of children who are abandoned, especially those with AIDS; the \nChildren's Justice Act; and the Missing Children's Assistance Act and \nSection 214 of the Victims of Child Abuse Act.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank the Members for their attention. \nThese are important programs and they will affect many children and \nfamilies. I urge the adoption of the 1995 CAPTA Amendments.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe considered as read, and agreed to, the committee amendment be agreed \nto, the bill be deemed read a third time, passed, as amended, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be placed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

MONITORING OF CONTAMINANTS.\n\n       ``(a) Interim Monitoring Relief Authority.--(1) A State \n     exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public \n     water systems may modify the monitoring requirements for any \n     regulated or unregulated contaminants for which monitoring is \n     required other than microbial contaminants (or indicators \n     thereof), disinfectants and disinfection byproducts or \n     corrosion byproducts for an interim period to provide that \n     any public water system serving 10,000 persons or fewer shall \n     not be required to conduct additional quarterly monitoring \n     during an interim relief period for such contaminants if--\n       ``(A) monitoring, conducted at the beginning of the period \n     for the contaminant concerned and certified to the State by \n     the public water system, fails to detect the presence of the \n     contaminant in the ground or surface water supplying the \n     public water system, and\n       ``(B) the State, (considering the hydrogeology of the area \n     and other relevant factors), determines in writing that the \n     contaminant is unlikely to be detected by further monitoring \n     during such period.\n       ``(2) The interim relief period referred to in paragraph \n     (1) shall terminate when permanent monitoring relief is \n     adopted and approved for such State, or at the end of 36 \n     months after the enactment of the Safe Drinking Water Act \n     Amendments of 1996, whichever comes first. In order to serve \n     as a basis for interim relief, the monitoring conducted at \n     the beginning of the period must occur at the time determined \n     by the State to be the time of the public water system's \n     greatest vulnerability to the contaminant concerned in the \n     relevant ground or surface water, taking into account in the \n     case of pesticides the time of application of the pesticide \n     for the source water area and the travel time for the \n     pesticide to reach such waters and taking into account, in \n     the case of other contaminants, seasonality of precipitation \n     and contaminant travel time.\n       ``(b) Permanent Monitoring Relief Authority.--(1) Each \n     State exercising primary enforcement responsibility for \n     public water systems under this title and having an approved \n     wellhead protection program and a source water assessment \n     program may adopt, in accordance with guidance published by \n     the Administrator, and submit to the Administrator as \n     provided in section 1428(c), tailored alternative monitoring \n     requirements for public water systems in such State (as an \n     alternative to the monitoring requirements for chemical \n     contaminants set forth in the applicable national primary \n     drinking water regulations) where the State concludes that \n     (based on data available at the time of adoption concerning \n     susceptibility, use, occurrence, wellhead protection, or from \n     the State's drinking water source water assessment program) \n     such alternative monitoring would provide assurance that it \n     complies with the Administrator's guidelines.

The Administrator shall publish such \n     guidelines in the Federal Register. The guidelines shall \n     assure that the public health will be protected from drinking \n     water contamination. The guidelines shall require that a \n     State alternative monitoring program apply on a contaminant-\n     by-contaminant basis and that, to be eligible for such \n     alternative monitoring program, a public water system must \n     show the State that the contaminant is not present in the \n     drinking water supply or, if present, it is reliably and \n     consistently below the maximum contaminant level.\n       ``(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the phrase \n     `reliably and consistently below the maximum contaminant \n     level' means that, although contaminants have been detected \n     in a water supply, the State has sufficient knowledge of the \n     contamination source and extent of contamination to predict \n     that the maximum contaminant level will not be exceeded. In \n     determining that a contaminant is reliably and consistently \n     below the maximum contaminant level, States shall consider \n     the quality and completeness of data, the length of time \n     covered and the volatility or stability of monitoring results \n     during that time, and the proximity of such results to the \n     maximum contaminant level. Wide variations in the analytical \n     results, or analytical results close to the maximum \n     contaminant level, shall not be considered to be reliably and \n     consistently below the maximum contaminant level.\n       ``(3) The guidelines issued by the Administrator under \n     paragraph (2) shall require that if, after the monitoring \n     program is in effect and operating, a contaminant covered by \n     the alternative monitoring program is detected at levels at \n     or above the maximum contaminant level or is no longer \n     reliably or consistently below the maximum contaminant level, \n     the public water system must either--\n       ``(A) demonstrate that the contamination source has been \n     removed or that other action has been taken to eliminate the \n     contamination problem, or\n       ``(B) test for the detected contaminant pursuant to the \n     applicable national primary drinking water regulation.\n       ``(c) Treatment as NPDWR.--All monitoring relief granted by \n     a State to a public water system for a regulated contaminant \n     under subsection (a) or (b) shall be treated as part of the \n     national primary drinking water regulation for that \n     contaminant.\n       ``(d) Other Monitoring Relief.--Nothing in this section \n     shall be construed to affect the authority of the States \n     under applicable national primary drinking water regulations \n     to alter monitoring requirements through waivers or other \n     existing authorities.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, as in \nexecutive session, the Senate immediately proceed to the consideration \nof the following Executive Calendar nominations, No. 513, James Jones; \nNo. 576, Donald Molloy.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed, en \nbloc, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, en bloc, and \nthe President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; that any \nstatements relating to any of the nominations appear at the appropriate \nplace in the Record, and the Senate then immediately return to \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nominations were considered and confirmed, en bloc, as follows:\n\n\n                             the judiciary\n\n       James P. Jones, of Virginia, to be U.S. District Judge for \n     the Western District of Virginia.\n       Donald W. Molloy, of Montana, to be U.S. District Judge for \n     the District of Montana.\n\n\n                      nomination of james p. jones\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, one characteristic shared by most top-notch \njudges is patience. It is an attribute which James P. Jones, the \nPresident's nominee to be United States District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of Virginia, has in abundance. This is fortunate, because he \nhas waited a very long time for this day. Jim was first nominated to be \na Federal district judge over 16 years ago, but his nomination became \nentangled in presidential politics and never came to the Senate floor \nfor consideration. That was 1980. He was recommended for this position \nagain last summer, renominated last December, favorably reported \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee in March, and has been pending \non the Executive Calendar ever since. I know he's relieved to have \nfinally completed this torturous journey, and I'm pleased that he will \nfinally be able to demonstrate what those of us acquainted with him \nhave known for years--that he will make an exemplary judge.\n  I have known Jim Jones for over 20 years. His experience will help \nhim discharge the responsibilities which will be placed upon him. He's \nbeen a litigator in private practice for almost 28 years. He has served \nas a state senator, assistant attorney general for the Commonwealth, \nand law clerk in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  In addition to his keen intellect and superior legal skills, Jim has \nthe character and even disposition crucial for a successful jurist. Not \nonly is Jim well-suited for the position, he has dedicated much of his \nlife outside his legal practice to public service. He has been involved \nin many community and bar-related activities, and he has recently \nserved as president of the Virginia Board of Education.\n  I was pleased to be given the opportunity to recommend Jim Jones to \nthe President for this nomination, and I am confident that Jim will \nserve with distinction as a Federal district court judge in the western \ndistrict of Virginia. I'm glad he will finally have a chance to serve.\n  With that Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for supporting this \nnomination and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/18/senate-section/article/S8327-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
