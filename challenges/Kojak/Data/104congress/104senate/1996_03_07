Mr. President, about 11 months ago, I stood on this floor \nand indicated to this body that it was about to make a crucial mistake, \na critical mistake. At that time the U.S. Senate was considering a \nmoratorium on the listing of endangered species. Those people at that \ntime who were calling for a so-called time out in the listing of \nendangered species, I do not think, or I hope, did not understand the \nconsequences. They did not want to wait for reauthorization of this \nlist. They did not want to wait for the reauthorization to take place \nthrough the legislative process. They said they could not wait for \nreforms to be deliberated and drafted by the committees of \njurisdiction. In fact, Mr. President, they could not even wait for the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee to consider the moratorium.\n  It was brought to the floor without a single hearing. There was \nnothing done in the way of a deliberative process to point out the \ninherent weaknesses of what was about to be done. In sum, they started, \nwithout justification, a piecemeal dismantling of the act, which is to \njeopardize forever the existence of various species of plants and \nanimals.\n  My colleagues reacted by giving pieces of history where the \nEndangered Species Act did not work well, and thereafter imposed the \nmoratorium on any further listing of endangered species. One Member of \nthe House of Representatives claimed at that time that ``we must put \nregulators on a leash.''\n  Mr. President, there are a number of ways to control regulators, but \nthe path taken was, in my opinion, the worst path. The path taken was \nto cause damaging and unreasonable requirements. In fact, we had to \nsimply stand by and watch extinction take its toll. No doubt that \nMember of the\n\n[[Page S1612]]\n\nother body overlooked the only real impact, which is the increased risk \nto plants and animals in an endangered state.\n  Mr. President, now, not a single plant or animal has been added to \nthe list since before April of last year. So, what good is this list? \nIt initiates the recovery through a planning process and provides the \nbenefit of State protections, and it affords restraint on Federal \nactivities which jeopardize listed species, and that is the need for \nlisting, to protect that which cannot protect itself.\n  What is it that we achieve by removing the protection? Everything the \ncritics hate--the process, the definitions, the mission of the \nEndangered Species Act--they all remain the same. We have not changed \nanything of that.\n  Mr. President, I think there are problems with the Endangered Species \nAct, things that need to be changed. The moratorium does not change a \nsingle thing. It did not touch the definitions, the process, the \nmission of the Endangered Species Act. They all are just like they were \nbefore April 10 of last year. Instead, my colleagues simply waged a war \non the variety of species that truly need protection. If reform of the \nlisting process had been intended, anyone could have talked to this \nSenator, who is the ranking member on the subcommittee with \njurisdiction, or my colleague, the esteemed, distinguished Senator from \nIdaho, the junior Senator, Senator Kempthorne, who is chairman of this \nsubcommittee, to talk about substantive reform. If the act was to be \nmade more efficient, then my colleagues could have addressed the many \nproposals that were brought forth by various coalitions throughout the \nlast session.\n  But, if my colleagues were honest with themselves and would recognize \nthat this moratorium sought neither to reform nor to protect but to \nprohibit protection of species, then I think we see the picture.\n  When the moratorium was passed in April of last year, there were \nabout 80 species that had been proposed for listing. Today, there are \nmore than 250 species listing decisions from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService and the National Marine Fisheries Service. In 1 year, because \nof our inactivity, we have three times more than we had then.\n  We were also told that there are another 270 candidate species which \nneed to be evaluated for either cooperative conservation agreements or \nproposed listings.\n  This has had a tremendous impact--the action taken by this body and \nthe other body last year. It has had a tremendous impact on individual \nspecies. Once the Florida black bear roamed throughout Florida, \nsouthern Georgia, and most all of Alabama. Thousands of these bears \nroamed this part of the country. Today, if we are lucky, there are \n1,200 to 1,500 bears remaining, and they are scattered and isolated.\n  The black bear, interestingly, Mr. President, is more important than \njust being a bear. It is known as an umbrella threshold species, whose \nown population well-being is reflective of the health of the rest of \nthe habitat area and the other species in that same ecosystem.\n  Currently, there are insufficient conservation areas in Florida to \nadequately protect the habitat base needed for long-term survival of \nthe State's black bear population.\n  This unique species, the Florida black bear, was scheduled to be \nlisted by 1996. But now because of the moratorium, the very future of \nthe black bear is bleak and really uncertain. Many scientists say the \nblack bear is finished.\n  The west coast steelhead of the Northwest has also steadily lost its \nhabitat and consequently consistently declined in population. This \nfish, which runs from California through Oregon and Washington and \nIdaho, is a game fish. The annual revenues from this sport fishery is \nvalued at about $32 million. It is in danger because of activities now \nbeing carried out because there is no protection under the Endangered \nSpecies Act.\n  Logging, urbanization, agricultural water diversion, dams, and \neffects of hatchery fish on native populations are all happening \nwithout any restraint, without any concern for species conservation, \nand are now being carried out because there is no protection of the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  The bog turtle of the Northeastern United States was proposed for \nlisting last year. Its protection was delayed because of the listing \nmoratorium, and biologists are now wondering if the remaining \npopulations will be viable once the moratorium is lifted. Probably not \nis the order. The bog turtle survives in wetlands which are separated \nby development. Consequently, the bog turtle has a difficult time \nfinding others of the species to mate with.\n  While the moratorium is in effect and the budget cuts deny execution \nof the act's mandate, the Fish and Wildlife Service is prohibited from \nconducting any research or taking actions to prevent further decline of \nthe bog turtle species.\n  The real tragedy is that there are countless others for which we have \nno current data and no concept of the welfare of the species. \nExtinction is forever. But we know there are some in trouble:\n  The swift fox;\n  There is a plant in New Jersey called the bog asphodel, a plant found \nonly in the State lands of New Jersey;\n  The Topeka shiner was to be protected by an agreement of private \nlandowners, but because more information needed to be collected, the \nagreement was not signed due to the moratorium.\n\n  All of these species which I have just talked about will be \nunmonitored and unprotected if the moratorium remains in place.\n  The moratorium, Mr. President, inherently costs time, effort, and \nspecies. I repeat that extinction is forever.\n  When we do resolve the reform issues for the Endangered Species Act, \nwe will have to do a great deal of research over again. We will be \nplaying catchup, and ultimately the moratorium will end up costing the \ntaxpayers more to recover a species that is further down the road to \nextinction.\n  Mr. President, the moratorium does not benefit the landowners or the \nregulated interests. On the contrary, the future of species on their \nland is as uncertain as it ever was. When the landowners throughout the \ncountry come to my office, they do not ask that we stop trying to \npreserve species. I have never heard anyone say that. They say they \nwant certainty in the process.\n  More importantly, the moratorium fails to acknowledge the permanency \nof extinction. We are spending time trying to come up with a reasonable \napproach to the Endangered Species Act. I have worked with Senator \nKempthorne, and I think we can come up with something. But I want to \nalert everyone here, Mr. President, as I did in the Appropriations \nCommittee yesterday, that when the appropriations bills--this bill, \nwhich is going to have five bills wrapped into one, the so-called \ncontinuing resolution--comes up in next few days, I am going to offer \nan amendment to do away with the moratorium. That is the right thing to \ndo.\n  What is needed is substantive reform. We need a more efficient \nlisting process with a deadline, with peer review, and with State and \nlocal participation in the process, making recovery plans practical \nwith such measures as deadlines, multispecies priorities, and \ncooperative efforts. That is essential to any substantive reform.\n  We need to bring non-Federal parties such as State and local \ngovernments and affected parties to the table to work cooperatively in \na teamwork approach that is vital to bringing balance to the delisting \nand recovering process.\n  We need to establish a relationship with private landowners, and it \nmust be changed to include voluntary conservation agreements, safe-\nharbor provisions providing the landowner protection for unforeseeable \nspecies habitat on their land, or private land, and we also need a \nshort-form habitat conservation plan from minimal impact landowners.\n  In effect, we should not have one program for all. We need to have \nvarious programs to meet the circumstances. We can do that.\n  But this moratorium, in my opinion, is cruel, it is unusual, and it \nis unnecessary.\n  Mr. President, I have said on other occasions, and I say today, that \nwe need to protect species of plant and animals. Extinction is forever.\n  Some within the sound of my voice may say, ``What difference does it \nmake? Why should we be concerned about an animal becoming extinct and\n\n[[Page S1613]]\n\nlosing it forever?'' If we do not care about animals, why in the world \nshould we care about plants?\n  I have a friend with whom I went to high school. He was one class \nahead of me. We played ball together. He had a son. His oldest boy hit \na home run in the Little League. He could not make it around the third \nbase. When he got to home, the parents were a little concerned that \nmaybe he was lazy. The fact of the matter was this little boy had \nleukemia. In those days, when children got leukemia, 20 or 25 years \nago, they died. They did not survive. Childhood leukemia was fatal. My \nfriend's little boy died, and he died quickly.\n\n  Mr. President, as a result of a plant called the periwinkle plant, \nscientists found that the substances from that plant allow children to \nlive. Children with leukemia now live because of the plant called \nperiwinkle. Childhood leukemia is no longer fatal, because of this \nplant.\n  About 40 percent of the curative substances we take come from plants, \nmany of them from the rain forests and other areas that are going out \nof business because of population density. I urge my colleagues who \nrecognize the need for substantive reform of the Endangered Species \nAct, who understand the devastating effect of this moratorium, will \nsupport an immediate repeal of this devastating moratorium and allow us \nto move forward with a sound, substantive, bipartisan reform of the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1611-6", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1613-S1614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE MAYR BROTHERS\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last weekend 170 employees of the Mayr \nBros. sawmill in Hoquim, WA, were notified that they were about to be \nlaid off. One-hundred and seventy individual workers is not a \nparticularly large number in connection with all of the layoffs that \nhave taken place across the Nation during the course of the last year. \nBut this is almost the last 170 workers for this particular mill. They \nare in addition to several thousand others in the area who have lost \ntheir jobs during the course of the last 4 or 5 years.\n  Hoquim, WA, the location of the mill, is a small city of about 9,000 \npeople. The Mayr Bros. mill is one of the few that remain in that city. \nIt has been a mainstay of this community for 63 years at this point in \nits history. Hoquim, Mr. President, to put it mildly, is not a \ndestination tourist resort by any stretch of the imagination. It is a \nworking-class community that has provided wood and fiber and paper \nproducts for the people of the United States for the entire length and \nbreadth of the 20th century.\n  These layoffs, however, are from a different cause than simply the \ndynamics of a constantly changing economy. They are taking place \nbecause of deliberate policies imposed by the Congress and by the \nadministration with respect to the harvest of timber in our national \nforests and on the lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management of \nthe United States.\n  It is particularly ironic in the light of these layoffs that the \njunior Senator from the State of Washington the day before yesterday \nintroduced a bill that would effectively cancel all of the harvest on \nFederal lands all across the country that were authorized by a \nrescissions bill signed as recently as last July by the President of \nthe United States, after extensive negotiations involving his office, \nmy office, and that of the distinguished Senator from Oregon [Mr. \nHatfield].\n  The owner and operator of Mayr Bros. mill, Tom Mayr, has left four \nFederal timber sales. They are commonly referred to as section 318 \nsales, named after that section of the fiscal year 1990 Interior \nAppropriations Act sponsored by then Senator Adams and Senator Hatfield \nto provide some interim relief while we determined the future \nmanagement of our national forests. But even those sales specifically \nauthorized by a fairly recent statute here have been held up for more \nthan 5 years just while a study respecting the marbled murrelet has \ngone on in the timber area.\n  Now, Tom Mayr is not the only person who is affected by those \nprovisions or by the Rescission Act provisions. Roughly 600 million \nboard feet of Federal timber contracts have been held up by the \nGovernment. In each case they have one feature in common. They \nrepresent contracts which were signed by the Federal Government \nauthorizing the harvest about which the Federal Government had second \nthoughts at some later period of time. As a consequence, if they are \nnot carried out, the Federal Government will have very considerable \ncontractual liabilities, at least $100 million--perhaps more than that.\n  Included in the Rescissions Act was language directing that the \nadministration release these timber sales unless one of these marbled \nmurrelets was known actually to be nested in the area. So they are \nsales in which there is no known nesting habitat for that particular \nspecies.\n  When President Clinton signed the bill, sale owners began to see some \nlight at the end of a very long tunnel but then the administration \nchanged its mind. Despite the fact that the language in the provision \nwas very clear and was discussed with representatives of the White \nHouse before it was passed and signed, it has literally taken court \norders to get the Clinton administration to implement the provision. As \na consequence, fewer than one-half of the sales covered by the \nprovision have been released and only those as a result of a court \norder.\n  Much has been made of these so-called salvage timber provisions in \nthe rescissions bill, so an outline of precisely what they contain \nshould be included in the Record at this point. First, the only one of \nthe three areas covered by the rescissions bill language on timber \nharvesting contracts is section 2001(k). Two other provisions, one on \ntimber salvage and one on the administration's own option 9 provisions, \nwere designed simply to help the administration carry out its own \npromises. They required the administration to do nothing at all. If it \nwished to repudiate its promises with respect to salvage timber or with \nrespect to the option 9 commitments of the President of the United \nStates to the people of the Pacific Northwest, it is entirely free to \ndo so unaffected by the provisions of the rescissions bill.\n\n  The areas that are covered by the bill on a mandatory basis involve \nless than 10,000 acres out of the 30 million acres of Federal \nforestland in Oregon and Washington, fewer than 1 acre out of 3,000. \nLet us put it in a slightly different fashion. If this provision were a \npermanent provision ordering this amount of harvest every year rather \nthan a one-time provision to honor past contracts, in 1,000 years fewer \nthan half of the acres in the national forests in these two States \nwould have been harvested once. In 1,000 years, fewer than half of the \nacres would have been harvested one time. The 600 million board feet \nrepresents one-tenth of the historic harvest level in the forests of \nthe Pacific Northwest and far, far less than the natural regeneration \nrate of those forests. We are talking about a tiny degree of relief, a \nvery modest degree of relief both for the people of timber country and \nfor that matter in connection with the demand of the people of the \nUnited States for forest products for paper production, for fiber \nproduction, for wood for the building of houses, and the like.\n  Even so, when the administration began to have second thoughts about \nthis provision, Senator Hatfield and I listened quite carefully to its \nviews, and in the bill passed by the Appropriations Committee yesterday \nto gather together all of the remaining appropriations bills in one \nomnibus proposal we have proposed two changes. We have made it much \neasier for the administration to exchange particular sale areas that it \nthinks are especially sensitive for others that are less sensitive \nassuming that the contractor goes along. We have also made it possible \nfor the administration to buy out certain sales if it can gain the \nconsent of the contracting party, and it can. We know of areas, \nincluding Mr. Mayr's areas, in which it can do so. But it is required \nto use the money already appropriated to it and not simply to do as the \nadministration wishes, to come up with another $100 million unaccounted \nfor, to be added to the deficit to be sent as a bill to our children \nand grandchildren. If it can find other ways in which to come up with \npresently appropriated money to purchase these sales or can find other \nareas in which to\n\n[[Page S1614]]\n\nmake exchanges of such sales, it can do so.\n  I think it would be especially ironic if the legislation to repeal \nthe rescissions bill were to pass in the immediate aftermath of this \nmost recent set of layoffs. It shows a tremendous indifference to the \nfaith of hard-working people who have paid their taxes and built their \ncommunities over the better part of this century.\n  There are those who claim to be offended by this law, so offended \nthat they call for its repeal. I am offended; I am offended by their \ncomplete and total lack of compassion that this proposal shows to these \nhard-working people and to the American economy and to the countless \nothers before them who have lost their timber-related jobs as a result \nof similar policies.\n  I am offended by the total indifference to the cost of the \nrepudiation of legal contracts entered into by the Government, \nshrugging them off on the proposition that someone else can pay for \nthem sometime in the future and that we will simply add another bill to \nthe taxpayers of the United States.\n  Mr. President, we will be debating this issue during the course of \nthe next several days. I will have some charts demonstrating \ngraphically the statistics I have outlined, that we are talking about \nan extremely modest proposal. We are speaking of far less harvest than \nthe President's own promises as recently as 2 years ago to the people \nof the Pacific Northwest. We are simply enabling the President to keep \nthe promises that he made, that he now, in an election year, desires to \nignore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1613-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--H.R. 497\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I first want to make a general observation \nwith respect to the previous Senator's statement on the salvage sales. \nI think we all agree that we are striving for balance here; namely, we \nwant to assure that dead, diseased, dying timber, that is, salvaged \ntimber, is harvested appropriately. That means there is a role to speed \nup salvage sales, but we also want to make sure we do not abuse our \nenvironmental statutes, abuse environmental protections.\n  I know the Senator, as all Senators are, is hoping to try to find the \ncorrect balance between those two extremes. One extreme is to go in and \ncut timber, dead, diseased, dying timber, and also green timber, as we \ndo not want to abuse the salvage sale provision, but at the same time \nwe want to make sure that our environmental statutes are adequately \nprotected, because all Americans want balance and they want to make \nsure our forests are protected and want to make sure that they are also \nproperly managed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1614-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1614-S1615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE FUTURE OF MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is all too easy for people in \nWashington to lose sight of what really matters. What really matters is \nhow decisions made here in Washington actually affect average American \nfamilies. The Medicare Program is a good example.\n  As the future of Medicare is debated, we are going to hear a lot of \nfancy words, a lot of concepts thrown around by both sides. But let us \nnot forget that premiums, deductibles, copayments, and managed care \nmean nothing in and of themselves. Let us not lose sight of the bottom \nline. The bottom line is how the Medicare Program helps people, \naverage, hard-working, descent people in my home State of Montana and \nacross the Nation.\n\n  Are the proposed changes in Medicare going to actually help seniors \nlive in dignity and security? Will they actually help average working \nfamilies begin to plan for a secure retirement? Will they actually give \nthese same families the peace of mind of knowing that they will not be \nforced to shoulder the costs of their parents' medical expenses?\n  Not long ago I was going through my mail from home and I came across \na letter that helped drive these points home. It came from Mrs. Ethel \nOstheller in Libby, MT. Libby, you might know, is a small town in the \nnorthwest corner of our State.\n  Mrs. Ostheller is 85 years old. She is widowed and lives off Social \nSecurity. She has had some serious health problems. She had a heart \nattack. She still owes a little over $700 to the hospital, and she now \npays about $150 each month for prescription drugs, none of which is \ncovered by Medicare.\n  She writes to me about these problems. Let me just read to you the \nclosure of her letter which reflects her concern, but yet the optimism \nwhich is so typical of people across our country.\n\n       So with all of this, I'm worried [she writes]. I wonder \n     what more can happen. But I'm not as bad off as lots of \n     others. I'm trusting in God, living one day at a time, and I \n     keep busy.\n\n  I think that typifies and represents the decency and the goodness and \nthe basic common goodness of Americans.\n  How will any changes in Medicare affect people like Ethel Ostheller? \nThat is what this debate is about. For her and thousands of other \nMontanans, Medicare is a health issue but also a pocketbook issue. It \nhelps them plan for a secure retirement and to make ends meet. That is \nwhy we must work to assure that Medicare remains solvent and that the \nMedicare trust fund is not raided, not raided in order to pay for other \nprograms or to pay for tax breaks for the very wealthy, as was the case \nin Speaker Gingrich's budget last year. That is also why we must work \nto assure that the Medicare Program is run as efficiently as possible. \nUnfortunately, that is not the case for either Medicare or Medicaid \ntoday.\n  The General Accounting Office estimates that about 10 percent of \nMedicare's total costs result from waste, from fraud, from abuse. That \nis about $18 billion this year; 10 percent wasted or lost through fraud \nor abuse.\n  We all know that $18 billion is a lot of money, but let me put this \nin perspective: $18 billion is enough money to run the government of \nthe entire State of Montana for 6 years.\n  More to the point, $18 billion is enough money to reduce the health \ncare costs of every Medicare recipient by $500 each year. That is $500 \neach year Medicare patients now pay because of Government waste, fraud, \nand abuse in the Medicare Program. That drives up--that fraud and \nabuse--Medicare costs. It is robbing our seniors, robbing people like \nEthel Ostheller, of hundreds of dollars each year.\n  How does this happen? Typically, it involves fraudulent billing \npractices by a Medicare or Medicaid provider; that is, a doctor or a \nhospital, one of the various providers. It occurs in every State in the \nNation and in every segment of our health care industry. There have \nbeen abuses in ambulance services, clinical laboratories, medical \nequipment suppliers, home health care, nursing homes, physician and \npsychiatric services, and rehabilitation.\n\n  Let me cite some examples. These were uncovered by the General \nAccounting Office and also by the Senate Special Committee on Aging.\n  A medical equipment company in California billed Medicaid half a \nmillion dollars for merchandise they said they delivered to needy \npatients. What happened? It was a ruse. The patients did not need the \nequipment; the company never made delivery of the equipment, but they \nsent the taxpayers the bill anyway.\n  Another example: Medicare paid $7.4 million to a company for surgical \nbandages that were never used.\n  And still another case in Great Falls, MT--unfortunately, my home \nState: An ophthalmologist overbilled Medicare by $200,000. He was \nprosecuted and convicted by our U.S. attorney in Billings.\n  While these incidents may be extreme, they are not isolated. Frankly, \nI am disappointed with the Federal\n\n[[Page S1615]]\n\nagencies that are supposed to have jurisdiction over all this. They \nhave let this go unchecked for too long and have only recently begun to \ntake action. I must say they are not alone.\n  A tough approach to fraud and abuse is almost completely lacking in \nthe Gingrich plan that Congress is considering. The $270 billion in \ncuts, which was so harsh on beneficiaries and hospitals, contained a \npathetically low amount for fighting fraud and abuse.\n  We must have zero tolerance for those who willfully cheat the \nMedicare system--zero. Ultimately, they are stealing money from \nordinary Americans, average American families. They are stealing money \naway from seniors, people like Ethel Ostheller, who depend upon \nMedicare to help make ends meet. They are also stealing money from \nmillions of Americans who are working today and deserve to know that \nMedicare will be there when it is time for all of them to retire.\n  In the weeks ahead, I intend to come forward with proposals to get \ntough on Medicare fraud. I look forward to working with a number of my \ncolleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, to find commonsense \nsolutions to this very serious problem.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1614-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ACTION TAKEN ON H.R. 497 VITIATED\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, when Minnesotans gather to talk about the \nissues that matter to them most, as they did on Tuesday at their \nprecinct caucuses, there is a common theme that weaves between nearly \nall of them, especially when they are speaking directly from their \nhearts.\n  They are looking for a better life.\n  They want a good job that pays a decent wage. They want to put enough \nfood on the table. They want a strong roof over their heads, for many, \na place they can call their own.\n  And after the bills have been paid, they would like a little extra at \nthe end of the month to squirrel away in a savings account.\n  The most striking truth about seeking that better life is that most \nfolks aren't doing it just for themselves. They are pursuing it for \ntheir children, too, in the hopes of offering them the best \nopportunities for success.\n  In other words, they are searching for prosperity.\n  It is interesting that prosperity and the struggle to achieve it has \nspread across the Nation to become a major theme of the 1996 \npresidential campaigns. The media have just begun to focus on the \ntroubles facing working people, and the stagnating wages and high taxes \nthat have pushed prosperity out of reach for many middle-class \nfamilies.\n  But where have the media been? Working families have been feeling the \npinch for a long time.\n  ``Our economy is the healthiest is has been in three decades,'' \nannounced President Clinton in his State of the Union Address.\n  Is it really? There is plenty of evidence to the contrary--and four \nareas are especially troublesome:\n  First, the economy itself has dropped to a sluggish pace. The Federal \nGovernment released new numbers just last week confirming that economic \ngrowth has slowed to a trickle, up by only nine-tenths of a percent \nduring the last 3 months of 1995.\n  Second, job growth has slowed as well, to about half the rate we'd \nexpect to see in a normal recovery.\n  The U.S. Labor Department says that pay and benefit increases last \nyear saw their lowest climb in about 14 years, since the Government \nfirst began tracking these statistics.\n  They could, in fact, be the leanest increases since before World War \nII, an unfortunate trend analysts say could easily continue.\n  Third, wages continue to slip as Americans take home fewer and fewer \ndollars.\n  Real weekly earnings for an average worker dropped three-tenths of a \npercent in 1995. That means families are taking home almost $800 a year \nless than they did before President Clinton was elected in 1992.\n  That is $800 they no longer have to spend on necessities such as \ngroceries, medical expenses, or insurance.\n  Fourth, while the economy is slowing down, taxes have accelerated.\n  Americans have never paid a higher percentage of their income in \ntaxes than they are paying today.\n  In 1950, an average worker paid about 2 percent of his earnings to \nsupport our Federal Government. Today, an average family sends 25 \npercent or more of its earnings to Washington, and that does not \ninclude the additional tax burden once State and local taxes are heaped \non top of that.\n  Now if the economy itself was not blocking the road toward \nprosperity, the record high taxes alone would have done it. Together, \nthey have proven to be a lethal combination for American families and \nAmerican workers.\n  None of this will come as any surprise to middle-class, working \nAmericans.\n  After all, they are the ones paying the taxes at the same time they \nwatch their paychecks shrink.\n  But they can find some comfort in the fact that it is their \nanxieties--that is, the anxieties of parents hoping to eke out a better \nlife for themselves and their children in the face of tremendous \nobstacles--that will perhaps become the defining issues of the 1996 \nelections.\n  It all comes down to economic growth, income, and jobs.\n  We know what is blocking the way, but how did the roadblock get there \nin the first place?\n  Do you remember the prank we used to pull when we were kids, when we \nwould attach a dollar bill to the end of a fishing line and plant it in \nthe middle of a sidewalk?\n  As soon as someone spied the bill and reached down to grab it, we \nwould yank on the string, moving that dollar out of reach and leaving \nthe poor victim embarrassed and empty-handed.\n  That is what the Clinton administration is doing to the middle class. \nThey tempt working Americans with a dollar bill and the prosperity it \nrepresents, but they yank it away just as soon as somebody begins to \nget close to it.\n  Rather than offering opportunities for success, the Government has \nallowed working people to become trapped between falling incomes and \nrising taxes. Whatever you call it--the ``middle-class squeeze'' or the \n``Clinton crunch''--it is cheating the middle class out of their hard-\nearned dollars.\n  Just look at your paycheck, look at your tax forms, look at what you \nare paying for government, who is spending your money, and how they are \nspending it. In most cases, the bureaucrats have your credit card and \nare spending it, I believe, without any real accountability.\n  It should make Americans angry that much of the money they work so \nhard for is being wasted on programs that do not work, or plainly just \ncost too much.\n  Unfortunately, past discussions about issues like wage stagnation and \neconomic growth have too often centered around the minimum wage or \ncorporate profits, and that is not what working men and women care \nabout, though.\n  They are interested in their net income--what is left after you take \nout Federal taxes, State taxes, payroll taxes. And under the Clinton \nadministration, there has been less and less left over in your pay \nenvelope, thanks in part to the President's tax increases and the \nFederal mandates that are sapping the precious resources of our job \nproviders, businesses have been forced to keep wages lower.\n\n[[Page S1616]]\n\n  They would like to invest their dollars improving salaries and \nbenefits, but any additional dollars that might have been available to \nimprove the lives of employees have been confiscated by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Even when job providers find the means to offer wage and benefit \nincreases, tax hikes mean families do not see much of a difference in \ntheir paychecks after it is done.\n  And so family incomes--the amount of dollars they have left to spend \non food, transportation, clothing, housing, et cetera--have actually \ndropped every year of the Clinton Presidency.\n  A Government-mandated increase in the minimum wage is not the only \nsolution--although many argue that is all we have to do and many \nproblems would be cured--because low wages alone are not the problem.\n  The Clinton administration simply cannot stop spending, and requiring \nmore and more tax dollars to feed that spending, taking away most of \nthe money that could be used for better salaries, or new jobs.\n  If the Government would reform itself, if it would curb its spending \nand cut taxes, middle-class families would not need a hike in the \nminimum wage or risk losing their jobs because of it.\n  In our current economic climate, it is the working folks who have the \nmost to lose. The wealthy do not need our help. The poor already have \nthe safety net of welfare and the hundreds of Federal programs it opens \nup to them. But who is watching out for the working people? They are \nthe ones being squeezed.\n  Yet the Clinton administration just does not get it, despite all the \ntalk from the White House about the need to reform Government and \nbalance the budget.\n  Just last week, President Clinton requested an additional $8 billion \nfrom Congress for increased domestic discretionary spending.\n  How can you go on national television one week to declare that ``the \nera of big Government is over,'' and then come to Congress just a few \nweeks later, hat in hand, asking for another 8 billion dollars' worth \nof even bigger Federal Government?\n  Where do we get the money--higher taxes, or borrow it and make our \nkids pay?\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle still do not get it, \neither.\n  They staked out a new agenda of their own last week as part of a \ncampaign to portray themselves as the soul of the working class. \nIncredibly, their proposal includes more job-killing taxes on the \nNation's job providers.\n  That, of course, comes after they spent months trying to delay and \nderail our efforts to balance the budget and offer meaningful tax \nrelief to American families.\n  Republicans have put on the table a balanced budget, welfare reform \nand Medicare reform. But who has stood in the way of getting that \npassed so the American people can begin to enjoy the benefits? It has \nbeen the Democratic leaders in this Congress and the President who have \nkept that from happening.\n  Mr. President, too many years of big Government have proven it: more \ntaxes, more spending, more regulations, and more Government programs \nwill not lead to more jobs and higher pay. We will never tax our way to \nprosperity or spend our way to economic success.\n  Unlike those Johnny-come-latelys in the White House and here on \nCapitol Hill who talk a good game about serving the middle class but \nnever step up to the plate on their behalf, the taxpayers' agenda \nRepublicans are fighting for has always been focused on the working \nclass.\n  We have heard their calls for tax relief--and we delivered.\n  We have heard their calls for opening the economy to more jobs, \nbetter paying jobs--and we delivered.\n  We have heard their calls for balancing the budget and putting an end \nto the legacy of debt we have imposed on our children and \ngrandchildren--and we delivered.\n  We have heard the pleas of working Americans who ask for nothing more \nthan a chance to reach prosperity--and again we delivered.\n  In the name of America's working class, we shipped each one of those \nproposals to the White House--and the President sent each of them back \nstamped ``Return to Sender.''\n  Mr. President, the balanced budget passed by this Congress, with its \ntax cuts and incentives to help stimulate growth and create jobs, is \nthe best way we can help average Americans troubled by an economy that \nis heading down.\n  We agree that the key to creating economic prosperity and good jobs \nis a healthy business climate.\n  We understand that those jobs can help instill independence and \ndignity, and create more opportunities for anyone trying to get ahead.\n  And we know that the key to empowering families to reach that better \nlife, however they may define it, is to cut taxes and let them keep \nmore of their own dollars.\n  Mr. President, for the working-class people of this Nation who have \nbuilt their own success and today lead the lives they have always \nwanted, prosperity is not defined by the size of their last Federal \nhandout or how much something they got for nothing.\n  It is oftentimes about building something out of nothing, which, \nafter all, is the definition of the American dream.\n  I urge the President to put aside the election-year politicking and \ntake a real stand on the side of the working class by working with \nCongress to right the economic wrongs created by his administration.\n  It is not too late to give prosperity a chance, but it would be \nirresponsible to make Americans wait until the November elections have \ncome and gone before we really try.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized to \nspeak for up to 30 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1615-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1616-S1617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FRESHMAN FOCUS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, you will be relieved to know I will not \ntake 30 minutes. I have shared it with my friend from Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, the freshman focus has been in here now for a couple \nof days, talking about the economy and talking about ways that we can \nstrengthen American families, strengthen the economy, strengthen wages, \nstrengthen jobs. The interesting part of it is that is what we have \nbeen talking about here for the last year. That is what we have been \ntalking about when we talk about balancing the budget, when we talk \nabout regulatory reform, when we talk about tax relief. Unfortunately, \nI think in our communications too often the perception is that we are \ntalking about those things because they are what is in our mind--tax \nrelief and balancing the budget. We really ought to be talking about \nthe benefits of those things. That is why we are doing it.\n  We are balancing the budget for a result, and one of the results, of \ncourse, is the fiscal and moral responsibility to pay for what we are \nusing and not to put onto our children and grandchildren a $5 trillion \ndebt, $260-billion-a-year interest payment, a lifetime interest payment \nfor a youngster born today of $180,000. We really ought to be talking \nabout that.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle stood up yesterday and \nsaid, ``We want to start talking about the economy. We want to start \nthe conversation.''\n  Excuse me? That is what we have been talking about for a year. That \nis the very thing that the Democrats have blocked all year long--a \nbalanced budget, help to create jobs, tax reform, so that people will \ninvest money in the economy and create jobs so families have more money \nin their pockets to spend. That is what we are talking about, jobs and \nwages and an economy that grows.\n  Unfortunately, we have not always had the information. The President, \nI think, maybe this year, has said our economy has been the healthiest \nit has been in three decades. I am sorry, Mr. President, but maybe you \nneed to look at some of the information that comes from your agencies.\n  Employment data: Unemployment rose from 5.6 to 5.8 in January. The \nhealthiest economy in 30 years? Not for workers. Increases in workers' \nwages and benefits are the lowest in 14 years. After accounting for \ninflation, the rise in wages is an abysmal 0.3 percent. At least part \nof it is the fact that the economy has grown more slowly in the\n\n[[Page S1617]]\n\nlast 4 years than it has grown in the previous 15.\n  This year's growth was 1.8, I believe. The last quarter was .9 when \nwe were more accustomed to 3.5, or 4.5 growth.\n  Why is that? There is a great argument about why that is, of course. \nThe Senator from New Mexico yesterday talked about a program in which \nthe Government would decide which are class A corporations. We would \nhave more regulation and seek to have the Government more involved. \nThat is a point of view, and not one that I agree with.\n  On the contrary, it seems to me that what we need to do to spark the \neconomy is to have tax relief so that there is more money in the \nprivate sector to invest in job creation and to do something about \nregulatory reform.\n  I come from a background of small business, and I have some idea of \nhow costly it is to meet the requirements of the regulations. Nobody is \nsaying do away with all regulations, but we are saying that there are \nways to do it that are less expensive, that are more efficient, and \nthat will encourage small business.\n  I do not know how many people have heard of small businesses who say, \n``I am not going to fight it anymore. It is not worth it. I have put in \nall of this effort and really take home very little.''\n  So, Mr. President, that is what it is about, and we have an \nopportunity to do that. We have an opportunity--starting last year. \nAnd, frankly, we have had opposition from the White House. We have had \nopposition from the minority Democrats. They do not want regulatory \nreform. That is available. We can do that. Balance the budget--we are \nstill in the process of that. What is so magic about balancing the \nbudget, for Heaven's sake? We have not done it for 30 years. Everyone \nelse has done it. You have to do it in your family. You have to do it \nin your business. It is a constitutional requirement in Wyoming. The \nlegislature is meeting now. When they came, they knew. ``Here is the \nrevenue we have, and here is the expenditure that we are allowed to \nmake.''\n  They do not do as we have done in the Congress for 30 years and say, \n``Here is the revenue. Here is the expenditure. Put it on the kids' \ncredit cards.''\n  That is what we need to do in order to do something about the \neconomy, Mr. President. I hope that we will do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1616-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATOR HENRY SCHWARTZ\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge today one of \nmy State's--Wyoming's--unsung heroes, Senator Henry Schwartz, who \nserved our great State from 1936 to 1942.\n  Senator Schwartz did much for Wyoming. But today I would like to \nfocus on his efforts during the 76th session of Congress when he had \namended the National Defense Act to establish a school specifically for \nthe training of black pilots.\n  While military opportunities for minorities increased after the Civil \nWar--like the establishment of the famed Buffalo Soldiers who fought \nand died for our country on the western frontier--there were very few, \nif any, opportunities available in the Air Force, at that time, the Air \nCorps.\n  To challenge that trend, in 1939 representatives of the African-\nAmerican community asked Congress to consider allowing blacks to be \nmilitary pilots. The matter had been given little consideration until \nSenator Schwartz submitted an amendment to the National Defense Act \nwhich established a training school specifically for African Americans. \nThe amendment passed with a vote of 77 to 8, and history was made.\n  With the help of the Senator from Wyoming, legends like Benjamin O. \nDavis, Jr., America's first black Air Force general and commander of \nthe 99th Pursuit Squadron--also known as The Tuskegee Airmen--was given \na chance to serve this country.\n  Past and future aviators, from astronauts to fighter pilots, will \ncontinue to rise in the defense of America because of Henry Schwartz's \nwork.\n  So today I rise to acknowledge the work of Senator Henry Schwartz and \nsincerely thank him. His genuine belief in affording all Americans the \nopportunity to achieve is his legacy to this Nation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

AND RELATED MATTERS--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion to proceed to \nSenate Resolution 227.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to consider a resolution (S. Res. 227) to \n     authorize the use of additional funds for salaries and \n     expenses of the Special Committee to Investigate Whitewater \n     Development Corporation and related matters, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the motion.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I believe that we have a constitutional \nobligation to get the facts as it relates to the Whitewater Committee \nand its work, which is incomplete. It is not nearly complete. It is not \ncomplete for a variety of reasons. The fact of the matter is that just \nthis past Saturday--actually late on a Friday--this committee received \na letter from a very prominent lawyer. That lawyer represents Bruce \nLindsey. Bruce Lindsey is President Clinton's close friend, confidant, \nand assistant.\n  For months and months and months, Mr. Lindsey and his attorney were \naware of the fact that we were seeking all notes and all relevant \nmaterial that he may have had in connection with Whitewater. We know \nthat he was part of this Whitewater strategic team. We know that. Mr. \nLindsey testified that he did not take notes. We were concerned and we \nhad reason to believe that he did take notes.\n  Mr. Lindsey's attorney sends us a letter, very interestingly, dated \nMarch 1. That is after the deadline for our committee's work or the \nappropriation for our committee. He sends us the notes that we had \nasked him about, which he had first denied ever having taken. There are \ntwo pages, all about Whitewater and various questions--like who made \ntelephone calls in connection with it to Bill Kennedy, Randy Coleman, \nHale, and other people involved in it. And then he tells us in his \nconcluding sentence that he has additional documents, and he claims a \nprivilege--not a privilege between himself, being Mr. Lindsey's \nlawyer--but he raises a privilege between himself and these documents \nbeing sent, that they are attorney-client discussions and \ncommunications with the President's counsel.\n  Now, first, we have the White House saying they would not raise the \nissue of privilege. Second, we have no way of knowing if this \ninformation falls within that domain. Third, in order to keep his \nclient from obviously thwarting the will of the committee and its \nsubpoena, he cloaks this. Understand, if anybody can simply say that \nthese are documents or information that I shared with the President's \ncounsel, that would automatically thwart us from getting information. \nThat is what this is about. This is a way of keeping information from \nus and not, obviously, being in a position where he is in contempt of a \nduly authorized, issued subpoena. That is what is going on. It is \nincredible.\n  Now, our attorneys have written to him. Our attorneys have written \nand we have asked to see the so-called privilege log that would exist, \nand we have been denied that. We have been given no response to this. \nHere we have people who want to cut off this investigation. They want \nto cut it off. Well, I have to tell you that when we get information \nthat comes in after the work of the committee, that we hoped had been \nconcluded, and get information from key White House officials, I have \nto suggest that that is why it becomes\n\n[[Page S1618]]\n\nvery difficult and dangerous to set a time certain for the conclusion \nof an investigation.\n  Indeed, in the book ``Men of Zeal,'' the former Democratic leader, \nSenator George Mitchell, said exactly that. He said this about when you \nset time lines:\n\n       The committee's deadline provided a convenient stratagem \n     for those who were determined not to cooperate. Bureaucrats \n     in some agencies appeared to be attempting to thwart the \n     investigative process by delivering documents at an \n     extraordinary slow pace. The deadline provided critical \n     leverage for attorneys of witnesses in dealing with the \n     committee on whether their clients would appear without \n     immunity, and when in the process they might be called.\n\n  This is exactly what is taking place--holding back documents and \ndocumentation until the critical moment. Wait until the committee goes \nout of existence and then say, ``Oh, by the way, I was culling my files \n* * *'' Look, that is preposterous. This is the second major player to \ndo this, the other being Mr. Ickes and his lawyer. Guess what his \nlawyer found? Mr. Ickes is deputy chief of the White House. His lawyer \nfound the same kind of information. Guess what? In the same way. He \nculled his files and found them. Why would you not undertake this when \nwe issued subpoenas months and months and months ago?\n  There have been more editorials than this Senator cares to go \nthrough. Almost by a 5-to-1 ratio, the editorials say the Whitewater \nwork should continue. Even though they did not say it should continue \nwithout a deadline, they indicate that, obviously, the work and the \ninvestigation has to be conducted in a way not to unduly politicize \nthis investigation. We understand that there are political \nramifications. We understand that on both sides.\n  I think it is instructive to look at two articles. One is the New \nYork Times. I do not deprecate any source of editorials. They have a \nright to think what they do. I think it is instructive when they say, \n``The Senate's duty cannot be truncated because of the campaign \ncalendar.'' That is the New York Times, not Senator D'Amato. That is \nnot a partisan vehicle for Republican or conservative policies. Very \nclearly, the question then is: What are my friends afraid of? What is \nthe White House afraid of? What are they hiding? What are they hiding?\n  Now, it has been said that, ``You will never end this.'' Look, I will \nput forth now that we are willing to say we will conclude this in 4 \nmonths. We think the trial will take 6 to 8 weeks, maybe a little \nlonger. That would give us 6 to 8 weeks, depending on when the trial in \nLittle Rock ends. Why do I say trial? There are key witnesses, who have \nbeen unavailable, that this committee would like to examine. We would \nlike to examine them and find out what they know or what they do not \nknow. By the way, some of them may be unwilling to come in.\n  I do not know how much more generous we can be. Certainly, to set a \ntime deadline of April 5 is silly and would guarantee that we could not \nbring in these witnesses. It would guarantee, I think, the kind of \nthing that we got in that letter that was sent to us, in which the \nlawyer, in a very artful way, claims attorney-client privileged \ncommunications with the private counsel for the President.\n  What we will do is have all of these witnesses that we seek to get \ndocuments from simply talking to the President's lawyer, and then you \nhave automatic attorney-client privilege raised. That is wrong. We may \nhave to fight that out, and we may have to take it to the floor of the \nSenate and ask for enforcement of the subpoena, and we will do it. We \nwill do it.\n  I do not know if those documents or that information will give us new \ninformation, information that we are not aware of. But I have to ask, \n``why would you hold this back?''\n  Why would you not let us see the so-called privileged log so we could \ndetermine whether or not this was noted as something that was \nprivileged earlier on, or is this just a convenient way to keep the \ncommittee from getting information and the American people from getting \nfacts they are entitled to.\n  I had a radio commentator who said, ``I am sick of this Whitewater.'' \nI have to tell you, ours is not to be an extraordinary, wonderful show. \nThat is not the job of this committee. Ours is not to be entertaining. \nOurs is to get the facts. That is what we are attempting to do. But we \nhave been thwarted every inch of the way.\n  Again, here is the New York Times. What do they say? ``The Senate's \nduty cannot be canceled or truncated because of the campaign \ncalendar.'' Then it goes on to say something very illuminating: ``Any \ncertain date for terminating the hearings would encourage even more \ndelay in producing subpoenaed documents that the committee has endorsed \nsince it started last July. The committee has been forced to await such \nevents as the criminal trial next week of James McDougal, a Clinton \nbusiness partner in the failed Whitewater land venture.''\n  Now, these are facts. Facts. We have not had the factual information \nwe have required and we are entitled to. We have been dealt with, I \nbelieve, disingenuously by many of the witnesses through their counsels \nin holding back information. I cannot believe a lawyer, in terms of \nsearching for information, would not have revealed the facts and \ninformation repeatedly. If one were to look at the transcripts of the \ntestimony, we will see witnesses who cannot remember, who forget over \nand over and over again.\n  Officer O'Neill, the uniformed officer who was on duty at the White \nHouse the night of Vincent Foster's death, testified he was about to \nsecure Foster's office. He saw Maggie Williams. Who is Maggie Williams? \nShe is the assistant chief of staff to the First Lady, Hillary Clinton. \nHe saw her carrying records out of Foster's office and place them in \nher office.\n  Now, his testimony is very detailed. Williams and other White House \ninsiders present at the same time, deny the records were removed. \nWilliams testified that she did not remove documents from his office.\n  The fact of the matter is we found documents, billing records that we \nknow were in the possession of Mr. Foster. We know that; we have his \nown personal handwriting affixed to the billing documents. Guess where \nthey show up? Upstairs in the residence of the White House.\n  Now, how do you think they got there? How do you think they got \nthere? By the way, Officer O'Neill has no reason to make up a story. He \nis not going to make a story up.\n  We have another young man by the name of Castleton. Officer O'Neill \nsays, ``I saw Evelyn Lieberman walk out of the counsel suite; she stood \nin front of the doorway, and I looked at her.'' Again, locking the \noffice was mentioned.\n\n       A few seconds later, I saw her come out with Mr. Nussbaum, \n     come out behind her, and I saw Maggie Williams come out and \n     turn to the direction I was standing and carrying what I \n     would describe as folders, and she had them down in front of \n     her as she walked down in the direction of where I was \n     standing. She started to enter her office. She had to brace \n     the folders on her arm, on a cabinet, and then she entered \n     the office and came out within a few more seconds and locked \n     the door.\n\n  How did he know that this was Maggie Williams? He says, ``When Maggie \nWilliams did walk out of the office and walked in my direction, Miss \nLieberman said, `That is Maggie Williams. She is the First Lady's chief \nof staff.' ''\n  He goes on.\n\n       Question. A lot of questions have been asked about the fact \n     you indicated some uncertainty whether there was a box on top \n     of the folders. Are you in any doubt that Maggie Williams was \n     carrying folders as she walked out of the White House \n     counsel's office and walked past you into her own office?\n       Answer. I am not in any doubt about it at all, sir.\n       Question. Were you not sure, right?\n       Answer. I was, yes, sir.\n       Question. You are not playing games with us and not going \n     to tell us you are certain about something if you are not?\n       Answer. No, sir.\n\n  Let me continue here. There is a young man by the name of Castleton, \na White House intern who worked on the Clinton 1992 campaign; this is \nnot a person who is out to get President Clinton. He testified that at \nMaggie William's request, he carried a box of documents that had been \nremoved from Vincent Foster's office. This box was moved from Maggie \nWilliam's office to the First Lady's personal residence. During the \ntrip to the First Lady's office, Castleton testifies that Williams told \nhim that the First Lady wanted to review these records.\n  Now, Maggie Williams, she does not remember. She did not remember. \nShe\n\n[[Page S1619]]\n\nsays that she would never tell him that. Why would she tell this fellow \nthis? That is what she testifies to.\n  Why would Castleton make up a story like that? How do you think \nrealistically the billing files turned up in the personal residence--\nthe billing files of the Rose Law Firm; the billing files that really \npoint to critical times and dates; the billing files that demonstrate \nthat indeed the Rose Law Firm and Mrs. Clinton in particular had \nnumerous calls with Seth Ward, Seth Ward being the eventual purchaser, \none of the purchasers of the Castle Grande property. I think there were \n14 to 15 conversations, meetings and/or calls, during a relatively \nshort period of time, during a matter of 4 or 5 months. This is not \ninconsequential. This is Seth Ward, Webb Hubble's father-in-law.\n  One would ask, why would Webb Hubble not have been doing that work? \nOne would have to come to the conclusion, given the nature of those \ntransactions--and those transactions wound up costing the American \ntaxpayers, ultimately, $3.8 million, taxpayers' money--that those \ntransactions were not bona fide. As a matter of fact, Federal officials \nhave characterized them as ``sham transactions'' that really were the \nkind of thing that led to the looting of the bank.\n  ``Let me ask you, when Mr. Chertoff raised the question to Mr. \nCastleton, did you understand that the box you were taking was a box of \nfiles that originated in Mr. Foster's office?''\n  ``I did understand that, sir.'' This is Mr. Castleton, a young man \nthat worked on the Clinton campaign; he still works at the White House.\n\n       Mr. Chertoff. You heard that from Maggie Williams?\n       Mr. Castleton. Yes.\n       Mr. Chertoff. Let me ask you, Mr. Castleton, on the way to \n     the residence after you picked up the box, you were walking \n     up with Maggie Williams on the way to your residence. What \n     were you told by Maggie Williams about the box being taken up \n     to the residence?\n       Mr. Castleton. I was told that the contents of the box \n     needed to be reviewed.\n       Mr. Chertoff. Reviewed by whom?\n\n  This is a young man that worked on the Clinton campaign in 1992, a \nyoung man who was working in the White House, a young man who still \nworks in the White House.\n\n       Mr. Castleton. By the First Lady.\n       Mr. Chertoff. And is this something that Margaret Williams \n     told you as you were walking up?\n       Mr. Castleton. As we were walking from the place where I \n     originally picked up the boxes to the residence.\n\n  Now, counsel goes on further. This young man is unequivocal. I have \nto ask a question: Why would he lie? Why would Officer O'Neill lie? Why \nwould he lie? He had no reason to make this up. Why would somebody who, \nas a partisan, has every right to be for one or the other--he went out \nand worked for the President--why would he would deliberately just make \nthis up out of his head?\n  And then, do not forget there were intervening times. They could have \nsaid, ``I imagined; I heard.'' He did not do that. It was unequivocal.\n  Counsel says, ``Now, what did Margaret Williams say to you?''\n  ``Miss Huber, she called.''\n  Miss Huber is a longtime Clinton aide who eventually found the \nbilling records. Where? In the personal residence of the First Lady and \nthe President.\n\n       Miss Huber. She called and said that Mrs. Clinton had asked \n     her to call me to take her to the residence to put this box \n     in our third floor office. We call it an office.\n       Mr. Chertoff. Had Margaret Williams, on an earlier \n     occasion, talked to you about storing records in the \n     residence?\n       Miss Huber. No.\n       Mr. Chertoff. This was first time you had ever done that?\n       Ms. Huber. Yes, sir.\n       And you specifically recall that the First Lady had made \n     that request?\n       Yes.\n\n  Now, look, is Ms. Huber lying? Is Officer O'Neill lying? Ms. Huber \nhas spent 20 years with the Clintons. Do you think she lied? She did \nnot lie. She told the truth.\n  Listen to this. It is very instructive. It is very instructive. This \nwoman, Ms. Huber, is the person who stores personal documents and puts \nthem away for the Clintons.\n  Mr. Chertoff says, ``Had Margaret Williams on any earlier occasion \never talked to you about ever storing records in the residence?''\n  And Ms. Huber says, ``No.''\n  Again, I think this is rather interesting. This is the first time. So \nMr. Chertoff says:\n\n       This the first time she ever had done this?\n\n       Yes, sir.\n       And she told you specifically the First Lady had made this \n     request?\n       Yes.\n\n  Now, let me tell you something. Here we are talking about three \npeople, three people. Officer O'Neill, who says that he actually saw \nMaggie Williams removing documents from Vince Foster's office. She \ndenies it.\n  Here is the second young man, Mr. Castleton. He worked for President \nClinton in the campaign. He still works for the White House; he \nobviously has an affinity for the President and First Lady. He has no \nreason to make up an adverse story. What does he say? He says Maggie \nWilliams told him, ``We are bringing these documents up to the First \nLady.'' And, ``The First Lady wants to review them.'' Wants to review \nthem.\n  He did not equivocate.\n  ``Are you sure,'' we said.\n  ``Yes.''\n  ``Are you sure?''\n  ``Yes.''\n  And then we take Ms. Huber, a woman who ran the Rose Law Firm. She \nwas the office manager there. She was in charge of the Governor's \nMansion. She is a special assistant at the White House, a close \nconfidant of the Clintons. She is the woman who stores their various \npapers, such as, I think she testified, income tax records and other \npapers, deeds of their homes, et cetera. We are talking about a trusted \nconfidant, a friend of the Clintons.\n  And get this. You must understand how unusual this set of \ntransactions were. Mrs. Clinton, again, gives an order, an order that \nMaggie Williams relays to this young man. She says, ``We have to take \nthese documents upstairs because Mrs. Clinton wants to review them.''\n  When we asked Maggie Williams about that she denies it. ``Why would I \ntell him?'' Of course she told him. He did not make that up.\n  But are we going to say that Officer O'Neill was wrong? That this \nyoung man made up this story? And that Ms. Huber, Carolyn Huber, who \nhas been with the Clintons for years and years and years and years, \nthat she would dream this up? Listen to what Mr. Chertoff, our counsel, \nasked. He said:\n  ``Had Maggie Williams on any earlier occasion talked to you about \never storing records in the residence?''\n  Ms. Huber said, ``No, no.''\n  ``Mr. Chertoff. This was the first time she asked you that you had \ndone that?''\n  ``Yes, sir.''\n  ``And she told you specifically that the First Lady had made these \nrequests?''\n  She says, ``Yes.''\n  Are we really saying here that Ms. Huber made this story up? That she \nlied? Listen to the question:\n\n       Had she told you specifically that the First Lady had made \n     this request?\n       Yes.\n       Had you ever been asked to do this before by Maggie \n     Williams?\n       No.\n\n  These are the kinds of things that we find. They may be embarrassing. \nI have not brought these out before but, I tell you, it demonstrates \nthe need to continue and to get the facts. And then we have the \nmysterious--I call it the miraculous appearance of these documents.\n  Let me ask you, how do you think the documents got there, given the \ntestimony of Officer O'Neill? Given the testimony of Tom Castleton, a \nyoung assistant who works in the White House, who said he was \ninstructed to take the documents there and that Mrs. Clinton wanted to \nreview these files? That is what he was told by Maggie Williams. Given \nthe fact that Carolyn Huber had never been asked by the chief of staff \nfor the First Lady to take files upstairs? She had been asked by the \nFirst Lady, had been asked by the President. Indeed she was their \nconfidant. Never been asked before, but, more specifically, had been \ntold that these instructions came by way of the First Lady.\n  And then where do the files, the billing records, show up? Do you \nreally wonder how they got there? Do we really believe the butler \nbrought them there? How could the butler get his hands on them? Did he \ngo into Vince\n\n[[Page S1620]]\n\nFoster's office, unseen by anybody and everybody? Do we really want to \nbe serious about this? Or do we want to trivialize it and say, ``Well, \nit is political.''\n  We can do that. That is fine. I am used to that. That is fine. What \nthe heck, they have a file over there on me at the White House that \ntheir staff has been directed to compile, that they sent over to the \nDNC. I did not know that was the kind of thing that our Government was \ninvolved in. I did not think that the White House should be doing that \nkind of thing. I have heard about enemies' lists in the past. Is that \nthe kind of business we are in? We want to stop the investigation? This \nis what we are going to do and we do not care who we slander and how we \ndo it? And do we really use Government employees to become engaged in \nthis kind of thing?\n  It is bad enough if you are going to do that out of a political \nparty. Let them do it. I do not say it is good. I do not say it is bad. \nIt takes place. But, I mean, are we going to have Federal employees at \nthe White House engage in that kind of thing? Are we going to have them \nbe instructed by their counsel, by one of their counsels, who tells \nthem: Let us get a file. Give us all the dirt you have on the Senator \nand send it over to the Democratic National Committee so we can get one \nof their guys to go out and continue to make regular attacks.\n  It is not going to keep me from calling them as I see them. Let me \ntell you something, if there are facts that are exculpatory and there \nis nothing wrong, then, fine. This is just one little, tiny area.\n  If we want to talk about this for days and days on the floor of the \nSenate we can do that and we will continue to do that. And let me serve \nnotice, you may block this by way of a rollcall, a party rollcall. \nPeople have a right to vote any way they want. We will continue this \nwork. And if we have to do it through the Banking Committee, we will do \nit.\n  Let me tell you, I have not asked to go beyond the scope of that \nresolution and I have resisted calls to get into other areas. I have \nresisted them. But my inclination will not be to do that if we are \nforced to go through a very circuitous process, in which ours is to get \nthe facts.\n  When the New York Times--you can quote 32 others and you can quote \nletters to the editors, et cetera, that say this is a political witch \nhunt, this or that--when they say that we should continue the work and \ngather the facts, do not truncate this, I do not think there can be a \nclearer call.\n  Let me go on. Here is Mr. Chertoff, in discussing some events with \nMiss Williams. He says, ``The fellow that helped you take the box, the \npapers, up to the residence?'' She is talking about this young \nCastleton, Mr. Chertoff is. Miss Williams says, ``Yes.''\n  Mr. Chertoff, the counsel said, ``Did you tell him that the reason \nthat documents had to go to the residence was so that the President or \nthe First Lady could review their contents?\n  ``No,'' she says. ``I do not recall saying that to Tom Castleton.''\n  Mr. Chertoff then goes on, ``When you say you don't recall, are you \ntelling us affirmatively that you didn't say it or are you just saying \nthat you don't have a recollection one way or the other?''\n  ``Miss Williams. Well, I would like to say--'' now listen to this--\n``affirmatively I did not say it, because I cannot imagine why I would \nhave that discussion with an intern about the files, going to the \nPresident and the First Lady. I know that I told them we were going to \nthe residence because I figured he needed to know where he was going. \nBut I cannot imagine that I said more than that. So I do not recall \nhaving the discussion with him.''\n  Mr. Chertoff later on goes on:\n\n       Well, let me read you--that this intern testified in his \n     deposition, starting at line 7, page 139, and he said, ``And, \n     what did she tell you? Answer: She told me that they were \n     taking the boxes into the residence.'' That part you agree \n     with?\n\n  Ms. Williams says, ``Yes.''\n  Mr. Chertoff then says:\n\n       And, did she say where in the residence? Answer. No. \n     Question. Did she say why you were taking them there?\n\n  Here is Mr. Castleton:\n\n       She says ``yes.''\n       Question. ``What was her statement? She says that the \n     President, or the First Lady, had to review the contents of \n     the boxes to determine what was in them. You disagree with \n     that?''\n       Ms. Williams. ``Yes. I do.''\n       Mr. Chertoff. ``And you also do not agree with Mr. \n     Nussbaum's testimony that in his discussion with you he \n     indicated that the documents would go to the residence and \n     the Clintons would be there and they would make a decision \n     where they go? You disagree with that?''\n       Ms. Williams. ``No. That is not what I recall.''\n       Mr. Chertoff. ``You disagree with both of those?''\n       Ms. Williams. ``That is not what I recall.''\n\n  Mr. President, here we have a Secret Service officer, Officer \nO'Neill, who testifies that on the night of Vince Foster's death, that \nhe sees Maggie Williams moving these documents--and he testifies with \nparticular clarity. Maggie Williams denies that and takes polygraph \ntests. They sustain her contention that she did not do that. In \nfairness to her we have to say that.\n  I think we also have to understand and note that we do not know how \nmany polygraph tests she may have taken. There is also a very real \nquestion with respect to the reliability of them given the manner and \nthe circumstances in which they are administered. But there is no \nreason, no earthly reason, for Officer O'Neill, who has been on the \nsecurity detail of the Secret Service for some 17 years, to have \nconjured up his testimony or to have made that up or to create or to \nfabricate.\n  No. 2, this is just one little part. But I focus in on it because I \nthink it answers the question as to how the documents got into the \nresidence--the documents being the billing records that just came to \nlight in January, months and months and months after--2 years after the \nspecial counsel had subpoenaed them.\n  So people knew. I mean, the White House lawyers knew. Everyone knew \nthat these documents were requested and were sought for 2 years. They \nwere covered by a subpoena. They were covered by our request and \nsubsequent subpoena in October.\n  (Mr. COVERDELL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let us take a look at this. So we have \nthe officer. He sees files being removed. We then have the testimony of \nMr. Castleton, the young White House intern who is now working at the \nWhite House and worked for the President in his election campaign in \n1992 and probably will be working on this one. So he has no reason, no \nhostility, no animus to try to create a story. He says that Maggie \nWilliams told him they were taking these documents up to the White \nHouse because ``Mrs. Clinton wants to review them.''\n  Then we add to that Mrs. Huber, Carolyn Huber--who worked for the \nClintons for 20 years, was really in charge of their personal day-to-\nday matters, the archiving of important documents, their deeds, their \ntax records, et cetera. She is the person who says that when she \ninitially found these billing records back in August of last year--and \nI believe her--she thought they were being left there because things \nwere generally left on the table, the Clintons would leave things on \nthe table to be filed by her, and that is what she did.\n  She took these and put them into a box and carried them downstairs to \nher office where she would review eventually that and other materials \nto decide where they should be placed. It was not until January 4 that \nshe discovered what these were.\n\n  How did these documents get there? Who had them? Who had control over \nthem? Who deliberately withheld them from the special counsel, from the \nRTC, and from others? How do you think they got there? Do you think \nOfficer O'Neill dreamed up the fact that Maggie Williams took documents \nout of Vince Foster's office? Do we think this young man, Tom \nCastleton, dreamed up the fact that it was said that indeed Mrs. \nClinton wanted to review these files, and they were carried up, she \nasked to have carried up these boxes of documents. And what about Mrs. \nHuber, a Clinton confidant for 20 years, who ran the Governor's mansion \nin Little Rock, was office manager in the Rose Law Firm and is an \nassistant now in the White House, who is in charge of archiving all of \nthe most personal of their documents? Do you think she made up the \nstory when she said, for the first time--never before, you have to \nunderstand--she passed an assignment to carry documents up by the\n\n[[Page S1621]]\n\nchief of staff, Maggie Williams, to the First Lady? This is the first \ntime the First Lady asked her. She was specific in saying that this \ntook place and Mrs. Clinton wanted to look at these papers.\n  Is there any wonder why? This is not something that you could easily \nlose--a slip of paper, a scrap of paper inadvertently in the bottom of \na desk drawer or in a file that one would not come up with, you know, \nthe general file. These are the records.\n  Why do you think the records were discovered in August? That was the \nvery time when the RTC was raising questions with respect to the \nvarious transactions.\n  What is illuminating about this is that there are a number of times, \noccasions, when the Rose Law Firm--in particular, one of its partners--\nhad conversations with Seth Ward about a transaction that was \ncharacterized by Federal banking regulators as a ``sham.'' This is a \ntransaction that would eventually lead to the loss of $3.8 million of \ntaxpayers' money and, obviously, one with which Webb Hubbell did not \nwant to have his name associated because the deal maker in that case \nwas his father-in-law, Seth Ward. His father-in-law. That is why he had \nanother partner on that deal. I do not know what they were going to do. \nBut eventually Seth Ward had to pay back $335,000 when the bank \ncollapsed and the RTC said, ``You are going to give us back this \nmoney.'' He had a big lawsuit between McDougal and the bank. He won \nthat lawsuit because lots of the facts that probably should have been \npresented at trial--the fact that it was an inside, cozy deal--really \ndid not come out. There was $335,000 in commissions that Ward got for \nnot doing a darned thing. Why give that money for not a thing? There \nwas a 10-percent commission for land that was sold by this fellow \nMcDougal, partner to the Clintons, from one bank to the other.\n  Now, look, the pattern continues. Documents are produced because they \nfall into the hands of the people who cannot nor will allow themselves \nto be placed in a position of obstructing justice. When Mrs. Huber \neventually realized what these documents were and that they were \nsubpoenaed materials, when she saw them on January 4, she did what she \nwas supposed to do; she called this attorney, called White House \ncounsel. They came over and made copies. The committee got them.\n  So how do you think the documents got there? Do you think they were \nin that box that young man carried up there? If they were in that box, \nthen how is it, as maintained by the White House, that everything was \nsent over, that nobody looked at this. I think that is the most \nunreasonable, incredible story I have heard.\n  Let me tell you why. You had a lawyer, a trusted confident and \nlawyer, who met an untimely, tragic death and he had some of your most \nsensitive papers in terms of your tax treatment and liability in terms \nof a variety of issues that could be certainly embarrassing and \ncertainly important to you. And he died, and you ask someone either at \nhis office, a coworker, a secretary, ``Please get me those documents \nbecause I want to have them transferred over to my new lawyer.'' If you \nwanted them to be transferred directly, would you not ask them to \ntransfer them directly?\n  But would it not be more reasonable, and perfectly appropriate, to \nsay I wish to look at these documents before I send them over to my \nlawyer? There may be things that are relevant or irrelevant, pertinent \nor not. There may be documents in there that have nothing to do with \nus.\n  And, indeed, very interestingly, there was a document that apparently \nmade its way up to the White House. It made its way up to the White \nHouse and somehow mysteriously got kicked back because it was not \ngermane. Now, the Clinton lawyers did not send that back. We have not \nfound out how it got back. That is the mysterious document that travels \nin reverse. We do not know how that document got back.\n  But the point of the matter is, it would not be unreasonable for \nanyone, anyone, least of all the First Family, to want to review these. \nAnd so it becomes very, very difficult for us to understand, some of \nus, how it is that the billing records show up. And, indeed, if no one \nreviewed the documents, you would have suspected or imagined that they \nwould have been there. These were documents that Vince Foster was \nworking on. He has notations all over them, his own personal hand. So \nhow do you think the documents got there? You do not think that they \nwere transported there?\n  And what about the documents that Tom Castleton transported? Wouldn't \nmost people want to see what documents concerning your own life were \nbeing sent to a new lawyer? I think it is absolutely extraordinary to \nbelieve that you would have no interest in checking this out, that you \nwould leave it to someone else, that you would leave it to a new \nlawyer. It is very difficult to believe.\n  So what would the conclusion be if one were to say it would be \ndifficult to believe? It means that somebody did look at these. But, \nyou see, once you take a stand and put out a story as the White House \ndid--because I think they were embarrassed when it was discovered that \nthese documents were secreted away in this closet for a period of \ntime--they had to come out and say, yeah, they were, instead of saying, \nsure, the Clintons looked at them. It would be natural. But, see, they \nalready denied that: No, never looked at them, never.\n  I think that would be one of the most unnatural things, illogical \nthings, not to look at your own papers, not to look at your own papers, \nnot to say, well, what is there? At least I know what we sent over to \nour new lawyer, after their lawyer, their friend, had died in such a \nway.\n  But, see, once you make a story up, you have to stick to it. And so \nthe mystery of the disappearing, then the appearing, billing records, I \nthink becomes rather logical. They were in possession of the White \nHouse, the First Family, right since the day that young Mr. Castleton \nbrought those files, all of those files up there to be reviewed.\n  Now, for the life of me, I cannot understand why they did not say, of \ncourse, we looked at them. What would I say? Would I say it was wrong \nor evil for the First Family to look at their own personal papers? Of \ncourse not. It would be illogical to suggest that they should not or \nwould not or could not. And I know when I have heard colleagues say, \noh, well, they would be accused of all kinds of conspiratorial things \nif they looked at them. Come on. That is nonsense. People have a right \nto look at their own documents, the President, Vice President, anybody.\n  So here we are at this point in time. The record is replete with \nthese kinds of inconsistencies, and I think they are more than \ninconsistencies. I believe that Maggie Williams did not give us \ntestimony that provided all the facts to us. I believe that she did not \naccurately relate the facts, particularly with respect to the \ninstructions she received about moving these documents and who they \nwere there for, and I think that helps answer the question of the \nmysteriously reappearing documents.\n  Let me cite again the New York Times:\n\n       The Senate's duty cannot be truncated nor canceled because \n     of the campaign calendar. Any certain date for terminating of \n     the hearings would encourage even more delay in producing \n     subpoenaed documents than the committee has endured. The \n     committee has been forced to await such events as the \n     criminal trial of the McDougals.\n\n  I am ready and willing to do the work of the committee as \nexpeditiously as possible. Notwithstanding, we should not set arbitrary \ntime limits. Why? Because that provides an opportunity, as has been \nstated before, for purposeful delay that I believe has occurred before \nthis committee. And I do not know of anyone who can say that we have \nreceived all of the documents. How can you say that? I got a letter \nfrom a lawyer on behalf of one of President Clinton's closest aides \nthat says he is not turning over documents to us, and he is raising a \nprivilege that the President said they would not. We are going to \ncooperate. So I know for certain that there are documents that we are \nentitled to that are being withheld deliberately--deliberately.\n  I say that I would be willing, and I ask my colleagues on the other \nside, to consider putting a time limit of 10 weeks after the Little \nRock trial concludes, no longer than 4 months from this point, because, \nas my colleagues have pointed out, the trial could go on indefinitely. \nThere has to be an end at some point because there are other important \nconsiderations, and situations\n\n[[Page S1622]]\n\nthat we want to attempt to avoid. And it was my intention to attempt to \navoid right from the inception. I thought we could have had our work \ncompleted. We ran into the problems of not getting witnesses and \ndocuments heretofore. But I recognize that there are some on the \nDemocratic side who feel very strongly that this should not continue. \nSo with that in mind, I am willing to put forth that we have a 4-month \nextension or any combination of 8 to 10 weeks after the trial, \nwhichever is less, whichever is less, as a finite time.\n  I recognize also that if indeed there are matters of great \nconsequences that come forth, then obviously it will behoove all of us \nto say that we have to continue. But if indeed there are still \nunanswered questions, and it is just a matter of us not being able to \ncontinue, then we have to act accordingly.\n  I hope that my colleagues on the other side would consider this. By \nnext week, we will get into the testimony of Susan Thomases, \nunbelievable testimony, testimony that is not credible, of this \nbrilliant lawyer, a close friend of Mrs. Clinton, who cannot remember \nkey dates even though they are logged in her files. And we will get \ninto the extraordinary things we had to do in order the get documents \nfrom her. If this is the kind of thing that they want, then we will \nhave to do it.\n  I say, last but not least, that I will spell this out with \nspecificity. And if indeed we fail in cloture the first time, we will \ntake it to cloture again and again. I guess the White House will look \nat the polls to determine the impact of attempting to keep us from \ngoing forward and, I think, holding back facts.\n  So we will make a determination. If we cannot come to a resolution we \nwill have to use whatever resources we have at our disposal to do the \nbest we can--and it may not be as easy and may be more cumbersome--so \nthat we can to get the facts. We will do that. I will use the \njurisdiction of the Banking Committee. And I will spell that out in \nfurther detail. So we will not be without resources. It will be more \ndifficult. It will place a greater strain. We may have to meet a lot \nmore.\n  But I have put forth the basis by which we could resolve this matter \nwithout one side saying, ``What are you hiding?'' and the other side \nsaying, ``It's nothing but politics.'' We will raise the question, what \nis the White House afraid of? What are they hiding? My colleagues on \nthe other side will say this is nothing more than politics in an \nattempt to embarrass the President. No one gains by that. No one gains \nby that. So I put this offer forth, and I hope we can work this out and \nresolve our differences.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, politics or policy, that is the \nquestion. Mr. President, if there was ever anything that is clear as \nthe noonday Sun on a cloudless day, anything that is obvious, it is \nthat Whitewater is politics, pure and simple, and has nothing to do \nwith policy. And the Senate should not continue this charade any \nlonger.\n  Mr. President, we have had 121 witnesses. We have had 40 days. We \nhave had over 200 depositions. We have had 45,000 pages of documents \nthat have been produced. We have had blah, blah, blah, blah, full of \nsound and fury, and absolutely signifying nothing.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the Whitewater \nCommittee, the last time he spoke--and I wanted to ask him some \nquestions, and he did not yield for that purpose--spoke about the \ncomparison of Whitewater with Iran-Contra. I wanted to draw with him \nthe comparisons between the two. I think the comparison of these two \nhearings really draws in sharp focus, in sharp contrast, the difference \nbetween policy and politics.\n  In the case of Iran-Contra, Mr. President, we had a matter of grave \nnational concern, national issues involving a terrorist state, Iran, \nand involving the action of the administration, as an administration \nwhile in office, that involved the President of the United States, \ninvolved the National Security Adviser while he was National Security \nAdviser, involved employees of the White House and of the Government, \ninvolved in some of the most critical issues then before this Nation. \nThey were issues as to which the Congress needed the information in \norder to make policy, in which the administration needed the \ninformation in order to make policy.\n  With all of those important issues, Mr. President, Iran-Contra took \nhalf the time that the Whitewater hearing is taking. Mr. President, I \nconfess I voted for this Whitewater investigation. Frankly, I search my \nmind as to why in the world I ever voted for it in the first place.\n  What are we doing with Whitewater? Does that involve the President of \nthe United States as President? Oh, no. Does it involve a recent event? \nOh, no. This is more than 10 years ago. Does it involve a matter as to \nwhich the Congress needs information to make policy? Oh, no.\n  I mean, look, whether Whitewater was a good development or whether \nthe McDougals embezzled money from the RTC or whatever are not matters \nas to which we need to make policy. If they are, they have been fully \nbrought out with 121 witnesses and 45,000 pages of information.\n  By the way, we have a special prosecutor that has spent over $25 \nmillion and has a huge team down in Arkansas as we speak, looking into \nany lawbreaking. So it is not lawbreaking. It is not policy. It is not \nrecent. Just what is it, Mr. President? What are all these things \nabout, all these witnesses?\n  I must confess to you, Mr. President, I hear all this stuff and it \ngoes in one ear and out the other. I am a lawyer by training, as are \nmany of my colleagues. You just cannot keep up with it because it is \nall, we know, irrelevant to anything except politics, this political \nseason.\n  We are told now that we need to go on for another 4 months or 10 \nweeks or whatever it is. For what? We have already had the First Lady \ncome down and testify. We have already had these very broad subpoenas \nthat have subpoenaed everything in the Western World. They wanted all \nthe e-mail that has come out of the White House. They tell me it will \ncost $200,000 just to comply with their request for e-mail.\n  Undoubtedly they will, among that $200,000 worth of e-mail, they will \nbe able to bring up somebody from the White House and say, did you say \nsuch and such in an e-mail? They will say, no, I do not remember that. \nThey will be able to produce it, and it will be another one of these \ngreat revelations. These great revelations about, ``Can you remember \nsomething you did 10 years ago?'' And maybe they cannot. I hope people \nwill not pull me up before a witness stand in some way and ask me about \nthings that happened 10 years ago, and ``Did you make these notes or \nnot?''\n\n  The question is, are the notes significant? What do the billing \nrecords signify? Not much. And whatever they signify, it has already \nbeen brought out. The distinguished Senator from New York is free to \nargue all of these things. You know, did Susan Thomases--did Ms. \nWilliams--did this person do this or that? It is all out there to the \nextent it has any relevance to anything.\n  I submit it is not relevant to anything except the Presidential race. \nIt is an attempt to get President Bill Clinton and the First Lady of \nthis country to be put in an embarrassing position. That is all this is \nabout. Everybody knows that, Mr. President. Everybody knows that. Give \nme a break.\n  Are we trying to make policy here? Just what law is it that we will \nbe able to amend or change or propose by virtue of Whitewater? Is the \nPresident charged with any wrongdoing, any violation of law? No, he is \nnot. Is the First Lady charged with any violation of law? No, she is \nnot. How about an ethical violation? No, they are not. But if they are, \nand if the evidence is there, we have a very partisan special \nprosecutor who has over $25 million already spent in a bottomless pit \nof money in order to be able to pursue that.\n  That is a legitimate purpose. It may be illegitimately or partisanly \npursued by the special prosecutor, but it is certainly legitimate and \nwithin the ambit of the law, and it is not going to be stopped by what \nwe do here in the Congress. So if there is lawbreaking which has not \nbeen either charged or revealed so far, that special prosecutor can do \nit.\n  What the special prosecutor cannot do is to have these hearings with \nall\n\n[[Page S1623]]\n\nthese accusatory looks and tones and dredging up pieces of paper, \nthrowing them out with a flourish as if they signify anything. And, Mr. \nPresident, we know they have no significance beyond the political race \nthat is presently occurring.\n  We know that if Bill Clinton were not President of the United States, \nthere would be no thought of going into this kind of thing, wasting \nthese kinds of resources, wasting this much time of the Congress on \nthis issue. It is politics, pure and simple, unvarnished, obvious and \nclear, and I hope we do not give another nickel to this boondoggle--not \nanother nickel.\n  I think my colleagues are proposing giving some more money to pursue \nit further. I hope they do not give a nickel. Whatever there is here--\nand there is nothing of legitimate concern for us, because it does not \ninvolve the President as President--it does not involve policy that we \nneed to know about, it does not involve charges of wrongdoing against \nthe President and the First Lady. It involves innuendoes that can be \nuseful only as political fodder in a political campaign, and that is \nall. I hope we do not continue it at all.\n  I must say, the distinguished Senator from Maryland is a lot closer \nto this than I am. I trust his judgment. If he would say we have to \ncontinue for 2 days or 5 days or whatever, I may reluctantly vote for \nit. But, Mr. President, I am so sorry that I voted for this resolution \nin the first place. I do not know what we were thinking when we \ncommissioned this Whitewater boondoggle investigation. I do not know \nwhat we were thinking, and I hope we will terminate it as soon as we \ncan. I wish we would set a precedent that we do not do this kind of \nthing.\n  Look, if the other party gains the White House this year--I will not \nbe around here as a Member of the Senate, but I hope our side does not \ntry to do that to their side when they get in office. It is a waste of \ntime, it is a waste of resources, it is a diversion from the purposes \nof this country and of this Senate and of this Government. We ought to \nget about the business of running the Government as set forth in the \nConstitution and let the candidates run the campaigns. Enough is \nenough, and we have already had too much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

GREEN\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, today the number 93 symbolizes a notable \nmilestone in Senate history. It is the 93d day after Senator Strom \nThurmond's 93d birthday, which was the same span of days and years \nreached by my venerable predecessor Senator Theodore Francis Green on \nthe day of his retirement on January 3, 1961. Tomorrow, Senator \nThurmond will be 93 years and 94 days old and he will assume Senator \nGreen's mantle as the oldest sitting Senator in history.\n  I join in extending hearty congratulations to Senator Thurmond on his \nremarkable durability and I wish him well in years to come. But I do \nhope we will not lose sight of the extraordinary long and distinguished \ncareer of the previous record holder.\n  The career of Theodore Francis Green will always be an inspiration \nand a model for productive senior citizenship. He was a classic late \nbloomer whose political career did not really begin until he was 65 \nyears old. And his most prolific years were in the two and a half \ndecades that followed.\n  Born in Providence in 1867--a year before Ulysses Grant was elected \nPresident--Senator Green was descended from a distinguished line of \nforebears dating back to the founding of colonial Rhode Island. Five of \nthem served in Congress. He began his own public life when he raised \nand outfitted his own company in the Spanish-American War.\n  He served a single term in the Rhode Island General Assembly in 1907, \nbut then endured 25 years of political rejection and disappointment. He \nran for Governor three times without success, in 1912, 1928, and 1930--\ncounted out he said by the opposition--and he lost a race for Congress \nin 1920. And then in 1932, at an age when his contemporaries were \ncontemplating retirement, he was elected Governor of Rhode Island, \nswept in on the New Deal tide.\n  Reelected to the governorship in 1934, he engineered on inauguration \nday the so-called Bloodless Revolution which in a single afternoon \nended Republican dominance of the State government and earned him the \npejorative of ``Kingfish Green'' in some circles. The coup was never \nsuccessfully challenged and he went serenely ahead with his reform \nagenda.\n  In 1936, Theodore Francis Green was elected to the U.S. Senate, \nbeginning 24 years of continuous service during which he became a \ncolorful and beloved fixture of Washington life. He was a strong \nsupporter of the New Deal and of social legislation in the post-war \nera. A dedicated internationalist and a tireless world traveler, he \nascended to the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nat the age of 89 in 1957.\n  He was not particularly impressed by his own longevity. ``My age is \nnothing to be proud of,'' he said. ``It's just an interesting \nincident.'' But the secret of longevity, he said is moderation. ``I \ndon't get worried and don't get excited. It would take more or less of \na bomb to upset me.''\n  There was, however, another factor that kept him going and that was \nhis almost ceaseless thirst for physical activity. It can hardly be \ncoincidental that Theodore Green and Strom Thurmond--both devotees of \nphysical fitness--should be the record holders for Senate seniority.\n  Green's prowess was legendary and he was sometimes referred to as \nTarzan, notwithstanding his modest 150-pound physique. He was a \nwrestler and a mountain climber and a handball player. He continued \nhigh diving until he was 82 when he was finally convinced by doctors \nand friends to give it up. And he continued to play tennis until he was \n87, and they quit only because he could not find time in his busy \nschedule to play.\n  But to the end he continued to work out and swim several times a week \nin the Senate gymnasium or at the YMCA. And most of he walked, daily--\nexcept in the worst weather, from his bachelor quarters at the \nUniversity Club to his office in the Russell Building. Every morning at \nabout 8:35 he would start out on the 2-mile walk, a familiar stooped \nfigure with his pince-nez eye glasses, usually proceeding down through \nLafayette Park and up Pennsylvania Avenue. It usually took about 45 \nminutes.\n  The daily walk was prompted as much by an aversion to automobiles as \nit was by a love for exercise. The only car he ever owned was acquired \nfor ceremonial purposes and it spent most of its days on blocks in his \nProvidence garage. He never learned to drive. But he loved trolleys and \nlegend has it that he once showed up, impeccably attired in top hat, \nwhite tie and tails, to take a society matron to a concert, traveling \nby street car.\n  Like the new holder of the longevity record, Senator Green had great \nappreciation for women. He often liked to joke that he looked forward \nto every leap year in hopes that some lovely lady would claim him. Even \nas he approached 90, he was regarded as one of the better dancers among \nWashington bachelors. And Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter once \nsaid that Theodore Green was ``the most charming dinner partner your \nwife could have.''\n  When Senator Green claimed the longevity title in 1956, Senators \nLyndon Johnson and William Knowland, the majority and minority leaders, \npresented him with a gavel supposedly made from the oldest tree on the \nCapitol grounds and proclaimed he had outlived all the surrounding \nflora. Senator Green often spoke of serving till he would be 100, but \nin 1960, aware of failing eyesight and hearing, he decided to step \ndown. He died 6 years later, in his 99th year, in the house where he \nhad lived all his life in Providence.\n  As I said at the time of his death, I was then and have always been \ngreatly in his debt. I benefited by his wise advice and counsel and \ngained by following his example. He truly was my role model. And I \nshall always appreciate his willingness to serve as chairman of\n\n[[Page S1624]]\n\nmy campaign committee when I ran in 1960 to succeed him. He was truly a \ngreat gentleman and statesman and his legend lies on in affectionate \nmemory of the people of Rhode Island. And, Mr. Speaker, for myself as \nthe longest serving Senator from Rhode Island, I know I share in this \nmemory.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues are aware, \ntomorrow our friend and colleague, Senator Thurmond, will become the \noldest sitting Senator in the history of the U.S. Senate. This is a \nremarkable achievement. In so doing, he surpasses the late Theodore \nFrancis Green of Rhode Island who retired in January 1961 to be \nsucceeded by Senator Pell. He retired at the age of 93 years and 93 \ndays.\n  Senator Thurmond will be 93 years and 94 days old tomorrow, so he \nwill exceed the record of the oldest Senator to serve, which was set by \nTheodore Francis Green.\n  I congratulate Senator Thurmond on the great things he has done in \nhis 40-plus years of Senate service, and I congratulate him on \nachieving this milestone.\n  On the last day before he breaks this impressive record set by \nSenator Green, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about Senator \nGreen's exemplary Senate career.\n  Theodore Francis Green, as Senator Pell has mentioned, came to the \nSenate in 1937. Previously, he served one term in the Rhode Island \nState Legislature, the house of representatives, and two terms--we had \n2-year terms in those days--as Governor, for a total of 4 years. He was \na strong supporter of President Roosevelt's New Deal programs, and he \nwas an advocate of important farm and unemployment relief legislation, \nand he fought vigorously for increased Federal aid for education.\n  He did his level best to ensure that Rhode Island got its fair share \nof Federal funds. And most significant in achieving Federal funds was \nwhen he secured President Roosevelt's support for a new naval base in \nour State constructed at Quonset Point. This was the site of 1 of 12 \nnew Navy bases that were built in the late thirties and early forties. \nKnowing that the Senators from New York and Massachusetts were just as \nanxious to land a new base for their home State, Senator Green pressed \nhis successor Governor and the State legislators to cede land to the \nFederal Government as quickly as possible. Once Congress began its \nconsideration of the matter, Senator Green took the lead in shepherding \nthe necessary authorization and appropriations bills through the \nSenate.\n  It was in foreign affairs that Senator Green truly made his mark. He \njoined the Foreign Relations Committee just as the United States was \nturning away from its isolationist policies and toward taking its place \nas the greatest military power the world had ever seen. In those days, \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee was where a good deal of the \naction took place.\n  Senator Green demonstrated his spirited efforts to implement the \nlend-lease plan, and his early support for the Selective Service Act \nwas up to the challenge.\n  While many of his colleagues called for the United States to retreat \ninto isolationism once World War II drew to a close, Senator Green was \nadamant that the United States should participate in creating a \nworkable, collective security arrangement to avoid future global \nconflicts. He worked diligently to ensure that American assistance to \nwar-torn nations--the so-called Marshall plan--was implemented, and he \nworked hard for the establishment of the U.N. Relief and Rehabilitation \nAdministration.\n\n  As Senator Green's influence in the Foreign Relations Committee \nincreased, he provided key support for the chief foreign policy \ninitiatives of the Truman administration, particularly with regard to \nGreece and Korea. But his internationalism was not limited to \nDemocratic administrations. On the contrary. Senator Green argued just \nas firmly against proposals to curb the President's power to conduct \nforeign policy during the Eisenhower administration. In 1957, as the \nnew chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he led congressional \nsupport for Eisenhower's request to use American troops to combat \ncommunism in the Middle East--the so-called Eisenhower doctrine.\n  Now, much like Senator Thurmond, Senator Green attributed his \nlongevity to two things: A healthy diet and regular exercise. As \nSenator Pell just mentioned, he walked every morning from the \nUniversity Club on 16th Street to the Capitol--every day, up until his \nretirement. Here he was in his nineties, getting up toward 95, 96, and \nthe New York Times heralded him as the Senate's undisputed champion \ndiver, swimmer, and handball player. I am not sure how much competition \nhe had as a diver, but nonetheless he was a champion.\n  Although Senator Green will no longer hold the distinction to have \nbeen the oldest person to have served in this body, he will long be \nremembered for his accomplishments, his compassion, his loyalty, his \nhonesty, and his good humor.\n  Upon hearing of Senator Green's intention not to run for reelection, \nSenator Fulbright said of him, ``I had hoped and expected that he would \nstay until he reached 100 years of age.'' On the eve of this historic \nday, I wish the same to the very distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina. I would hope and expect that he will stay until he reaches \nthe age of 100. Indeed, we have said to Senator Thurmond that we hope \nwe are here when he reaches 100. He said, ``If you get exercise and eat \nright, you will be here.''\n  I look forward to many more years of serving with our distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina, and I congratulate him on breaking the \nrecord set by a Rhode Islander for being the oldest Senator to serve in \nthis body.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Therefore, Mr. President, I announce there will be two \nvotes, then, at approximately 5 minutes before 2 o'clock. We hope to \nbegin on time. I believe the managers of the bill are in the area and \nare prepared to begin immediately. We will have the votes starting at 5 \nminutes before 2 o'clock.\n  While we wait on the managers to come to the floor, I want to say \nthat I think this is a good agreement under the circumstances. This \nwould provide for a short-term debt ceiling extension to March 29. The \npurpose of this short-\n\n[[Page S1625]]\n\nterm extension is so that we can continue to work, as requested by the \nbipartisan Governors, with the leaders in Congress and with the \nadministration to see if we can come to a broader bipartisan agreement \non the budget or, in the alternative, come to some agreement on the \nentitlement reform that we would like to be able to include in this \ndebt ceiling legislation, which would be for the longer period of time.\n  I am pleased we have reached this point.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to ask my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting H.R. 3021, a bill to extend the current debt ceiling until \nMarch 30, 1996. Under current law, the debt ceiling would be reached on \nMarch 15. This bill is intended to give the Secretary of the Treasury \nample authority to ensure the full investment of all Federal funds and \ntrust funds, including the Social Security trust fund, until March 30, \n1996.\n  Mr. President, I am told that the Secretary of the Treasury, Robert \nRubin, supports this legislation and that President Clinton intends to \nsign it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter received from Secretary Rubin.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 1996.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: Over the past several days, Treasury and \n     Congressional staff have had constructive discussions \n     regarding new legislation to raise the ceiling on the \n     Nation's debt. The resulting bill, H.R. 3021, is up for \n     consideration in the House today. The Administration \n     continues to believe that a long-term straightforward debt \n     ceiling increase should be enacted as soon as possible. \n     Clearly, this is the preferable course of action. \n     Nevertheless, at this juncture, I urge that this interim bill \n     be approved by Congress this week.\n       As a reminder of the events that would transpire without \n     Congressional action, I have attached a letter from Under \n     Secretary Hawke. In it he states that the lack of prompt \n     action by Congress could result in non-investment of incoming \n     trust fund receipts and could hamper our ability to auction \n     and settle securities later in the month, thereby prompting a \n     default.\n       We also continue to believe the commitment you articulated \n     together with Speaker Gingrich and Majority Leader Armey in \n     your February 1 letter is the right one. We should resolve \n     the debt limit impasse by enacting legislation that is \n     ``acceptable to both [the President] and the Congress in \n     order to guarantee the government does not default on its \n     obligations.''\n       We look forward to working with you to achieve enactment of \n     a long-term straightforward debt ceiling bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert E. Rubin.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, therefore, I believe that we must act \nswiftly in passing this critical bill.\n  Let me reiterate my position regarding the debt limit issue. It is \nthis Senator's intention to work toward passage of a long-term debt \nlimit extension later this month. We will not default on our debts. \nWhat this legislation does is simply allow a few more weeks to work out \na few unresolved issues with the Governors proposals on Medicaid and \nwelfare.\n  Let me just take a few moments to summarize the bill for my \ncolleagues. Section 1(a) of the bill provides the Secretary with the \nauthority to invest receipts received by a trust fund or other Federal \nfund until March 30, 1996. Obligations issued under this authority \nshall not count toward the public debt limit. This is to ensure the \nfull establishment and maintenance of income to Social Security and \nother Federal funds that by law are authorized to invest in Federal \nobligations and securities.\n  Section 1(b) defines the term Federal fund as a trust fund or account \nto which the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to issue Federal \nobligations for investment purposes.\n  Section 1(c) extends the current authority--Public Law 104-103--to \nincur debt, not subject to the public debt limit for purposes of \nguaranteeing timely payment of Social Security and other Federal \npayments, from March 15, 1996 until March 30, 1996.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the Senate expeditiously enacts this \ncritically important piece of legislation to preserve the full faith \nand credit of the U.S. Government.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I wish to join my esteemed chairman, the Senator from \nDelaware, in stating that, indeed, this legislation is necessary. It is \nin fact urgent, a fact which in and of itself speaks to the awkwardness \nwith which Congress has approached the most elemental of duties, which \nis to ensure the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. Here we \nare in a fiscal year that began October 1. We can look out the Senate \ndoors and there in the park between here and the Supreme Court we see \nspring rains; we see spring buds; the daffodils are all but upon us; \nand we still have not extended the debt ceiling, which we will have to \ndo.\n  We are now in an extraordinary pattern of putting in jeopardy the \nworld's primary currency, the world's largest economy but also the \nworld's largest debtor nation. The full faith and credit of the United \nStates is of interest not just to Americans but to the world itself.\n  I hope we will, indeed, make this extension.\n  I believe my esteemed chairman placed Mr. Rubin's letter in the \nRecord. Mr. Rubin's letter was accompanied by a letter from the \nHonorable John D. Hawke, Jr., who is the Under Secretary of the \nTreasury for Domestic Finance, explaining in detail why this particular \nextension is urgent and must not be put off. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the letter be printed in the Record so that it will be seen out in \nthe rest of the world that at least the Treasury Department knows what \nthe problem is.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 26, 1996.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: Because the Congress will shortly be \n     considering legislation to increase the public debt ceiling, \n     Secretary Rubin has asked me to provide you with information \n     concerning the Treasury's expected cash and debt positions \n     for the next several weeks. We share the view expressed in \n     the Leadership's February 1 letter to the President that it \n     is of great importance for Congress to resolve the \n     uncertainties surrounding the debt limit by promptly enacting \n     an increase acceptable to both Congress and the President.\n       In his letter to you of January 22, Secretary Rubin \n     described the remaining three actions that he believed to be \n     legal and prudent, and that would provide funds with which to \n     pay the country's financial obligations. He estimated at that \n     time that these actions would be sufficient to carry us \n     through February 29 or March 1. On February 1, Congress \n     passed H.R. 2924, which was signed into law on February 8 as \n     Public Law 104-103, granting authority to Treasury to issue \n     an additional $29 billion in debt that would be temporarily \n     exempt from the debt limit. The debt limit exemption for \n     these securities expires on the earlier of March 15 or the \n     enactment of a new debt limit increase by the Congress. As \n     the Secretary informed you on February 20, on Friday we \n     issued $29 billion in bills under this new authority, and \n     with this action, and the auctions scheduled for this week, \n     the payment of all benefits\n\n[[Page S1626]]\n\n     and other disbursements scheduled for March 1 has been \n     assured.\n       In addressing our expected future cash and debt positions \n     in the light of these recent actions, I must caution that \n     there are inherent uncertainties in such predictions. Our \n     projections are revised every day to reflect the actual \n     volume of receipts and disbursements we experience, and the \n     results that are ultimately realized three to four weeks \n     hence may well vary by several billion dollars in either \n     direction from the numbers we currently estimate.\n       On March 5, Treasury is scheduled to announce the amount of \n     13- and 26-week bills that will be auctioned on March 11 and \n     issued in exchange for payment on March 14. Treasury sells \n     13- and 26-week bills every week, and this schedule follows \n     the normal pattern. While we project that there will just be \n     room under the debt limit on March 14 to issue these \n     securities, we currently estimate that the cash balance on \n     March 14, after the securities are issued, will be less than \n     the $5 billion that we consider a prudent minimum. Moreover, \n     because we estimate that the debt limit leeway remaining \n     after the bills are issued will be less than $1 billion, we \n     see no room to increase the size of the bill auction to \n     improve the cash balance, and because of our cash needs we \n     will not be able to decrease the size of the auction \n     significantly to preserve debt limit leeway.\n       Similarly, on March 12, Treasury is scheduled to announce \n     the amount of 13- and 26-week bills to be auctioned on March \n     18 and issued in exchange for payment on March 21. If there \n     is no debt limit increase, or assurance of a debt limit \n     increase, by March 12, that announcement will have to be \n     conditional: that is, it will state that the March 18 auction \n     will be held only if Treasury has assurance of its ability to \n     issue the bills on March 21 without exceeding the debt limit. \n     We strongly prefer not to make such a conditional \n     announcement because the effect is to prevent ``when-issued'' \n     trading in the securities until the final announcement is \n     made. Secondary market trading usually begins on a when-\n     issued basis immediately after the announcement of an \n     auction, and is important because it affords precaution price \n     discovery. Truncating the when-issued trading period tends to \n     increase the Government's cost of borrowing.\n       By March 13 or 14, if there is no debt limit increase, we \n     project that our cash balances will be below our prudent \n     minimum of $5 billion and that there will be less than $1 \n     billion in leeway under the debt limit. If the actual debt \n     level on March 13 or 14 is $1 billion more than we currently \n     forecast, Treasury would be out of debt limit room and would \n     not be able to issue sufficient securities to the trust funds \n     to enable all trust fund receipts to be invested on those \n     dates.\n       On March 15, under the terms of Public Law 104-103, the $29 \n     billion of securities we issued Friday will become subject to \n     the debt limit, if no debt limit increase is enacted prior to \n     that date. As a consequence, the amount of Treasury debt \n     outstanding would then be well over the limit. Of course, all \n     the outstanding debt will have been validly issued, and no \n     action to reduce debt will be mandated. Nevertheless, \n     Treasury will immediately be disabled from issuing any new \n     securities, since outstanding debt already will be in excess \n     of the debt limit. Therefore, Treasury would be unable to \n     issue securities to any trust funds either to invest their \n     incoming receipts or to roll over maturing investments. We \n     estimate that on March 15 this would leave approximately $9.8 \n     billion of trust fund assets uninvested, including \n     approximately $2.0 billion of assets of the Social Security \n     and Medicare trust funds--a result I am sure we all want to \n     avoid.\n       These trust funds, unlike the Civil Service Retirement and \n     Disability Fund and the so-called G Fund, do not have \n     statutory protection in the form of an automatic restoration \n     of interest not earned during a period in which new debt \n     cannot be issued. Thus, a subsequent Act of Congress would be \n     required to restore that lost interest. Based on past \n     experience in similar situations, we expect that Congress \n     would act to restore lost interest.\n       In addition, because savings bonds count against the debt \n     limit, new sales of savings bonds would have to be suspended \n     on March 15. This would affect approximately 45,000 banks and \n     payroll offices that act as issuing agents, and would disrupt \n     the savings programs of millions of individual investors.\n       Because March 15 is a tax payment date, cash balances will \n     improve through March 20. However, on March 21 a total of \n     $16.6 billion of trust fund assets, including $8.8 billion of \n     Social Security and Medicare receipts, would remain \n     uninvested. Moreover, on March 21 Treasury bills totaling \n     $25.5 billion will mature. If the debt limit has not been \n     increased before that time, it is unlikely, based on current \n     estimates, that the Treasury will be able to issue enough new \n     securities to raise the cash needed to pay these bills. It is \n     conceivable that our cash balance on March 21 might be as \n     much as the amount by which outstanding debt exceeds the debt \n     limit, and that we could use the cash, plus a small bill \n     auction, on that date to pay the maturing bills. However, our \n     most recent projections do not show this occurring. In any \n     event, such an action would exhaust Treasury's cash on that \n     date, and we project that on March 22 cash flow will be \n     negative.\n       As I cautioned, these projections reflect current estimates \n     only and are all subject to changes--which could be favorable \n     or unfavorable--to reflect our actual day-to-day experience \n     with receipts and disbursements. The Secretary has asked that \n     I continue to keep you informed if and as changes in the \n     projections affect the sequence of events I have set forth.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           John D. Hawke, Jr.,\n\n                                            Under Secretary of the\n                                    Treasury for Domestic Finance.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. With that, Mr. President, I would simply say I feel \nthat while the 2-week extension is urgent and absolutely indispensable, \nwe ought to do more. And with the conclusion of this part of our \ndebate, I will proceed, when the chairman is ready, to offer an \namendment that would in fact extend us to the spring of 1997 when we \nhave a new cycle in American Government and a new fiscal year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the bill has now expired.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3465\n\n              (Purpose: To increase the public debt limit)\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3465:\n       Strike all matter after the enactment clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n                       TITLE  --PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT\n\n     SEC.  01. INCREASE IN PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT.\n\n       Subsection (b) of section 3101 of title 31, United States \n     Code, is amended by striking the dollar amount contained in \n     the first sentence and inserting ``$5,400,000,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Chair. And as you have observed, this is a \nsuccinct matter. We are simply taking the debt ceiling now at $4.9 \ntrillion and raising it to $5.4 trillion. The statutory limit on the \ntotal outstanding public debt of the United States subject to that \nlimit will be reached on March 15, 1996 or shortly thereafter.\n  Might I make the point here that when we speak of the public debt, we \ninclude here all the debt owed to the various trust funds of the \nFederal Government as, for example, Social Security trust funds which \nare really internal financing arrangements that do not represent debt \nheld by private investors.\n  Today is the third time in this fiscal year that I have offered an \namendment to extend the permanent debt ceiling. On November 9, I \nproposed simply raising it to $4.967 trillion in order to provide time \nto complete action on the budget reconciliation bill. The amendment was \ntabled 49 to 47. On January 26, I offered an amendment to raise the \ndebt ceiling to $5.4 trillion, which would have taken us beyond the \nNovember elections to about May of next year. And that amendment was \nalso tabled by a very close vote, Mr. President, 46 to 45. And the \namendment I have just sent does the same thing. It would bring us to \nabout May 31, 1997. Anything sooner than that gets us involved with a \nPresidential election which will have occurred, a State of the Union \nMessage, a February recess. It seems to me that taking this issue up \nnext May is an orderly way to do it, a way to tell financial markets \nthat this country is not in jeopardy of default.\n  The very idea of default has not existed in the vocabulary of \nAmerican politics.\n  I made the point, Mr. President, that in 1814 the British invaded \nWashington, burned the White House, burned the Treasury Building, \nburned the Capitol; but the interest on the national debt continued to \nbe paid out of the sub-Treasury in Manhattan. The thought of default \nnever occurred to us. Here we are, talking about 3 weeks until \ndoomsday. Three weeks until doomsday? That is no way for a grownup, \nmature, solvent nation to behave.\n  The General Accounting Office has produced a report, ``Information on \nDebt Ceiling Limitations and Increases,'' which was prepared at my \nrequest, and reports that we are in the 21st debt ceiling crisis or \ndebt issuance suspension period since 1946. All these crises, save \nfour, have occurred since 1980-- 17 since 1980. And it is, therefore, \nno coincidence that we have closed down the Federal Government 11 times \nsince 1981--something unthinkable in previous years. But we do it.\n  The current debt ceiling crisis, which began on November 15, has \nalready lasted 114 days. Prior to this crisis, the longest one was 100 \ndays; that was 1985.\n\n[[Page S1627]]\n\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the General \nAccounting Office report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. General Accounting Office, Accounting and \n           Information Management Division,\n                                Washington, DC, February 23, 1996.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: Your January 16, 1996, letter \n     requested information on past debt ceiling limitations and \n     actions that the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) has \n     taken to avoid defaulting on government obligations. In our \n     January 26, 1996, letter to you, we discussed actions taken \n     by Treasury during debt ceiling crises since September 30, \n     1984.\\1\\ As agreed with your office, the enclosure to this \n     letter provides information on (1) when the outstanding debt \n     subject to the statutory debt limit was within $25 million \n     \\2\\ of the public debt limit between July 1, 1954, and \n     September 30, 1984, (2) the debt ceiling crises occurring \n     between September 30, 1984, and February 15, 1996, and (3) \n     when the statutory debt ceiling has been revised since June \n     26, 1946.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Debt Ceiling Limitations and Treasury Actions (GAO/AIMD-\n     96-38R, January 26, 1996).\n     \\2\\ During the current crisis, Treasury has maintained a $25 \n     million difference between the outstanding debt and the debt \n     limit.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                      Changes in the debt ceiling\n\n       The federal government began with a public debt of about \n     $78 million in 1789 and since then the Congress has attempted \n     to control the size of the debt by imposing ceilings on the \n     amount of public debt that can be issued. Until 1941, the \n     Congress set ceilings on the various types of Treasury \n     securities that could be issued. In February 1941, the \n     Congress set an overall ceiling of $65 billion on all types \n     of Treasury securities that could be outstanding at any one \n     time. This ceiling was raised several times between February \n     1941 and June 1946 when a ceiling of $275 billion was set and \n     remained in effect until August 1954. At that time, the \n     Congress imposed the first temporary debt ceiling which added \n     $6 billion to the $275 billion permanent ceiling. Since that \n     time, the Congress has enacted numerous temporary and \n     permanent increases in the debt ceiling which currently \n     stands at $4.9 trillion.\n\n\n        relationship of the debt ceiling to the outstanding debt\n\n       As shown in the following chart, the relationship between \n     the public debt limit and the amount of outstanding debt is \n     very close. \\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\3\\ These figures are nominal dollars. They are not adjusted \n     for inflation or for growth in the economy.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       (Chart not reproducible in Record.)\n       In order to determine when a debt ceiling crisis may have \n     arisen, we reviewed historical Treasury documents for the \n     period July 1, 1954, through February 15, 1996, and \n     identified 21 periods when the outstanding debt subject to \n     the statutory debt limit was within $25 million of the debt \n     ceiling.\n       If you have any questions regarding the information in this \n     letter, please call me at (202) 512-9510, or Gary Engel, \n     Assistant Director, at (202) 512-8815.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                              Gregory M.

Debt ceiling crisis.            \n                                                                        \n1 On one or more days during this period, the difference between the    \n  amount of debt subject to the limit and the debt limit was greater    \n  than $25 million. As noted in the letter, we were unable to           \n  specifically identify the debt ceiling crisis prior to September 30,  \n  1984. Therefore, in order to better estimate the periods when Treasury\n  may have had difficulty in performing its normal financing operations,\n  we assumed that Treasury's difficulties continued if the following    \n  occurred: the outstanding debt subject to the limit fell below the $25\n  million threshold and then rose to the $25 million threshold during a \n  14-day period.                                                        \n2 Specific actions taken by Treasury during these periods are discussed \n  in the following GAO report: A New Approach to the Public Debt        \n  Legislation Should Be Considered (FGMSD-79-58, September 7, 1979).    \n3 Specific actions taken by Treasury during these debt ceiling crisis   \n  are discussed in the following GAO reports: Civil Service Fund:       \n  Improved Controls Needed Over Investments (GAO/AFMD-87-17, May 7,     \n  1987) and Treasury's Management of Social Security Trust Funds During \n  the Debt Ceiling Crisis (GAO/HRD-86-45, December 5, 1985).            \n\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Again to say, a default by the Treasury would have disastrous \nconsequences for the domestic economy of the United States and for \nglobal financial markets. I make the point that during the 1980's, we \nbecame a debtor nation, the world's largest debtor nation. To \njeopardize the full faith and credit of that debt is to jeopardize the \nwell-being of the Nation.\n  I have, Mr. President, one last thing to say, a point to make, a \npositive point. I know that there are many persons who legitimately \nfeel that in extending the debt ceiling we are only somehow extending \nthe tendency to spend more than we have in the way of income, to be \nexcessive and improvident and, in consequence, debt ridden.\n  Mr. President, this is not the case. Owing in large measure--or so I \nchoose to believe--to the budget measures, tax and spending measures we \ntook in 1993, we are now in a very solid cash-flow situation for the \nfirst time since the late 1960's. We are seeing the legacy of debt but \nalso the consequence of legitimate behavior.\n  In this period, 1994-97, for the first time since the administrations \nof John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, the Federal Government will have \nmore revenue than expenditure on programs and procurement. This also \nwent through to the first years of President Nixon. We had a very small \nsurplus, tiny, $3.1 billion in the first half of the decade; $2.3 \nbillion in the second half. Then there was the period of the Nixon \nadministration when matters were just even, properly so.\n  Then with the onset of President Ford's administration, then \nPresident Carter's, with the great increase in oil prices, inflation, \nthings of that kind, we began to borrow money to pay for ongoing \nprograms, $22 billion, then $13 billion.\n  The first years of the Reagan administration we borrowed $80 billion \nto pay for ongoing programs. Some of it is investment, but it was \nongoing. Then in the administration of the latter years of Mr. Reagan, \nit dropped to $21 billion.\n  Then Mr. Bush had the misfortune of a recession, which reduced \nrevenues, and in some ways raised outlays, and you have a big deficit, \nback to a $64.8 billion shortfall between revenues and outlays.\n  Mr. President, we are now at a $56.7 billion surplus. That means what \nwe call the deficit is entirely accounted for by interest on the debt \nwe accumulated in this period. We have our budget in balance, save for \nwhat we borrowed in the 1980's.\n  There were those who had in mind that is what we should do--that \ndeficits would end up choking the life out of the Federal Government \nand its programs. They had a phrase for it called ``starve the beast.'' \nThey were not wrong. It was the idea that you could not argue this \nprogram out of existence and that program out of existence; just starve \nthe Government of revenues. And you are then forced to do things you \nwould have never dreamed of previously. For example, the present \nadministration proposed a 7-year balanced budget glidepath which had \nenormous reductions in discretionary spending. Now you seem to have no \nalternative because of the debt service.\n  But I do say, Mr. President, we can see our way out of this. We have \ncut our outlays. Our revenues are solid. If we stay on this path, we \nwill get to the point where the debt begins to decline. Then it can be \na very rapid event.\n  I say this to those Members of the House, really, who themselves had \nthe good sense in 1979 to make the debt ceiling extension automatic. \nPassage of the budget resolution automatically increased the debt \nceiling by the necessary amount. I say to them that, if they see an \nincrease in the debt ceiling as being an invitation to spend moneys you \ndo not have, that you have been forced to borrow--that may indeed have \nbeen the case in the 1980's; it is not the case today. We are beginning \nto act in a mature and open and defensible way.\n  Let us put this debt ceiling behind us. Let us not have 3 weeks of \nsaying, my God, in 3 weeks it is doomsday. No. Let us not put this off \nand let us do the right thing--pay our bills until next May. In the \ninterval there will be a Presidential election. We will hear a lot \nabout this subject. We will have a new administration. I hope we will \nhave the same President, but he will be in his second term. If we do \nnot, we will have the distinguished majority leader, one-time chairman \nof the Finance Committee, a man who will know what to do. We are on the \nright path. Let us do the right thing.\n  With that, Mr. President, reserving the remainder of my time, I yield \nthe floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to speak with regard to \nthe proposed debt increase issue for 3 or 4 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from Delaware \nthat he has 13 minutes remaining, and the Senator from New York has 1 \nminute, 26 seconds.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield the Senator 3 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the floor manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have grave concerns about the \nproposal to increase the debt without having a mandate in place to \naddress a balanced budget. For this body to vote to increase the debt \nwithout having a budget that can be achievably balanced is \nirresponsible.\n  What we are doing here, I think, is extraordinarily irresponsible. We \nare losing the leverage that we have--and the leverage that we have is \nthe ability to affect just how much spending occurs. Mr. President, \nthis body cannot face an authorization to increase the debt unless this \nbody has found a way to ensure that the debt is not going to continue \nuncontrolled. This is the realization that we must not be afraid to \nface: the Government simply does not have the discipline to control its \nspending; the Government does not have the discipline and constraints \nto control its spending as is dictated in the private sector.\n  What should this body be doing? Well, Mr. President, this body should \nbe doing the only responsible thing to do when one incurs too much \ndebt--and that is decrease expenses. It is not responsible to the debt \nwithout taking corrective action.\n  The greatest concern this country has is too much debt, and now we \nare being asked to accumulate that debt further by increasing the debt \nceiling from $4.9 trillion to somewhere in the area of $5.4 trillion. \nWhat is the rationale for this? The argument is that we simply have to. \nI am not arguing with the reality that we have to pay our bills, but to \nsuggest that we go ahead with this authorization without first having \naddressed a mandatory balanced budget is absolutely irresponsible.\n  To suggest that we are up against some time frame of tomorrow or the \nnext day is not necessarily true. We know that the Secretary of the \nTreasury has continued to borrow from funds, and likely can do so for a \nlimited period of time. So, why not take\n\n[[Page S1629]]\n\nthis opportunity--when there is a need now that is greater than it has \never been before--to establish a methodology to achieve a balanced \nbudget?\n  Mr. President, interest currently is about 16 percent of our total \nexpenditure. Mr. President, that is a cost that we have absolutely no \ncontrol over; it is an automatic cost that continues to grow and does \nnot disappear. It's like having a horse--and the Senator from Montana \nknows about horses. You may feed a horse and watch him eat, but that \nhorse continues to eat when you're not around--that horse eats while \nyou sleep. A horse's eating cannot be controlled and neither can this \ncountry's interest expenditures. In Canada, 20 percent of the budget is \ninterest on the debt. They cannot afford their health care. If you look \nat Central America countries, South America countries, what put them \nunder was too much debt.\n  Currently our interest costs are more than our annual deficit. We are \nbroke, yet we just keep spending. And to suggest that we are on the \nright track without having mandatory discipline is absolutely \nunrealistic.\n  Some may suggest the problem will fix itself--the economy will expand \nor the tax base will increase, and so forth. Those are all fine. But we \nhave not addressed a responsible method to curtail this runaway debt, \nand here we are today prepared to increase the debt ceiling without \nhaving taken the corrective action, and this Senator from Alaska is \ngoing to vote against it.\n  The rationale is obvious: We have to be disciplined. We better face \nup to it because we are going to be right back here again in a year, 18 \nmonths, more or less, increasing the debt ceiling again. Will we have \nthe leverage then? Well, we have the leverage now, and that leverage is \nto enact a mandatory balanced budget. Only then will I vote for the \ndebt ceiling, but not until. I appreciate the floor manager allowing me \nthis time.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I respectfully rise in opposition to the \nMoynihan amendment. I am sure he recalls, as I do, that when George \nMitchell was the distinguished majority leader of this Senate, he often \nsaid the perfect is the enemy of the good when Republicans offered \namendments from time to time.\n\n  I just want to reiterate that, as I stated earlier, it is this \nSenator's intention, hopefully upon the successful enactment of the \nlegislation before us, without the Moynihan amendment, it is this \nSenator's intention to work toward passage of a long-term debt ceiling \nextension later this month. As I have said, we cannot and will not \ndefault on our debts, and I know that is a matter with which the \ndistinguished Senator from New York agrees.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. There is no disagreement.\n  Mr. ROTH. Let me suggest that the problem with the Moynihan amendment \nis that I think we do make it possible for there to be a default if we \ndo not move successfully on the legislation before us. The House, I \njust want to point out, passed the legislation, H.R. 3021, by a vote of \n362 to 51. Most of the ``no'' votes came from Republicans. The House \nleadership says that the Moynihan amendment would not pass on the House \nside. So it is unlikely that a straightforward debt limit bill will \npass. The House wishes, as you know, to combine that with entitlement \nreform, and we intend to vote on that later this month.\n  The point I want to emphasize is that we are running the risk that, \nif the Moynihan amendment should be adopted, it will not be agreed upon \non the House side, and time is not on our side.\n  As I said earlier, the amendment before us really jeopardizes the \nability of Treasury to manage the public debt. We may not have until \nMarch 21 or even March 15, as I understand the situation. Treasury has \ninformed us that next week, cash levels will be imprudently low, \nsomething under $1 billion. I think that is the first time that \nsituation has arisen where we are running that kind of a risk.\n  The distinguished Senator, my good friend and colleague, asked for \nthe letter from John D. Hawke, Jr., the Under Secretary of the Treasury \nfor Domestic Finance, to be printed as part of the Record.\n  I want to read one paragraph from that letter where the Under \nSecretary says:\n\n       By March 13 or 14, if there is no debt limit increase, we \n     project that our cash balances will be below our prudent \n     minimum of $5 billion and that there will be less than $1 \n     billion in leeway under the debt limit.\n       If the actual debt level on March 13 or 14 is $1 billion \n     more than we currently forecast, Treasury would be out of \n     debt limit room and would not be able to issue sufficient \n     securities to the trust funds to enable all trust fund \n     receipts to be invested on those dates.\n\n  So that, in my judgment, is why we wish and need to enact H.R. 3021 \nnow, unamended, so that this danger of running out of funds can be \naverted.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge my friends and colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to reject the so-called Moynihan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to make a few remarks to go along \nwith Senator Murkowski's remarks on a lot of reservations some of us \nhave about extending the debt limit without tying it to a responsible \nbalanced budget amendment, so that we do not literally give Congress an \nopen checkbook to go ahead and spend and spend and spend.\n  I wanted to clarify that we are here today to consider a short-term \nextension to this debt ceiling, to give us time for 2 weeks to work out \na further extension of this. What are we asking today? We are asking to \nbe able to borrow more money. For what? To pay interest.\n  I tell people back home, it is like if you go to one banker to borrow \nmoney so you could pay interest to another banker you owe on another \nloan. If you get into that position, you are in financial trouble. That \nis what we are doing here, borrowing more money year after year, and it \ndoes nothing but cover up a history of mismanaging this country's \nfinances. This is without going back and addressing the problem.\n  We have to get our finances in order. We have to agree on a balanced \nbudget within the next 7 years. This should not be viewed as a \npolitical excuse to put off balancing this budget. The debt ceiling \nshould only be passed, and I will only vote for it, if it has some \nspecific instructions on how we are going to achieve a balanced budget \nand not to just say, well, we are going to borrow some more and add to \nthe debt, which is going to put our children even deeper into their \nfinancial problems, so we can go on and continue business as usual here \nin Washington. We cannot do that any longer.\n  We need to have some real reforms when it comes to the problems of \nthe entitlements, welfare, Medicare, and Medicaid. We have been working \ntoward this, and, hopefully, within the next couple of weeks, we can \nwork out something that will put us on that glidepath.\n  I am going to propose what I call the ``taxpayer protection \nlockbox,'' which means that if revenues exceed even our spending \nforecasts, those extra dollars will not be given to Congress to spend \non even a larger Government. But if there are additional revenues \navailable, they will be returned to either the taxpayer in the form of \ntax relief, or they can only be spent to reduce the debt. But once we \nset this spending level, we want to make sure that, if additional \nrevenues do come in, Congress does not have an open checkbook to spend \neven more.\n  So I wanted to respectfully ask that we examine this problem and make \nsure that any extension in the debt limit is tied to a balanced budget.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has 1 minute 24 \nseconds.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, first, let me say to my friend from \nMinnesota that he is quite right that we spent moneys we did not have. \nWe spent them in the 1980's. This is clear and inexorable. This table \nshows it in these bar charts. We have finally gotten to the point where \nwe have revenues above the levels of outlays. We did this in 1993 with \na vote on which not a single vote was found on the other side of the \naisle to do so. But we did it. Now, can we not put this argument aside, \nresolve our remaining legislative matters, and get on with the \nPresidential election, rather than holding the full faith and credit of \nthe United States at jeopardy?\n\n[[Page S1630]]\n\n  I want to thank my esteemed chairman for the clarity and tone of his \nremarks. Whichever way this vote will go, we will manage to get through \nthis. But that we are doing this for the 17th time since 1980 suggests \nthat we better look to our procedures in the future.\n  Mr. President, with thanks to the chairman, I yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Will the Senator yield me 1 minute?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Roth may have 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nYork for his remarks. I must, once again, urge the defeat of the so-\ncalled Moynihan amendment. If it should carry, I think it is critically \nimportant that it be recognized that we would be jeopardizing the \nability of the Treasury to manage the public debt.\n  As I said earlier, we may not have until March 21, or even March 15. \nTreasury, again, has informed us that next week cash levels will be \nimprudently low and under $1 billion. That is the reason it is \ncritically important that we enact H.R. 3021 without amendment. As I \nhave assured the distinguished Senator from New York, then we will look \nat the longer term and work together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON (after having voted in the affirmative). Mr. President, on \nthis vote I have a pair with the distinguished Senator from Kansas [Mr. \nDole]. If he were present and voting, he would vote ``nay.'' If I were \nat liberty to vote, I would vote ``yea.'' I withdraw my vote.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, there \nwill be no more recorded votes today. However, I think it should be \nnoted that we had hoped to move forward on the small business \nderegulation bill. There has been basically an objection to bringing \nthat up at this time by one of the Democratic Members, perhaps other \nMembers about bringing it up at this time. We are attempting though to \nreach an agreement on when that bill will be considered. It is one that \npassed overwhelmingly, unanimously, bipartisan, a good bill. I think \neverybody understands that. We have agreement on it. We should go ahead \nand move that legislation. I have discussed this with the distinguished \nDemocratic leader. We are now trying to get an agreement on making sure \nthat we get it up in a very short, reasonable period of time.\n  We will begin the omnibus appropriations bill on Monday morning. \nAmendments will be started on Monday with the votes to occur on \nTuesday, and we will have some further specific announcement on the \ntime of those votes. Also, we are expecting Members to have amendments \nready on Monday on this omnibus appropriations bill. Again, I have \ndiscussed this with the Democratic leader. We do know already at least \none amendment that will be ready on Monday is the Daschle omnibus \namendment. We are working now, we are hoping maybe even here in the \nnext few minutes to get some of the amendments, a list of the \namendments that would be available on Monday.\n  I do want to emphasize also it is important that we get a reasonable \nagreement on time for handling this legislation because it will call \nfor a conference with the House because there clearly will be \ndifferences between the two bodies' versions of the omnibus \nappropriations bill. We need to get it done in time so there can be a \nconference, an agreement in conference, and get this matter hopefully \nconcluded by Thursday of next week.\n  There will be no votes on Friday and no votes on Monday, but I \nemphasize again we will begin debate on this omnibus appropriations \nbill with amendments to be offered. I hope Members will not try to hold \ntheir amendments to the second day. We just will not physically be able \nto accommodate that. We are going to work across the aisle to get an \nagreement on that at the appropriate time.\n  I do want to inform Members that later there will be a cloture motion \nlaid down on Whitewater, and in all probability on the D.C. \nappropriations conference report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1630-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1630-S1631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, last week the major leaders of the \ntelevision and movie industries in the United States met with President \nClinton, Vice President Gore, and in separate meetings with several of \nus in Congress to address the issues of glamorized violence and sexual \nexploitation.\n  President Clinton and the industry leaders are to be congratulated \nfor coming together, an indication that both the leaders of Government \nand the industry take this issue seriously.\n  Second, while I opposed the Federal Government mandating the V-chip \nand the ratings system that goes with it, the fact that the industry \nhas decided to address the pressure in the telecommunications bill for \nthem to voluntarily set up a system rather than oppose the proposal in \nthe courts will do some good. It is a signal to the American people \nthat the industry is willing to show self-restraint and that good \ncitizenship can prevail over the profits-at-any-cost philosophy.\n  My experience with this issue suggests that progress can continue to \nbe made without Government entering the constitutionally dangerous \nfield of regulating content and without the industry impairing either \nits profits or its effectiveness. But because this field that is \nentered is new in the United States for the industry, there will be \nsome stumbling along the way. The path of real progress is rarely easy \nin any type of endeavor.\n  The television-movie leaders deserve our congratulations not only for \nthe step just announced but for a series of positive actions that have \nbeen taken over the past few years. The industry initially moved in a \nmore conservative direction somewhat reluctantly, but as more and more \nleaders started self-examination and found pride and satisfaction in \nthe good they were doing, the progress has become more measurable.\n  In 1986, when I began talking about violence on television, I was a \nlonely voice. The entertainment industry responded to my calls for a \nreduction in gratuitous and glamorized violence on television with \nalmost universal denials of any link between violence on television and \nviolence in our society. For even suggesting such a link, I was loudly \nand enthusiastically denounced by some.\n  When I asked that they work together to establish joint standards on \nviolence, the networks told me that antitrust laws precluded them from \ndoing so. When I introduced and Congress passed an antitrust exemption \nin 1990, signed into law by President Bush, to allow them to discuss \nthis issue, they spent the first year and a half of the exemption doing \nnothing. Finally, halfway through the exemption, I took to the Senate \nfloor to call the Nation's attention to this issue and the industry's \ninaction. Public hearings were held in the House and the Senate.\n  In response to this public pressure, the networks announced joint \nstandards on violence in 1992. The broadcast networks led the way on \nthis, followed by cable and the independents. The standards they \ndeveloped were not as strong as I would have liked, not as strong as \nthe British standards, for example, but a positive step forward.\n\n  In the summer of 1993, the networks established a parental advisory \nsystem. They took significant nonpublic actions to change the shape of \nthings. The President of one of the broadcast networks told me that he \nviewed a film they had paid $1.5 million for, and after viewing it he \ndecided the network should take a loss and not show it because of its \nviolence.\n  When the officials of one network met, initially, one or two sharply \ncriticized what I was doing. Then one of the officers asked the \nquestion, ``Do you let your children watch what we are producing?'' He \nreported that question changed the whole tone of the meeting and what \nthey would produce in the future.\n  Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Association, and others, \narranged for me to meet with the Writers Guild and the Directors Guild, \nthe creative people who help to shape what we view. A few of them were \nhostile, some reluctant, and others clearly welcomed a slightly \ndifferent thrust.\n  In August 1993, the first-ever industrywide conference on the issue \nof gratuitous television violence was held. At that conference, I urged \nthe industry to select independent monitors, not censors, to make any \nreports to the public about television programming. In early 1994, both \nthe broadcast and cable networks announced they would do it and \nannounced their selection for independent monitors.\n  These monitors, the UCLA Center for Communication Policy and \nMediascope, have now each issued their first annual reports. Many \ncritics dismissed these monitors as pawns of the industry because the \nindustry is paying for their work.\n  These first reports clearly belie that suspicion. They are solid, \ncritical examinations of television programming. They make concrete \nsuggestions for ways to improve. The reports exceeded my greatest \nhopes.\n  These studies show that television violence is still a problem, but \nthe very existence of the reports should encourage everyone concerned \nabout this issue. The networks invested significant sums to fund this, \nand they have respected the independence of the monitors' work.\n  The industry has proposed a voluntary rating system to provide the \npublic with more information about their programming. I applaud this \nvoluntary effort. The question is where we go from here.\n  Laudable as the most recent step by the industry is--though I voted \nagainst that V-chip in the version that passed the Senate as an unwise \nand probably unconstitutional intrusion of the Federal Government in \nthe field of content--I have concerns that some in industry and \nGovernment are looking to this as the answer to the question of \ngratuitous violence. It will help concerned parents. Perhaps of greater \ninfluence, it will affect advertising for those who accept that form of \nsustenance.\n  I have these concerns:\n  First, it will take years before the V-chip is in most American \nhomes.\n  Second, the recent report on television by Mediascope suggests that \nwhile ratings help parents and are helpful with young children, boys \nbetween the ages of 11 and 14 are attracted by an R rating, not \nrepelled by it. If the study had included young people between the ages \nof 15 and 19, my instinct is that the R rating would prove to be even \nmore of a magnet.\n\n  Third, teenagers are mechanically very adept. Many will find their \nway around the V-chip, if by no other means, by going to a friend's \nhome.\n  Fourth, and most important, the homes that most need to use the V-\nchip will not use it. Children in high-\n\n[[Page S1632]]\n\ncrime areas watch half again as much television as in areas where crime \nis less prevalent. Too often, the children of those parents are \ndesperately just trying to get by, and if watching more violence on \ntelevision keeps the children off the streets, it will strike many \nparents as a reasonable tradeoff.\n  So I welcome the industry's considerable effort to assist the \nAmerican public with ratings and the V-chip, but I view it as a mixed \nblessing.\n  Let me close by issuing a challenge to the industry and to my \ncolleagues. To the leaders of television, I applaud the progress you \nare making. Broadcast entertainment TV is measurably less violent than \n5 years ago and cable TV is slightly less violent. If this progress \ncontinues, 10 years from now people will look back on today's \ntelevision as we now look back on old movies that have the heroes and \nheroines smoking and drinking heavily. Moving away from that stereotype \ndid not hurt the movies and television, and it helped the American \npublic.\n  I urge all industry leaders to read the two fine monitoring reports \nthat the broadcast and cable industries authorized. I particularly call \nyour attention to the statistic in the more recent report that 73 \npercent of violence in entertainment television has no immediate \nadverse consequences for the perpetrators of the violence.\n  The message to children and adults from that: Violence pays. The same \nreport notes that only 4 percent of violent programs emphasize an \nantiviolence theme. It should not be difficult for television \nexecutives to tell your writers and directors and other creative people \nto shift this emphasis. We do not need to wait for a V-chip for that.\n  To my colleagues in Government, I urge patience. As one of the \nharshest critics of the industry, let us acknowledge that progress has \nbeen made even before this latest announcement and congratulate the \nindustry for it. It is no accident that the top five in the network \nratings on television today are not violent shows.\n  Let us applaud the progress that has been made, and let the dust \nsettle a little, viewing carefully and not emotionally where we are, \nand not pass more legislation at this time. President Clinton and \nSenator Bob Dole deserve some of the credit for the progress that has \nbeen made, as do many other of my colleagues of both parties in the \nHouse and the Senate. Periodic hearings should be held to determine \nwhat is happening, but let us not derail a train that is now headed in \na better direction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson).

Mr. President, it is with regret, I tell my colleagues \ntoday, that we are not able to proceed at this time with the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, S. 942, which was marked \nup by the Small Business Committee yesterday. We had hoped to be able \nto go forward on what is a very sound, bipartisan bill that responds to \nthe major regulatory reform requests of the delegates to the White \nHouse Conference on Small Business. At this time, there is an objection \non the other side of the aisle to calling that measure up for \nconsideration today.\n  Frankly, I am very disappointed that we are not able to go forward, \nbecause this is something that we in the Small Business Committee, with \nthe help of others in this body who are concerned about small business, \nhave worked on for a long time.\n  I want to pay a very special thanks to my ranking member, Senator \nBumpers, and his staff who worked with us and the other members of the \ncommittee to get what I think is a good bill. It was passed out of the \ncommittee on a 17 to 0 vote. It was one which I had hoped we would be \nable to move quickly.\n  We are coming up very shortly on the 1-year anniversary of the White \nHouse Conference on Small Business. A number of small businesses do not \nunderstand how slowly this place moves. Sometimes I do not understand \nhow slowly this place moves.\n  It would seem to many that the time has come to respond to their \nrequests. There are several simple requests.\n  One of them is to put some teeth in the measure that is supposed to \ngive small businesses an opportunity to be heard in the regulatory \nprocess. Congress passed, and the President signed about 16 years ago, \na measure called the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The objective of that \nact was to make sure that Government regulations which affected small \nbusiness took a look at the impact on small businesses and choose a \nmeans of minimizing the hassle, the redtape, the wasted energy, the \nwasted effort that a regulation might impose on a small entity. I say \nsmall entity because that is only small business. It has a small \nprofit. We have had people from colleges and universities who wring \ntheir hands and tell us that the same hassles the small businesses face \naffect them. I cannot tell you the number of county and city officials \nin my State who say, I wish we had the ear of some of the regulators in \nWashington because they do not take into account what some of these \nregulations that might be perfectly workable for a large corporation, \nor even a State government, do when it comes down to the local level to \na small business.\n\n  Well, for years, the White House conference delegates and other small \nbusiness groups have said that if you want to make regulatory \nflexibility work, you have to put some teeth into it. When the reg flex \nbill was passed initially, there was an exclusion of judicial \nenforcement. In other words, you could not go to court and say a \nFederal regulatory agency failed to take into account the impact on \nsmall business. Well, we have, by a bipartisan effort, a measure which \nprovides judicial enforcement for regulatory flexibility. The President \nhas called for it, the Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration has called for it, leading Members of both sides of the \naisle in this body have called for it. We would make regulatory \nflexibility subject to the judicial enforcement. Why? Because, quite \nfrankly, right now, when the Small Business Council for Advocacy goes \nto a Federal agency and says, ``You did not take into account how this \nis really going to tie up small business, and you are putting a \ntremendous recordkeeping burden on them, putting them through a \ntremendous hassle,'' too often those agencies say, ``Tough luck.''\n  So what are you going to do about it? The answer is nothing. He \ncannot do anything about it. Under this bill, he could do something \nabout it. Under this bill, a small entity could do something about it. \nWell, that is what is being held up today. That is what we had hoped to \nbring to the floor this afternoon, to do what the small businesses of \nAmerica have asked us to do, and that is let their voice be heard in \nWashington. Let them have an opportunity to express their concerns and \ntheir complaints to the agencies that are driving them nuts.\n  I might add, parenthetically, that even the Small Business \nAdministration itself came out with a bunch of regulations, some of \nthem in its loan programs, and others, which we think might make it \nmore difficult for small businesses. It would not be a bad idea for the \nSmall Business Administration to take a look at how its own regulations \nimpact small business. We can give them some help. Well, we cannot do \nit until we have S. 942, or the contents of that bill, passed by both \nHouses and signed by the President.\n\n  This measure also does some other things that are very important. It \nsays when you write a regulation, you have to tell, in plain English, \ncommonsense language, how an entity can comply with it, what you are \nreally getting at in a regulation. We are saying that if you do not do \nthat, if a regulatory agency wants to bring an enforcement action \nagainst a small entity, the small entity can look and say, here are \nyour guidelines; or, if you do not have any guidelines, you can publish \nguidelines. Sometimes the simplifying guidelines a Federal agency puts \nout are very thick. For a small business with one, two, or three \nemployees, not many of them have the time to read\n\n[[Page S1633]]\n\nthrough hundreds of pages of directions. That is not simple language. I \nthink that is a tool the small businesses need.\n  Senator Domenici, as a result of small business hearings we had in \nNew Mexico, had a good idea, one that we need to try out, which is \nincluded in this bill. It would give small businesses an opportunity to \nparticipate in making the regulations in the first place. Let them be \nheard. Bring them in and let them have a crack at it. Let them have an \nopportunity to say how the goals of the legislation--that is, what the \nregulations are supposed to do to help achieve the goals of \nlegislation--how those goals can better be achieved as they affect \nsmall business. That is also included in it.\n  And then we have a final provision that also came from the hearings \nthat we held around the country, from Georgia to Alaska, Tennessee, and \nMissouri. We have had hearings in Minnesota, all around the country, \nand we have heard a lot of small businesses say that it is not just the \nregulations; sometimes it is the regulators themselves. Sometimes the \nregulators themselves come in and act like they have been sent by the \nking rather than by a popularly elected Government. They act like they \nrepresent a monarch, and they tread on the rights of the people who do \nnot have the resources to fight them.\n  So we would set up an ombudsman, who would be available for a small \nbusiness or a farmer, or other small operators, to raise an objection \nas to how an inspector operates. I asked the small businesses before, \n``Why do you not object if OSHA sends in an inspector who is \noverreaching, who does not listen to your side of the story, who says \nit is his way or the highway? Why do you not just object to the \nagency?'' They say, ``If we object to the agency, that same guy is \ngoing to come here next month, and instead of fining us $4,000 for not \nhaving a label on some dish-washing soap, he could increase the fine, \nor it could get even worse.''\n\n  So we set up a means where an affected small business or entity that \ngets stepped on by these enforcers could register a complaint. We set \nup regional regulatory fairness boards to hear these complaints. I \nthink it will help the agencies themselves to root out a bad apple, or \nto bring in an inspector, examiner, or representative who is out of \nhand and say, ``We have had complaints about you. You are not helping \nthe citizens we are supposed to serve and represent to comply with the \nlaws and with the regulations. You need to shape up the way you are \nacting.''\n  Well, that ombudsman provision, the regulatory fairness provision, is \nalso included in S. 942.\n  Finally, equal access for justice. We want to make it easier if you \nare a small business and the Federal Government comes in and says, ``We \nneed a million dollars in penalties,'' and you say, ``That would put me \nout of business. It is not a willful violation, and I did not cause \nserious harm. It is the first time I have done it.'' That is totally \nout of whack. If they proceed against you and get a $10,000 fine, then \nyou ought to be able to get your attorney's fees from the agency that \ntried to run over you. It makes them accountable. It makes sure that \nthe agency comes in with demands that are not out of reason. That, too, \nis in S. 942.\n  Unfortunately, at this point, there is an objection on the other \nside. I know that we have very strong support, particularly from the \nmembers of the Small Business Committee, on both Republican and \nDemocratic side. We would like to move this bill. We have time set up \non the floor. This is valuable time that we are wasting that we are not \nmoving forward on this bill. This is the time that we could be doing \nsomething that would respond to the concerns that the small businesses \nof America have about how the Federal Government acts.\n\n  Unfortunately, as long as there is that objection, it will take us \nsome time to bring it up. We will bring it up. I know everybody seemed \nto be ready for it. The people who were involved in crafting it were \nready to come to the floor.\n  I say by way of explanation to our other colleagues that I truly \nregret we cannot pass this measure. It is one I know had total \nbipartisan support in the committee. I think it will have strong \nbipartisan support on the floor. The President has already indicated \nhis support for the basic principle of judicial enforcement of \nregulatory flexibility.\n  Mr. President, I only say we are still ready to do business if the \nMembers on the other side change their mind. It is too bad we have \nvaluable time set aside on the floor and we are not able to move.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order of \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand that someone from the \nmajority will be coming to the floor to offer a unanimous-consent \nrequest that has to do with a number of matters pertaining to our \nschedule for next week. While he is on his way, let me simply explain \nthe dilemma that requires our objection to moving at this time to the \nSmall Business Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n  We have no objection to the substance of this particular bill, with \nthe understanding that some technical details remain to be resolved. I \nam quite confident that if all we had to do was to consider the bill, \nafter only a short period of time for debate and adoption of a \nmanagers' amendment to clarify some technical questions with the bill, \nwe would then be in a position to vote, I would suspect unanimously, \nfor that particular legislation.\n  The dilemma is that the bill will very likely be used as the vehicle \nfor another very big debate, unlimited debate, over the whole issue of \ncomprehensive regulatory reform. That issue has been before the Senate \nfor weeks already during this Congress. Several attempts to invoke \ncloture were made and failed. We could thus find ourselves in much the \nsame set of circumstances again next week were comprehensive regulatory \nreform legislation offered as an amendment to this bill.\n  My concern is that the Senate has many important and timely issues \nfacing it. We have a debt limit extension bill, the continuing \nresolution, the Whitewater resolution and a number of other issues \npending. I would be very concerned if this body found itself mired once \nmore in an impasse over comprehensive regulatory reform, with no real \nhope of coming to some consensus, some compromise.\n  We are getting closer. I think at some point there may be an \nopportunity to bring a bill to the floor. But we are not there yet. I \nthink that rejoining this debate at this time on this bill would most \nlikely undermine what possibilities there are for regulatory reform.\n  So bringing regulatory reform to the floor under those circumstances \nwould not be what I view to be a very constructive exercise. But it is \nnot my objection this afternoon that will cause the bill not to be \nscheduled. There are objections within our caucus, and I respect those \nobjections. They are being made for legitimate reasons.\n  So we will continue to try to resolve these outstanding difficulties \nand come to some resolution at some point in the future. But until the \nbroader issues relating to this particular bill are resolved, we would \nnot be in a position to go to the bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on February 28, the Postal Service \nrecognized 50 years of Fulbright scholarships by issuing a \ncommemorative stamp in\n\n[[Page S1634]]\n\nhonor of this outstanding program. Fittingly, the unveiling ceremony \nwas held at the University of Arkansas, where Senator J. William \nFulbright served as president.\n  The Fulbright scholarships were established by the Congress in 1946 \nunder legislation proposed by Senator Fulbright. They were intended to \nincrease mutual understanding between the United States and countries \nworldwide. By anyone's measure, this program has been a great success.\n  Each year, nearly 5,000 individuals are given the opportunity to \nbroaden their professional or academic knowledge by studying or \nlecturing at renowned international universities, or conducting \ncollaborative research with foreign countries. Since its inception, \nnearly a quarter million people have participated in the Fulbright \nprogram.\n  The design of the stamp itself emphasizes the international exchange \nof students, scholars, artists, and other professionals that the \nscholarships facilitate. A compass laid over top of a human head \nsymbolizes the power of the mind applied to all areas, while a \ndecorative bookbinding paper background represents academics and the \narts.\n  Mr. President, J. William Fulbright of Arkansas served the public \nwith great distinction for more than 30 years. He gave great thought \nand care to America's role in the world, and it is most fitting that \nthe Postal Service has chosen to pay tribute to the international \nexchange program which bears his name.\n  I know this stamp is a source of great pride not only to Senator \nFulbright's family, but to all who have been associated with this \nspecial program. I hope the issuance of this commemorative stamp will \nhelp ensure another 50 years of Fulbright scholarships.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1633-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

This event was celebrated in nearly 6,000 \nschools in all 50 States and 61 countries.\n  My pride stems from the fact that this celebration, which is \nrecognized by the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, \nwas established by the Institute for International Sport in 1991. The \nInstitute, housed at the University of Rhode Island, has brought us the \nhugely successful World Scholar-Athlete Games, which will be held again \nin 1997, as well as the Rhode Island scholar-athlete games. Now in its \nsixth year, National Sportsmanship Day has grown not only into a \nnational movement, but an international one as well.\n  National Sportsmanship Day was conceived to create an awareness among \nthe students of this country--from grade school to university level--of \nthe importance of ethics, fair play, and sportsmanship in all facets of \nathletics as well as society as a whole. The need to periodically \nrefocus our young people on sportsmanship and fair play is sadly \nevident on the playing field in these days of taunting, fighting, \nwinning at all costs mentality, and the lure of huge sums of money for \nathletes hardly ready to cope with life's normal challenges.\n  To commemorate National Sportsmanship Day, the Institute for \nInternational Sport sends to all participating schools packets of \ninformation with instructional materials on the themes surrounding the \nissue of sportsmanship. Throughout the country, students are involved \nin discussions, writing essays, creating art work, and in other \ncreative ways engaging each other on the subject.\n  Mr. President, as it has in past years, the President's Council on \nPhysical Fitness and Sports has recognized National Sportsmanship Day. \nI ask unanimous consent that the letter signed by the council's \ncochairs Florence Griffith Joyner and former congressman Tom McMillen \nbe inserted in the Record following my remarks. Mr. President, I would \nalso commend and urge my colleagues to encourage students to focus on \nNational Sportsmanship Day and the lessons contained therein.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        The President's Council on\n\n\n                                  Physical Fitness and Sports,\n\n                                        Washington DC, March 1996.\n       The President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports is \n     pleased to recognize March 5, 1996, as National Sportsmanship \n     Day. The valuable life skills and lessons that are learned by \n     youth and adults through participation in sports cannot be \n     overestimated.\n       Participation in sports contributes to all aspects of our \n     lives, such as heightened awareness of the value of fair \n     play, ethics, integrity, honesty and sportsmanship, as well \n     as improving levels of physical fitness and health.\n       The President's Council congratulates the Institute for \n     International Sport for its continued leadership in \n     organizing this important day. We wish you every success in \n     your efforts to broaden participation in and awareness of \n     National Sportsmanship Day.\n     Florence Griffith Joyner,\n       Cochair.\n     Tom McMillen,\n       Cochair.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1634-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1634-S1636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CHINA, TAIWAN, AND THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, shortly after I announced that I would be \nretiring from the Senate, President Clinton called and suggested that \nfrom time to time, I should give a report on some issue facing the \nNation, and today I am again doing that--this time with a few \nobservations about the relationship between China, Taiwan, and the \nUnited States.\n  My interest in this subject is more than a sudden thrust caused by \nrecent developments. My parents were Lutheran missionaries in China and \nhad returned to the United States 1 month when I was born. I tell \nChinese-American audiences that I was ``made in China.'' I grew up in a \nhome that had Chinese art, guests, and influence. That gives me no more \nexpertise than others, but I mention it because my interest has been \nlongstanding.\n  Before the Shanghai communique that recognized the People's Republic \nof China, I favored recognizing the mainland Chinese Government, as \nwell as the Government on Taiwan. It would have been somewhat similar \nto our recognizing both West Germany and East Germany as two separate \ngovernments. Neither Germany was particularly happy with that, but it \nacknowledged reality, and it did not prevent the two governments from \neventually merging into one Germany.\n  Following that course with China and Taiwan would have been a wiser \npolicy, and it would have acknowledged what is a reality: There are two \nseparate governments.\n  But that did not happen, and hindsight is an easy luxury.\n  The situation now is confusing and could turn dangerous. Our \ncolleague Senator Dianne Feinstein has described United States policy \ntoward China as one of zig-zagging, and that, unfortunately, is an apt \ndescription.\n  Let me outline where we are and why I believe a firm and consistent \nU.S. policy is desirable for all parties.\n  China has moved generally in a constructive direction since the \nemergence of Deng Ziaoping's leadership following the death of Mao. All \nof us who have been visitors there are impressed by\n\n[[Page S1635]]\n\nthe economic gains, and with those gains has come some greater \nopenness--within tight constraints--even on political expression, \nparticularly in the southern part of China near Hong Kong. But the \nviolent suppression of those who demonstrated peacefully for human \nrights at Tiananmen Square shocked Americans and all democratic \nnations, as well as the thousands of Chinese students in the United \nStates. I remember speaking to a large gathering of Chinese students at \nGrant Park in Chicago. All of us were stunned by the Chinese \nGovernment's action. I also joined those peacefully protesting outside \nthe Chinese Embassy here in Washington. The benign face of the \nGovernment of China many had come to expect, suddenly turned \nmalevolent.\n  After none-too-swiftly denouncing the Government violence at \nTiananmen Square, President Bush sent two of our top officials to \nBeijing to meet with their leaders, and whatever the content of the \ntalks, the pictures that came back to us on the wire services were of \ntwo highly placed Americans, toasting the Chinese leadership that had \njust squelched, in a bloody fashion, the yearning for freedom of many \nof their people.\n  In the meantime, the nearby island of Taiwan has moved more and more \ntoward the human rights we profess to support. Taiwan now has a \nmultiparty system, a free press, and freedoms that are comparable to \nthose we enjoy. Its Parliament is at least as confrontational as is our \nCongress, and on March 23, there will be an election for President with \nthe incumbent President, Lee Teng-hui, ahead in the polls. It is \nsignificant that he is a native Taiwanese. Taiwan has been our seventh-\nleading trading partner and is No. 2 in the world in holding foreign \ncurrency reserves.\n  Here is where our zip-zagging comes in. At least on paper, we applaud \ndemocracies and say we will support them, and we frown upon \ndictatorships. But the Shanghai communique states that the United \nStates will recognize only one China. And so we have turned a \ndiplomatic cold shoulder to Taiwan, showing greater sensitivity to a \ndictatorship than to a democracy.\n  In terms of power, it is not a choice of two equals. For the same \nreasons that many in the State Department and Defense Department did \nnot want to recognize Israel, which had significantly more-numerous \nArabs as neighbors, and have had a tilt toward Turkey in her \ndifficulties with less-numerous and less-powerful neighbors in Greece \nand Armenia, so there are many in key positions who say--once again--\nthat the choices should not be made on the merits but on the numbers \nand the potential power of the two governments. China has 1.2 billion \npeople, and Taiwan has 21 million.\n\n  However, there is something that makes many of us uncomfortable when \nthe cold calculations of population and power are used as the \noverriding criteria in deciding whom we befriend. When we said, as we \ndid for a period, that President Lee, the chief executive of a \ndemocracy, could not come to Cornell University for a reunion of his \nclass because it might offend China, it showed weakness and lack of \nsupport for our ideals. Eventually, President Clinton reversed that \ndecision, and I applaud him for it.\n  With an election in Taiwan coming soon, the Chinese Government, which \ncertainly must be a top contestant in the bad public relations field, \nhas been making military noises that cause apprehension in Asia and \nconcern everywhere--apparently in a heavy-handed attempt to influence \nthe Taiwanese elections.\n  Complicating the Chinese situation is that they face a transition in \nleadership, and no potential leader wants to look weak on the issue of \nabsorbing Taiwan into the mainland. So leaders and potential leaders \ntry to one-up each other in sounding tough on Taiwan. The irony is that \ntough talk makes an eventual peaceful reunion of the two governments \nless likely.\n  While it is probable that China will not invade Taiwan in the near \nfuture, or launch a missile attack, people struggling for leadership \npower sometimes do irrational things. And public officials are risk-\ntakers. No one becomes a United States Senator without taking risks, \nand no one moves into leadership in China without taking risks. What \nhas to be demonstrated to China is that their belligerent talk and \nactions are creating hostility around the world and that an invasion or \nmissile strike would be a disaster for the Chinese leadership and the \nChinese people.\n  The position of the United States should be one of firmness and \npatience as China goes through this leadership change, evidencing our \nstrong desire for friendship, but also our determined opposition to the \nuse of force to achieve change. The lesson of history is that dictators \nwho seize territory and receive praise for it from their own controlled \nmedia are not likely to have their appetite satisfied with one bite of \nland. If China should turn militaristic and seize Taiwan, that would be \nonly the first acquisition. Mongolia to the north is a likely next \ntarget, and as we should have learned from Hitler, dictators can always \nfind some historic justification for further actions.\n  Editorial voices from the New York Times to the Washington Post to \nthe Chicago Tribune to the Los Angeles Times--all newspapers that have \nbeen friendly to China--have denounced that nation's belligerent \nnoises. And the sentiment in the Senate and House is equally clear.\n  What should we be doing?\n  Our policy should be clear and firm, friendly but not patronizing, \ntoward both governments.\n  The United States should enunciate a defense policy--joined in, \nideally, by other governments--that military actions such as an \ninvasion or missile strike would evoke a military response from us. I \npersonally would favor a strong response with air power by the United \nStates and other nations, if an attempt were made to invade Taiwan or \nan appropriate military response if they launch a missile attack, but \nthe means of responding militarily do not need to be spelled out. I do \nnot believe an invasion or an air or missile attack are likely in 1996, \nbut any future leaders who may emerge in China should be put on notice. \nSecretary of Defense William Perry has hinted at that possibility, and \nthe presence of a United States aircraft carrier in the international \nwaters between China and Taiwan is a good signal. But hints are not \nenough. The Los Angeles Times editorially praised Perry for his \nstatement as ``the strongest indication that the United States might \nintervene if China attacked Taiwan.'' The best way of preventing \nmilitary action is to move beyond ``might.'' We should state our \nposture unequivocally. No military leader should even consider gambling \non our hesitancy. Our able Ambassador to China, James Sasser--who I \nonce encourage to run for President--should quietly meet with their \nleaders and tell them we are serious about that message and that the \nbelligerent noises are hurting the Chinese image around the world.\n\n  Another reason for doing this is that other Asian nations have \nserious questions about our military resolve, not our military \ncapability. They see a few terrorists chasing us out of Somalia; they \nnote that until recently, we were long on talk and short on action in \nBosnia; and they see us quake when the Chinese Government growls. If \nour policy in this situation is not more clear and more firm, \ninevitably, Japan and other nations will invest significantly more in \nweapons and defense personnel, and an arms race in Asia will be \naccelerated. That is in no one's interests, other than the arms \nmanufacturers. The United States has assured Japan and other Asian \nnations that we would come to their defense if attacked--but we also \nonce gave that assurance to Taiwan. The nations of Asia are asking a \nfundamental question: Can they count on the United States?\n  Defense Secretary Perry has suggested that the top security officials \nof Asia should get together regularly in order to reduce tensions and \nincrease understanding, an idea somewhat similar to Senator Sam Nunn's \nsuggestions some years ago about Soviet and United States military \nleaders exchanging visits. The Nunn initiative produced some lessening \nof tensions. If China declines such a suggestion, nothing will have \nbeen lost. But anxieties among the nations of that area will diminish \nif China accepts such an invitation.\n  If China continues a policy of sending missiles to Pakistan and \nconducting military exercises near Taiwan, the United States should \nreexamine our trade policies, which now are heavily\n\n[[Page S1636]]\n\nweighted in China's direction. China has a huge $34 billion trade \nsurplus with the United States. We can ask organizations like the World \nBank, which in 1994 made a $925 million, interest-free loan to China \nthrough the International Development Association, to act with greater \nprudence toward China. IDA loans generally go to poor nations; the \naverage recipient country's per capita income is $382 a year. China's \naverage of $530 is well above that, and China has foreign reserves of \napproximately $70 billion. When China's bellicosity toward Taiwan is \ncombined with human rights abuses, the picture painted is not good. Our \nrelationship should be correct but not condescending or cowering. When \nChina sells nuclear weapons technology to Pakistan our response should \nbe clear, not quavering. Tough nonmilitary means of sending a message \nto China's leadership may need to be used.\n  If China's leaders will lighten up a bit, and see their present \nforeign policy orientation as self-defeating, there is no reason China \nand the United States cannot have a good, healthy, and fruitful \nrelationship that will help the people of both of our countries. If \nChina reaches out with a friendly hand toward Taiwan, rather than with \na fist, China will make gains economically and politically.\n  In the meantime, we should welcome visits by Taiwan's leaders to the \nUnited States and by our leaders to that Government. We should stop \nplaying games, and stop treating Taiwan as if it is a relative with a \nsocial disease. Because of past policy errors on our part, formal \nrecognition in the immediate future is not advisable, at least until \nthe Chinese leadership situation is sealed. But we should encourage \nTaiwanese participation in international organizations, and do whatever \nelse we might do to encourage a friendly Government that is both a \nhealthy trading partner and democracy.\n  And when areas of uncertainty arise, as they inevitably will, the \nUnited States should remember our ideals, and do what we can to further \nthe cause of human rights and democracy, not as a nation that has \nachieved perfection--we obviously have not--but as a country that wants \nto give opportunity to people everywhere to select their governments. \nWhen we stray from our ideals, everyone loses.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair. Mr. President, as I said earlier today, \nwe are trying to move to Calendar No. 342, S. 942, the small business \nregulatory reform bill. I understand, if I ask unanimous consent to \nmove to consideration of the bill at this moment, there will be an \nobjection; so I ask.\n  Mr. SIMON. Yes. Mr. President, in behalf of Senator Daschle, for \nreasons he has outlined earlier, I will object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have heard some concern expressed that \nthis measure may become a broad measure and involve many other items, \nsuch as controversial items that are included in the major regulatory \nreform bill, S. 343, which I personally hope is moving toward \nresolution.\n  There are a significant number of Members on both sides moving \nforward on that, but in order to assure my colleagues that we want to \nkeep the focus on small business, we have a consent decree which would, \nI think, narrow it.\n  I want to read this consent request carefully so that other Members \ncan listen to it, so they can think about it and see whether this would \nbe the format under which we could bring the bill up.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, March 12, at \n11 a.m., the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 342, \nS. 942, the small business regulatory reform bill, and it be considered \nunder the following limitation:\n  Ninety minutes of total debate, equally divided between the two \nmanagers; that the only amendments in order to the bill be the \nfollowing:\n  A managers' amendment to be offered by Senators Bond and Bumpers; an \namendment to be offered by Senator Nickles regarding congressional \nreview; and one additional amendment, if agreed to by both leaders, \nafter consultation with the two managers.\n  Further, that following the expiration or yielding back of all time, \nany pending amendments and the bill be temporarily set aside; further, \nthat immediately following any ordered cloture votes on Tuesday, March \n12, the Senate resume consideration of the bill, the Senate immediately \nvote on any pending amendments to the bill; and, further, following \ndisposition of all pending amendments, the bill be read a third time, \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on final passage, all without any \nintervening debate or action.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, as the Senator from Missouri knows, I \nhappen to be on the floor. I do not know the details of all this. I \nobject on behalf of Senator Daschle to what appears to be a reasonable \nrequest. I think he should take it up with Senator Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I appreciate the \nposition of my colleague and neighbor from Illinois. I realize there is \nobjection on the other side.\n  Let me suggest what the framework of the debate itself is. We will \ncontinue to discuss additional items to be brought up. I discussed with \nmy ranking member, Senator Bumpers, the objectives of keeping this bill \nnarrow. I believe we are in agreement. Whenever we can get the \nagreement of the minority to proceed, I will propose that we enter into \nan agreement on this basis so that we keep the amendments limited, and \nso that we can come to closure on this very important matter.\n  Mr. President, since my good friend and neighbor from Arkansas is \nhere, let us lay out some of the reasons that this bill is important. I \nhave talked briefly about it before.\n  Last June, almost 2,000 delegates to the White House Conference on \nSmall Business came to Washington to give their best advice and counsel \nto the President and Congress. They voted on an agenda of the top \nconcerns of small business. The Washington conference came after a \nyear-long grassroots effort, where over 20,000 small business people \nsifted through more than 3,000 policy recommendations, some 59 \nconferences at the State level, and six regional hearings.\n\n  Over 400 of the most important policy recommendations were voted on \nby delegates to the White House conference. The top 60 recommendations \nwere published by the conference last September as a report to the \nPresident and Congress, entitled ``Foundation for a New Century.'' Not \nsurprising, this gathering echoed the findings that we in the Small \nBusiness Committee have heard as we have held hearings in Washington \nand around the country. Three of the top findings of the White House \nSmall Business Conference were calling for reforms in the way that \nGovernment regulations are developed, the way they are enforced, and \nreforming Government paperwork requirements.\n  The common theme of all three recommendations is the need to change \nthe culture of Government agencies, the need to provide an ear--a \nresponsive ear--and a responsive attitude toward the small business and \nsmall entities that are the backbone of this country, the dynamic \nengine driving the growth of this economy.\n  The Vice President said to the conference delegates last year, \n``Government regulators need to stop treating small business as \npotential suspects and start treating small business like a partner \nsharing in a common goal.'' The Vice President also noted that this \nchange in the culture of Government may take years of effort to \naccomplish. Mr. President, I would say, parenthetically, that if we \ncannot even bring the bill up, it is going to take more than years.\n  I am extremely disappointed that we cannot even get an agreement to \nbring the bill up next week. We have here before us a measure that is \ndesigned to\n\n[[Page S1637]]\n\ndeal with one particular area of great importance to small businesses \nall across the country.\n  One of the measures included in this bill is the Small Business \nAdvocacy Act, recommended by Senator Domenici, filed in the form of S. \n917, which focused on the early involvement by small business in the \ndevelopment of new regulations. The bill was referred to the Small \nBusiness Committee, as was S. 942, the Small Business Regulatory \nFairness Act, which I introduced. We have been working to combine \nelements of both bills in legislation that already had been considered \non the Senate floor, which was the measure to provide judicial review \nand enforcement of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which says, quite \nsimply, that Federal agencies have to take into consideration the \nimpact on small business of the regulations they issue.\n\n  We had hearings before the Small Business Committee which confirm the \nimportance of having this kind of reform. The SBA chief counsel for \nadvocacy released a report that said that small businesses bear a \ndisproportionate share of the regulatory burden. When you take a look \nat regulations as they affect large businesses and as they affect the \nsmaller businesses with up to 50 employees, the cost for a small \nbusiness is some 50 to 80 percent more per employee. Small business is \nput at a disadvantage not only in making a profit, but in competing \nwith a larger business.\n  Throughout our efforts in the Small Business Committee, I am proud to \nsay that we have worked very closely and had the greatest cooperation \nfrom my ranking member, Senator Bumpers of Arkansas, and his staff. We \nhave had great input from members of the committee, who have taken a \nvery active role in holding hearings in their States and coming back \nwith recommendations to give to us on how we can flesh out this bill \nand make it work better for small businesses in our States and across \nthe country.\n  This bill, S. 942, came out of the committee without any opposition, \nand the more people have talked about it, the more offers we have had \nto cosponsor it. I think the bill delivers on the legitimate regulatory \nconcerns of small business, as well as the major recommendations of the \nWhite House Conference on Small Business, and it really does do \nsomething to address the disproportionately heavy impact that these \nregulations have on small business and on the paperwork burdens of \nsmall business.\n  This legislation is narrowly focused on small business. It does not \ngo into the big debates over more expansive and, I think, needed \nbroader regulatory reform. These efforts need to go forward, but I \nthink we have something we can deliver here now, today, and, if not \ntoday, for Heaven's sake, let us deliver it next week so small business \nin America can begin to see that somebody is listening.\n  If there is one plaintive comment I have heard, both in my State of \nMissouri, at other hearings, and at the hearings up here, it is small \nbusiness asking: ``Is anybody listening? Does anybody really care what \nthe burdens the Federal Government places on small business are doing \nto the small businesses?'' I think it is time we answered the question, \nand I think it is time we answered, ``Yes, we are willing to listen and \ndo something about it.'' I do not think that we can abandon these \nefforts.\n  We need to move forward with regulatory relief this year. I think, as \nI said in my remarks earlier today, judicial review of reg flex, the \n1980 provision that said regulatory agencies are supposed to consider \nsmall business, that has to be implemented, and there has to be teeth \nput in it. They have not done so. Regulatory agencies have routinely \nignored the impact on small business. We need to give them some \nenforcement powers so that they will be heard.\n\n  Equally important, we need to give enforcement reform some outlet to \nchange the culture of regulators when they deal with small business so \nthat somebody who has examples of regulators that have been \noverreaching can get a fair hearing and a fair shake from the \nregulators. These measures would level the playing field and bring some \naccountability into small business.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the National Federation of Independent Business from the \nVice President of Federal Government Relations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               National Federation\n\n\n                                      of Independent Business,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 1996.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the more than 600,000 small \n     business owners of the National Federation of Independent \n     Business (NFIB), I urge all your colleagues to support S. \n     942, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act \n     of 1996. The Bond-Bumpers legislation includes important \n     provisions that have been top priorities for NFIB members for \n     many years. It also includes provisions that were recommended \n     by small business owners at the 1995 White House Conference \n     on Small Business. The bill has these important elements:\n       Strengthening the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n       Provisions that would encourage a more cooperative \n     regulatory enforcement environment regulation.\n       Updating the Equal Access to Justice Act.\n       Providing for the judicial review of the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act of 1980 is of particular concern to the small \n     business community because it has the potential to fulfill \n     the promise of that 16 year old law. the purpose of \n     ``reg.flex.'' was to fit regulations to the scale and \n     resources of the regulated entity. A strong ``reg.flex.'' \n     process will provide a substantial measure of the regulatory \n     reform that small business owners have wanted for years.\n       The vote on S. 942 will be a ``Key Small Business Vote'' of \n     the 104th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Donald A. Danner,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n                                     Federal Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it says, in part:\n\n       On behalf of the more than 600,000 small business owners of \n     the National Federation of Independent Business, I urge all \n     your colleagues to support S. 942, the Small Business \n     Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996. The Bond-Bumpers \n     legislation includes important provisions that have been top \n     priorities for NFIB members for many years. It also includes \n     provisions that were recommended by small business owners at \n     the 1995 White House conference on small business.\n\n  It then goes on to describe it. It says, in closing, ``The vote on S. \n942 will be a key small business vote of the 104th Congress.''\n  I see my colleague from Arkansas is on the floor so I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first, I want to express my sincere \nappreciation to the chairman of the Small Business Committee, my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Bond, who has spoken very eloquently \nabout this whole issue.\n  Second, I want to say that all the concerns I had about this bill--\nand we had some--he has very graciously accommodated. I think the bill \nis to the point now that if it were permitted to be brought up it would \nsail through this Chamber by a vote of 100-zip.\n  In 1980, Congress passed what we know as the Regulatory Flexibility \nAct. It was designed to lighten the regulatory burden on small \nbusinesses. What is wrong? It has not worked. The small business \ncommunity feels that they have been taken because the bill simply did \nnot provide the relief that was represented to them. Every White House \nconference for small business that has been held has put regulatory \nflexibility as one of the very top issues that concern them. In 1992 it \nwas one of their top issues.\n  Now here is an opportunity for Congress, for the first time, to keep \nfaith with the small business community on something they say is just \nabout the highest item on the agenda. There is absolutely no sense in \nanybody delaying the taking up or the passing of this bill.\n  To those who are working on a much broader regulatory reform bill, I \nsay, ``amen.'' You have my blessing. Stay with it. I hope some \nregulatory reform bill on a comprehensive basis is offered that I can \nsupport. Until that happy day, this bill ought to pass now. It is not \nrelated to the broader regulatory reform bill. This bill says very \nsimple things, but they are dramatic and they are helpful.\n  First, the Small Business Administration will have a small business \nombudsman. Some guy comes into your office and says, ``Your fire \nextinguisher is 56 inches off the floor and it ought to only be 54 \ninches off the floor, therefore I am fining you $100,'' they can\n\n[[Page S1638]]\n\nwrite a letter or call the ombudsman and say, ``This is ridiculous. Not \nonly is he trying to fine me $100, he is arrogant. He is abusive.'' We \nare trying to comply with the law out here and make a living and the \nombudsman can record it, sort of keep a report card on some of these \npeople who come in with an abusive attitude. What is wrong with that?\n\n  Second, we say and this is the most important part of the bill, \nhenceforth and forevermore when you draft a regulation you will have to \naccompany it with an explanation in the mother tongue--which is \nEnglish--and say in clear, plain, written English what this regulation \ndoes and what it takes to comply with it. It would not be a bad idea to \nlet the IRS in on that, too. Why is the IRS perhaps the most detested \nof all Federal agencies? Because everything they do is subject to 18 \ninterpretations.\n  Third, there is a broader equal access to justice provision in this \nbill which says small business is entitled to attorney fees in certain \ninstances where they are sued and have to resist a regulation that is \nfound to be outside the intent of Congress. What is wrong with that?\n  We already have a rule that says a regulation that is found to be \narbitrary and capricious can be stricken; but we do not have a bill \nthat says if the courts find that OSHA or EPA or anybody else who tries \nto impose a regulation on you to be arbitrary and capricious, you win, \nbut you lose because you do not get your attorney fees. Under this bill \nin such a case you would almost always get your attorney fees. That is \nthe way it ought to be.\n  Finally, we have a provision that is mildly controversial called \njudicial review. That is, if you do not like a regulation and you \nbelieve that it goes beyond the intent of Congress and that Congress \ndid not intend this nonsense to be imposed on you, you challenge it. \nHaul them into court--why not? Congress passes a one-sentence law and \nthe regulators will draft 1,000 regulations to enforce it, and then say \nthose regulations are sacred even though the small business community \nhad no input. Congress goes home, beats itself on the chest, gives \nitself the good government award and says, ``Well, we passed a law, we \nthought it would be OK.'' But nobody rode herd on the regulators.\n  So here there are 1,000 regulations out there and they are saying, \n``We will impose these on you and you do not have the right to \nappeal.'' That is downright un-American. I do not care what anybody \nsays.\n\n  I do not think I have ever voted to disallow judicial review. So here \nis a chance to say to the small business community, we have heard your \ncomplaints, we are doing everything we can, not only to lighten the \nregulatory burden but make the regulators pay if they unfairly and \narbitrarily abuse you with their regulations.\n  Let me just repeat one thing. It is a real tragedy. This bill has \nnothing to do with this giant so-called Dole-Johnston or Johnston-Dole \nregulatory reform bill. I will tell you something else. I do not want \nit part of that bill. I do not want somebody trying to attach this bill \nto that bill as an amendment. I want to pass this bill and say to the \nsmall business community: Here is something for you, whether this other \nmess ever passes or not.\n  So, the minute the request of the distinguished Senator from Missouri \nto bring that bill up under the terms he requested, which are eminently \nreasonable--the minute that bill hits this floor and we spend an hour \nand a half debating it, it will be out of here 100-zip.\n  We cast 23 votes this year. Last year at this time we cast over 90 \nvotes. In short, we are not doing anything, and, in addition to that, \nhere we are with an opportunity to do something that really amounts to \nsomething and we cannot get that done.\n  So the Senator from Missouri and I are going to persevere with this. \nWe are going to get this bill passed one way or the other, because it \nmakes too much sense not to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday I received a letter from Dr. \nAlice Rivlin, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, \nconcerning the omnibus appropriations bill our Appropriations Committee \nreported yesterday.\n  As our colleagues know, the Appropriations Committee reported that \nmeasure to provide funding beyond the March 15 deadline of the current \nresolution for the programs and activities of the Federal Government \nand agencies funded in the five appropriations bills not yet signed \ninto law, to respond to the President's supplemental request for Bosnia \noperations and disaster relief and to respond to his request for \nadditional funding for certain programs he believes to be of a priority \nnature.\n  Dr. Rivlin's letter is disappointing to say the least. She concludes \nby declaring, and I quote directly from the letter: ``Regrettably, I \nmust advise you that if the bill were presented to the President in its \ncurrent form, he would veto it.'' ``Veto'' is the word. I do not think \nanybody needs to go to Webster to find out that veto is no, negative, \ncut off, closed issue.\n  By the way, may I say parenthetically, I received this letter \nyesterday afternoon, within a matter of an hour or two after the \ncommittee had completed its work and during which time the committee \nmade amendments to the so-called chairman's mark. I defy anybody to go \nthrough that complex document in a matter of an hour or two and know \nprecisely what it means and what it says.\n  The Appropriations Committee has gone to considerable lengths for \nmany months to address the concerns of the administration. In the bill \nreported yesterday, our committee went a very long way, in my judgment, \ntoward the administration's position on many issues. That the \nadministration would ignore that progress and still threaten to veto \nbefore the process is even completed--because, as everyone knows we are \nstill in the process of having the full floor consider this bill as \nwell--indicates to me that they are more interested in the politics of \nthe moment than the responsibility of governing.\n\n  Let me be specific. The President has made the so-called COPS \nProgram, cops on the beat, a top priority. The bill reported yesterday \nprovides $1 billion for that purpose. Mr. President, $1 billion is \nsignificant money.\n  The President vetoed the VA/HUD bill, in part because it did not \nprovide funding for the National Service Program. Our reported bill \ncarries Senator Bond's recommendation, as the subcommittee chairman, of \n$383 million for that program. The committee also agreed with his \nrecommendation to add $240 million in funding for the environmental \nprotection programs and $50 million for community development financial \ninstitutions, both priorities of the administration, identified as such \nin the President's veto message of the VA/HUD bill.\n  In the Interior bill, the committee concurred with Senator Gorton's \nrecommendation that we want to refine the language on the Tongass \nNational Forest and the salvage timber provisions of last year's \nrescissions bill, both in response to the President's objections listed \nin his veto message. We also recommended greater funding for the Park \nService.\n  In addition, we adjusted funding levels in the Labor-HHS bill to \nprovide for $6.5 billion for title I of that bill, compensatory \neducation; $3.245 billion for education for the handicapped; $200 \nmillion for drug free schools. These are ample sums and all have been \nidentified as priority programs of the administration.\n  Mr. President, let me underscore this sentence. All of this was done \nwithin existing constraints. In other words, it was done within the \nconstraints of the budget resolution passed by the Congress.\n  But, in addition to these--in addition--our committee recommended \n$4.7 billion in additional money--add-on, increase--for an array of \nprograms that the President had requested and that the committee \nbelieves should be funded if--if--the additional resources can be \nfound.\n  In total, the committee provides about $6.2 billion in response to a \nrequest of the administration for about $8 billion for programs of \ninterest to the President. We went to $6.2 billion\n\n[[Page S1639]]\n\nof the $8 billion request level, contingent upon finding additional \nresources. There are many different ways in which you can do that. We \nare not prescribing how it can be done or should be done. That is not \nin the Appropriations Committee's role of authority.\n  In this context, it is utterly perplexing to me that the \nadministration would threaten a veto when the process is just underway. \nI hope the President's advisers understand they cannot compel Congress \nto appropriate $1 of money. That is exclusively, constitutionally the \njurisdiction of the Congress. I hope they realize that rejection of \ngood-faith efforts to reach compromise and maintain the essential \noperations of Government will harden positions and polarize and drive \nsome in Congress to argue for no compromise at all.\n  The omnibus appropriations bill reported yesterday is not the only \nway to maintain Government operations beyond March 15. Other vehicles \nthat may be drafted should this proposal fail or be vetoed may not be \nso responsive to the administration's programs. I do not wish to pursue \nthat course. I believe the bill reported by our Appropriations \nCommittee yesterday is the way we should proceed; to be accommodating, \nas we are the only authority that can appropriate money. It is the \nPresident's check and balance to either sign or veto a bill, including \nan appropriations bill, but we can take those rigid positions and \npolarized positions and continue the stalemate.\n\n  Mind you, the Appropriations Committee of the Senate has made a long \nmovement, serious movement, sincere movement to try to be \naccommodating, recognizing the President has a role in the legislative \nprocess and has his priorities. But we also have ours. It is not going \nto be the President's way or no way any more than we are suggesting it \nshould be the Congress' way or no way. We have made our move. We have \nmade the gesture of trying to accommodate in a very real way. I only \nhope the President's advisers realize this may be our last and best \noffer. If they are more interested in the substance of governing than \nthe politics of the moment, I hope they will work with us toward a \nsuccessful conclusion of our efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to compliment my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Hatfield, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nfor his statement. I hope the administration was listening. I just \njotted down a few of the figures that Senator Hatfield alluded to. He \nmentioned the committee had moved $6.2 billion out of the $8 billion \nthe administration had requested. If I understand his statement \ncorrectly, they are still saying they will veto the bill because we are \nnot spending enough.\n  If they veto this bill or maybe if their threatened veto means this \nbill does not go forward, therefore the net result of what they are \nlooking at, if I think ahead of this scenario, is then they are going \nto be looking at a continuing resolution, one that will continue \nfunding at the lower of the House or Senate level, maybe even less a \npercentage of that. So the administration, while trying to get more \nmoney in spending for a variety of programs, may well end up getting \nless, because, as Senator Hatfield just stated, they cannot make \nCongress appropriate money. It may well be that some of the President's \npet programs, if they follow through on this veto threat of what sounds \nto me to be a very generous, maybe even overly generous bill reported \nout of the Senate Appropriations Committee--if they are going to \nthreaten to veto that bill, maybe we should just look at the continuing \nresolution and/or maybe we should look at zero funding for programs \nsuch as national service.\n  Maybe we should look at zero funding for some other programs which \nthe President feels very strongly about. He cannot make us appropriate \nthe money. If he wants to shut down the entire Agency because he does \nnot get the money for want of his new programs, that would be his \ndecision, and it would also be his responsibility. And maybe he thinks \nhe will gain politically by doing so. I doubt it. Maybe we will have to \nfind out.\n  Again, I think Senator Hatfield has something very good for the \nadministration. It is very premature, in my opinion, as he stated on \nthe floor of the Senate, for the administration to be issuing veto \nthreats just when a bill is passed out of the Appropriations Committee. \nUsually that is not done until bills are passed and reported out of \nboth Houses, and then possibly a conference report.\n  So I am disappointed to hear of the President's veto message, or veto \nthreat, as explained by Senator Hatfield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1639-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1639-S1642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SMALL BUSINESS REGULATORY FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise on the floor this evening because \nI want to compliment Senator Bond from Missouri, the chairman of the \nSmall Business Committee, and also Senator Bumpers from Arkansas for \nthe legislation they reported out which is now pending, or we wish to \nhave pending before the Senate.\n  Also, I wish to express my displeasure at those on the Democrat \nside--Senator Daschle, or whoever he is--for objecting to consider this \nbill. This is a bill that was reported out unanimously by the Small \nBusiness Committee. It has overwhelming support, as Senator Bumpers \nmentioned and as Senator Bond alluded to as well. This is a bill that \nis going to pass overwhelmingly in the Senate. To object to even \nconsidering it --and I looked at the unanimous-consent request. It even \nsaid let us consider it next week. To object to consider this bill \ntoday, or next week, I think flies in the face of common sense. It is \nwell-known. Yes, part of the unanimous-consent request is that the bill \nwould have an amendment offered by myself and Senator Reid from Nevada, \na bill almost identical to the one we passed through the Senate last \nyear unanimously. It had a 100-to-nothing vote, a bill that would say \nCongress should review regulations. We would have an expedited \nprocedure to do so. If Congress did not like it, we could kill it. If \nwe passed a joint list of disapproval, the President would have an \noption to veto that resolution.\n  So we would restore checks and balances and restore congressional \naccountability--because many times Congress will pass laws and tell the \nagencies or the regulatory agency to implement it, and then we turn the \nagencies loose. And then we find out the regulations are far too \nexpensive, maybe do not make sense, and have unintended consequences.\n\n  Congress should be in play. Congress should still have exercising \noversight. This is going to make Congress responsible. It is going to \nmake Congress look at the rules that come out of legislation as a \nresult of executive action.\n  So, again, this is legislation that is supported by the President. So \nwhy in the world will our colleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle \nnot let us bring up legislation such as this that is supported very \nstrongly by the small business community all across the United States?\n  I used to be in small business prior to coming to the Senate. Small \nbusinesses are strangling with the mountains and mountains of \npaperwork. So we are trying to give small business at least some \nregulatory relief. We have a chance to do it.\n  My colleague from Missouri passed a good bill out of committee, and \nit was a bipartisan bill. We do not have many bipartisan bills. We need \nmore. We need more bipartisan work. Senator Bond and Senator Bumpers \nhave done it in this bill. Senator Reid and I did it in the \ncongressional review. We need more examples of that.\n  So then when we try to take it up and pass it either this week or \nnext week, by a time certain, unfortunately it is objected to. Those \nobjections will not stand. Those objections will not last. They will \nnot prevail.\n  I have heard other colleagues say that maybe we want to do a more \ncomprehensive bill. I want to do a comprehensive bill. I want a \nsignificant comprehensive regulatory bill. It does not have to be on \nthis. We can pass two bills this year.\n  It is part of the frustration of being in the Senate and Congress \nwith people thinking, ``Well, there is only one bill. Therefore, we had \nto put everything in\n\n[[Page S1640]]\n\nthe world that remotely is related to it on that one piece of \nlegislation.'' It does not have to happen. It should not happen. If we \ncan put together a bipartisan coalition and pass comprehensive \nregulatory reform, let us do it. I will be happy to help in any way I \ncan.\n  I worked with Senator Dole to put together a good piece of \nlegislation. Senator Johnston worked with us. But we only had four \nDemocrat votes. We had four cloture votes on that major comprehensive \npiece of legislation. That goes all the way back to last summer. We \nspent hours and hours trying to negotiate a comprehensive package.\n  I hope we can. I hear Members say maybe we can do it. I hope we can. \nI am willing to spend more hours to make that happen. But while we are \nhere, while we are looking for legislative action, let us pass some \ngood legislation. Let us pass legislation that makes Congress more \nresponsible. Let us give small business regulatory relief now. If we \ncan pass more comprehensive legislation that says the benefits must \njustify the cost of the regulation or the regulation does not happen, \nthat makes sense. Let us do that, too. But it does not have to be on \nthis piece of legislation.\n\n  So I urge my colleagues that are now obstructing this piece of \nlegislation--not even allowing us to consider the legislation--to \nreconsider. I think they are making a mistake. I think small business \npeople across the country, if they found out the Democrats are \nobstructing and blocking this piece of legislation, would be upset.\n  So I hope that they will reconsider. I hope they will allow us to \npass this legislation in a bipartisan fashion as soon as possible. It \nwill be, in my opinion, a real, positive, good piece of legislation for \nbusiness all across the country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to express a certain amount of \nindignation over the charade being played out in the U.S. Senate this \nafternoon.\n  Yesterday, I was, as a member of the Small Business Committee of the \nSenate, in attendance when the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \nFairness Act of 1996 was unanimously passed to the floor. I listened to \nthe ranking member, the Senator from Arkansas, the Senator from \nMinnesota, the Senator from Connecticut, and the Senator from \nMassachusetts all heap praise on the committee chairman, Senator Bond, \nfrom Missouri for his bipartisan efforts to produce a bill that could \nreceive unanimous consent and come to the floor and be rapidly attended \nto.\n  It is stunning, in light of those comments, that the leadership, the \nminority leadership, the President's leadership, would come to this \nfloor and throw obstacle after obstacle in front of the consideration \nof this bipartisan piece of legislation. What it says to me is that \nthey are bringing the President's campaign onto the floor of the \nSenate, and the 1996 campaign for President of the United States is at \nwork here today on the Senate floor. The administration, the President, \nresponding to the hue and cry across the land--which is that we have to \nbe more attentive to small business in America. Small business produces \nover half the jobs, and all the new jobs--virtually 90 percent of the \nnew jobs--are coming to small business.\n  Everybody admits all across the land to the regulatory burden on \nsmall business, and I wish to point out that small business means like \n4 employees; 60 percent of the American businesses today have 4 \nemployees or less; 90 percent have 25 or less. They cannot keep up with \nthe burdens that this Government has heaped on small business, many of \nthem family businesses. They cannot keep up with the pages and pages of \nregulation. They have been intimidated by regulatory bullies. \nEverybody--governments across the land, State governments, the Federal \nGovernment, both parties--has said we have to do something about it, \nincluding the President of the United States, who says he supports this \nlegislation, whose members on the small business committee voted for \nthis legislation, who said this is a true bipartisan effort, who \nacknowledged the chairman's work. And here we come to the floor and we \nrun into this political wall.\n  This objection can only be a part of a partisan strategy. That is all \nit can be. And it leaves the President in a very unattractive light. \nThis is the light. It leaves him in the position of saying, ``I support \nthe bill; I am for this,'' and then backhandedly going to his \nleadership and saying, ``Do what you can to stop it.''\n  That is a pattern, I would suggest, Mr. President, that we are seeing \nall too often. Remember the ``I am going to lower your taxes,'' but \nthen they got raised, or remember ``I'm for welfare reform,'' but he \nvetoed it at midnight. And now we have ``I'm for relief for the small \nbusinessman.''\n  I am for this piece of legislation that gets at some of the \nfundamental changes that need to occur to help small business prosper, \nto help them grow, to help them hire somebody, to help create a shorter \nunemployment line, and here they all are, here they all are doing \neverything they know to do to block the consideration of that which \nthey say they are for.\n  If the strategy is to say, well, the Congress is not doing anything, \nI can only assure them that this is going to backfire. The American \npeople are alert. They will know who is standing in front of this. They \nwill know who the obstacle was and is.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter from the National Association of Towns \nand Townships dated March 7, 1996 to Senator Bond thanking him for his \n``leadership in developing legislation to strengthen the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act of 1980,'' which this piece of legislation does. And \nthey endorse it and strongly recommend its passage. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                          Towns and Townships,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 1996.\n     Hon. Kit Bond,\n     Chairman, Small Business Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: The National Association of Towns and \n     Townships (NATaT) would like to thank you for your leadership \n     in developing legislation to strengthen the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA). NATaT strongly supports S. \n     942, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act \n     of 1996. NATaT has long supported judicial review of the \n     Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), which is a major component \n     of S. 942.\n       NATaT represents approximately 13,000 of the nation's \n     39,000 general purpose units of local governments. Most of \n     our member local governments are small and rural and have \n     fewer than 10,000 residents. These small communities simply \n     do not have the resources to comply with many mandates and \n     regulations in the same fashion that larger localities are \n     able. The impact of federal regulations on small localities \n     was understood by the authors of the RFA and small localities \n     were therefore included under the definition of small \n     entities in that act.\n       NATaT has long recognized the failings of the RFA and has \n     fought to strengthen it over the years. We have concluded \n     that the only way to get federal agencies to take notice of \n     their responsibilities under the RFA is to allow small \n     entities to take an agency to court for failure to follow the \n     provisions of the RFA. Strong judicial review language would \n     do just that. NATaT strongly supports the judicial review \n     language and would oppose any efforts to weaken it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Tom Halicki,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am going to yield the floor. I just \nwant to reiterate that the President's own men looked right at this \nSenator in front of me and said, ``Thank you. You have done an \noutstanding job. You have demonstrated true bipartisanship.'' And \neveryone voted to bring this to the floor for judicious handling and \nmanagement. The President has said publicly he supports it, and their \nleadership on that side of the aisle is blocking it. The truth will be \nknown as to who is for it and who is against it. This is one for which \nthe 1996 Presidential campaign ought to have waited in the name of the \nAmericans who are waiting for this relief.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. The White House Conference on Small Business which was \nconcluded about a month ago took a look at a number of issues that are \nfaced every day in small business, or maybe just the business world \nfaces every day in doing business--the number and scope of Federal \nregulations and the cost of compliance. They took a look at penalties, \nthe lack of cooperation, and as far as the Government entities are \nconcerned that are\n\n[[Page S1641]]\n\ncharged with compliance or enforcement.\n  We got that report from the President's conference on small business. \nI know my friend from Missouri spent hour after hour combing through \nthe report after that conference was over. It was pretty comprehensive \non what areas we could deal with and what areas maybe that we could not \ndeal with. But it was pretty obvious that we had a lot of work to do in \nthis piece of legislation. It is truly bipartisan. We marked it up the \nother day, after Senator Bond's work, and then the years that the \nranking member, Senator Bumpers of Arkansas, spent in trying to find \nmiddle ground or to craft a piece of legislation that could pass this \nCongress. He has a vital interest in this and he has been a vital part \nof this, to bring this piece of legislation to the floor.\n  I believe the measure does strike the right balance. It strikes a \nbalance between business and the burdensome regulatory and enforcement \nnature of the Federal Government. Business owners who deal with these \nregulations every day are telling us ``give us some flexibility, give \nus some relief,'' not maybe to change a law but get the regulatory \nagencies in a position that they can be an advocate for business, put \nthem in a support role, not just to go out and levy fines or find \nsomething wrong.\n  There is probably not a business in the world where you cannot go out \nand find something wrong or some violation of some rule or regulation. \nThe regulatory agencies should be an advocate of that business and help \nthem to put their house in order. Just give us a little help. Tell us \nwhat we are doing wrong and then turn around and help us fix it.\n\n  I think we can find that relationship between the regulators and, of \ncourse, people who are trying to make a living in this country.\n  This measure incorporates several provisions that will greatly help \nentities which are defined as small business, small nonprofits and, of \ncourse, that is what we find in our small towns. When you are a 98 \npercent small business State, as Montana is, this happens to be a very \nimportant issue. After all, all the new jobs are being created by the \nyoung entrepreneurs who are starting out in business and they are \nhiring one, two, three, four, five people to get started in hopes of \ngrowing to something larger. It even encompasses our people who work on \nour farms and ranches.\n  I am very concerned about the changing attitude that has been \noccurring in probably one of the most helpful, the most knowledgeable \nagencies in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and that is the Soil \nConservation Service. They have taken a support group of actually great \npeople and know what they are talking about when it comes to soil \nscience, soil conservation, water management, water conservation, what \nto do about erosion--the farmers and ranchers across this land really \nplaced a lot of confidence in the know-how of the Soil Conservation \nService--and turned them into a regulatory unit which maybe a farmer or \nrancher does not want to come back on their farm or their ranch \nanymore. That is a relationship that has been destroyed because of the \nnature of the bureaucracy in this day and age.\n  I think this law creates a cooperative relationship between \nregulators and small business entities, one that is less punitive and \nmuch more solution oriented.\n  It adds a trigger to the Regulatory Flexibility Act when a rule is \nlikely to have a significant economic impact on the substantial number \nof small entities, and the agency would then have to show they have \ntaken steps to minimize the impact of the rule on small businesses \navailable within the agency's discretion.\n  The RFA would also be applicable to the IRS rules and substantive \ninterpretive rulemaking, for the first time. I just went down through \nsome of the things that it does. It struck me in the compliance guides, \nit means, write the rules and regulations in plain English so all of us \ncan understand it, and gets away from these legalees or gets away from \nthe language that, no matter which way you go, you are going to be out \nof compliance as far as a businessman is concerned. Just keep it \nsimple. That is not asking too much.\n  It asks for more input from the small businesses during the \nrulemaking process. We had a hearing in my State of Montana on the new \nrules and regulations on safety in the workplace in the woods, logging, \nrequiring that an employer enforce a rule to make loggers wear a \nspecific kind of logging boot. It is a caulk boot. You know what? The \nboot is not even out on the market yet. They cannot even buy it at any \nprice. They cannot get it. The logging operation is shut down because \nthe rule called for the boot, and it is not available.\n  There, again, you are asking for some flexibility. Not a bad idea. \nWeigh first-time penalties for small infractions. Quit going out there \nand beating up on people.\n  It makes Government more cooperative, and it even makes the \nbusinesses more cooperative, also. Those are just some things that \nhappened in this act. I find that if you come forward with a piece of \nlegislation which has strong bipartisan support--and I mean everybody \non that Small Business Committee had an opportunity for input in \ncrafting this legislation--and then we bring it to the floor in hopes \nof giving small business some relief, and it is filibustered by the \nother side of the aisle--make no doubt about it, they will not let this \npiece of legislation come up for a vote. They always told me, the price \nof a filibuster is a few political chips. Somebody better be paying it, \nand somebody better be kicking some into the pot, because along with \neverything else, we do not want to get into a situation, especially in \na year like 1996, where the only thing we do is get into the business \nof name-calling and not really looking at this piece of legislation and \nwhat it does for us.\n  Small business is where it is at. We do not even pick up the business \nsection in the paper that we do not see large corporations downsizing, \nspinning off small parts of their own industry. You know what? That is \nnot all bad because some of those little spinoffs, they go out, they \nhire smaller, they become lean and mean, and you know what? Pretty soon \nthey become very profitable.\n\n  So when you look at S. 942, it is something that I think the Small \nBusiness Committee can be very, very proud of. It has new compliance \nguidelines, informal small-entity guidance services to small business \ndevelopment centers, even enforcement on ombudsman and regional boards \nthat creates some kind of a relationship between those people who do \nbusiness with the Small Business Administration in trying to get their \nbusinesses off the ground. It levels the playing field. It allows small \nbusiness to do business on the same level as big business.\n  So I congratulate Senator Bond and Senator Bumpers for working on \nthis, working it out the way it should be done. I mean, we have been \npart of the criticism, too, that we are too partisan. But this one \nreally was not. This was a bill that was worked on and was worked on, \nand it was fine-tuned before it was ever allowed to come to a vote in \nthe committee. Everybody had an opportunity to be a part of this Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996.\n  We cannot talk one way and act another, because I think the \ninformation and the availability of how we act and what we say is too \nopen to the world to then go home and tell the folks that we have done \nsomething else. I do not think we are in that kind of a position.\n  So I hope and I suggest that the other side of the aisle--let us get \nthis on the floor. If you have some complaints about it, let us bring \nthem out and let us try to work them out. That is the way legislation \nmoves. I do not think there is anybody on this committee that is not \namenable to suggestions as far as this piece of legislation is \nconcerned, because as far as small business is concerned, this could be \nthe biggest piece of legislation that we move this year. So I thank my \nchairman and the ranking member, and I hope that we can pass this \nposthaste. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I want to express my sincere thanks both to \nSenator Burns and to Senator Coverdell, two members of the Small \nBusiness Committee who have been very active participants. They have \nheld hearings\n\n[[Page S1642]]\n\nin their own States. They have brought us good ideas from their States \nthat we have incorporated in S. 942.\n\n  I share the sentiments expressed by Senator Burns. We have had great \ncooperation, as mentioned before, from Senator Bumpers, all of the \nDemocratic members of the Small Business Committee, and their staffs. I \nthink we have a good piece of legislation. Senator Coverdell, at my \nrequest, introduced a letter of endorsement from the National \nAssociation of Towns and Townships. They, too, are going to be affected \nand benefited. This is not for small profitmaking corporations only or \nindividuals; this affects small entities like not for profits and small \nlocal units of government.\n  So we have made an offer for a very tight unanimous consent request \nto move forward on this bill. We asked to do it today. That was \nobjected to. We asked to do it Tuesday. That was objected to.\n  My plea is, small business, small entities want some relief. They \nhave given us good ideas. We worked on it in the committee. Let us go \nforward. I ask the Members on the other side who are objecting, let us \ngo forward and get on with this, because small business deserves to \nhave an answer. So do the other small entities affected. I hope that we \nwill be able to move forward early next week. But right now it still \ndepends upon whether the objections will be raised on the other side.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1639-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1642-S1643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I hope that my distinguished friend from \nMissouri and my friend from Montana will attend my remarks for just a \nmoment, and perhaps comment on them, just as they have on one another's \nwith respect to the bill that they have been so eloquently attempting \nto move to passage.\n  Just a few moments ago, the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Hatfield, appeared on the floor with \nthe extraordinary news that the administration had expressed its \nunwavering intention to veto the omnibus appropriations bill that was \nreported by the Senate Appropriations Committee just yesterday.\n  The Senator from Oregon pointed out that appropriations, the spending \nauthorization for the spending of money, is the prerogative of \nCongress. That is perhaps the most fundamental of all the prerogatives \nof Congress, that no President of the United States has ever been able \nto or can now or will be able to in the future force the Congress to \npass an appropriation at a level that the President wishes.\n  But my distinguished chairman and friend from Oregon, I do not think, \nreached the true depths of the arrogance of this veto threat. So while \nhe was speaking, I got out our publication, our committee report, on \nthe subject. I discovered that the total amount of money that we \nproposed to allow the President of the United States to spend during \nthe current fiscal year in that bill, for five different agencies, is \n$164 billion, approximately $164 billion, approximately $164 billion, \nof which a little less than $5 billion is restricted and cannot be \nspent unless the President reaches an agreement with Congress on a \nbalanced budget at some time in the future.\n\n  The President of the United States has said that he will veto this \nbill unless we allow him to spend $166 billion instead of $164 billion \nwithout any restrictions, without any commitment on his part, without \nany agreement with the Congress with respect to a balanced budget in \nthe future.\n  I must say that I find this to be absolutely extraordinary and \nwithout precedent, that a President of the United States should, once \nagain, threaten to close down five major units of our Government \nbecause we propose to allow him to spend $164 billion and he wants to \nspend $166 billion.\n  I know that each of my colleagues here on the floor is a chairman of \na subcommittee on the Appropriations Committee, as am I. The Senator \nfrom Missouri and I are chairmen of subcommittees whose bills are a \npart of this overall bill. But I just wonder whether they agree with me \nor not that it is practically beyond belief that a President of the \nUnited States should threaten this whole range of programs in all of \nour areas on which we are willing to spend $164 billion just as he is \nwilling to commit himself at some point or another to a balanced \nbudget, and the great bulk of that, $159 billion anyway, whether he \nagrees or not, just because we will not spend $2 billion more than he \nwants.\n  Mr. BURNS. If the Senator from Washington will yield.\n  Mr. GORTON. I will yield.\n  Mr. BURNS. I do not know where he wants to spend the $2 billion. He \nwas not specific about that, I ask?\n  Mr. GORTON. I believe he was specific about it. Perhaps a few hundred \nmillion were in the field of the Senator from Missouri. Others were in \nsocial and health services.\n  My own responsibility for the Department of Interior and related \nagencies, where we are willing to spend $12.5 billion, is maybe $200 \nmillion more than he wants to spend over and above $12.5 billion; in \nother words, 1 or 2 percent more money than we are authorizing for him, \nand yet he threatens to veto this entire bill because he cannot spend \nevery dime that he wishes to spend.\n  Mr. BURNS. I congratulate the Senator from Washington, because I know \nwe had to look at Indian schools, we had to look at the Indian Health \nService. Those areas suffered cuts last year, and we tried to add some \nmoney back and were successful in doing that, and we get this close.\n  I am wondering, though, if we are not sort of lapping over into the \npolitical world rather than the world of reality or this world of \ntrying to finance the Government and make it work.\n  Mr. GORTON. It seems to me that is the most apt comment on the \nsubject.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, if the Senator from Washington will yield.\n  Mr. GORTON. He will.\n  Mr. BOND. The thing that is striking to me is that we have been \nworking on these bills for many months. I have been working on the \ntitle which funds veterans, housing, environment, Federal emergency \nmanagement, and as I think my distinguished colleague knows, we have \nbeen trying to find out from the administration what they want.\n  I remember when our son was 2 or 3 years old, he would come in and \nsay he wants more. From a 2- or 3-year-old maybe more is a reasonable \nrequest, but when you get it from a Budget Director who is supposedly \nsupporting a President who now recognizes the need for a balanced \nbudget, when the President and the Budget Director refuse to give you \nany specifics, it, to me, is amazing that they can get by with doing \nnothing but issuing veto threats.\n\n  I ask the Senator, maybe he has heard, because I have not heard, from \nthe White House, the Office of Management and Budget, of any changes \nthat they wish to see so that they can utilize the funds better?\n  It is a great gimmick. It is a great political campaign to say, ``I \nam going to spend more on everything. Of course, I'm for a balanced \nbudget. Of course, I'm for a balanced budget, but I want to spend more \non everything.''\n  Do they tell you where they want to make any cuts, I ask the Senator? \nDid they tell you where they want to save money?\n  Mr. GORTON. For almost a year, this Senator has suggested that within \nthe frame of reference of the amount of money available to use for the \nDepartment of the Interior and related agencies, if the administration \nwanted to shift priorities, then we would be happy, seriously, to \nconsider those shifts. None have been proposed.\n  Mr. BOND. You have not heard from them either. I thought I was the \nonly one who was completely stiffed by them. In November, I put in \nrequests. I asked the Agency heads, the Department heads whose budgets \nwe fund, ``If there is an adult in supervisory authority, please have \nthem contact us and say what changes they want to make.''\n  I had a conversation with the Vice President. I said, ``This is a \nprocess in which the executive and the legislative branches need to sit \ndown and compromise.''\n  Every government I have ever served in, and I served at the State \nlevel where I was a Republican chief executive with a Democratically \ncontrolled\n\n[[Page S1643]]\n\nlegislature, we always sat down and worked together, and the people \nexpected us to do that.\n  How can the people of the United States expect us to negotiate a \nbudget or appropriations bills when one side will not even talk to us \nand all they do is send veto threats? I ask my colleague, how do you \ncompromise? How do you work with, how do you negotiate with somebody \nwho will not talk with you?\n  Mr. GORTON. Well, you do not. I must say, I found particularly \nstriking the analogy of the Senator from Missouri to a 2- or 3-year-old \nchild who simply says, ``More.''\n  In this case, what we have is an administration that only says, \n``More. We want more spending, we do not want any setoffs, but we want \nto send the bill to somebody else, to our children and our \ngrandchildren. We really do not want a serious proposal that will lead \nus to a balanced budget, except maybe after the end of the next \nPresidential term. We will think about binding someone in the future, \nbut we don't want to bind ourselves.''\n  So we have now in front of us the proposition that $164 billion is \nnot enough money to spend, and the President will veto a bill that only \nspends $164 billion, of which $5 billion is fenced, as it were. ``We've \ngot to have $166 billion to spend the way we want without any \nconditions imposed on that spending.''\n  Again, I think the Senator from Oregon was too polite to say so, but \nI believe that if that is the proposition with which we are faced, it \nis pointless to spend a week or so of this body's time debating the \ndetails of a proposal which will be vetoed in any event.\n\n  Regrettably, we will perhaps have to approach the President with \nanother of these notorious continuing resolutions; that is to say, \nshort-term appropriations bills, which--and I think I can speak for my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle--when I say they will be for \nsmaller amounts of money, they will be markedly smaller amounts of \nmoney in authorizations for the administration than is the bill that \nwas arrived at working with both Republicans and Democrats in an \nattempt to reach a common ground somewhere between the last set of \nappropriations proposed by this body and those originally asked for by \nthe President.\n  It is too bad, but here we are with a veto threat over the \nproposition that we are not going to spend $166 billion in exactly the \nway the President wishes but only $164 billion, with $5 billion of it \ncontingent upon the President agreeing to a balanced budget at some \nreasonable future time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1642-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1643-S1645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           STATEMENTS OF THOMAS JEFFERSON ARE RELEVANT TODAY\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I recently came upon some statements \noffered by Thomas Jefferson, which, I think, appear to bear some \nremarkable relevance to our current predicament. To quote from one of \nthem from 1816, in a letter to Governor Plumer, he said: ``I place \neconomy among the first and most important of republican virtues, and \npublic debt as the greatest of the dangers to be feared.''\n  On another occasion, he made the same point, perhaps even more \ndramatically, in a letter to Samuel Kerchival, also in 1816: ``We must \nmake our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and \nservitude.''\n  It is when we are having the most difficulty attending to and \nresolving the most vexing issues of the day that we can profit most \nfrom such reminders and that much of what confronts us today has been \ndealt with by so many of our greatest public servants who came before \nus.\n  One simply cannot read many of the statements of our third President, \nThomas Jefferson, without coming upon repeated, potent references to \nthe necessity of eliminating public debt. I suggest that he would be \nhorrified to learn that we would ever consider allowing our current \nimpasse to stand and to leave deficits and mandatory spending to spiral \nupward unabated.\n  It is all very well, politically, to say that we will--our two \nparties--take our respective cases to the electorate in November to \n``let the people decide'' as to who failed who in the realm of public \nresponsibility. But, in the meantime, I think we do a tremendous \ndisservice to our citizens for as long as we leave this situation \nunresolved.\n  Here is another quote from Thomas Jefferson, stated to Thomas Cooper \nin 1802, which says it perhaps more vividly and relevantly even than \nthe others: ``If we can prevent the government from wasting the labors \nof the people, under the pretense of taking care of them, they must \nbecome happy.''\n  Well, I think that is the nub of it. ``If we can prevent the \ngovernment from wasting the labors of the people, under the pretense of \ntaking care of them, they must become happy.''\n  I certainly agree with that. I can think of few things more dangerous \nand more cruelly deceptive than to suggest that we must continue to \npile debt and misery upon our children's heads because we dare not slow \ndown, in any way, the current engines of spending growth, which churn \nout funding for various beneficiaries of Government largess. We do not \n``take care of'' anybody when we do this. We do not take care of \nanyone's children by forcing tomorrow's children to pay lifetime tax \nrates of 80 percent. That will, I assure my colleagues, lead to more \nmisery, more poverty, more hunger and need and deprivation, and more \nintergenerational hostility than anything ever contemplated in any \nbalanced budget agreement.\n\n  Mr. Jefferson was fully acquainted with the dangers of mounting \npublic debt. Indeed, one might say that the principal challenge of the \nyoung republic was how to discharge the massive debts compiled by the \nindividual States in the course of the American Revolution.\n  Alexander Hamilton was, of course, instrumental in diagnosing the \nseverity and nationality of this problem, arguing that the Federal \nGovernment must bear the burden of lifting the national debt burden \nbecause we would all collapse together anyway if this was not properly \ndone.\n  That brings to mind Daniel Webster's remark about Alexander Hamilton. \nIf you think of rhetoric today and the emotion and passion of speech, \nWebster said this about Hamilton: ``He smote the rock of the national \nresources, and abundant streams of revenue gushed forth. He touched the \ndead corpse of Public Credit, and it sprung upon his feet.'' Now, you \ncan see that quote etched at the base of the Hamilton statue at the \nDepartment of the Treasury, if you so desire to check it.\n  Mr. Jefferson, again in a letter to Governor Plumer, stated his \nrecognition of the necessity of reducing public indebtedness. Mr. \nJefferson did not always agree with Alexander Hamilton's solutions and \nmethods, to be sure. But they were certainly in agreement as to the \nnecessity of eliminating the poison of mounting public debt.\n  To Governor Plumer, Jefferson wrote: ``We see in England the \nconsequences of the want of economy; their laborers reduced to live on \na penny in the shilling of their earnings, to give up bread, and resort \nto oatmeal and potatoes for food; and their landholders exiling \nthemselves to live in penury and obscurity abroad, because at home the \ngovernment must have all the clear profits of their land.''\n  That sounds like a pretty fair description of what is going to happen \nto us. Our own Government continues to increase its share of the \nNation's ``profits''--the savings and investment--which it must absorb \nin order to finance the massive spending increases we have programmed \ninto our laws. Indeed, the burden of paying for that irresponsibility \nfalls ultimately on the taxpayers, our taxpayers, our citizens, and \ncuts into the share of their own pay, which they would otherwise be \nable to use to provide for themselves.\n\n  I fully recognize there are many Senators here on both sides of the \naisle who are equally committed to confronting and resolving these woes \nresulting from our debt. There are sincere disagreements as to how to \naccomplish that goal. I do believe there is now widespread recognition \nthat the goal must be met.\n  I, therefore, close by reiterating my belief that we must not give up \non this process. We must not give up on coming to agreement merely \nbecause of the disagreements which have divided us to this point. I do \nnot find any reason to ``give up'' to be a convincing one. Give up \nbecause we believe we might hold political advantage if the impasse \npersists, or because we cannot agree on\n\n[[Page S1644]]\n\nthe size of a tax cut? When ``our cause'' is the elimination of \nincreases in the public debt, these are simply not sufficient reasons.\n  As a member of the bipartisan Senate group headed by Senators Chafee \nand Breaux, I have joined approximately two dozen Senators, from both \nsides of the aisle, in putting forward our best hope of ``splitting the \ndifference'' between the two sides in order to get this job done. It \nmight not be the only way and might not be the magic formula which \nproduces an agreement, but it is certainly better than ``packing it \nin'' and, instead, morosely retreating to consult with our political \nadvisers as to how best to cope with the public anger in the wake of \nour failure to complete our work--sitting with our gurus saying, ``How \ndo we get around this if we do not do anything?'' Well, you do this and \ndo that. We all know what that is.\n  So I suggest to my colleagues that they pay heed to these words of \nThomas Jefferson and be reminded that we are truly facing a choice \nbetween ``liberty'' and ``servitude'' when we choose between a balanced \nbudget and mounting debt. That is very much the choice that confronts \nour children and grandchildren, and we have now to make the choice for \nthem. I do hope and pray that recognition of this will spur all of us \non to renewed efforts to reach an agreement and to defer any further \nthoughts of simply extracting political advantage from failure. That \nwould be terrible.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I have a comment on a rather elusive \nmatter. We work in an arena where truth is always a rather elusive \nentity. Many statements in this place seem to be repeated ad hominem \nand ad nauseam, however inadvertently, without regard to any basis in \nfact. A mischievous speaker may do this because he or she believes \nthat, as has often been said, ``A falsehood repeated often enough will \nbe believed.'' Equally often, this happens because this is simply what \nthe individual has been told, perhaps several times, and thus the rash \nassumption is made that a statement made so often ``must be true.'' \nThus, often, in good faith, speakers perpetuate ideas and statements \nwhich are simply and totally at complete variance with the facts.\n  To cite one specific case, I wish I could count how many times it has \nbeen stated as an article of pure faith by those on the other side that \nwe have had however many hours of hearings on Whitewater and \nTravelgate, but only one, or none, on Medicare. The Democratic policy \nchannel on the televisions in our offices also plays this old and tired \ntune. Many speakers on the other side of the aisle have repeated it in \nold and tired phrases. The only problem is, it is just simply not \ntrue. It is not even close to being true. It is one of those myths \nwhich has developed, somehow directly, in the teeth of the facts. I did \na little checking of the record. I know that is not what we are \nsupposed to do. I did a little checking of the record on this matter.

SIMPSON. Mr. President, I am now a member of that committee and I \nsat in on those hearings. They were often held at 9:30, 10 o'clock in \nthe morning. Had I been chairman I might also have sought to have them \nin the afternoon. I was there for almost all of them, usually arriving \nafter some haste ill-attained in getting through the D.C.'s fabled rush \nhour traffic from my home in Virginia.\n  We held 10 full Finance Committee hearings last year on Medicare \nalone--10. They were not about abstract, philosophical topics, but \nsubjects directly related to the solutions presented in our budget \nproposal. On May 11, 16 and 17 we had hearings specifically on the \nquestion of how to restore solvency to the Medicare Program. We tackled \nthe issue of payment policies in hearings on July 19 and 20. We \nexplored more comprehensive reforms on July 25 and July 26. On August \n30 we dealt with the subject which I personally think requires much \nmore, much more attention--the 30-year future of Medicare. That is when \nthe real problems all coalesce. This is only part of the list, as the \nrecord will show.\n  We also had multiple hearings on Medicaid. The proposals which we \nmade in the course of budget reconciliation were all explored in depth \nat those hearings. The opinions of the Governors regarding our plan was \nheard on June 28. The importance of flexibility for the State \nGovernments in administering Medicaid was explored July 12. The proper \nway to calculate the distribution of funds under the Medicaid formula \nwas explored on July 27. Again this is only a partial list.\n  Even the issue of the Consumer Price Index reform, which so many have \nsaid we should ``not rush to do,'' especially not rush to do in budget \nreconciliation, the CPI reform was the subject of several full \ncommittee hearings on March 16, April 6, and June 6. When somebody \ntells you we have not done anything--and looked into CPI; we do not \nwant to rush into it--cite those, please. Having been right there \npersonally I can tell you few experts believe we are acting with any \nsense at all on either side of the aisle in allowing the expensive \nerrors in the CPI calculation to persist. That is absurd. It is out of \nwhack either .5 or up to 2.2. Everybody that testified said that. If \nyou dealt with it, knocked off a half percent or full percent in the \noutyears, in 10 years, at 1 percent, it is $680 billion bucks--billion \nbucks--and we do not even play with it.\n  The senior groups all seem to flunk the saliva test when we begin to \ntalk about the CPI. ``Oh, break the contract, break the contract.'' I \nam telling you, they will break America. We are not talking about them \nor to them. None of them will be hurt in anything we are doing. No one \nover 60 is even affected by the things we have in mind, but people \nbetween 18 and 40 will indeed be on a destructive path.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not know what to make of these assertions that we \nhave not had hearings on Medicare or Medicaid. We have had many. The \nrecord speaks clearly. On Medicare alone, 10 full committee hearings. \nIt seems to me be a trend in Washington saying that what has happened \nhas not happened and vice versa. The media plays that well in their \nrecountings of these things. Perhaps the assertions will be revised to \nstate that we only had a minimal look at Medicare. That would probably \nbe the result of the response to my remarks.\n  I do not know how many dozens of hours were needed to spend on that \nto escape the application of that term. I also note that this work \ncontinues on in the current year. We had another remarkable hearing on \nMedicaid last week with six of our Nation's Governors testifying--three \nRepublicans, three Democrats--in describing the desires of the State \ngovernments with regard to Medicaid.\n  So I ask these items be printed, and I ask my colleagues to perhaps \nrefrain from repeating the charge that we have not thoroughly explored \nMedicare in committee hearings. The facts are exactly otherwise, and I \nwish my good colleagues to know that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1643-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1645-S1646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 INTERNATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING FUNDING\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Finally, a comment on family planning funding. I want to \nexpress my serious concerns about the severe restrictions this Congress \nhas imposed on U.S. funding for international family planning \nassistance.\n  My colleagues will recall that the Senate successfully avoided a \npartial Government shutdown on January 26 by passing H.R. 2880 on a \nbipartisan vote of 82-8. At the time we faced a midnight deadline for \npassing legislation to avoid yet another Government shutdown. Because \nno one in this Chamber wanted another shutdown to occur, we passed this \nmeasure in the exact form it came to us from the House without amending \nor striking any provisions which we considered to be objectionable. We \nhad no choice in the matter. It was a frustrating and vexing experience \nfor many of us.\n  I was and continue to be deeply troubled by a provision of H.R. 2880 \nthat prohibits funding for international family planning assistance \nprograms until July 1 unless a foreign aid reauthorization bill is \nenacted prior to that date. After July 1, funds will be provided at \nonly 65 percent of the fiscal year 1995 level, with a requirement they \nbe spent in equal amounts over the following 15 months.\n\n  I believe that policy to be very shortsighted. It is preventing the \nU.S. Agency for International Development [AID] from increasing access \nto family planning services for millions of citizens in the developing \ncountries around the world. The ultimate result will be more unwanted \npregnancy and even higher population growth in the poorest, most \nheavily populated nations of the globe.\n  Ironically, this policy, if it is not corrected, will also inevitably \nlead to more abortions, many of which will be performed under unsafe \nconditions that will surely result in infection, infertility, and \ndeath. This outcome deeply concerns me.\n  The people who so often resist these programs are talking continually \nabout abortion, unwanted pregnancy, population and so on. I strongly \nurge all of my colleagues, whether they be pro-choice, pro-life, \nDemocrat, Republican, conservative, liberal, moderate, to consider the \ntragic consequences of what we have done. Restricting access to family \nplanning services--I did not say ``abortion,'' and it is not there, \neither--restricting access to family planning services will assuredly \nresult in more abortion. If anyone can refute this I welcome them to do \nso and come forward.\n  The harsh reality is that this misguided policy is contributing to a \nscenario where abortions are or will be the only form of birth control \nin some of the most impoverished places on Earth. This outcome sharply \ncollides with the stated views of the very people who support it. Of \nall the issues the religious groups may consider when they compile \ntheir scorecards--I know where my scorecard is because I happen to be \npro-choice, and I have always been pro-choice; always. In fact, I do \nnot even think men should vote on the issue. So mine is rather clear \nand has been. So when they are compiling their scorecards on the \nperformance of Members of Congress, I think this is surely one of the \nmost important because it might be that they would show that these \npeople somehow were in favor of abortion because of the misguided way \nthey try to distort the issue.\n  The abortion issue alone offers a compelling reason for the Congress \nto reconsider the current restrictions on international family planning \nfunding.\n  But we should also contemplate the consequences of unrestrained \nworldwide population growth. One study by the United Nations Population \nDivision has estimated that if the world population trends of 1990 \ncontinue indefinitely into the future, worldwide population will \nincrease to 694 billion by the year 2150. This is the equivalent of \n12,100 people for every square mile of land on the Earth's surface. The \npossibility of this occurring is self-evident. The real issue is \nwhether we will take thoughtful, rational steps to prevent this \nscenario or will we do nothing and simply allow nature to prevent this \noutcome in its own less civilized way?\n  Since the beginning of mankind to the year 1940 was a segment of \npopulation growth, and since 1940 to this\n\n[[Page S1646]]\n\nday it has doubled. The population of Earth has doubled since 1940. It \nis now 5.5 billion, and this study shows in the year 2150 it will \nincrease to 694 billion. And where is the most rapid population growth \noccurring? Desperately poor countries that have to cope with poverty \nand malnutrition and ill health and lack of education and environmental \ndamage and famine.\n  These countries simply do not have the resources to effectively solve \nall of these problems on their own, or maybe any of them, any more than \nthey are able to stabilize their population growth. It continues to \ncompound and exacerbate so many of the other difficulties. Fertility \nrates, lack of education for women, these things lead to grievous \nproblems.\n  I am not suggesting the United States bear the sole responsibility \nfor addressing this problem. Nor is the rest of the world suggesting \nthis. In September 1994, I and Senator John Kerry attended the \nInternational Conference on Population and Development in Cairo. Mr. \nPresident, 179 nations participated in that conference, and the final \n``programme of action,'' which was adopted by acclamation, estimated \nthat the nations of the world would have to spend $17 billion annually \nby the year 2000 in order to meet the needs of developing countries for \nbasic reproductive health services, including family planning and the \nprevention of sexually transmitted diseases.\n  This ``programme of action'' estimated that up to two-thirds of these \ncosts would be met by developing countries themselves--two-thirds; \nself-determination--with the other one-third coming from ``external \nsources.'' To put that in perspective, consider the United States \nGovernment's expenditures on international family planning in fiscal \nyear 1995 represented less than 10 percent of what is needed from these \nexternal sources by the year 2000. To retreat from this modest \ncommitment would be a grave mistake.\n  So, as this legislative session continues, I believe we should \nrestore a more appropriate level of funding for international family \nplanning programs. Senator Hatfield has previously advised the Senate \nof his desire to rectify this situation, and here is a man who holds a \nview different than mine on abortion, but a very sensitive, sensible \nhuman being. I richly commend my friend Mark Hatfield for his \ncommitment to this cause, and I stand ready to assist him in any way \npossible. He does his tasks so very well, and we should not impede him.\n  It is not too late for us to reverse our course and embrace a more \nsane, rational and sensible policy.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, may I inquire of the chair if we are in \nmorning business?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is technically still on a motion to \nproceed with the Whitewater investigation, but we have been proceeding, \nin essence, as if in morning business.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nproceed as in morning business for a brief period of time on another \nmatter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1645-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1646-S1647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have just had one of the most remarkable \nand rewarding meetings of my career with a 10-year-old girl and her \nmother from the Washington, DC, area. I will only use her first name. \nShe and her mother called and asked to see me today.\n  Lea is a sweet girl, 10 years of age, who was preparing for a \ncomputer project to earn a Girl Scout merit badge this week. In \npreparation for that project, Lea and her mother signed on to the \nProdigy computer service and logged on to a so-called chat room for \nchildren, where kids from around the country can play checkers and do \nother such things that kids do with each other. It was Lea's very first \ntime on the Internet.\n  Within minutes--I emphasize, Mr. President--within minutes, someone \nwas attempting to engage young Lea, a 10-year-old, in conversations of \na sexual nature. Needless to say, she was shocked and screamed. Lea and \nher mother were upset and very angry.\n  If I can be allowed a personal comment, this really brought this \nproblem that I and others have been trying to do something about home, \nbecause my wife and I have been blessed with two 10-year-old \ngranddaughters of our own. When Lea came in to see me, it was life as \nit exists and life as I know it.\n  At the time of this most unfortunate event, Prodigy did not provide \nthe supposedly child-safe space with an alert button, which notifies \nthe system operator that children's checkers room was being misused. A \nsimilar service was available for adults, in the adult chat room, but \nnot for children, as strange as that might seem.\n  Together, the mother and the daughter contacted Prodigy and the news \nmedia. Within hours, Prodigy agreed to make the alert button available \nand the alarm available to those on these children's areas.\n  I heard this story on the news this morning, on the radio, and met \nwith the mother and the daughter at their request this afternoon. I \nbring this story to the attention of the U.S. Senate because, since the \npassage of the Communications Decency Act as part of the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996, there has been a great deal of \nattention placed on this new law. With that attention, some have also \ncontinued their campaign of misinformation about the new law in the \npress and now in the courts.\n  Mr. President, Lea's story demonstrates and illustrates better than \nanything else that I know of that there are, indeed, real dangers on \nthe Internet, especially for children and especially with the \ninteractive computer services that are available. But more important, \nthe very quick response from Prodigy to this problem illustrates that \nthe new law is starting to work.\n\n  Opponents of the new law use harsh language like ``censorship'' to \ndescribe the Communications Decency Act that was jointly sponsored by \nmyself and Senator Coats from Indiana and overwhelmingly passed in the \nU.S. Senate and in the House of Representatives and made part of the \ntelecommunications bill. Those who cry censorship hide behind the first \namendment to make defense of those who would give pornography to \nchildren and engage children in sexual conversations. What a travesty.\n  I hope more adults, whether they have children or grandchildren or \nnot, will come to realize and recognize and see that the law is \noperational.\n  In respect to the first amendment, Mr. President, it is almost a \nsacred text with this Senator.\n  That is why I worked so closely--even with the new law's opponents--\nto assure that our legislation was constitutional. The final \nlegislation was the produce of nearly 3 years of investigation, \nresearch, negotiation, and compromise.\n  The Communications Decency Act makes it a crime to send indecent \ncommunications to children by means of a computer service or \ntelecommunications device, to make indecent communications available to \nchildren on an open electronic bulletin board, to use a computer to \nmake the equivalent of an obscene phone call to another computer user, \nand to use a computer or facility of interstate commerce to lure a \nchild into illegal sexual activities.\n  The law makes computer services responsible for what is on their \nsystem. To comply with the new law, a computer service must take \nreasonable, effective and appropriate measures to restrict child access \nto indecent communications.\n  While it is fair to wonder why the alert button service has not been \nmade available earlier, Prodigy is to be recognized for their quick \nresponse when this problem was brought to their attention. This is the \ntype of response, that the Communications Decency Act sought to \nencourage and help prevent in the first place.\n  What the ACLU and their fellow travelers and the computer service \ncompanies have difficulty dealing with is that it is wrong--\ndespearately wrong--for an adult to electronically molest or corrupt a \nchild.\n  And thinking people en masse want to do something about it.\n  The Communications Decency Act is not a cure-all. But, at a minimum, \nchildren and families deserve to have a law on their side \nnotwithstanding the\n\n[[Page S1647]]\n\nprotests from the profiteers of child pornography that are rampant on \nthe Internet today.\n  The heart and soul of the new law is its protections for children. It \nis not censorship. It is not prudishness. The new law does not prohibit \nconsenting adults from engaging in constitutionally protected speech.\n  Published reports indicate that Penthouse and Hustler have removed \nindecent material from their publicly available bulletinboards in \nresponse to the new law and their material are now only available only \nto adults through credit card access.\n  That is another step in the right direction.\n  I count this action as a success for the new law. In these two cases, \nfree samples of pornography are no longer given to children. We are \nmaking progress.\n  If the Internet and other computer services are to be a place of \ncommerce, community, and communication, then it must be a place which \nis friendly to families. Indeed, the technology necessary to comply \nwith the Communications Decency Act is the same technology which can \ntell a computer service whether a user is old enough to enter into a \nbinding contract or not.\n  Before the passage of the Communications Decency Act, the Internet \nhad been described as the Wild West. At last, there is now some degree \nof law and order. In effect, the new law is a zoning measure. Adults \nare free to engage in otherwise legal indecent activities and \ncommunications, just not with, or in the knowing presence, of children.\n  Mr. President, later this month, a three-judge panel will hear \narguments on the constitutionality of the Communications Decency Act. \nAn initial review by a Federal judge in Philadelphia protected the \nheart and soul of the new law from a temporary restraining order as had \nbeen requested by the ACLU. Only a small portion of the act was \nenjoined pending further court review. Ultimately, as we all know, Mr. \nPresident, this matter will come before a majority of the Supreme \nCourt. And I hope that they will find--and believe that they will--the \nCommunications Decency Act fully constitutional.\n  Although the U.S. Department of Justice has agreed not to file cases \nunder the new law until the three-judge panel has an opportunity to \nreview the statute, the action by Prodigy, and others indicates that \nthe Communications Decency Act can and is working.\n  I thank all of my colleagues in the Senate and all of my colleagues \nin the House who have been up front in the support of this measure.\n  I now thank President Clinton and his Justice Department for entering \ninto the fray on the side of the kids to begin to make further advances \nin correcting this terrible wrong.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me commend my colleague from Nebraska for his \ndiligence in bringing to our attention a very, very important matter \nthat affects the youth of our Nation. I commend him.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend and colleague from Alaska, very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1646-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1647-S1648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, an extraordinary thing happened today \nin the forum in the sense of the effort to try to bring the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act before this body as Senate \nbill 942.\n  The fact is that here we are 6 o'clock, Thursday, and the information \nof the Senator from Alaska is that the Democratic minority has refused \nto allow this vital piece of legislation to come before this body for a \nvote. The realization, as evidenced by my good friend, Senator Bumpers \nfrom Arkansas, is that, if it came up, it would pass 100 to nothing.\n  We are talking about trying to assist the small business community \nrelative to employment, encourage those that are willing to take a risk \nin the highest area of fallout of any activity, and that is the small \nbusiness community. We are talking about trying to get some regulatory \nreform that will assist them.\n  This has been a top priority of this Congress. It has been a top \npriority of the Senate. We cannot even get it up for a vote.\n  What are we trying to do with this? Some people would say we are \ntrying to unwind the environmental laws, or the labor oversight \nresponsibilities that we have. What we are trying to do is bring some \nlogic into the equation, some cost-benefit, and risk analysis. What \ndoes it mean?\n  Mr. President, I live in Alaska. It snows in Alaska. When the snow \ncomes down, either leave it or move it. In the case of the city of \nFairbanks, where I live, the snow falls on the area where they park the \nbuses. So what do they do? They move the snow back to the back lot. But \nthat is classified as a wetlands. You cannot put snow in a wetland.\n  Is that a rational reality? You cannot dump the excess snow in the \nriver. Why cannot you dump it in the river? Because it may have picked \nup something along the way that somehow would be inappropriate to dump \nin the river. But when it snows in Washington, DC, where do you dump \nthe snow? You dump it wherever. Nobody gets too excited because snow \nhere is a calamity. The city is tied up. It cannot move. You dump it in \nthe Potomac River.\n  Anchorage, AK, the State's largest city, probably has the cleanest \nwater in the world. When it rains it drops down in the street, and goes \ndown the gutter. The gutters go out into Cook Inlet. There is a 30-foot \ntide twice a day. The water goes out. This is not sewage. This is water \nthat goes into your drain from the rain. It goes out.\n  They did not have any problem until the Environmental Protection \nAgency came down with a mandate that said you have to remove 30 percent \nof the organic matter from the water before you can dump it without \ntreatment. And the EPA said to the city of Anchorage, you are in \nviolation of the law.\n  Well, the assembly met. Somebody came up with the idea. ``Let us put \na few fish guts in the drains so we would have something to recover and \nremove the organic matter and, therefore, comply.''\n  When they appealed to the highest level of the Environmental \nProtection Agency, they said we are not going to make exceptions. This \nis uniform throughout the United States.\n  What we are trying to do here, Mr. President, is get some balance, \nsome logic into a situation that has run amok with bureaucracy and the \ninability of our administrators to address clear decisions that should \nbe made relative to the areas of responsibility the administrators \nhave. You cannot mandate uniformity on things like this. You have to \nbring in common sense. You bring in the analysis of cost-benefit. You \nbring in what the risk to the public is. You give the administrators \nthe authority, and you hold them accountable.\n  Many Senators on both sides of the aisle today have worked hard to \ntry to pass regulatory reform legislation. My good friend from \nLouisiana, Senator Johnston, has labored in the vineyards for an \nextraordinary amount of time. But for reasons unknown, today the other \nside of the aisle said, we are not going to bring it up; we are going \nto object. I do not know whether this is connected with an election \nyear. We have a lot of political issues around here.\n  Everybody is committed to assisting small business by reducing \nredundant regulatory oversight, and here is a chance to do it. Politics \nis not an overarching excuse, in my opinion, and getting the American \npublic energized so that we can address the relief needed from some of \nthe ill-founded, erroneous, duplicative regulations is a bipartisan \nresponsibility. We seem to agree on it, but we cannot move. We are \nstuck. No explanation.\n  Today a constituent of mine came in. He brought me a chart. He is in \nthe business of transporting oil. He has to have five permits. He has \nto have a Coast Guard operating regulation permit. He has to have a \nCoast Guard OPA 90 regulatory permit. He has to have an Environmental \nProtection Agency OPA 90 regulatory permit. He has to have an \nEnvironmental Protection Agency spill prevention regulatory permit, and \nhe has to have a State permit, plus the local permits.\n\n[[Page S1648]]\n\n  You have created a whole new industry out there of consultants that \nare hired to do these permits, do this evaluation, at a great cost to \nthe public. And the justification for this really is questionable, \ngiven the lack of cost-benefit and risk analysis that should be \nassociated with the process and unfortunately is not.\n  If you want to go into the logging business in my State, at the last \ncount you have to get some 41 permits. You have to have a radio \noperator's license to run your camp. You have to have a Corps of \nEngineers permit to run your camp, and on and on and on and on.\n  There can be no argument that reforming the way we do regulatory \nbusiness in this country is of paramount importance. We cannot seem to \nget that reform.\n  We are not ready to give up by any means. We are going to keep going \nat it. But in the meantime, there is no reason why we should not move \nwith this particular bill, the small business relief that Senator Bond \nand Senator Bumpers have developed in the Small Business Regulatory \nEnforcement Fairness Act. I commend them for their efforts. There is a \nconsensus on the need for the bill. There is a consensus on the content \nof the bill. There is a consensus on the relief that this bill would \nprovide to the small business community--stimulate employment, \nstimulate investment, stimulate inventory buildup--and yet we cannot \nget the consensus we need to bring it up in the Chamber.\n  The question the Senator from Alaska has to ask the Chair is, why? \nThere are so many positive benefits to this legislation--teeth for the \n16-year-old Regulatory Flexibility Act to allow judicial review of \nadverse impacts regulations have on small businesses. It includes \npenalty waivers and reductions for small business violations that are \nof little if any significance, recovery of attorney's fees when small \nbusiness is forced into defensive litigation due to enforcement \nexcesses, and, finally, small business participation in rulemaking.\n  We cannot keep missing the opportunity to pass positive, helpful \nlegislation for important segments of America's small business \nindustry. We should not miss the opportunity to pass this bill. \nObviously, the weekend is going to go by. We are going to take this up \nagain next week. But I would encourage my colleagues to allow this \nbipartisan bill to come before the floor to get it passed. We owe that \nmuch to the American people.\n  I think we ought to be asking our friends on the other side of the \naisle why they see fit to hold up this important legislation. I \nencourage America's small business community to demand an answer, \nbecause we are ready to go with it on our side, and I think those \npeople out there who are frustrated are waiting and certainly deserve \nan answer.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my statement. I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1647-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   WHITEWATER DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION AND RELATED MATTERS--MOTION TO \n                                PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with \nmy colleague, Senator Johnston, directing a land conveyance for the \npurpose of siting a low level radioactive waste facility at Ward \nValley, CA. This measure is virtually identical to language the Senate \npreviously agreed to in the reconciliation bill conference report, with \nthe exception that we have added an additional condition that \nCalifornia must provide its written commitment to carry out \nenvironmental monitoring and protection measures based on \nrecommendations of the National Academy of Sciences, subject to Federal \noversight by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n  Mr. President, the Congress--in 1980 and again in 1985--gave States \nthe responsibility for low level radioactive waste disposal. After an 8 \nyear licensing process costing more than $45 million, the State of \nCalifornia awarded a license for a waste disposal site at Ward Valley, \nin the Mojave Desert. California is the host State for the Southwestern \nlow level radioactive waste compact which includes the States of \nArizona, North Dakota, South Dakota, and California.\n  The Ward Valley site has withstood the scrutiny of two environmental \nimpact statements, two biological opinions under the Endangered Species \nAct, and a variety of court challenges. Ward Valley was given a clean \nbill of health by the National Academy of Sciences in a special report \nissued in May 1995. No low level radioactive site has received greater \nscrutiny than this one. It's a safe site, and anyone who reviews the \nfacts with the tools of science rather than the rhetoric of emotion \ncomes to that conclusion.\n  With the license issued, the court challenges exhausted, and the \nscience settled, all that remains is a simple, administrative land sale \nfrom the Bureau of Land Management to the State of California. This is \nthe kind of routine conveyance that would normally be handled at a BLM \nfield office. But the Secretary of the Interior has intervened, and \neffectively kept the land sale from proceeding for more than 2 years by \nordering a supplemental EIS, and later, a review by the National \nAcademy of Sciences. Both the supplemental EIS and the Academy review \nturned out to be highly favorable to the Ward Valley site, and at the \nconclusion of each we have hoped that any remaining excuse for further \ndelay would evaporate. Unfortunately, Ward Valley opponents hope to \ndelay this forever, suggesting at each juncture a new study, a new \nhurdle, a new obstacle.\n  The latest hurdle was erected on February 15, when Interior Deputy \nSecretary John Garamendi announced yet another round of follow up \nstudies to include tritium tests. California is not opposed to tritium \ntests, and the State is willing to conduct them. The problem, Mr. \nPresident, is that Interior wants the tests concluded prior to the land \ntransfer. The National Academy of Sciences did not say this was \nnecessary or desirable. In fact, the Academy suggests ongoing testing \nshould be undertaken in conjunction with the operation of the facility. \nThe Interior Department's actions, in my opinion, are merely a tactic \nto delay the commencement of operations at Ward Valley until after the \nnext election.\n  If we do nothing, Mr. President, and allow this land conveyance to be \ndelayed, I can guarantee that there will be some new obstacle erected \nafter the tritium tests are complete. As the National Academy of \nSciences pointed out, tritium tests are difficult and often \ninconclusive. That's why they should not be rushed, they should not \nprecede the conveyance, they should continue along with all of the \nother monitoring and protection measures that will be undertaken during \nthe\n\n[[Page S1650]]\n\nsite's operation. If we proceed with rushed tritium testing, we will \nlikely end up with an inclusive result, providing project opponents \nwith yet another excuse for delay. At the very least, the project \nopponents will ask for another supplemental EIS to consider any new \ninformation. A new basis for further litigation or new strategies for \ndelay would be fabricated. They delays would just go on and on.\n  What we have, Mr. President, is a Department of the Interior--lacking \nexpertise or responsibility in matters relate to the regulation of \nradioactive materials--that aspires to get into the business of nuclear \nregulation. Even worse, the Secretary of the Interior is acting to \nusurp the statutory authority of the State of California to protect the \nradiological health and safety of its citizens through the State \nmanagement and oversight of low-level radioactive waste disposal.\n  Some of my colleagues may recall that we made low-level radioactive \nwaste management a State responsibility in the 1980 and 1985 act in \nresponse to heavy lobbying by the National Governors' Association. At \nthe time, Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton \nwere prominent leaders in the National Governors' Association. Governor \nBabbitt even served on a special NGA task force recommending that low \nlevel radioactive waste management become a State responsibility. \nToday, Interior Secretary Babbitt is working to usurp and erode the \nvery State authority he lobbied Congress for as Governor. I find that \nmost ironic.\n  The irony is not lost on the Governor of California. He has asked us \nfor this legislation. He is concerned about the health, safety, and \nwelfare of Californians. He is aware that low-level radioactive waste \nis being stored in hospitals, in residential neighborhoods, in \nbusinesses, and in universities at 2,254 sites in 800 locations across \nCalifornia, and that the waste in these temporary sites are subject to \nfires, floods, and earthquakes.\n  If you oppose this bill, then you are by necessity arguing for the \ncontinued storage of these materials all over California, or the \ntransport of these materials across the United States to the only \nfacility currently open to California--Barnwell, SC. Meanwhile, some \nhospitals in California are running out of room. Will this result in \nthe curtailment of cancer treatment or AIDS research that uses \nradioactive materials? Will this result in an accidental release at one \nof these dispersed locations as a consequence of a fire, flood or \nearthquake? We can only hope and pray that it will not.\n  To summarize, Mr. President: This is a simple directed land sale that \ndoes what the administration should have done long ago. If we fail to \ndo this, we not only create problems for California and Arizona, North \nDakota, South Dakota as Southwestern Interstate Compact States, we \nchallenge the viability of the Low Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act \nand the policy of State responsibility upon which it is based.\n  A June 16 editorial in Science magazine perhaps says it best: ``The \nrisks stemming from one carefully monitored Ward Valley LLRW site are \ntrivial in comparison with those from 800 urban accumulations. Enough \nof groundless fears and litigation.''\n  Mr. President, we have, indeed, had enough of groundless fears and \nlitigation.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \ndiscourage American businesses from moving jobs overseas and to \nencourage the creation of new jobs in the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     the american jobs act of 1996\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I intend to introduce legislation \ncalled the American Jobs Act, and I simply wanted to come to the floor \nand describe it. I also intend in the coming weeks to try to convince \nas many Members of the Senate as possible to cosponsor this, because I \nthink it does relate to a lot of the issues that the American people \nare very concerned about.\n\n  I spoke yesterday on the floor of the Senate about the issue of trade \nand jobs and the economy. I know some people get tired of hearing that. \nIt is probably the same song with 10 different verses that I come and \ntalk about from time to time.\n  But I think it is central to the question of where are we headed as a \ncountry? Who are we and where are we going? We are a country that is a \nwonderful country with enormous challenges ahead of us, but a country \nstill filled with substantial strength and opportunity in the future.\n  I mentioned yesterday how interesting it is to me that at a time when \npeople talk about how awful this country is, we have people suggesting \nwe ought to put fences down across the border down south to keep people \nout. Why would we want to keep people from coming to this country? We \nhave an immigration problem. Why do people want to come here? Because \nthey think this is a remarkable place. Most people around the world \nthink this is a wonderful place to live and a wonderful place to be.\n  What is happening in our country? Well, we are a country that \nsurvived the Civil War and came out as one country. We survived the \ndepression and went on to build the strongest economy in the world. We \ndefeated Hitler, cured polio, and we put a person on the Moon. When you \nthink of all the wonderful things we have done in this country and then \nunderstand there is a kind of mood in America that is a mood of \ndissatisfaction and concern, not about what is past because all of us \nunderstand that what we have done has been quite remarkable in the \nhistory of humankind, but the concern is about the future. Where are we \nheaded? Where are we going? What kind of a country will we be in the \nfuture?\n  There are several levels of that concern. One is about the declining \nstandards and values in our country that people see. One is about crime \nand the increase in violence in our country and the concern about why \nthat exists. But the other is about the issue of jobs. Will we have \ngood jobs in our country? Under what circumstance will we have good \njobs? There is not a social program in America--none that we talk about \nin the Senate or the House ever during the year--that is as important \nor as useful as a good job to an able-bodied person that wants to have \na good job.\n  A good job is the best social program in our country--a good job with \ngood income. My ancestors came here from other countries because they \nsaw that beacon of hope and opportunity in our country. They wanted to \ntake advantage of it. They wanted a good job. They got good jobs and \nwere able to give their children an education. That is what people in \nAmerica want today. They are concerned because so many jobs in America \nseem to be moving elsewhere, and because the jobs that exist here seem \nto pay less money than they used to and have less security than they \nused to have.\n  We do not have wages spiking up in America, except for the wages of \nCEO's. Yesterday there was a report in the newspaper in town that says \nthe\n\n[[Page S1651]]\n\naverage CEO salary of the large corporations of the country was up 23 \npercent in 1 year--an average $4 million salary. But that is unusual \nbecause blue-collar workers are not keeping pace with inflation. In \nfact, 60 percent of the American families sit around the dinner table \nand talk about their lot in life, and they discover that after 20 years \nthey are working harder and they have less income. If you adjust it for \ninflation, they have less income now than 20 years ago.\n  Why is that the case? Why is it the case that we have jobs with lower \nincome, with less security, and jobs that are moving from our country \noverseas?\n  The chart behind me shows America's trade deficit. I am not going to \nspeak about that today. That is for another time. I have already given \nthat speech, in any event. But the trade deficit. The merchandise trade \ndeficit last year was over $170 billion. What does that mean? It means \nwe are buying more from other countries than they are buying from us. \nAnd we have a very substantial deficit. What it means is jobs that used \nto be here now are somewhere else. It means jobs are moving from \nAmerica, from our country, to other countries. In fact, this chart \nshows foreign imports now take over one-half of U.S. manufacturing \ngross domestic product.\n  Said another way, if you evaluate what it is we produce, manufacture \nin our country, and measure that to what we import from other \ncountries, foreign imports now take one-half of U.S. manufacturing GDP. \nA fair portion of these foreign imports are goods made by American \ncorporations in foreign countries to be shipped back for purchase by \nAmerican consumers. Or said another way, there are American jobs that \nare now gone overseas somewhere, making the same products to ship back \nto Pittsburgh, Denver, Fargo, and Sacramento, to be bought by American \nconsumers. They think it is a good deal. If you can get somebody \nworking for 14 cents an hour in some foreign land to make your shoes, \nshirts, or pants, think of how cheap that is going to be for American \nconsumers--not understanding, of course, that the jobs that used to \nexist here to produce those products for our people are now gone.\n\n  This chart depicts jobs that used to be in America. To pick a few \ncountries, U.S. jobs now in foreign affiliates of U.S. firms were \nnearly 70,000 in 1992; 53,000 in Hong Kong; 14,000 in Costa Rica; \n40,000 in Ireland, and it goes on and on.\n  I pointed out yesterday that there are a lot of reasons for all of \nthis, like global economics, in which corporations are redefining the \neconomic model and saying, ``We want to produce where it is cheap and \nsell into an established market.'' That might be fine for them because, \nfor them, that is profits. For the rest of the American people it is \ntranslated into lost jobs.\n  The initiative I am offering in the Senate today has two purposes, \none of which I have already introduced in a separate smaller piece of \nlegislation. The first provision is to say let us start by stopping the \nbleeding. Let us decide we will not reward a tax break to companies \nwhich decide to shut their American plants down and move their U.S. \njobs overseas. How do we do that? Here is an example: If we have two \ncompanies on the same street making the same product, owned by two \nAmericans, in any American city in the country, and they are the same \nkind of company, make the same product, they may have the same \nprofitability; the only difference is that one of them, on a Monday, \ndecides, I am out of here, I am done, I am tired of having to pay a \nliving wage to an American worker. I am tired of having to comply with \nair and water pollution laws. I am sick and tired of not being able to \nhire kids. I am tired of having to comply with these regulations that \nrequire my workplace to be safe. So I am escaping. I am shutting my \ndoor, getting rid of my workers, taking my equipment and capital and \nmoving to a foreign country where I do not have to bother about \npollution laws. I can dump whatever I want into the streams and air. I \ncan hire 14-year-olds if I choose. I do not have to care about an \ninvestment in safety in the workplace. Most importantly, I can pay 14 \ncents an hour, 25 cents an hour, or 50 cents an hour and increase my \nprofitability.\n  When that person, on a Monday, decides he is going to do that, and \nhis plant closes, and the other person on the other end of the block \nmaking the same product stays here, what is the difference? The person \nthat left our country to produce the same product and ship it back into \nour country and compete with the person that stayed gets a tax break.\n  Our tax law says that if you leave this country, shut your plant \ndown, move your jobs overseas, we will give you a deal. You get \nsomething called ``deferral.'' You can defer your income tax obligation \non the profits you earned. In fact, you can defer them permanently, if \nyou wish, and never pay taxes on that profit. You can invest those \nproceeds overseas and use profits to build more plants and create more \njobs overseas. We will give you a deal. The American taxpayer tells you \nthat you can get a big fat tax break.\n  Well, no more. In fact, I tried to close that little thing last year, \nand 52 Members of the Senate cast a vote to say, ``No, we want to keep \nthat tax break.'' I do not have the foggiest idea why they would think \nthat. But I am going to give them a chance to think about it at least a \ndozen more times this year because we are going to vote and vote and \nvote on this provision until we decide to do the right thing. The right \nthing is to have a Tax Code that is at least neutral on the question of \nwhether you ought to have your jobs in America or overseas.\n  I am really flat tired of seeing a Tax Code that subsidizes the \nmovement of American jobs abroad. Are there conditions under which \npeople would move jobs abroad? Yes. Should we stop it? I do not think \nwe can because we have a global economy. But should we subsidize it? \nNo! It is totally ridiculous. Title I of my bill says let us stop this \ninsidious tax loophole, stop the break that says we will reward you if \nyou simply shut down your American plant and move your jobs to Mexico, \nSingapore, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, China, or you name it.\n  Title II is also very simple: It says for those that create net new \njobs in America, for those American companies that stay in America and \ncreate net new jobs in America, you get a 20 percent payroll tax credit \non your income taxes for the first 2 years of that new job. Why am I \ndoing that? Because I want to close the loophole that allows them to \nmove their jobs overseas and get paid for doing it, and I want to \ncreate an incentive for people to create jobs here in this country.\n  These people in this town who have this global notion that it does \nnot matter where manufacturing exists, it does not matter where jobs \nare, are not thinking about the well-being of this country. This \ncountry does not exist by consumption figures alone. Every single month \nyou drive to work, turn the radio on, guess what? There is some \ncommentator telling us about our economic health. How do they describe \nour economic health? They say we consumed so much last month, we bought \nso much, sales were so high. So we measure now the economic health of \nAmerica by what we consume. That is not what describes the economic \nhealth of my hometown or the economic health of my State or this \ncountry.\n  Economic health in this country is described by what we produce--\nmanufacture, production. The genesis and source of wealth in this \ncountry is what does this country produce. Those who believe America \nwill remain a long-term economic world power without a strong vibrant \nmanufacturing economy have not studied the British disease of long, \nslow economic decline at the turn of the century when they decided it \ndid not matter where manufacturing existed. This country had better \nstart caring again about whether we have a productive sector, whether \nwe have a strong manufacturing base, and whether we retain a broad \nnetwork of good paying jobs in this country. That comes from the \nmanufacturing sector.\n  We spend our time in the Congress talking about almost everything \nexcept that which matters most to American families--jobs. Jobs and \nopportunity. You ask most people what they care about. They care about \nwhether or not they have a decent job and they have an opportunity to \nmake a living and support their family. Then they care about whether \ntheir kids are going to be able to find a decent job. Yes, along the \nway, whether they can get a\n\n[[Page S1652]]\n\ngood education for their kids. Yes, whether their families are safe. \nYes, whether they get decent health care. Those are the central issues \nfor families. All of it is driven by do you have an opportunity to get \na decent job.\n  It ought not escape anybody's notice that as those who describe our \neconomic circumstances in our country, these economists--and I guess I \nshould make clear with truth in labeling that I taught economics in \ncollege for a couple of years part-time; I was able to overcome that \nand go on and do other things in life. The economists who have \ndescribed for us an economic model in which they talk about how \nwonderfully healthy America's economy is because it is growing and it \nis moving ahead. Why? Because they talk about how much we are \nconsuming--a fair amount, incidentally with debt, debt-assisted \nconsumption, as opposed to manufacturing assisted by good investment. \nThat is the difference.\n  If we do not start moving to debate the central issue of what moves \nour economy ahead and what provides economic strength and vitality for \nAmerican families, we are always, it seems to me, going to be on the \nend of a disconnection from the average American voter. They want us to \nbe dealing with things that matter most in their lives. There is not \nmuch that is more important than the issue of will this economy of ours \nproduce decent jobs in the future? Now, we can, as we have in the past, \njust hang around here and talk about all the other ancillary issues \nthat do not matter very much, but if we do not decide that jobs matter \nand that our Tax Code that actually encourages people to move their \njobs overseas, if we do not decide that desperately needs changes, we \ndo not deserve to belong in this Chamber. We have to decide what the \ncentral issues for our country are.\n  I think everybody in this country knows that we have lost some 3 \nmillion manufacturing jobs in about a 5-to 8-year-period, at a time \nwhen we have increased by tens of millions the number of American \ncitizens who live here. A good job base in the manufacturing sector is \nshrinking, our population is increasing. Opportunity is moving away. It \nis not too late. I think that what most of the American people would \nlike us to do is put America's Tax Code on the side of America's \nworkers and America's taxpayers, and not on the side of big \ncorporations that will milk the Tax Code by moving jobs overseas \ninstead of keeping jobs here at home.\n  Mr. President, I will be introducing the legislation in the Senate \ntoday. I hope that some of my colleagues will join me. Again, I \nindicate that I fully intend that we will have repeated votes on this \nkind of legislation this year because I think it is central to the \nissue of what we ought to be doing.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GLENN:\n  S. 1598. A bill to provide that professional sports teams relocating \nto different communities shall lose trademark protection with respect \nto team names, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                        the sports heritage act\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Sports \nHeritage Act of 1996. This legislation addresses a problem faced by \nmany communities after the loss of a professional sports team and is a \ncompanion to a bill I introduced in November, the Fans Rights Act.\n  Simply, the Sports Heritage Act would allow a community to keep a \nprofessional team's name and colors in the event of a relocation. The \nonly condition is that the team must have played at least 10 years in \nthe community. The bill also says that the elected officials of a \ncommunity can waive this right.\n  Mr. President, relocation fever is sweeping American professional \nsports. At a record number, professional sports teams are abandoning--\nor attempting to abandon--their host communities, often with little \nregard for the historical legacy of the team in its home city.\n  The Sports Heritage Act gives communities some protection over that \nhistorical tradition. For example, the proposed team relocation which \nhas truly shocked sports fans across the country is the Cleveland \nBrowns' decision to move to Baltimore.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to get into the specifics of that move \nor why it has shocked sports fans. But let me tell you a bit about the \ntradition of the Browns in Cleveland.\n  The Cleveland Browns have been a symbol of undying and unwavering fan \nsupport for half-a-century. During the football season, Lakefront \nMunicipal Stadium is packed to the rafters with Browns' fans rooting on \ntheir team. There have been glorious Browns' seasons and their have \nbeen not-so-glorious seasons. But one constant has been the fan \nsupport. And that support has been passed on from generation to \ngeneration.\n  I am pleased that the deal between the city and the NFL will maintain \nthe Browns' name and colors in Cleveland for a future team. Let's be \nhonest, did anyone really think Baltimore Browns sounded right? Not \nonly doesn't it sound right, it flies in the face of sports history in \nCleveland, in Ohio, and the rest of America. The name Browns belongs to \nthe rich sports tradition of northern Ohio and its right that the name \nand colors will stay.\n  Another example is the Oakland Raiders. How many of us spent the last \ndecade referring to the team as the Oakland Raiders instead of the Los \nAngeles Raiders? Or could you imagine other situations, such as the \nOrlando Yankees or the New Orleans Cubs? I'm not suggesting these two \nstoried franchises are going to move, but I use the examples to stress \nhow a team name can be woven into the fabric of a community's \ntraditions.\n  The Sports Heritage Act would permit communities that have long-\nstanding ties to a sports franchise, 10 or more years, to retain the \nteam name for any future franchises. I think that's only fair.\n  The current relocation fever in professional sports has brought about \na great deal of attention in Congress. Fans and communities need more \nprotection and I believe the Fans Rights Act will accomplish that. The \nSports Heritage Act will help strengthen that protection and I urge all \nSenators to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Mack):\n  S. 1600. A bill to establish limitations on health plans with respect \nto genetic information, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                    the genetic fairness act of 1996\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, today, Senator Mack and I are \nintroducing a bill to do two things. It would--\n  First, prohibit health insurers from conditioning the sale or terms \nof health insurance on genetic information of the insured or applicant \nfor insurances; and\n  Second, prohibit health insurers from requiring an applicant for \ninsurance or an individual or family member presently covered to take a \ngenetic test or to be subjected to questions relating to genetic \nhistory.\n  Under this bill, an insurer could not engage in the following actions \non the basis of any genetic information of an individual or family \nmember or on the basis of an individual's or family member's request \nfor or receipt of genetic services:\n  Terminate, restrict, limit, or otherwise apply conditions to coverage \nof an individual or family member;\n  Cancel or refuse to renew the coverage of an individual or family \nmember;\n  Deny coverage or exclude an individual or family member from \ncoverage;\n  Impose a rider that excludes coverage for certain benefits and \nservices under the plan;\n  Establish differentials in premium rates or cost sharing for coverage \nunder the plan; or otherwise discriminate against an individual or \nfamily member in the provision of health care.\n  Last fall, as cochairs of the Senate Cancer Coalition, Senator Mack \nand I held a hearing on the status and use of genetic tests. Witnesses \ntestified about the great promise of genetic testing in predicting and \nmanaging a range of diseases. A considerable portion of illness derives \nfrom defects in one or more genes or the interplay of environmental and \ngenetic factors.\n  For example, approximately 3 percent of all children are born with a \nsevere condition that is primarily genetic in origin. By age 24, \ngenetic disease strikes 5 percent of Americans. Genetic disorders \naccount for one-fifth of adult hospital occupancy, two-thirds of \nchildhood hospital occupancy, one-\n\n[[Page S1653]]\n\nthird of pregnancy loss, and one-third of mental retardation.\n  About 15 million people are affected by one or more of the over 4,000 \ncurrently identified genetic disorders. An even larger number are \ncarriers of genetic disease. J. Rennie in the June 1994 Scientific \nAmerican estimated that every person has between 5 and 10 defective \ngenes though they often are not manifested. Indeed, we are all carrying \naround between 50,000 and 100,000 genes scattered on 23 pairs of \nchromosomes.\n  In the past 5 years, there has been a virtual explosion of knowledge \nabout genes. Scientists, including those at the Federal Human Genome \nProject, are decoding the basic units of heredity. We know that certain \ndiseases have genetic links, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, \nHuntington's disease, cystic fibrosis, neurofibromatosis, and Lou \nGehrig's disease. Altered genes play a part in heart disease, diabetes, \nand many other more common disease.\n  While these important understandings hold great potential, they also \npresent some serious problems. Witness after witness at our hearing \ndiscussed the potential and the reality of health insurance \ndiscrimination. They told us about insurers denying coverage, refusing \nto renew coverage, or denying coverage of a particular condition.\n  In a 1992 study, the Office of Technology Assessment found that 17 of \n29 insurers would not sell insurance to individuals when presymptomatic \ntesting revealed the likelihood of a serious, chronic future disease. \nFifteen of 37 commercial insurers that cover groups said they would \ndecline the applicant. Underwriters at 11 of 25 Blue Cross-Blue Shield \nplans said they would turn down an applicant if presymptomatic testing \nrevealed the likelihood of disease. The study also found that insurers \nprice plans higher--or even out of reach--based on genetic information. \nAnother study conducted by Dr. Paul Billings at the California Pacific \nMedical Center, reached similar conclusions.\n  Here are a few examples, real-life cases:\n  An individual with hereditary hemochromatosis (excessive iron), who \nruns 10K races regularly, but who had no symptoms of the disease, could \nnot get insurance because of the disease.\n  An 8-year-old girl was diagnosed at 14 days of age with PKU \n(phenylketonuria), a rare inherited disease, which if left untreated, \nleads to retardation. Most States require testing for this disease at \nbirth. Her growth and development proceeded normally and she was \nhealthy. She was insured on her father's employment-based policy, but \nwhen he changed jobs, the insurer at the new job told him that his \ndaughter was considered to be a high risk patient and uninsurable.\n  The mother of an elementary school student had her son tested for a \nlearning disability. The tests revealed that the son had fragile X \nsyndrome, an inherited form of mental retardation. Her insurer dropped \nher son's coverage. After searching unsuccessfully for a company that \nwould be willing to insure her son, the mother quit her job so she \ncould impoverish herself and become eligible for Medicaid as insurance \nfor her son.\n  Another man worked as a financial officer for a large national \ncompany. His son had a genetic condition which left him severely \ndisabled. The father was tested and found to be an asymptomatic carrier \nof the gene which caused his son's illness. His wife and other sons \nwere healthy. His insurer initially disputed claims filed for the son's \ncare, then paid them, but then refused to renew the employer's group \ncoverage. The company then offered two plans. All employees except this \nfather were offered a choice of the two. He was allowed only the \nmanaged care plan.\n\n  A woman was denied health insurance because her nephew had been \ndiagnosed as having cystic fibrosis and she inquired whether she should \nbe tested to see if she was a carrier. After she was found to carry the \ngene that causes the disease, the insurer told her that neither she nor \nany children she might have would be covered unless her husband was \ndetermined not to carry the CF gene. She went for several months \nwithout health insurance because she sought genetic information about \nherself.\n  These practices deny people health insurance. In the United States, \n40 million people or 15 percent have no health insurance. In \nCalifornia, it is 23 percent, translating to between 6 and 7 million \npeople. If people with genetic conditions or predispositions cannot buy \nhealth insurance on the private market, they usually have nowhere to \nturn. To qualify for Medicaid, the primary public health insurance \nprogram for the nonelderly, families have to spend down or impoverish \nthemselves. Having more uninsured people means that we all pay more, \nboth for the public programs and for uninsured people arriving in \nhospital emergency rooms at the last minute with exacerbated \nconditions.\n  Not only do these denials deprive Americans of health insurance, the \nfear of discrimination can have adverse health effects. For example, if \npeople fear retaliation by their insurer, they may be less likely to \nprovide their physician with full information. They may be reluctant to \nbe tested. This reluctance means that physicians might not have all the \ninformation they need to make a solid diagnosis or decide a course of \ntreatment.\n  I hope Congress will begin to address this unfair insurance practice. \nAfter all, we are all just a bundle of genes. We are all at risk of \ndisease and illness. This bill can help make health insurance available \nto many who need it and who want to buy it. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me today in enacting this bill. \n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Glenn, Mr. DeWine and Mr. Kohl):\n\n  S. 1601. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nextend the deadline for and clarify the contents of the Great Lakes \nhealth research report, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n THE AGENCY FOR TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND DISEASE REGISTRY REAUTHORIZATION \n                              ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill with Senators \nGlenn, DeWine, and Kohl, to reauthorize and extend an ongoing research \neffort examining human health effects of consuming Great Lakes fish \nthat have been exposed to pollutants. Extensive, careful research is \ncritical to sensible and cost-effective decisions on the steps needed \nto protect the Great Lakes environment.\n  This research effort was originally authorized in the Great Lakes \nCritical Programs Act of 1990, which I authored. The effort is being \nled by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and is \nintended to help provide information on the human and ecological health \neffects of environmental contamination, particularly in the Great \nLakes.\n  Studies have indicated that humans are the final biological receptors \nfor many toxic substances. One of the most obvious pathways of human \nexposure is fish consumption, since it is well documented that some \npollutants of concern accumulate in fish, and fishing is a very popular \npastime in the Great Lakes.\n  Preliminary results from the first phase of this research indicate an \nassociation between consumption of contaminated fish and human body \nburdens of persistent toxic substances, including PCB's, \norganochlorines, and heavy metals such as mercury and lead. One ongoing \nstudy component of the overall project suggests that there is a \npositive connection between the amount of Lake Ontario fish consumed by \nmothers and adverse neurobehavioral effects in their children.\n  The information being gathered through this research is crucial to \nmaking well-informed decisions about environmental protection in the \nGreat Lakes. Its findings are extremely useful in the development of a \nuniform fish advisory for the entire Great Lakes, rather than the \nconfusing system currently in place where each State warns anglers and \nconsumers of slightly different hazards to health. This uniform \napproach's key components have received the endorsement of the Michigan \nEnvironmental Science Board. And, the data being gathered will help \nguide policymakers in addressing possibly one of the most challenging \nissues facing the Great Lakes region--contaminated sediments.\n  As my colleagues may know, there are many areas of concern in the \nGreat Lakes. These areas are frequently harbors or watersheds drainage \nareas that\n\n[[Page S1654]]\n\nhave experienced significant industrial activity. The sediment in these \nareas has become contaminated with any number of persistent pollutants. \nDespite reductions in point source discharges, and projected decreasing \nemissions from air sources that deposit toxics in the Great Lakes, the \nreservoir of contaminants already in sediments will continue to degrade \nwater quality and therefore increase opportunities for human exposure. \nWe must continue our efforts to remove or treat these sediments, but we \nwill need guidance from well-conducted, peer-reviewed scientific work \nlike that provided by the ATSDR to prioritize our efforts. Also, I \nwould like to once again strongly urge the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency to submit its very tardy report to Congress providing \nthe results of a comprehensive national survey of aquatic sediment \nquality. This too is important data we need to attack the problem of \ncontaminated sediments.\n  Extending this research effort is necessary to help track the long-\nterm effects of pollutants on human health. This bill authorizes an \nextension until 1999 and requires an additional report to Congress at \nthe conclusion of the research. Also, the bill clarifies the purpose of \nthe research consistent with scientific recommendations and the \npreliminary study results.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that all my colleagues from the Great \nLakes region and Senators representing other areas that suffer from \nwater quality problems will join me in cosponsoring this bill. We need \nmore means and data by which we can measure our environmental \nprotection progress and efficiently target our limited resources. This \nresearch program is a small, but very important part of that effort. We \ncannot afford to make decisions without the information that is coming \nout of the ATSDR research. Our children's future depends on it.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today in support for the \nreauthorization of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease \nRegistry's [ATSDR] study examining the connection between consumption \nof contaminated fish and human health.\n  I am honored to join my colleagues, Senators Levin, Kohl, and DeWine, \nin the reauthorization of this study of immense importance to the \npeople of the Great Lakes basin. I am also pleased that my Ohio \ncolleague, Congressman LaTourette, and Congressman Oberstar have \nintroduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives. That \nbill was successfully included in the House-passed Clean Water Act \nReauthorization.\n  As you may know, the Great Lakes States have fish advisories warning \nthe public against consumption of certain fish at particular levels due \nto contamination. This bill would continue a research program designed \nto investigate and characterize the association between the consumption \nof contaminated Great Lakes fish and short- and long-term harmful human \nhealth effects. The ATSDR study develops a body of knowledge on \nexposure pathways, body burdens, and associated human health effects in \ndefined at-risk populations. These populations include sport anglers, \nthe urban poor, pregnant women and their children, native Americans, \nand elderly.\n  This body of knowledge has a variety of potential and beneficial \nuses. Perhaps most importantly, it may be used to assist State and \nlocal agencies in developing fish advisories, remedial action plans, \nand lake-wide management plans. The study's findings may also increase \ngeneral public awareness of the health implications of the toxic \npollution in the lakes, and provide a study model for other human \nhealth research.\n  Congress has recognized the merits of this human health effects \nresearch in the past. I thank my Great Lakes colleagues for their \ncontinued support in the effort to understand the impacts of consuming \ncontaminated fish and hope others will recognize the merits of \nreauthorizing the ATSDR human health effects research.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I rise today to take a moment to \npraise a worthy nonprofit organization that is having a real impact on \nfour communities in my home State of Maine. The organization is Faith \nin Action, a national program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation \nthat in 1993 began providing technical assistance and startup grants to \nhelp develop interfaith volunteer projects that focus on helping those \nin need of care from the community.\n  During the first 2 years of the program, Faith in Action limited its \ngrants to faith coalitions--churches, temples, and synagogues--that \nwanted to begin volunteer care giving projects within their community A \ntotal of 800 such projects will be funded over 4 years of this \ninitiative. In 1995, Faith In Action expanded its criteria, and now \nencourages health and social service agencies to join with \ncongregations to develop new projects. Each approved coalition is \nawarded a $25,000 grant to assist people in the community of all ages \nwho have special needs.\n  Over the last year, these grants have helped fund important projects \nin four communities in Maine: Portland, Bangor, Richmond, and Lubec. In \nBangor, two Faith in Action programs are up and running, providing the \nfrail elderly residents in and around that city with a variety of \nassistance. Developed by St. Joseph Healthcare, in conjunction with \narea churches and synagogues, the project assesses the needs of elderly \nresidents, particularly improving their access to quality health care. \nVolunteers provide transportation, home visits, help in meal \npreparation, light housekeeping or repairs in the home, and other \nservices to assist the elderly who want to maintain some independence, \nbut cannot do everything for themselves.\n  A similar project is starting up in the small town of Richmond, where \nthe grant money is being used to assist the homebound elderly with \ntransportation, companionship, and other services. A new facility has \nopened in that town for those elderly residents who need some living \nassistance, but do not qualify for a nursing home. Some of the Faith in \nAction funds went toward the purchase of a van to help these residents \nget to and from the grocery store, pharmacy, and other errands. A grant \nin Portland is targeted for persons who have acquired brain injuries \nand will go toward meeting the special needs of that population. And \nfar up the coast, in the town of Lubec, a Faith in Action grant is \nbeing used to help meet the needs of children, adults, and seniors who \nare receiving hospice care.\n  The common link between all these projects, of course, is the members \nof the community reaching out to help those within their city or town \nwho need their help. Faith in Action grants are rooted in voluntarism, \nand in linking the different religious communities within a city or \ntown to work together to better serve the community. Only by working \ntogether can we solve some of the many problems within our cities and \ntowns.\n  As chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am extremely \naware of the daunting demographics that we face in the coming decades. \nMore than 33 million Americans are over the age of 65 today--a number \nthat will double in the coming three decades. We need to prepare now to \nmeet the needs of today's aging population. Faith in Action is an \norganization with the vision to meet that goal, by encouraging the \ndiverse members of a community to work with one another to address the \nspecial needs of individuals within that community. We need to \nencourage more and more people to get involved in Faith in Action \nvolunteer projects, or in any volunteer project at all. We can do so \nmuch for each other, even if it is only for a few hours each month.\n  I congratulate the organizations in Maine that have already received \nFaith in Action grants and are putting them to such important use. I \nencourage other churches, synagogues, and temples in Maine and around \nthe country to contact their local health and social service agencies \nand see if they can come up with a project that might serve the needs \nof the elderly or disabled in their community. Finally, I salute Faith \nin Action and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation for their dedication \nto these projects--keep up the good work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1656-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1656-S1657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            REFORM IN RUSSIA\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on February 5, Russia's \nCommission on Human Rights of the Russian Federation issued its report, \n``On the Observance of the Rights of Man and the Citizen in the Russian \nFederation.'' The report covers the years 1994-1995 and its conclusion \nis troubling: ``the human rights situation in the Russian Federation \nhas remained extremely unsatisfactory.'' The commission observed that \nconstitutional guarantees for human rights and civil liberties ``remain \nlargely rhetorical'' and that ``in many aspects of civil and political \nrights and liberties there has been a distinct retreat from democratic \nachievements.''\n  In support of its finding, the commission noted, inter alia: an \nincreasing militarization of society; growth in the jurisdiction and \npowers of the security forces; the use of force to resolve domestic \naffairs, as in Chechnya; aggravation of racial and ethnic intolerance \nand discrimination; and the termination of state support for human \nrights organizations and offices. ``Political expediency,'' the \ncommission charges, ``increasingly takes precedence over fundamental \nprinciples of law and respect for human rights and dignity,'' a cause \n``for grave concern.''\n  Mr. President, only this past week the former head of the commission, \nSergei Kovalev, was in Washington to testify before the Commission on \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe [CSCE], also known as the Helsinki \nCommission and on which I have recently been appointed to serve. Mr. \nKovalev was president of Russia's Commission on Human Rights from its \ninception in October 1993 until he submitted his resignation on January \n23 of this year. The commission's report bears his stamp. His \nresignation was in protest over the very matters I have just noted: the \nfear that Russia's leaders are paying only lip service to democratic \nand economic reform and contemplating a return to the worst features of \nSoviet-era authoritarian rule.\n  Mr. Kovalev's testimony last week focused on the fighting in \nChechnya, about which I will comment further below, but he has a long \nhistory of fighting for human rights, including as a political prisoner \nin the former Soviet Union. His voice is among the most respected in \nRussia; he maintained his seat in Russia's State Duma despite the \nresurgence of the Communists in December's parliamentary elections.\n  In his letter of resignation to President Yeltsin, Mr. Kovalev wrote:\n\n       Even though you continue to proclaim your undying devotion \n     to democratic ideals, you have at first slowly, and then more \n     and more abruptly, changed the course of your government \n     policy. Now your government is trying to turn the country in \n     a direction completely contrary to the one proclaimed in \n     August 1991.\n\n  He then goes on to analyze President Yeltsin's swing toward \nauthoritarianism. Mr. Kovalev questions President Yeltsin's commitment \nto the basic hallmarks of democracy, when he has ``virtually halted \njudicial reform'', and thwarted transparency and accountability with \nthe creation of secret institutions and constant issuing of secret \ndecrees.\n  Mr. President, in the past 6 years, we have witnessed amazing \ndemocratic\n\n[[Page S1657]]\n\nand economic transformations in Russia. While these radical changes \nhave borne some difficult and unfortunate challenges both in Russia and \nthe international arena, Russia had been on a course of reform that we \nembraced. We counted on President Yeltsin, whose own personal \nmetamorphosis had apparently paralleled his nation's, to lead Russia \nthrough these challenges. But now there are troubling signs of erosion \nof Yeltsin's genuine commitment to reform which, if continued, could \nhave detrimental consequences for the U.S. national interest. Our \ninterest lies in the continuation of reform in Russia--whether led by \nPresident Yeltsin or not.\n  As we wait for more reform in Russia, President Yeltsin has tried to \nreassure the international community with positive words and uplifting \npromises. But some of the actions we have seen in recent weeks, \nincluding the sacking of his respected economic advisor and other \nCabinet-level reformers, lend pause. The replacements have been Soviet-\nera hardliners resistant to reform and internationalism. Many people \nhave voiced reservations about President Yeltsin's authoritarian \ntendencies, and hope that it may just be election year posturing, a \nresponse to the decidedly antireform results of last month's \nparliamentary elections in Russia. The question we must ask is how far \non the slippery slope do we go with President Yeltsin? When do his \nattempts to appease hardline critics leave Russia in the same boat he \nclaims to want to avoid?\n  Mr. Kovalev testified about the excessive use of force in Chechnya \nand I join in his condemnation of practices repugnant to human dignity. \nIt is clear that the fighting in Chechnya is war; the combatants on \nboth sides are committed to a cause. But even in war, there are \nstandards of respect for human rights and for civilized conduct. These \nhave been violated on both sides of the conflict and both deserve \ncondemnation.\n  But Russia, as a sovereign state, and as a member of the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe, has a special obligation to \navoid civilian casualties during hostilities on its own territory. The \npractice of calling in indiscriminate airstrikes on Chechnyan villages \nmust end, just as surely as the Chechnyan practice of terrorism must \nstop.\n  The overall slowing and, in fact, apparent retreat by Russia's \nleadership in human rights and reform brings into question the future \ndirection of United States-Russia relations, as well as Russia's place \nin post-cold war alliances, in doubt. President Clinton and Secretary \nChristopher are right to do all they can to work with the new Russian \nofficials and offer constructive support wherever we can to advance the \ncause of reform. But we must keep our eye on the ball: our goal is \nreform--democratic, economic, and military reform--and support for \nPresident Yeltsin to the extent that he will deliver those reforms.\n  I conclude by quoting from Mr. Kovalev's March 6 testimony to the \nCSCE in which he, in turn, drew on the wisdom of one of Russia's \nleading proponents of democracy and human rights, Andrei Sakharov:\n\n       the West should have a two-track policy (towards Russia): \n     assistance and pressure. Assist, and effectively assist--the \n     growing civil society and democratic movement in (our) \n     country. Exert pressure, and strong pressure--on those forces \n     that oppose peace, human rights and progress.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1656-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1657-S1658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        DISAPPROVAL OF ADMINISTRATION'S CERTIFICATION OF MEXICO\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to further comment on \na joint resolution introduced on March 5, 1996, that disapproves of the \nadministration's certification of Mexico. I am joined by my colleagues \nSenator Helms, Senator McConnell, and Senator Pressler who are original \ncosponsors of Senate Joint Resolution 50, but were inadvertently \nomitted as original cosponsors upon introduction. I also urge its \nimmediate passage.\n  In order to determine if a country has cooperated fully with the \nUnited States, the President must evaluate the country's efforts in \nseveral areas: their efforts to reduce cultivation of illegal drugs, \ntheir interdiction efforts, the swift, decisive action by the \nGovernment against corruption within its ranks and their extradition of \ndrug traffickers. The results of the Government's efforts are the true \nindication of success. These same standards should also be used when \nCongress measures the accomplishments of foreign governments.\n  As required under the Foreign Assistance Act, the President released \nhis list on March 1 and granted Mexico full certification. That \ndesignation is completely unacceptable, and undeserved. And for that \nreason, my colleagues and I are introducing this joint resolution of \ndisapproval of Mexico's certification.\n  Mexico is a sieve. For the President to certify that Mexico is \ncomplying with antinarcotics efforts and curbing the export of drugs \nacross the border is simply not supported by the facts.\n  Our own Drug Enforcement Agency [DEA] estimates that up to 70 percent \nof all illegal drugs found in the United States come from Mexico. \nSeventy five percent of the cocaine in the U.S. is said to have come \nfrom Mexico. Virtually all of the heroin produced in Mexico is \ntrafficked in the United States. These numbers certainly do not sound \nlike full cooperation to me. From these numbers alone, it seems as \nthough the Mexican Government has failed horribly in its efforts to \ncurb the flow of drugs into the United States. Even the International \nNarcotics Control Strategy Report just released by the State Department \nstates that ``no country in the world poses a more immediate narcotics \nthreat to the United States than Mexico.'' Our own State Department \nsays this.\n  Even efforts to end police corruption have failed because the drug \ntrade has infiltrated the Mexican law enforcement community. Robert \nGelbard, Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and \nLaw Enforcement Affairs in a congressional hearing, stated that ``we \nhave always been aware--and acknowledge--that law enforcement \ncorruption in Mexico is a deeply entrenched, serious obstacle to \nbilateral antinarcotics cooperation.'' The State Department, in their \n1996 Strategy Report, while acknowledging some efforts by the Mexican \nGovernment, indicates the continuation of official corruption by \nstating that, ``endemic corruption continued to undermine both policy \ninitiatives and law enforcement operations.''\n  It is time that the Mexican Government takes aggressive action \nagainst drug traffickers. Promises are no longer adequate. Among other \nsteps that should be taken, Mexico should be arresting and extraditing \nmore of its cartel leaders. Mexico must comply with the 165 outstanding \nrequests for extradition by the United States. That would be real \ncooperation.\n  The Mexican Government should also swiftly enact legislation stemming \nthe growing problem of money laundering and enforce its anticorruption \nlaws. There are no reporting requirements if an individual walks up to \nan exchange center with suitcases filled with cash. This should be \nadequate evidence that Mexico needs reporting requirements of large \ncash transactions. Action to identify and prosecute officials that \ninterfere with the investigation, prosecution, or have assisted in the \ndrug trade, must occur with greater frequency if government officials \nare to be trusted.\n  For the President to claim that Mexico has been fully cooperating to \nend the scourge of drugs is beyond belief. I hope that the Senate will \nnow closely analyze and debate the extent of Mexico's participation in \nthe illegal drug trade. Then we should ask ourselves, ``Is the Mexican \nGovernment taking actions that actually slows the flow of drugs?'' It \nseems as though it has not.\n  The Mexican Government must do more to fight the narcotics industry \nthat has permeated the lives of the Mexican people and the economy of \nMexico. The drug trade is worth tens of billion of dollars to Mexico. \nNo wonder Mexico is having difficulty decreasing the flow of drugs from \ntheir country into ours. There is too much money involved.\n  Mexico is now being used to store cocaine from Colombia for shipment \ninto the United States. The cartels may be storing as much as 70 to 100 \ntons of cocaine in Mexico at any one time. With a developing narcotics \ninfrastructure and its close proximity to the United States, Mexico has \nproven to be an asset that the cartels do not want to lose. And now \nthere are reports that\n\n[[Page S1658]]\n\nthe Mexican gangs may soon take over the drug trafficking from the Cali \ncartel. It is ironic then that Colombia, the source country, was \ndecertified while Mexico was fully certified.\n  I must also add that I have heard that some foreign officials believe \nour certification process is illegitimate. This is the height of \narrogance. What is illegitimate about placing conditions on our foreign \naid and requiring the recipient to curb the flow of drugs?\n  The certification process has the net effect of bringing the drug \nproblem to the forefront, not only for the United States but also for \nMexico. It seems as though only when a government is forced to confront \nthe problem as difficult as the drug trade will a solution be found.\n  As a result of the amount of drugs that are found to have come into \nthe United States through Mexico, we know that Mexico has failed to \nstem the international drug trade. If this administration does not want \nto recognize Mexico's failure, then it is up to Congress to do so. \nAgain, I encourage my colleagues to join us in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1657-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING THE ODELSON FAMILY\n\n Mr. SIMON.

Mr. President, in a statement last week I condemned \ntwo terrorist bombings which took place in Jerusalem and Ashkelon 12 \ndays ago. I did not think that it would be so soon that events would \nbring me once again to this floor to condemn another pair of cowardly \nattacks against innocent people, including young children.\n  Today, Israelis are justifiably shocked, disgusted, and angry. To \nbring home just what Israel is experiencing, let me provide a vivid \ncomparison. On a proportional basis, the number of people killed by \nterrorists in Israel over the past 12 days would be equivalent to over \n3,000 Americans killed. Imagine what our reaction would be if over \n3,000 Americans were murdered in terrorist attacks in such a short \nperiod.\n  I dare say that our fundamental sense of stability and security as a \nnation would be shaken to its very core. That is what Israelis are \nfeeling today.\n  As difficult as it is in this moment of grief and anger, we have to \nrecognize the motive of those behind these dastardly attacks. Their \nsingle-minded aim is to end the peace process cold.\n  We cannot let them have the satisfaction of that kind of victory. We \nmust resist the urge of our raw emotions in the wake of these \noutrageous attacks. We must not discard the remarkable achievements of \nthe past 3 years, for that would play directly into the hands of the \nterrorists.\n  Last week, I urged that the peace process continue. I believe that \neven more firmly now.\n  The terrorists can be defeated through a two-pronged strategy. First, \nthere must be intensified efforts to destroy the infrastructure and \nnetwork that are ultimately behind terrorist actions. In that regard, I \ncommend President Clinton for offering technical assistance to the \nIsraelis and Palestinians in the war against terror. Second, we must \nprove to the terrorists that their actions are not producing the \ndesired results. That means moving forward undaunted with the peace \nprocess.\n  Last week, I appealed to the Palestinian majority that supports peace \nto join the battle against terror with renewed vigor because it is \ntheir future that is most at stake. I renew that call today. If these \nattacks continue, then the Palestinian experience with self-government \ncould become a fleeting memory.\n  Mr. President, in my remarks today I have used the term ``war''--the \nsame term Prime Minister Shimon Peres has used to describe the state of \naffairs between Israel and Hamas. It is an appropriate term to use, and \nunlike many wars this one is a clear-cut conflict between good and \nevil.\n  A victory by the pro-peace majority of Israelis and Palestinians \ncould lead the way to a thriving, vibrant, and cooperative Middle East. \nA victory by Hamas and its extremist allies on both sides will mean \nconflict, bloodshed, and division long into the future.\n  In this war, as in all of Israel's wars, the United States will stand \nby Israel and do whatever it takes to ensure victory.\n  Mr. President, Israel has endured much suffering in its short \nhistory, and it has shown remarkable fortitude in the face of terrorism \nand other attempts to destroy it. The Israeli people have always \nthwarted the designs of those who have tried every means to eliminate \ntheir country. I have no doubt that they will prevail in their present \nstruggle against those who have declared war against Israel, the peace \nprocess, and, indeed civilization itself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1658-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1658-S1659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         REPORT OF SENATE DELEGATION'S TRIP TO THE MIDDLE EAST\n\n Mr. PELL. Mr. President, in February, I led a congressional \ndelegation on a trip to Jordan, Syria, Israel, and Cyprus. I was \npleased to be joined on this trip by the distinguished Senators from \nVirginia and Oklahoma--Senators Robb and Inhofe.\n  On our trip, Senator Inhofe, Senator Robb, and I focused primarily on \nthe Middle East peace process, including prospects for a peace treaty \nbetween Israel and Syria, as well as the implementation of Israel's \npeace agreements with Jordan and the Palestinians. During our stop in \nCyprus, we examined the conflict between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots \nand the likelihood of a peaceful, negotiated settlement.\n  Since our return, the Middle East--and specifically Israel--has been \nwracked by an unimaginable wave of violence and terror. The murder of \nscores of innocent Israelis, as well as Palestinians, Americans, and \nother civilians, has cast an unmistakable pall over the peace process. \nTo be frank, I am not sure that any supporter of the peace process, be \nthey in Israel, the Palestinian autonomous zone, or the United States, \nhas a clear idea of what the future holds.\n  My own hope is that the process can survive this unspeakable assault. \nOur recent trip reaffirmed for me the clear fact that the terrorists \nare the enemies of peace. If the terrorists succeed in destroying the \npeace process, then they will be rewarded for their depravity. I do not \nthink such an outcome would be right or fair.\n  Mr. President, the Senate already has responded to some of the \nterrorist bombings in Israel. Scarcely a week ago, the Senate passed a \nresolution to condemn the perpetrators, to commiserate with the \nvictims, to express continued support for our ally, Israel. In a \nshocking indication of how frequent these incidents have become, \nhowever, the Senate will soon consider yet another resolution that \ncondemns two more bombings that have occurred since the passage of the \nlast resolution.\n  Above and beyond these resolutions, I would expect that there may be \nsome deep soul searching in both the Congress and the administration \nabout the American role in coordinating the peace process. In this \nregard, I thought it might be useful to share with my colleagues the \nreport that our Senate delegation made on its recent trip to the Middle \nEast. As I said a moment ago, our trip preceded the recent wave\n\n[[Page S1659]]\n\nof terror, but I think that our observations, conclusions, and \nrecommendations remain timely and important.\n  Mr. President, I ask that our delegation's executive summary be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The summary follows:\n\n                         Letter of Transmittal\n\n                                                February 23, 1996.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: From February 7-14, 1996, our Senate \n     delegation traveled to the Eastern Mediterranean, visiting \n     Jordan, Syria, Israel, and Cyprus. The delegation, led by \n     Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat from Rhode Island and \n     Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Committee on Foreign \n     Relations, included Senator Charles S. Robb, Democrat from \n     Virginia and a Member of the Senate Committees on Foreign \n     Relations, Armed Services and Intelligence; and Senator James \n     Inhofe, Republican from Oklahoma and a Member of the Senate \n     Committees on Armed Services and Intelligence. We were \n     accompanied by Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff \n     members Edwin K. Hall (Minority Staff Director and Chief \n     Counsel), George A. Pickart (Minority Professional Staff \n     Member for the Near East and South Asia), and Peter M. \n     Cleveland (Minority Professional Staff Member for East Asia \n     and the Pacific) and by Jay C. Ghazal (Legislative Assistant \n     to Senator Pell for Defense Issues).\n       The purpose of the trip was to focus on the Middle East \n     peace process, including prospects for a successful \n     conclusion to the bilateral negotiations between Israel and \n     Syria, and the status of the implementation of Israel's peace \n     agreements with Jordan and the Palestinians. We also examined \n     the potential for a peaceful and negotiated settlement to the \n     conflict on Cyprus.\n       In Jordan the delegation met with His Majesty King Hussein \n     bin Talal, Her Majesty Queen Noor, and with newly-appointed \n     Foreign Minister Abdal Karim al-Kabariti; in Syria with \n     Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara and Vice President Abdal \n     Halim Khaddam; in Israel with Prime Minister Shimon Peres and \n     with representatives of the Israel Defense Forces on the \n     Golan Heights; in Gaza with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and \n     newly elected Palestinian Council members Haider Abdel Shafi, \n     Ziyad Abu Amer, and Riyad Zanoun; and in Cyprus with \n     President Glafcos Clerides, House President Alexis Galanos, \n     and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash. In addition, \n     Senators Robb and Inhofe, both members of the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence, met separately with U.S. \n     intelligence officials on matters pertaining to the region.\n       Our visit to the region coincided with a period of intense \n     activity with regard to the peace process and other matters:\n       On the day of our arrival in Israel, Prime Minister Shimon \n     Peres called for early elections in an effort to secure a \n     mandate for his peace negotiations with Syria;\n       Syria and Israel, fresh from a scheduled break in their \n     negotiations at Wye Plantation in Maryland, had just hosted a \n     shuttle visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher;\n       The Palestinians had just concluded elections for a chief \n     executive--a vote won overwhelmingly by PLO Chairman Yasser \n     Arafat--and an 88 member council;\n       On the day we traveled to Gaza, Israel had sealed its \n     borders with the Palestinian autonomous area for security \n     reasons, one of many closures since the onset of self-rule;\n       Israel and Jordan continued to work out arrangements to \n     implement their recent peace treaty, at the same time that \n     King Hussein exhibited a more aggressive posture towards \n     Iraq;\n       As Ankara grappled with forming a new government and as \n     Athens installed new leadership, tensions flared between \n     Turkey and Greece over an uninhabited Dodecanese islet, and a \n     visit by a high-level U.S. envoy to mediate over Cyprus was \n     cancelled.\n       We would like to commend the dedicated U.S. Foreign Service \n     personnel at the American Embassies in Jordan, Syria, Israel \n     and Cyprus, and at the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem, \n     for their assistance and support during our trip. In \n     particular, we would like to express our deep appreciation to \n     Ambassador Wesley W. Egan, Jr. and Deputy Political Counselor \n     Margot Sullivan in Amman; Ambassador Christopher W.S. Ross \n     and Political Officer Laurence Silverman in Damascus; \n     Ambassador Martin S. Indyk and Political Officer John Hall in \n     Tel Aviv; Consul General Edward G. Abington, Jr. and \n     Political Officer Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley in Jerusalem; \n     and Ambassador Richard A. Boucher and Political Officer John \n     Lister in Nicosia, for their special efforts to make our trip \n     a success.\n       We would also like to thank our military escort, Commander \n     Sean Fogarty (USN), as well as Commander Joe Malone (USN), \n     and YN1 Dwight Brisbane (USN) for their exceptional work in \n     support of the delegation.\n       This report attempts to present a snapshot of the \n     circumstances at the time of our visit. Our visit, it should \n     be noted, preceded the recent wave of terrorist bombings in \n     Israel, so the report does not address the bombings or their \n     potential impact--which undoubtedly will be quite significant \n     on the region and the prospects for peace. The views \n     expressed are our own, and do not necessarily reflect those \n     of the Senate Committees on Foreign Relations and Armed \n     Services, or the individual members thereof.\n           Sincerely,\n     Claiborne Pell.\n     Charles S. Robb.\n     James M. Inhofe.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n\n                    Israel-Syria Peace Negotiations\n\n       Peace talks between Israel and Syria resumed late last year \n     and showed signs of progress. Syrian and Israeli officials \n     report that serious discussions have taken place under U.S. \n     auspices at Wye Plantation in Maryland, and that the new \n     informal setting helped to produce greater flexibility from \n     both sides.\n       The parties may become distracted by early elections in \n     Israel and the presidential campaign in the United States, \n     which in turn may prevent them from reaching quick agreement \n     on a peace treaty. But officials from Israel and Syria say \n     substantive negotiations will continue for the foreseeable \n     future and assert that an agreement remains possible.\n       Notwithstanding the improvements in atmosphere, Syria and \n     Israel still have a tough road ahead in the negotiations:\n       The relationship between the two countries is plagued by \n     instinctual mistrust;\n       Difficult decisions remain to be made on security \n     arrangements on the Golan Heights (including the extent of \n     Israel s withdrawal, the dimensions of demilitarized zones, \n     and the possible presence of an international monitoring \n     force including U.S. troops) and on the fabric of the future \n     Israeli-Syrian relationship.\n       Syrians accept the inevitability of peace with Israel, but \n     appear uncertain of the terms, ill-prepared for a normal \n     relationship and reluctant to accept the concept of a warm \n     peace.\n\n\n                  Israeli-Palestinian Peace Agreements\n\n       Assuming the recent terrorist bombings in Israel do not \n     cause the peace process to unravel completely, the ``Oslo \n     II'' agreement between Israel and the Palestinians will set \n     the stage for the emergence of a permanent Palestinian \n     entity--which Palestinians see as their own state with East \n     Jerusalem as its capital, and which Israelis see as something \n     far short of that.\n       Palestinian officials, including PLO Chairman Yasser \n     Arafat, bristle at what they perceive to be ``unequal'' U.S. \n     treatment of Israel and the Palestinians, but acknowledge the \n     importance of their own commitments on security and wish to \n     be seen as working hard to prevent acts of violence and \n     terror against Israelis.\n       The Palestine National Council will have to decide whether \n     and how to amend the PLO Covenant, which still refers to the \n     destruction of Israel. Arafat clearly recognizes the need to \n     address the issue, but is not yet fully committed to changes \n     that will be as forthcoming and precise as Israel and others \n     would expect.\n       The Palestinians must develop and refine the institutional \n     basis for their experiment with self-rule. Recent elections \n     succeeded in creating an 88 member council, but council \n     members have yet to meet and seem to lack confidence about \n     their role in Palestinian society and their relationship with \n     Arafat--their powerful chief executive.\n\n\n                       Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty\n\n       Jordan and Israel are implementing their October 1994 peace \n     treaty with vigor and in good faith. As King Hussein stated, \n     ``The peace process is over. It's peace building now.''\n       In recent months, King Hussein has taken a new and \n     aggressive posture towards Iraq, granting asylum to two \n     highly-placed Iraqi defectors (who willingly returned to Iraq \n     after our visit and were subsequently murdered), calling for \n     greater coordination among Iraq's fractured opposition, and \n     talking about a federated Iraq. The King's statements and \n     actions present a challenge to Saddam Hussein and have \n     sparked the interest--not all positive--of other regional \n     powers such as Syria.\n\n\n                            Cyprus Conflict\n\n       The situation in Cyprus, which is closely connected to the \n     relationship between Greece and Turkey, remains jittery and \n     uncertain. The recent escalation of tensions between Ankara \n     and Athens over a small Dodecanese island underscores the \n     acute need to resolve differences between the Greek and \n     Turkish Cypriot leaders.\n       While some in the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities \n     appear willing to seek reconciliation, and even with the \n     broad outlines of a solution apparent for some time, a recent \n     attempt by the U.S. Administration to initiate a high-level \n     mission on Cyprus failed to take hold.\n       The United States stands ready to devote considerable \n     resources and energy to the problem, but the parties offer \n     few prescriptions for improving the current hostile climate. \n     The tendency of the Turkish Cypriot leadership to rehash old \n     grievances when discussing current problems suggests that the \n     impasse may remain for some time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1658-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1659-S1660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PRESIDENT'S DAY\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the Senate's \nattention a practice that has crept into our popular culture with \nlittle notice. This practice relates to the Federal holiday we observe \nevery year on the third\n\n[[Page S1660]]\n\nMonday in February. According to current Federal law, this holiday is \n``Washington's Birthday'' in honor of our great first President. In its \nde facto observance, however, this holiday has become known as \n``President's Day'' because of its proximity to the birthday of our \n16th President, Abraham Lincoln.\n  This matter was recently brought to my attention by the President of \nthe Society of the Cincinnati. The Society's concern is that by \ncombining the two holidays in popular observance, we dilute the \nremembrances of the gravity and importance of the achievements of both \nmen--one who fought to found our Nation and one who fought to preserve \nit. According to law, President Lincoln's birthday is observed on \nFebruary 12.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1659-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DRUGS AND YOUTH: THE CHALLENGES AHEAD\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last week retired Army General \nBarry McCaffrey was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to be this Nation's \nfifth drug czar. Perhaps the biggest, and most important, challenge \nfacing General McCaffrey is the emerging trend of increasing drug use \namong young people. A recent survey of students in the 8th, 10th and \n12th grades yielded some troubling results. According to the annual \nMonitoring the Future survey, drug use among secondary school students, \nparticularly marijuana, is on the increase. The nationwide study also \nfound that the use of LSD, stimulants, inhalants and hallucinogens also \nincreased, albeit not to the extent of marijuana use.\n  As a parent, perhaps the most troubling of the study's findings was \nthat which gauged the attitudes of young people regarding the risks of \ndrug use. The proportion of secondary school students who see drug use \nas dangerous continued to decline in 1995. The significance of this \nshould not be overlooked. In regard to the risk of drug use, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services found that 9 out of 10 adult \ncocaine users started using drugs as a teenager. The potential problem \nincreases when one considers that there are currently 39 million \nAmericans under the age of 10. Given these demographics, the actual \nnumber of teens using drugs will increase when these children reach \ntheir late teens and twenties, even if the percentage of users remains \nthe same as it is today. Failure to address these emerging attitudes, \nin addition to leading to increased youth drug use, may also lead to \nincreased crime and violence which often accompanies drug abuse.\n  In an effort to learn from the experiences of communities all across \nthe Nation and raise awareness about youth drug use and the violence, \nPresident Clinton has invited concerned individuals from all across the \nNation to a national summit which is taking place today in Greenbelt, \nMD. In addition several cities, including Milwaukee, will be joining \nthe summit by video teleconference. Wisconsin will be well represented \nboth in Greenbelt and Milwaukee.\n  Among those representing Wisconsin in Greenbelt is Capt. Charles \nTubbs of the Beloit Police Department. As head of the department's \ncommunity relations division, Captain Tubbs has gained national \nrecognition for his efforts in regard to gangs and school related \nviolence. His leadership has led to the development of many community \nbased initiatives which deal directly with the problems associated with \nyoung people.\n  Coordinating the Milwaukee site will be James Mosely, director of the \nMilwaukee-based, Fighting Back Initiative. This program draws upon many \nresources from throughout the community to deal directly with the \nproblems associated with drug and alcohol abuse in Milwaukee's north \nand southside communities.\n  The national summit presents an opportunity to learn about these \ncommunity based antidrug efforts as well as others from all across this \nNation. A great deal can be learned from the people in our cities and \ntowns who deal with these problems on a daily basis. A comprehensive \nantidrug policy must develop partnerships which build on the \nexperiences and needs of local communities.\n  One such partnership involving the Drug Enforcement Agency and law \nenforcement in northeastern Wisconsin recently resulted in a drug bust \ngarnering 40 pounds of marijuana with an estimated street value of \n$250,000. The officers of the Brown County Sheriff's Department, as \nwell as the DEA agents who lent a helping hand, deserve our respect and \nadmiration for their willingness to identify a problem and work \ntogether to solve it. We should learn from their example, and seek more \nco-operative efforts of this nature. I am pleased that General \nMcCaffrey has indicated that he intends to do just that.\n  In closing, Mr. President, Capt. Tubbs and James Mosely are just a \nfew examples of the hundreds of dedicated people all across our State \nwho are committed to helping young people lead better lives and in the \nprocess, making our communities better places to live. There can be \nlittle doubt that drug use, particularly among our young people, \npresents a danger and that finding the solution will require the \ndedication of each of us. As General McCaffrey acknowledged, solving \nthe drug problem will not occur overnight, it will take a determined \nand consistent effort over a number of years. Building on the good work \nand experiences of people like Charles Tubbs and James Mosely is a good \nplace to start.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1660-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO BRIAN KLINEFELTER, SLAIN POLICE OFFICER\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a very \nbrave man, to police officer Brian Klinefelter who sacrificed his life \non January 29, 1996, in the line of duty. He was shot to death when he \napproached three robbery suspects whom he had pulled over on a dark \ncounty road. Backup was only 2 minutes away, and his shift had ended \nabout 15 minutes before the incident occurred.\n  It is a tragedy when any policeman falls in the line of duty. \nHowever, this occurred in St. Joseph, a small town were officer Brian \nKlinefelter was known by most on a first-name basis. Admired by young \nand old, his untimely death had an immediate impact on this close-knit, \ncentral Minnesota community.\n  As a small boy, Brian Klinefelter had always dreamed of becoming a \npolice officer. He was a 1988 graduate of Apollo High School where he \nplayed football and he received his police training at Alexandria \nTechnical College. He had been a policeman with the six member St. \nJoseph Police for 2\\1/2\\ years, and he had proudly built his career on \ndedication and commitment. At the age of 25 he was nominated for the \ntop award of Officer of the Year after talking an armed gunman into \nsurrendering in August, 1995.\n  Brian's death was especially hard for the citizens of St. Joseph \nbecause it was the first death of a policeman and the first in the St. \nCloud area in more than 57 years. His slaying marked the 178th death of \na peace officer in the line of duty in Minnesota in the past 114 years. \nOver 2,200 people attended his funeral, including over 1,600 law \nofficers with a stream of more than 500 squad cars from the Midwest and \nCanada.\n  Friends and colleagues remember Brian as a very caring person with a \nbig heart who loved being a law enforcement officer. He was a devoted \nand loving husband, a wonderful father, a caring and beloved son, a \ngenerous and loving brother, a loyal friend, and a fine policeman who \ndedicated his life to defending the peace. As we honor him, I want to \nshare with you a part of his family's memories, ``Brian's love and \ndedication to his profession should serve as a model for everyone in \ntheir lives.''\n  I extend my deepest, heartfelt sympathy to his devoted wife, Wendy \nand his baby daughter Katelyn, and his parents, siblings, and fellow \nofficers. Officer Brian Klinefelter leaves a rich legacy of protecting \nthe lives and property of his fellow citizens, and we will never forget \nthis gallant man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/07/senate-section/article/S1660-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1660-S1661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MARCH 11, 1996\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
