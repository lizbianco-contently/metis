That will start as soon as we can. \nThere is no time limit on the resolution; however, we hope we will be \nable to dispose of this resolution after a reasonable amount of debate.\n  Following the disposition of Senate Resolution 199, there are a \nnumber of possible items for consideration. We would like to complete \naction on House Joint Resolution 132. The Democratic leader objected to \nits consideration last night but indicated in a positive way that, if \nwe could make one change and clear one other bill, we could probably \npass that today. I assume there will be a request for a rollcall. It \nwill have to go back to the House where I assume they would take the \nSenate amendment and send it on to the President.\n\n  A cloture vote could occur on the motion to proceed to Labor-HHS \nappropriations. It is my hope we will get a continuing resolution today \nfrom the House. I am not certain what the length would be, but it could \ngo until Friday, or it could go until next Tuesday or Wednesday--\nprobably until Friday.\n  We still have three appropriations bills: D.C. appropriations, \nforeign ops, and Labor-HHS, which we are unable to bring to the floor \nbecause of opposition on the other side.\n  So, there could be rollcall votes throughout the day. Let me indicate \nthat it seems to me we ought to make a decision here that we stop the \nlegislative business no later than Friday of this week. It is going to \nbe difficult for those of us involved in budget negotiations if there \nis legislation every day in the next week. It is my hope we can \ncomplete action on a budget agreement Friday or Saturday of this week \nand that only the principals might have to return next week.\n  In any event, I ask staff and others to determine if that is a \npossibility, to say--of course, we are at a point now where any one \nSenator can object to anything and it will not come up unless you have \nunanimous consent or unless it is privileged. So I hope we could take a \nlook at that.\n  I would just say, one thing we have agreed to--I think it is fair to \nstate this--is if we do reach an agreement on sort of the format, \nframework, and scheduling, there will not be press conferences. There \nwill be a news blackout, unless there is an agreement at the end of \neach day to issue a joint press statement. I think that has been part \nof the problem. There have been so many press conferences, so many \npeople reacting to other people that it makes it difficult to proceed. \nSo, hopefully we can work that out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/20/senate-section/article/S18935-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18935-S18937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 132\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne).

Mr. President, my hometown of Tuscumbia, AL is in the \nmidst of celebrating a very special day in its history. On December 20, \n1820--175 years ago--Tuscumbia was officially declared to be a city in \nthe State of Alabama. Hers is a rich and colorful history, steeped in \nthe tradition and development of Alabama and of the Nation.\n  Tuscumbia's recorded story is, first, one of French settlers, who as \nfar back as 1780 established a trading post on Cold Water Creek near \nthe Tennessee River about 1 mile from the present-day northern city \nlimit. This creek, which runs through Tuscumbia, is the outlet for the \nimmense spring which rises from the ground near the center of the city. \nIt had probably been a center of Indian activity for many centuries \nprior to that.\n  When the French colony was established, Nashville, TN was the most \nimportant American trading station in what was then the southwestern \nUnited States. Nashville and the settlements to its south were \nfrequently subjected to hostile incursions by Indians stirred up by the \nFrench.\n  In 1787, Col. James Robertson organized an expedition, marching south \nand across the shoals of the Tennessee River where he found the Indian \nvillage near the mouth of Cold Water Creek. The Indians and their \nFrench allies retreated a short distance up the creek to where \nTuscumbia is located and here Col. Robertson attacked and defeated \nthem, capturing the trading post and a large quantity of supplies.\n  In March 1817, Congress passed an act establishing the Territory of \nAlabama. The town was first surveyed and laid out as a city by Gen. \nCoffee that same year, 1817. When the territorial legislature assembled \nat Huntsville in October 1819, a bill was passed incorporating the town \nof ``Ococopoosa,'' which means ``cold water.'' At another session of \nthe territorial legislature a few months later, the name of the town \nwas changed to Big Spring, and on December 20, 1820, the legislature of \nthe new State of Alabama officially incorporated it as a town. The name \nwas changed on December 31, 1822 to Tuscumbia, after a celebrated chief \nof the Chickasaw Indians who had befriended the Dickson family, the \nfirst American settlers who arrived in 1815.\n  When Tuscumbia was established, the Tennessee River was navigable \nfrom the Ohio River until it reached the shoals near Tuscumbia. The \nshoals extended to nearby Decatur, where the Tennessee River again \nbecame navigable up into the State of Tennessee. About this time, a new \nenterprise known as the railroad became commercially viable in the \nUnited States.\n  The very first railroad to be built west of the Allegheny mountains \nwas one that connected Tuscumbia to the Tennessee River. It was \ncompleted in 1832, 2\\1/8\\ miles long. In 1834, the Tuscumbia, \nCourtland, and Decatur Railroad was built in order to serve as a \nconnecting link between the 2 portions of navigable waters of the \nTennessee River. Over the next 25 years, there was an enormous amount \nof trade with New Orleans by water. Magnificent steamers, some of them \ncarrying as much as 6,000 bales of cotton, glided up and down the \nrivers. Some of these ships were palatial in their accommodations and \nfurnishings. Excursions on one of these elegant boats to the Crescent \nCity were very popular. Other steamers ran to cities along the Ohio \nRiver and to St. Louis. River traffic became less popular around 1857, \nwhen the Memphis and Charleston Railroad was connected with the \nTuscumbia, Courtland, and Decatur Railroad.\n  Until completion of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, the \nTuscumbia Post Office was a major distributing office, and probably the \nlargest and most important one between Nashville and New Orleans. A \nnumber of State lines converged here.\n  Tuscumbia's story is also a tragic one of war and destruction. During \nthe War Between the States from 1861 to 1865, there were few areas of \nthe South more completely devastated than the beautiful Tennessee \nValley. Tuscumbia was at the center of the fiery track of the armies of \nboth sides. Large blocks of brick stores and many private homes were \ndestroyed and condemned. Cavalry horses roamed at will through grounds \nthat were the pride of their owners.\n  Americans have, thankfully, rarely experienced the infliction from an \nenemy army's occupation. But the people of the Tennessee Valley area, \nincluding Tuscumbia, during the time of the Civil War were all-too-\nfamiliar with looting, burning, and other atrocities. In her book 200 \nYears at Muscle Shoals, Nina Leftwich recalls some of the conditions \nthese citizens faced. The following passage appears in her historical \nwritings:\n\n       The story of the wrongs inflicted upon the defenseless \n     citizens of Tuscumbia during the occupation by the Federals \n     is best told by an account of it written by Mr. L.B. Thornton \n     [the editor of the local newspaper] soon after it occurred:\n       ``The Federal army first made its appearance in Tuscumbia \n     on the 16th of April 1862 under General Mitchell . . . They \n     broke open nearly every store in the town, and robbed them of \n     everything they wanted, arrested a great many peaceable \n     citizens, forcing some to take the oath of allegiance to the \n     U.S. government, robbed the masonic hall of its jewels and \n     maps, and broke open and destroyed the safes in the stores \n     and offices. They destroyed my office by breaking my desk and \n     book cases, and destroying the papers, and took them from my \n     office 30 maps of the state of Alabama . . .\n       ``Ladies could not safely go out of their houses. Citizens \n     were arrested and held in confinement, or sent off to the \n     North, in many cases without any charge being made against \n     them, and the citizens were not permitted to meet on the \n     streets and converse together. Person nor property was safe \n     from the soldiers. They took from private citizens whatever \n     they wanted--hogs, sheep, cattle of every kind, vegetables, \n     corn, potatoes, fowl of every description . . . When they \n     evacuated the town, they set fire to it in 4 or 5 different \n     places * * *''\n\n  More than 30 of Tuscumbia's brave young men were killed during the \nwar, and for years after the sound of battle had died away, the town \nsat on the ashes of desolation, waiting for a brighter day to dawn. \nThat day did come when the industrial city of Sheffield was founded, \nbringing jobs and trade to Tuscumbia.\n  Colbert County was established on February 6, 1867, when it was \nseparated from Franklin County, one of the original Alabama counties. \nLater that same year, the county was abolished by the Constitutional \nConvention. After Alabama was readmitted to the Union in 1868, the new \ngovernment reestablished Colbert County. This new county need a county \nseat, and on March 7, 1870, an election was held to determine if \nTuscumbia or Cherokee would be the permanent county seat. Tuscumbia won \nby a vote of 1367 to 794.\n  Writing in 1888, Capt. Arthur Henley Keller, who authored the book \nHistory of Tuscumbia, Alabama, described Tuscumbia as having ``caught \nthe contagion of progress and enterprise, and within the last 2 years \nhas doubled her population. Observant and far-seeing men recognize the \nfact that she has every natural advantage that any other place in \nNorthern Alabama has, and that which money can never secure. Her \nsociety is as good as can be found anywhere. She has churches of all \ndenominations and first-rate schools. The Deshler Female Institute \nstands in the front rank of Southern schools. It stands as a monument \nto the memory of Brigadier Gen. James Deshler, of Tuscumbia, who was \nkilled at the battle of Chickamauga.''\n\n  The story of Tuscumbia is that of leaders like Robert Burns Lindsay, \nwho served as Governor of Alabama in the early years of the 1870's, \nwhich were difficult years of Reconstruction. He opposed secession, \nalong with most of the residents of north Alabama, but after Alabama's \nordinance of secession was enacted, he remained loyal to his adopted \nstate.\n  In 1870, Lindsay was elected Governor of Alabama. His leadership was \nimportant during those tough Reconstruction years and he fought \nmightily to end that difficult era of occupation.\n  Governor Lindsay and his wife Sarah had a daughter named Maud \nMcKnight Lindsay. She attended Deshler Female Institute and received \nkindergarten training. She went on to teach kindergarten in Tuscumbia \nand served as the principal of the Florence Free Kindergarten, the \nfirst free kindergarten in Alabama. She became a great leader in the \ncause of educating young children and was the author of many childrens' \nbooks. She passed away in 1941.\n  No history of Tuscumbia would be complete without the story of Helen \nKeller, who was born at Ivy Green in \n\n[[Page S18937]]\n1880. In fact, the Keller family first settled in Tuscumbia around the \ntime of its founding in 1820. Her grandfather was very involved in the \nrailroad development. His son was Captain Arthur Henley Keller, a \ncolorful confederate soldier, lawyer, and newspaper editor who wrote \nthe history from which I quoted earlier. Capt. Keller was Helen's \nfather.\n  When she was only 19 months old, she suffered acute congestion of the \nstomach and brain which left her deaf and blind. It was right behind \nthe main house at Ivy Green at the water pump that Helen Keller, under \nthe tutelage of her teacher Anne Sullivan, first learned that every \nobject had a name. The word ``w-a-t-e-r'' was the first one she \nunderstood, but ``teacher'' became the most important word in her life.\n  Tuscumbia native Helen Keller contributed so much in her lifetime as \nan educator, author, and advocate for the disabled. She furthered the \ncause of improving education and general conditions for the handicapped \nand disabled around the world. During World War II, she visited the \nsick and wounded in military hospitals. Today, Ivy Green is host to an \nannual weekend festival celebrating the life and accomplishments of the \n``First Lady of Courage.'' Thousands of people from all across the \nworld pay visits to see where Helen Keller lived as a child and where \nshe learned to overcome obstacles to become an inspiring heroine. Each \nsummer, thousands also attend live performances of the play ``The \nMiracle Worker.'' This most famous daughter of Tuscumbia is a symbol of \nhope to those around the world who have ever doubted their ability to \npersevere and achieve. She passed away in 1968.\n  An integral part of the story of Tuscumbia is the founding of the \nTennessee Valley Authority, one of the great achievements of the New \nDeal. Congress created TVA in 1933 and gave it the overall goal of \nconserving the resources of the valley region. Congress also directed \nTVA to speed the region's economic development and, in case of war, to \nuse the Tennessee Valley's resources for national defense. It provided \nmany much-needed jobs during the dark years of the Great Depression and \ncontributed to our military success during World War II.\n  Congress established TVA after many years of debate on how to use the \nFederal Ggovernment's two nitrate plants and Wilson Dam at Muscle \nShoals. During the ensuing 62 years, TVA has built dams to control \nfloods, create electrical power, and deepen rivers for shipping. It has \nplanted new forests and preserved existing ones, led the development of \nnew fertilizers, and is now involved in solving the nation's \nenvironmental problems. The lakes created by damming the Tennessee \nRiver and its branches add to the beauty of our region. Besides \nproviding electrical power, water recreation, and navigable waterways, \nTVA has been a major contributor in the economic growth and development \nof this area and all of north Alabama.\n  Attracted by TVA electrical power, Reynolds Metals Co. was located at \nListerhill, AL, and for more than 50 years, many Tuscumbians have been \nprovided jobs there. During a somewhat similar period, the Robbins \nplants located in Tuscumbia have impacted the economy of the city and \nregion.\n  During a very crucial period in the development of the Tennessee \nValley, the northern part of Alabama was represented in Congress by a \nTuscumbian, the Hon. Edward B. Almon. He was elected in 1914 and was \nvery much involved in the congressional authorizations for Wilson Dam \nand the two government nitrate plants. He played an important role in \npassing the National Defense Act of 1916, which was highly instrumental \nin the development of this area. He was the Congressman when the TVA \nwas created. He died a short time after the TVA act was signed into \nlaw, and was succeeded by another Tuscumbian, Archibald Hill \nCarmichael. He served during the most formative years of the Roosevelt \nera.\n  Earlier, I mentioned Brig. Gen. James Deshler, for whom Deshler \nFemale Institute was named and whose name our high school bears. I \nshould also mention that his father, Maj. David Deshler, played an \nimportant role in the development of Tuscumbia, particularly with \nregard to the railroads.\n  The name of Gen. John Daniel Rather is also indelibly etched into the \nrailroad history of Tuscumbia. He served as a director and officer of \nthe Memphis and Charleston Railroad. While he was its president, it was \nmerged with the East Tennessee, Virginia, and Georgia Railroad to \nbecome the Southern Railway System.\n  Tremendous contributions to the State's educational system came from \n2 Tuscumbians, Dr. George Washington Trenholm and his son, Dr. Harper \nCouncill Trenholm. And no history of Tuscumbia would be complete \nwithout mentioning Heinie Manush, a professional baseball player who \nwas the first Alabamian to be enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame at \nCooperstown, NY. He compiled a life-time batting average of .330.\n  I hope the celebrations and events over the last 3 weeks have brought \nTuscumbians a better understanding of the city and area's history. As \nthe 175th birthday of our beloved Tuscumbia comes to a close, and as we \nstart speeding toward her 200th anniversary in the year 2020, I hope \nthat each resident will take a moment to reflect upon how blessed they \nare to be from there.\n  I think back upon my life and career there and cannot imagine them \nhaving been anywhere else. It is a progressive little city that has \nchanged a great deal over the years, but it is also one that has always \nretained its small-town charm and the many qualities that make it such \na unique place to live. Since her birthday 175 years ago, Tuscumbia has \naged gracefully and improved with time. As I said back in March when I \nannounced my retirement from the Senate, I will enjoy the remainder of \nmy days in my hometown after I retire, for Tuscumbia is a wonderful \nlittle town to be from and the best little town in America to go home \nto. I wish Tuscumbia a happy birthday and look forward to enjoying many \nmore with her well into the next century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/20/senate-section/article/S18935-5", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN.

Mr. President, we are now in the second Government \nshutdown of the year. This is the second one we have had in a month.\n  There have been many Government shutdowns in the past. In fact, I \nhave been here in the Senate during some of those. But the shutdowns of \nthis year seem very different than previous ones.\n  Prior to this Congress, the shutdowns of Government were short, and \nthey were generally regretted by the congressional leaders. And, even \nwhen the Congress and the President continued to be at odds, those \ninvolved were eager to pass continuing resolutions to restart the \nGovernment and maintain basic services.\n  In this Congress we have a very different situation. In this \nCongress, the shutdowns are longer, and the Republican leadership in \nCongress sees the shutdown and the maintenance of the shutdown as an \nessential part of their strategy to gain leverage on the President in \ntheir negotiations with him about major policy issues.\n  Monday morning, when I was reading the Wall Street Journal, I saw a \nstatement in the front page article. The statement was from Speaker \nGingrich. In reading that, I gained an insight into how we arrived at \nthis year's shutdowns, and why these shutdowns are so different from \nthose of the past.\n  The paper describes the strategy that Speaker Gingrich devised to get \nhis way in disagreements with the President. I will quote very briefly \nfrom that article.\n\n[[Page S18938]]\n\n  ``He''--that is Speaker Gingrich--``would need to make heavy use of \nthe only weapon at his disposal that could possibly match President \nClinton's veto: The power of the purse.''\n  Here is a quote from the Speaker.\n  ```That's the key strategic decision made on election night a year \nago,' Mr. Gingrich says. `If you are going to operate with his veto \nbeing the ultimate trump, you have to operate within a very narrow \nrange of change . . . You had to find a trump to match his trump. And \nthe right not to pass money bills is the only trump that is equally \nstrong.'''\n\n  Mr. President, I want to focus people's attention on this phrase \n``the right not to pass money bills.'' The Speaker talks about this \nright, this so-called right. The obvious question is whether this is an \nappropriate and an acceptable trump for the Presidential veto, as the \nSpeaker seems to believe, or whether, on the contrary, it is an abuse \nof power, whether it is a proper use of the power vested in the \ncongressional majority under the Constitution, or whether it is a \nperversion or destruction of the delicate system of checks and balances \nset out by the Framers of the Constitution.\n  I have done my best to analyze the Constitution in light of the \nSpeaker's remarks, and it is my conclusion that the refusal to maintain \nfunding for basic Government services is, in fact, an abuse of the \npower granted by the people to the Congress and the Constitution. I \nwould like to take a few minutes to explain that reason.\n  The Founding Fathers set up a very delicate system of checks and \nbalances. In article I, Congress is given authority to make laws in a \nwide range of areas. For instance, Congress is given exclusive \nauthority to appropriate money.\n  Article I, section 9, reads:\n\n       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     consequence of appropriations made by law.\n\n  The Framers recognized the need to have a check on irresponsible \nlegislation by the Congress and they gave the President the power to \nveto.\n  Article I, section 7 contains that power. It says:\n\n       Every bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a law \n     . . . be presented to the President of the United States; if \n     he approve, he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it. \n     . . .\n\n  Clearly, when there would be a disagreement between the Congress and \nthe President, the Framers of the Constitution wanted to provide a \nmethod for reconciling the differences, and in this language, this \nlanguage describing the veto, they established a procedure to determine \nwhich side should prevail. When in disagreement with the Congress, the \nPresident would veto the bill and return it to Congress. If no \nagreement were reached, the Congress could pass the bill again, and if \nthey had the votes, the two-thirds votes in each House to override the \nPresident's veto, the bill would become law.\n  This system of checks and balances has served us reasonably well for \n206 years, with both the Congress and the President generally agreeing \nto abide by the procedures set out in the Constitution. There was one \nmajor departure, and that was with the action by President Nixon to \nimpound funds which the Congress had appropriated for spending. In that \ncase, the final determination was that the President had, in fact, \nabused his power, that appropriations legally made and passed, in some \ncases over the veto of the President, prevailed over the contrary \ndesire of the President to get his way. And just as the President in \nthat case abused his power under the Constitution when he impounded \nfunds that were legally appropriated over his objection, I believe that \nby shutting down Government services and maintaining those services \nshut down in order to gain leverage with the President on larger policy \nissues, the Congress is similarly abusing its authority under the \nConstitution.\n  Those who wrote the Constitution were focused on how to resolve \nlegislative differences between the Congress and the President. The \nSupreme Court has recognized this focus of the Founding Fathers. Mr. \nJustice Jackson in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Ccompany versus Sawyer \nstated:\n\n       While the Constitution diffuses power the better to secure \n     liberty, it also contemplates that practice will integrate \n     the dispersed powers into a workable Government. It enjoins \n     upon its branches separateness but interdependence, autonomy \n     but reciprocity. 343 U.S. 579,635 (1952).\n\n  The Founders of the country assumed that the failure of the President \nto sign legislation or the failure of Congress to enact legislation \nwould be based on specific disagreements on what that legislation \nshould contain, not on the desire of either the Congress or the \nPresident to extort concessions from the other on basic policy \ndifferences.\n  Mr. President, I use the word ``extort'' here because I believe it \nactively describes the current situation. The dictionary defines \n``extort'' as ``to wrest or wring from a person by violence, \nintimidation or abuse of authority.''\n\n  I believe we have an attempt here to wrest or wring concessions from \nthe President by abuse of authority. Mr. Gingrich talks about Congress' \nso-called right not to pass money bills--in other words, the right to \nshut down the Government to get his way in disagreements with the \nPresident. He is not just asserting his right to disagree with the \nPresident on spending levels or levels of taxation. He is not just \nasserting the right to pass legislation reflecting his view of what is \nthe right level of spending or taxation. He is not just asserting the \nCongress' right to pass those laws again over the President's veto if \nthe disagreement continues.\n  No, here the Speaker's position goes well beyond the constitutional \nframework for resolving disagreements between the Congress and the \nPresident. Here we have Mr. Gingrich's majority in Congress arguing for \nmajor changes in authorizing legislation in Medicare, in Medicaid, and \nin numerous other areas of policy in seeking to get its way by, in \nfact, refusing to fund the Government itself, the entire Government or \nwhat is left of the Government to be funded, if the President does not \nbow to their wishes--not just refusing to fund the portion of the \nGovernment that the President wants to fund and the majority wants to \ndefund but refusing to fund other broadly supported areas of Government \nactivity.\n  This abuse of power or extorting of concessions from the President by \nrefusing to maintain the basic services of Government is not part of \nthe checks and balances that the Framers of the Constitution \nenvisioned. They assumed that the maintenance of Government activities \nwhich both the Congress and the President deemed to be worthwhile would \nbe supported by mutual consent of the two branches of Government. They \ndid not anticipate that one branch would be willing to kill its own \nchildren unless the other branch agreed to give ground on policy \ndisputes.\n  The obvious question is whether in fact this so-called right not to \npass money bills is the ultimate trump or even the best trump. I \nsuggest it is not. I suggest that the Founding Fathers put one more \ntrump in this delicate balance of Government structure, and that is the \ntrump of the people's vote every 2 years.\n  Abuse of power is always possible in politics and government, and the \nFramers of our Constitution were more keenly aware of the danger than \nany of us. In fact, the entire Constitution was written in reaction to \nthe very abusive power which they suffered at the hands of the British \nmonarchy.\n\n  For that very reason, they provided what is literally the ultimate--\nand certainly the best--trump, the right of the people to express their \nwill every 2 years on who comprises the House of Representatives and on \nwho holds one-third of the seats in the Senate.\n  Article I, section 2, and article I, section 3, set out that the \nHouse of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every 2 \nyears and that a third of the Senate shall be elected every 2 years.\n  Time will tell whether the people of the country decide to use that \nultimate trump to remedy what appears to me to be a clear abuse of the \npower granted by the people to the Congress by way of the Constitution. \nUntil that time, this extortion, this abuse of power, should stop. It \nshould stop today.\n  Today we should pass a continuing resolution to bring the Government \nback to full operation. Today we should pass a continuing resolution \nfor a period long enough to allow careful negotiation on the budget and \nserious negotiation on the budget, not for the \n\n[[Page S18939]]\n2 or 3 days for which we were just advised by the majority leader we \nare likely to be passing a continuing resolution.\n  And today we should resolve that the power not to pass money bills, \nwhich the Congress clearly has--and I do not dispute that Congress has \nthat power, but that power should never become or never be seen as a \nright not to pass money bills, as Mr. Gingrich asserts. Today we should \nfully restore the checks and balances between the President and the \nCongress which the Constitution of the United States contemplated at \nthe time of the founding of the Republic.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I regret that we find ourselves here \ntoday. I must say that I believe my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, has \nmade every reasonable effort to see if we could resolve this problem. \nAnd, indeed, in the past we have been able to resolve many of the \noutstanding issues with our professional staff and counsel working \ntogether--even some that might be considered contentious. I believe \nthis one is beyond the control of my friend and colleague on the other \nside. We have made every reasonable effort to attempt to settle this \nmatter. That is a question of the enforcement of a subpoena on Mr. \nKennedy for his notes--William Kennedy was formerly associated with the \nRose law firm, former associate counsel in the White House--regarding a \nmeeting of November 3, 1993.\n  I summarize that because it is well known. To go over every single \naspect of it, I think, would draw this out unnecessarily.\n  It was but a short time ago that my colleague and friend, Senator \nSarbanes, requested that I speak to Chairman Leach in the House of \nRepresentatives in regard to an offer that was made, apparently, to the \nSpeaker in regard to a possible settlement of the manner in which to \nproduce these notes. Let me first say that I find the conduct of the \nWhite House to be absolutely one based upon delay and obfuscation--\ndelay, delay, delay, delay, delay.\n  Let me tell you, with some specificity, what I am talking about. We \nasked for this information, and information was covered going back to \nAugust. We had numerous conferences with the White House with regard to \nnot only this, but all of the relevant information. Throughout these \nproceedings, we have had the continued posture, publicly, of \ncooperation and, yet, when it came to producing relevant material \nevidence that goes to the heart of the matter, we have had delay.\n\n  This is not the first time. Only when the issuance, or the threat of \nthe issuance, of a subpoena and bringing this public would we get \ncooperation--in numerous instances. But this one takes the cake. Let me \ntell you why. Because after our August 25 request, ensuing meetings \ntook place in September, October, and November. On November 2, it gets \ndown to specificity as it relates to these notes of Mr. Kennedy. \nNovember 2. Here we are now in December. It comes to the issue of \nprivilege for the first time and, remember, this is the same \nadministration, and these people are working for the same President, \nwho says, ``I will go to great lengths, and I cannot imagine raising \nthe issue of privilege.'' And privilege is raised.\n  Now, clearly, in looking at the legislative history of the Congress \nof the United States as it relates to the Executive, there has never \nbeen an instance where a committee, in its capacity of investigating, \nhas been turned down or has the claim of privilege succeeded in \nthwarting that committee's request for documents. Never. There is a \nhistory on that. Clearly, bringing up the issue of privilege in this \ncase is very, very doubtful, very, very tenuous. But I suggest, Mr. \nPresident, it flies in the face of what Mr. Clinton, the President of \nthe United States, promised and said publicly: ``We will cooperate.'' \nWhat sense is it if you have 50,000 pages of documents? You can give us \nthe Federal Registry. So what? You can give us a million pages. But \nwhen it comes to the relevant information that we request, there is \nrepeated delay, delay, obfuscation.\n  That is what we have had to deal with. This is a perfect example. \nOnly when we say that we would vote these subpoenas, move this, do we \nbegin to get any kind of response. Let me say that it is absolutely \ndisingenuous, it is wrong, and it is a contrivance for the White House \nto say that it has offered us conditions by which to accept this \nagreement. The fact of the matter is, those conditions that they have \nadded to it are over and above what was reasonable, and that back on \nNovember 2--again, almost 6 weeks ago--we said to them, ``You do not \nhave to concede anything. Give us the information and indeed it will \nnot be deemed a waiver.'' So we offered that to them.\n  The whole month of November goes by, right up until the recess this \ntime, and delay, delay, delay. They come back and they say, ``Oh, by \nthe way, we will be willing, if you will agree that this is not a \nwaiver of privilege, first, and then attach other conditions--\nconditions to say that we, the Senate, should get approval from other \nbodies.''\n  Now, I do not have any objection and, indeed, would suggest and \nrecommend that other bodies have no reason--be they my colleagues in \nthe House or investigatory bodies, or the independent counsel--to go \nalong with this. But to make this public and then to claim that they \nhave conceded something that we offered weeks ago is wrong. Spin \ndoctors. They are very good at this spinning.\n  In an effort, just a little less than an hour ago, to come about some \nkind of suggestion, some kind of resolve of this matter, my friend and \ncolleagues suggested that I reach out to Chairman Leach, chairman of \nthe House Banking Committee, which is also conducting its investigation \ninto the matter known as Whitewater/Madison, and related matters.\n  I said that I would, and I did. I have seen now for the first time a \nletter of response or a letter from Chairman Leach to Speaker Gingrich. \nI do not know if my friend and colleague has a copy of this letter. I \nwill make a copy available. We just received this by fax at 10:30. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the complete letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n \n[[Page S18940]]\n\n                                          Committee on Banking and\n\n\n                                           Financial Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Speaker, Office of the Speaker,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: I have reviewed the letter of December \n     18, 1995, to you from Jack Quinn, Counsel to the President.\n       Committees of the Congress may from time to time consider \n     entering arrangements of one kind or another with the White \n     House. However, House determinations should not be contingent \n     on Senate agreement or vice versa.\n       What the White House is attempting to do in this instance \n     is position the House of Representatives--and particularly \n     the Committee on Banking and Financial Services and the \n     Committee on Government Reform and Oversight--in opposition \n     to the Senate and the Independent Counsel. This is a \n     circumstance we should prudently avoid.\n       In his cover letter Mr. Quinn suggests that ``our interest \n     is not in maintaining the confidentiality of the notes, but \n     rather in ensuring that the disclosure of the notes not be \n     deemed to waive the President's right to confidentiality with \n     respect to other communications on the same subject covered \n     in the notes.'' In the letter of December 14, 1995, from Ms. \n     Jane Sherburne to Mr. Michael Chertoff it is noted that ``our \n     concern about disclosing the Kennedy notes has not had to do \n     with the notes themselves, but instead the possibility that \n     disclosure would result in an argument that there had been a \n     waiver (in whole or in part) of the President's privileged \n     relationship with counsel.''\n       It is my view that while these may be credible concerns for \n     the Counsel to the President to raise, they are inconsistent \n     with the objectives of the Congress concerning full and \n     complete disclosure in this matter. Just as the White House \n     is concerned with precedent from its perspective, so must \n     Congress be for its oversight prerogatives.\n       To my knowledge, this request by the White House of the \n     House for a commitment relative to a Senate request is \n     unprecedented. It underscores the gravity of the issues at \n     stake and hints at White House concerns that a new path of \n     inquiry could be opened by the information transferred. In \n     this context, what the White House is inappropriately \n     attempting to do is hamstring one congressional body by \n     holding hostage documents subject to a constraining agreement \n     by the other body.\n       What appears to be at issue with regard to the requested \n     documentation is that there may have been a transfer of \n     confidential law enforcement information related to an \n     investigation touching on an office holder to outside \n     attorneys representing the office holder in his personal \n     capacity. The then House Committee on Banking, Housing and \n     Urban Affairs was assured in 1994 that such disclosure did \n     not occur and would not be appropriate. In this regard, for \n     example, Bernard Nussbaum, former White House Counsel, \n     testified that he had on his staff at the White House Neil \n     Eggleston and Bruce Lindsey, both of whom attended the \n     meeting the notes for which are at issue. Under oath Nussbaum \n     stated that Lindsey and Eggleston ``would not release \n     confidential information which they received in the course of \n     [their] official capacities to anyone outside the White House \n     for any improper purpose, or for any purpose.''\n       The White House's reluctance to turn over the requested \n     documents may cast doubt on the accuracy of this and similar \n     testimony by other White House officials before a committee \n     of the House of Representatives.\n       On process grounds, I have sought to be as deferential as \n     prudently possible to the White House, but with each new \n     revelation, some of which if viewed in isolation might seem \n     relatively inconsequential, the evidence of a consistent \n     pattern of delay and obfuscation is clearly emerging.\n       Accordingly, my advice is that a respectful letter be sent \n     to Mr. Quinn denying his request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James A. Leach,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me read part of the letter. I made \nthat call because if there was an attempt to settle this and we could \nget the documents--let me start by saying this: If we are given the \ndocuments at any time--any time; at any time--why, we will cease and \nsuspend. It is not necessary to go forward. We are asking the Secretary \nor the Senate legal counsel to seek enforcement of this subpoena, \nwhether after the vote, prior to the vote--whatever.\n  Let me suggest that the White House and the President has it within \nhis discretion and within his hands to deliver those documents to us. \nWe could end it tomorrow. If people say you are unnecessarily going \nforward--no, it is because we have had nothing but delay, delay, \nconditions that we have not been able to accept. We have had a rebuttal \nof our efforts going back to November 2 when we offered to say we will \nput aside the question of privilege, you have not waived it. Yet it is \nat the last moment when we finally say we will vote to issue a subpoena \nthat they come forth with what I consider to be another tactic of \ndelay.\n  Let me read part of Chairman Leach's letter:\n\n       What appears to be at issue with regard to the requested \n     documentation is that there may have been a transfer of \n     confidential law enforcement information related to an \n     investigation touching on an office holder to outside \n     attorneys representing the office holder in his personnel \n     capacity. The then House Committee on Banking, Housing and \n     Urban Affairs was assured in 1994 that such disclosure did \n     not occur and would not be appropriate. In this regard, for \n     example, Bernard Nussbaum, former White House counsel, \n     testified that he had on his staff at the White House, Neil \n     Eggleston and Bruce Lindsey, both of whom attended the \n     meeting the notes for which are at issue. Under oath Nussbaum \n     stated that Lindsey and Eggleston ``would not release \n     confidential information which they received in the course of \n     [their] official capacities to anyone outside the White House \n     for any improper purpose, or for any purpose.''\n\n  I have a copy of a hearing before the Committee on Banking, Finance \nand Urban Affairs, dated July 28, 1994, page 18. Chairman Leach \nfurnished this to me, again by fax at 10:32, less than half an hour \nago.\n  Mr. Nussbaum's testimony:\n\n       On my staff, I had a number of very experienced people, \n     Congressman. I had Cliff Sloan, who was a former assistant \n     solicitor general, a partner in a distinguished law firm. I \n     had Neil Eggleston, a former assistant U.S. attorney in the \n     Southern District of New York and an experienced \n     litigator, Bruce Lindsey, who is on the White House staff \n     is a lawyer of high competence and high integrity. I \n     didn't feel it necessary to issue those kind of \n     instructions to those people.\n       I knew and I still know to this day that those people would \n     not release confidential information which they received in \n     the course of our official capacities to anyone outside the \n     White House for any improper purpose, or for any purpose.\n\n  A letter that Chairman Leach sent to me says:\n\n       The White House's reluctance to turn over the requested \n     documents may cast doubt on the accuracy of this and similar \n     testimony by other White House officials before a committee \n     of the House of Representatives.\n       On process grounds, I have sought to be as deferential as \n     prudently possible to the White House, but with each new \n     revelation, some of which viewed in isolation might seem \n     relatively inconsequential, the evidence of a consistent \n     pattern of delay and obfuscation is clearly emerging.\n       Accordingly, my advice is that a respectful letter be sent \n     to Mr. Quinn denying his request.\n       Sincerely, Chairman Leach.\n\n  The chairman advised me he might have additional letters on this \nmatter.\n  I have made an attempt, as its relates to asserting what the position \nof my colleagues--I have explained our position that we have no problem \nin going forward under the conditions that we had offered to this \nadministration, to this White House, back in early November, and which \nwas the subject matter of discussions, repeatedly, for weeks and weeks \nand weeks as it related to this and other matters.\n  So when we want to talk about avoiding constitutional clashes, I say \nright now, Mr. President, please, keep your promise to the American \npeople. Give us the information that Congress is entitled to, that the \npeople are entitled to.\n  Let me, if I might, refer to the New York Times of yesterday, and, \nMr. President, I will ask that the complete editorial be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The editorial is entitled: ``Averting a Constitutional Clash.''\n\n       If Mr. Clinton relinquishes the documents, it would be a \n     positive departure from the evasive tactics that have marked \n     the Clintons' handling of questions about Whitewater since \n     the 1992 campaign. Mr. Clinton's assertion that the \n     subpoenaed material is protected by lawyer-client privilege, \n     and his quieter claim of executive privilege, are legally \n     dubious and risk a damaging precedent.\n\n  As it relates to this, let me read just part of the editorial of \nDecember 14 of the Washington Post:\n\n       The privilege claims also undercut Mr. Clinton's much-\n     professed interest in getting the facts out.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest again that attempting to raise this claim \nand raising and delaying this matter for months--for months, now--and \nforcing us to demonstrate that we are absolutely serious in terms of \nour determination to get the facts that we are entitled to, that the \nCongress of the United States and the Senate of the United States, the \nAmerican people are entitled to, will not be delayed any longer.\n  Again, I said at any point, at any time the White House says we will \ndeliver and we are going to deliver these \n\n[[Page S18941]]\nwithin a period of time--and I do not mean days; I do not mean weeks; I \nmean within an hour or 2 hours--we will stop, but not until that takes \nplace.\n\n       The privilege claims also undercut Mr. Clinton's much-\n     professed interest in getting the facts out. To the contrary, \n     these actions of administration officials and associates--\n     like other of their actions in this long, evolving Whitewater \n     affair--look cagey, not candid, and are suggestive of people \n     with something to hide.\n\n  Let me go on:\n\n       It is fair to ask whether the White House exploited \n     information it obtained improperly from Federal agencies that \n     were looking into possible criminal matters involving the \n     Clintons.\n\n  That is the Washington Post editorial Thursday, December 14.\n  We can go on and on. December 12, New York Times, an editorial:\n\n       The committee reasonably wants to know about government \n     matters that may have been discussed, such as the handling of \n     investigations by the Treasury Department . . .\n\n  That is exactly what Chairman Leach points out. Those questions were \nraised. Now we know, at least this Senator knows, for the first time, \nMr. Nussbaum said, no, materials would not be turned over of this \nnature, or words to that effect.\n\n       A court will decide whether notes taken at the meeting and \n     a White House memo about the session can be deemed personal \n     legal papers. That will take an expansive interpretation on \n     Mr. Clinton's behalf.\n       To be sure, citizen Bill Clinton is entitled to claim \n     whatever privacy the courts will give him. But President \n     Clinton, the politician and national leader, cannot expect \n     the public to be reassured by mysterious mobile files and \n     promises of openness that disappear behind the lawyer-client \n     veil.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent these editorials be printed in \nthe Record in their entirety for completeness.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the New York Times, December 19, 1995]\n\n                    Averting a Constitutional Clash\n\n       President Clinton may be moving to avoid a constitutional \n     confrontation with Congress over the Senate Whitewater \n     committee's access to notes taken by a White House lawyer at \n     a Whitewater meeting two years ago that was attended by \n     senior officials and personal lawyers for Mr. Clinton and his \n     wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n       If Mr. Clinton relinquishes the documents, it would be a \n     positive departure from the evasive tactics that have marked \n     the Clintons' handling of questions about Whitewater since \n     the 1992 campaign. Mr. Clinton's assertion that the \n     subpoenaed material is protected by lawyer-client privilege, \n     and his quieter claim of executive privilege, are legally \n     dubious and risk a damaging precedent.\n       A forthcoming response to the Senate's request would seem \n     especially timely in view of new disclosures that more \n     records have disappeared from the Rose Law Firm. These \n     documents deal with Mrs. Clinton's legal work for Madison \n     Guaranty, the failed savings and loan run by their Whitewater \n     partner. This news comes one week after the disclosure that \n     Vincent Foster removed three files from the firm during the \n     1992 election campaign and turned them over to the Clintons' \n     trusty political errand-runner, Webster Hubbell.\n       The dispute with the committee involves notes taken by \n     William Kennedy 3d, an associate White House Counsel, at a \n     November 1993 meeting at the offices of the Clintons' private \n     attorneys. This meeting was attended by three members of the \n     White House Counsel's office, three lawyers for the Clintons \n     and Bruce Lindsey, one of the President's senior political \n     aides. Clearly, lawyer-client confidentiality ought to apply \n     to Mr. Clinton's exchanges with his personal lawyer. But to \n     try to extend the privilege to such a broadly constituted \n     meeting is a stretch, especially given the committee's \n     mandate to find out whether Administration officials, \n     including some at the meeting, may have improperly used \n     confidential Government information to aid the Clinton's \n     private defense.\n       Mr. Clinton's various lawyers, and some legal ethics \n     experts, speak of the overlap of the President's public and \n     private roles to justify the claim of lawyer-client \n     privilege. But this argument misses the vastly different and \n     even conflicting responsibilities of Mr. Clinton's two sets \n     of attorneys.\n       As for executive privilege, it ought to be a way to protect \n     a narrow band of Presidential privacy on important matters of \n     governance, including national security. It is a distortion \n     of the doctrine's history to raise it to block a legitimate \n     Congressional inquiry into the Clintons' Arkansas financial \n     dealings and the official conduct of senior Administration \n     aides.\n       A decent resolution that had the White House handing over \n     the notes seemed to be in sight over the weekend. But \n     yesterday Senator Alfonse D'Amato, the committee chairman, \n     complained that the White House was trying to bargain in the \n     media instead of negotiating with the committee. It should \n     still be possible to make arrangements before tomorrow, when \n     the full Senate is due to take up the matter. If not, the \n     Senate has no choice but to vote to go to court to enforce \n     the committee's subpoena.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the Washington Post, December 14, 1995]\n\n                       Now a Subpoena Controversy\n\n       In refusing to honor a Senate Whitewater committee subpoena \n     for notes taken by then-White House associate counsel William \n     Kennedy during a Nov. 5, 1993, meeting between White House \n     officials and the Clintons' attorneys, the administration \n     risks traveling down a familiar dead-end. Seeking refuge from \n     a legislative inquiry behind the twin shields of executive \n     privilege and attorney-client privilege--as the \n     administration is doing--may slow Congress. But it will do \n     nothing to avoid a confrontation and a debilitating fight \n     that is likely to end up in court.\n       Claims of executive and attorney-client privilege play \n     directly into the hands of Republicans on the Hill who, \n     despite their wails of protest, are not the least bit \n     bothered by the image of a stonewalling Democratic \n     administration. The privilege claims also undercut Mr. \n     Clinton's much-professed interest in getting the facts out. \n     To the contrary, these actions of administration officials \n     and associates--like other of their actions in this long, \n     evolving Whitewater affair--look cagey, not candid, and are \n     suggestive of people with something to hide. The political \n     affiliation of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and company \n     notwithstanding, there are aspects of the November 1993 \n     meeting that raise legitimate questions.\n       It is fair to ask whether the White House exploited \n     information it obtained improperly from federal agencies that \n     were looking into possible criminal matters involving the \n     Clintons. If, for instance, administration officials used \n     confidential government information to try to shield Bill and \n     Hillary Rodham Clinton from exposure to probes into Madison \n     Guaranty, the failed Arkansas thrift partially owned by the \n     Clintons, and the Small Business Administration-backed loan \n     company owned by Judge David Hale, then they have something \n     serious to answer for. Obviously Mr. Kennedy's notes on the \n     Nov. 5 meeting can shed light on those questions. His notes, \n     however, are what the administration seeks to withhold.\n       This impasse between the Senate committee and the White \n     House over so-called privileged documents must and will be \n     resolved. It would be better, however, if the dispute could \n     be settled between the executive and legislative branches. A \n     reasonable accommodation of each side's interests, not a \n     legal challenge, is what's needed at this time. The \n     overriding interest is to get at the truth. If, however, a \n     satisfactory solution cannot be reached, then the courts must \n     decide. It shouldn't have to come to that.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From The New York Times, December 12, 1995]\n\n                       Traveling Whitewater Files\n\n       Just when it seemed possible that the White House could not \n     handle Whitewater any more clumsily, here come two new moves \n     to undermine public confidence.\n       The disclosure that Vincent Foster removed three files from \n     Hillary Clinton's law firm during the 1992 election campaign \n     and turned them over to the Clintons' political fixer, \n     Webster Hubbell, is truly a blow to those who want to believe \n     the Clintons have nothing to hide. The files related to Mrs. \n     Clinton's work for Madison Guaranty, the savings and loan \n     owned by the Clintons' Whitewater investment partner, James \n     McDougal. The White House will no doubt argue that the files \n     are innocuous.\n       But that claim seems lighter than air compared with the \n     fact that they were stored in the basement of a lawyer later \n     convicted of a felony and that they disappeared from the Rose \n     Law Firm in a year when the Clinton campaign team was \n     perfecting its stonewall defense on Whitewater.\n       The other matter has to do with the dubious claim of \n     lawyer-client privilege being advanced by President Clinton \n     about a 1993 meeting at which his senior lawyers and aides \n     discussed Whitewater. Mr. Clinton seems headed for a messy \n     legal showdown with the Senate Whitewater committee. But the \n     President is stretching attorney-client privilege beyond any \n     reasonable limit and also revoking his promise of openness \n     about this matter.\n       Surely no one wants to intrude on exchanges between the \n     President and his personal lawyers. But this meeting included \n     a top political aide, Bruce Lindsey, and a battery of \n     attorneys on the public payroll, including White House \n     Counsel Bernard Nussbaum and two of his assistants.\n       The committee reasonably wants to know about government \n     matters that may have been discussed, such as the handling of \n     the investigation by the Treasury Department and the \n     Resolution Trust Company into Madison Guaranty. A court will \n     decide whether notes taken at the meeting and a White House \n     memo about the session can be deemed personal legal papers. \n     That will take an expansive interpretation in Mr. Clinton's \n     behalf.\n       To be sure, citizen Bill Clinton is entitled to litigate \n     all he wants and to claim whatever privacy the courts will \n     give him. But \n\n[[Page S18942]]\n     President Clinton, the politician and national leader, cannot expect \n     the public to be reassured by mysteriously mobile files and \n     promises of openness that disappear behind the lawyer-client \n     veil.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, last Friday our committee voted out this \nresolution, asking that the full Senate authorize the Senate legal \ncounsel to go to court to enforce the subpoena served on William \nKennedy, former associate counsel to the President. The subpoena seeks \nthe notes that Mr. Kennedy took at the Whitewater defense meeting, and \nwhich was attended by others, on November 5, 1993, with other White \nHouse officials and President and Mrs. Clinton's personal attorneys, a \nmeeting that took place at the Clintons' personal attorney's office.\n  The President has repeatedly claimed that he would not assert \nprivilege with regard to Whitewater matters. He has promised to \ncooperate fully with our committee investigation. But over the past \nweeks, President Clinton has chosen to resist our committee's \ninvestigation by preventing Mr. Kennedy from turning over his notes. \nOur committee must obtain Mr. Kennedy's notes in order to fulfill our \nobligation to the Senate and to the American people.\n  I could go on and on. I, indeed, will raise other matters. I will say \nthat what we are attempting to do is to find the truth about the \nfailure of an Arkansas savings and loan called Madison Guaranty that \ncost the American people $65 million. We want to find the truth about \nwhat happened to documents in Vincent Foster's office following his \ndeath, and why White House officials prevented law enforcement \nofficials from seeing those documents; the truth about the activities \nof Hillary Clinton's law firm, the Rose Law Firm, in connection with \ntheir representation of Madison; the truth about White House efforts to \nobtain confidential law enforcement information about Madison and \nWhitewater and what they did with that information; the truth--not what \nMr. Lindsey has said to us, that he gathered it so he could answer \nnewspaper inquiries. But getting to the truth about these matters has \nproved to be rather difficult. And these notes, we believe, are \nrelevant and will answer some of the questions and will lead us to \nother areas.\n  President Clinton's refusal to deal openly with our committee's \ninvestigations comes at a time when damaging facts have begun to mount \nand mount. These are facts that we have had to uncover on a daily \nbasis, dragging out, dredging out, fighting for the information. So, \nagain, to come before the American people and say we provided 50,000 \npages of documentation means little, when the critical, crucial \nmatters--which may be 8 pages, 10 pages, 2 pages of notes, telephone \ncalls, logs that are missing, missing files--that is the key.\n  Vincent Foster was deeply concerned about Whitewater. That he was \nconcerned about Whitewater can be attested to by his notes in which he \nsaid, ``Whitewater, can of worms you should not open.'' Vincent Foster \nhad files about Madison that Webster Hubbell transferred to the \nClintons' personal attorneys. Their phone records and White House entry \nand exit logs indicate that the President, that the First Lady, her \nchief of staff, Maggie Williams, and the First Lady's confidant, Susan \nThomases, were deeply involved in the decision to prevent law \nenforcement officials from searching Vince Foster's office.\n\n  Let me again say, phone records indicate and the White House entry \nand exit logs indicate that the First Lady, the chief of staff, Maggie \nWilliams, and the First Lady's confidant, Susan Thomases, were deeply \ninvolved.\n  That the First Lady was concerned about allowing law enforcement \nofficers unfettered access to the documents in Mr. Foster's office; \nthat a Secret Service officer saw Mrs. Clinton's chief of staff, Maggie \nWilliams, carry files from Foster's office on the night of his death; \nthat Hillary Clinton had not been forthcoming about the amount of work \nshe did for Madison while a partner at the Rose Law Firm.\n  We have also learned that the critical billing records have \ndisappeared, which raises the question: What was in the files Maggie \nWilliams was carrying from Vince Foster's office? What did they \ncontain? Are they the billing records? Where have the billing records \ngone to?\n  That former White House Counsel, Lloyd Cutler, misled the Banking \nCommittee when he claimed, in the summer of 1994, that the Office of \nGovernment Ethics had exonerated the White House colleagues for their \nhandling of confidential RTC information and that high White House \nofficials sought to obtain confidential information from the Small \nBusiness Administration and in the Small Business Administration office \nin Little Rock about David Hale, a former Arkansas judge, who contended \nthat the then Governor Clinton forced him to make an improper $300,000 \nloan to the Governor's Whitewater partner, Susan McDougal; that there \nwas a deliberate effort to obstruct the RTC's criminal investigation of \nMadison and Whitewater; the U.S. attorney in Little Rock remained on \nthe Madison case over the warnings of senior Justice Department \nofficials in Washington and declined the first RTC referring.\n  Mr. President, our committee has uncovered these and other patterns, \npatterns of people who cannot remember where they were or what they \nwere doing or who they were doing it with. We have a constant attempt \nat a diversion of information and the American people and the committee \nhave a right to the facts.\n  Mr. President, let me say it is the intent of the committee to go \nforward. It is the intent of the committee to see to it that the \nsubpoenas are enforced. It is the intent of the committee to bring this \nmatter to a head.\n  I would say, even after a vote we stand ready to accept this \ninformation as we had outlined, going back to November. We had detailed \nthat, I believe in writing, November 27. What we want is the facts. \nWhat we want is the information that the President has promised us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am going to take a few minutes to \ndiscuss the legal issue because I think it is very important in terms \nof the Senate reaching a decision whether to go to court with respect \nto obtaining these notes. The fact of the matter is the White House has \nsaid that these notes will be available. The White House, in order to \nmake the notes available, is seeking certain assurances that it will \nnot have a general, broad waiver of the attorney-client relationship. \nOur committee has indicated that the conditions the White House is \nseeking are reasonable ones and our committee is prepared to agree to \nthem.\n  The White House concern, then, is with respect to other investigative \nbodies. For example, the independent counsel and the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  As I understand it, I am told that the White House has reached an \nunderstanding with the independent counsel that I presume parallels \nwhat our committee is prepared to do regarding the turning over of the \nnotes as not being a waiver. So we are very close to having a \nresolution of this matter.\n  The problem now becomes, will the House of Representatives treat it--\nare they unwilling, in effect, to say this is not a general waiver?\n  Let me discuss briefly why this is important. The White House has \nmade a number of proposals to try to resolve this matter. I disagree \nwith the chairman, in terms of the chronology he set out with respect \nto efforts, back and forth, and who was being uncooperative. I think, \nfrankly, the committee staff, on occasions, was not seeking a \nresolution of this matter and was moving in the direction of provoking \na confrontation and a crisis, constitutional confrontation.\n  The special committee has agreed that the production of the notes of \nMr. Kennedy, taken at this November 5, 1993, meeting--on which there \nare strong assertions of attorney-client privilege--but our committee \nhas agreed that the production of those notes shall not act as a \ngeneral waiver of the attorney-client privilege.\n  The only remaining hurdle then to getting those notes is agreement by \nthe independent counsel and the House. I understand the independent \ncounsel now has worked out an understanding with the White House.\n  I believe that the concerns about a general waiver of the attorney-\nclient privilege are meritorious, and that the \n\n[[Page S18943]]\nSenate should make additional efforts to accommodate them before \nsending this matter to the Federal court. It always should be borne in \nmind that when the executive and legislative branches fail to resolve a \ndispute between them and instead submit their disagreements to the \ncourts for resolution, significant power is then placed in the judicial \nbranch to write rules that will govern the relationship between the \nelected branches. In other words, we have a chance here to work this \nout in a way that we get the notes, the White House concern about a \ngeneral waiver of a privilege is accommodated, and there is no need to \ngo to court running the risk, I would suggest to some Senators, of an \nadverse precedent. And I will make reference to that shortly.\n  Since a mutually acceptable resolution of this matter is at hand, if \nwe can just reach out and grasp it, I strongly urge the Senate not to \nprecipitate unnecessary litigation by passing this resolution. The \nargument is made, well, there is a time factor. If you go to court on \nthis matter, there certainly will be a time factor. I mean you are \ncaught in a situation here, the choice as it were, between achieving a \nresolution which would make the notes immediately available to us and \ngoing through an extended court proceeding which would take an extended \nperiod of time even under the most expedited procedures.\n  Let me first simply state that a number of legal scholars have \nexamined this meeting that was held on the 5th of November of 1993, a \nmeeting between the private lawyers the President was engaging and the \ngovernmental lawyers who had been handling various aspects of these \nmatters for the President. The meeting was to brief the new private \ncounsel hired by the Clintons. Several legal scholars have examined \nthat meeting and have concluded that a valid claim of privilege has \nbeen asserted.\n  For example, University of Pennsylvania law professor Geoffrey \nHazard, a specialist in legal ethics and the attorney-client privilege, \nprovided a legal view that the communications between White House \nlawyers and the President's private lawyers are protected by the \nattorney-client privilege.\n  Other legal experts have concurred with that view. New York \nUniversity law school professor Stephen Gillers stated, and I quote--\nthis was in the paper:\n\n       The oddity here is that Clinton is in both sets of clients, \n     in one way with his presidential hat on and in one way as a \n     private individual. The lawyers who represent the \n     President have information that the lawyer who represents \n     the Clintons legitimately needs, and that is the common \n     interest. It is true that Government lawyers cannot handle \n     the private matters of Government officials. However, \n     perhaps uniquely for the President, private and public are \n     not distinct categories. So while the principle is clear, \n     the application is going to be nearly impossible.\n\n  And there are other legal experts who have said that there is a \nprivilege that applies here.\n  Efforts have been made over the last few weeks to try to resolve this \nmatter in a way that the committee would get the information it was \nseeking, and the White House would get assurances that it was not \nbroadly and generally waiving the lawyer-client privilege--not only \nwith respect to this particular meeting but with respect to all other \nmeetings that touched on this subject matter. That is what the law may \nwell provide. And that is one of the things, of course, that seems to \nme is a legitimate concern on the part of counsel for the President.\n  There is an original proposal for Mr. Kendall, the President's \nprivate lawyer, that would allow for questioning of people at that \nmeeting in terms of what they knew when they went in and what they did \nafter they came out. But I will not get into the questioning about the \nmeeting itself. I thought that was an effort to try to accommodate, and \nto give the committee the chance to gain information, and, yet, not \nintrude upon the lawyer-client privilege. The majority projected that \nproposal, and the White House went back and sort of obviously \nreconsidered and came forward with a new proposal that embraced \nproviding the notes to the committee.\n  Mr. Kennedy, it needs to be pointed out here, is sort of a \nstakeholder. He happens to have these notes. He is not providing them \nin response to the committee's subpoena because he is instructed that \nhe has to observe the lawyer-client privilege and, therefore, cannot \nprovide this information. The canon of lawyer ethics is that you have \nto abide by the lawyer-client privilege. So he in effect says, ``Well, \nI have these notes. This is what I have been told and this is what I am \ndoing.'' The White House and Mr. Kendall, the President's lawyer who \nwas brought in to handle the private side of this matter, have in \neffect said that those notes ought not to be provided until they can \nget assurances with respect to the lawyer-client privilege.\n  Let me just make a point that I think legitimate privilege issues \nhave been raised. I think it is clear that an attorney-client privilege \ndoes apply here. It is one of the oldest of privileges for confidential \ncommunications known to the law. I mean, if anyone stops and thinks \nabout it, it is obvious why you have it. People then say, ``Well, if \nyou have nothing to hide, why do you not tell everything?'' Of course, \nthe logic of that assertion is that there would be no lawyer-client \nprivilege. The logic of that assertion is that there would be no \nlawyer-client privilege, and in this instance, the White House says we \nare prepared to give the notes. We are prepared to provide the notes. \nWe just want assurances that providing the notes will not be seen as a \ngeneral waiver of the lawyer-client privilege.\n\n  So that in other fora, and in other matters, it will be sort of, \nwell, in fact here you waive the lawyer-client privilege.\n  So they are trying to be forthcoming. They are trying to meet the \ndemands of the committee for this information, and at the same time not \ncompletely eliminate the lawyer-client privilege. And the committee in \nthe conditions it is prepared to accept--our committee, this \ncommittee--has moved to address that problem. The question then is will \nothers who may undertake an investigation be prepared to do the same? \nAs I understand it, the independent counsel is prepared to do so as \nwell.\n  So it now really is a question of whether the House, the relevant \ncommittees in the House of Representatives, are prepared to do the \nsame. Will they in effect make the same undertaking our committee is \nprepared to take? I might point out it does not lose them any position. \nI mean I have read this letter from Chairman Leach that Chairman \nD'Amato provided me. I am not quite sure that it is understood that \nthey will not lose any of the positions they now have. The notes will \nbecome available. But it is understood that the notes do not constitute \na waiver of a privilege. And the question then becomes why will not \nthat be acceptable? What is the difficulty with that? I mean we \nobviously asked the same question amongst ourselves and reached a \nconclusion that those conditions were reasonable. There were some \nothers that the White House dropped by the wayside. But we are now back \nto these conditions as was mentioned in the committee hearing, the two \nor three which the committee had been prepared to accept.\n  Let me just talk briefly about the general waiver issue.\n  The concern here is that the production of these notes could \nconstitute a general waiver of the attorney-client privilege, and it \nwould be a waiver that would apply to all communications relating to \nthe subject matter of the meeting. In other words, you could then turn \nto other meetings, other discussions between the President and his \nlawyers and say, oh, no, the privilege has been waived with respect to \nthose meetings.\n  It is this far-reaching aspect of the law of attorney-client \nprivilege, the subject matter waiver, that creates the difficulty the \nspecial committee is facing here. Production of the notes without these \nunderstandings could be construed as a waiver of the privilege as to \nall communications on this subject matter. Potentially such a waiver \nwould encompass all communications between the President and his \nlawyers at any time up to the present that pertain to the subject \nmatter of this meeting.\n  Obviously, that is very far-reaching. The committee itself recognized \nthat. Our committee recognized that. And our committee in effect said, \nno, that is not what we want to do. We do not \n\n[[Page S18944]]\nwant to intrude in that manner into the attorney-client privilege, and \ntherefore we are willing to agree to the condition that it would not be \nused, the argument would not be used that this constituted a general \nwaiver.\n  This is a complex issue, no question about it, and it seems to me \nthat taking it to the courts instead of resolving it, especially when \nit appears we are very close to resolution of the matter--that must be \nunderstood. We have a situation now in which the White House says we \nare willing to make the notes available. Our committee has said we will \naccept them on certain conditions which constitute an accommodation \nbetween the legislative and the executive branch. The independent \ncounsel apparently has taken the same view. And the question becomes, \nwill the House of Representatives join in, so you do not end up having \na whipsaw action in which notes are provided in good faith and on \ncertain understandings and then another investigative body says, oh, \nno, we are going to treat that as a general waiver and we are going to \nproceed on that basis, after this committee has said it would not treat \nit as a general waiver and after apparently the independent counsel has \ntaken the same position.\n  In my view, this dispute has escalated needlessly. The White House \nhas offered to provide the Kennedy notes to the committee, provide the \nGovernment lawyers for testimony, and in my view, rather than \nproceeding to the court at this time, the Senate should make a further \neffort to obtain this information in a manner that protects against an \nunintended general waiver of the attorney-client privilege.\n\n  It seems to me there is a constructive role that the committee can \nplay in trying to accomplish that. We are not very far away from it, in \nmy view, and it comports I think with the advice and counsel that has \ngenerally been provided historically with respect to these potential \nconfrontations between the Congress and the Executive.\n  First of all, let me note that Congress historically has respected \nthe attorney-client privilege. Indeed, Congress first acknowledged the \nconfidentiality of attorney-client discussions back in the middle of \nthe last century. In the middle of this century, the Senate considered \na rule that would have expressly recognized testimonial privileges that \ntraditionally are protected in litigation. The Senate thought of \nadopting a rule. It ultimately decided that a rule was unnecessary and \nstated:\n\n       With few exceptions, it has been committee practice to \n     observe the testimonial privileges of witnesses with respect \n     to communications between clergyman and parishioner, doctor \n     and patient, lawyer and client, and husband and wife.\n\n  As recently as 1990, Senate majority leader Mitchell stated that:\n\n       As a matter of actual experience, Senate committees have \n     customarily honored the attorney-client privilege where it \n     has been validly asserted.\n\n  That has been true even in highly charged political investigations \nwith respect to respecting the attorney-client privilege. For instance, \nduring Iran-Contra, Gen. Secord and Col. North successfully asserted \nthe attorney-client privilege. During the proceedings against Judge \nHastings, the impeachment trial committee considered his claim of \nattorney-client privilege and ruled that testimony would not be \nreceived in evidence.\n  The Senate's most recent experience with the attorney-client \nprivilege arose in the disciplinary proceedings against Senator \nPackwood. Prior to the controversy over Senator Packwood's diaries--\nprior to that--the Select Committee on Ethics considered Senator \nPackwood's assertion that certain documents other than the diaries were \ncovered by the attorney-client or work product privileges. That was the \nassertion he made, that he was covered by these privileges.\n  To resolve that claim, the Ethics Committee appointed a former \njurist--interestingly enough, it was Ken Starr--as a hearing examiner \nto make recommendations to the committee and accepted his \nrecommendation that the privilege be sustained. With respect to the \ndiaries, the committee agreed to protect Senator Packwood's privacy \nconcerns by allowing him to mask over the information dealing with \nattorney-client privilege.\n\n  So there was no intrusion into the attorney-client privilege claim in \nthat instance. The Senate respected that. This committee has extended \nprotection of the attorney-client privilege to witnesses that have been \nbefore the committee.\n  During the hearing testimony of Thomas Castleton, Chairman D'Amato \nconfirmed that Castleton need not testify about conversations with his \nattorney. Similarly, he limited questioning of Randall Coleman by \nminority counsel regarding an interview his client, David Hale, granted \nto a reporter for the New York Times during which Coleman was present. \nThat was Coleman, the client, and this reporter for the New York Times, \nand that was given this protection.\n  It seems to me that the President and Mrs. Clinton ought to have \nprotection for the lawyer-client privilege consistent with past Senate \npractice.\n  Let me turn to why we need to avoid a needless constitutional \nconfrontation by pursuing a negotiated resolution to this dispute.\n  Congressional attempts to inquire into privileged executive branch \ncommunications are rare and with good reason. In fact, the courts on \noccasion have refused to determine the dispute and have encouraged the \ntwo branches to settle the differences without further judicial \ninvolvement. In other words, when it comes to the court, it says you \nought to settle it between yourselves and not involve the court in \ntrying to address this matter. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia has long held that Presidential communications are \npresumptively privileged, and therefore it would take this matter to \ncourt. The committee is taking on a heavy burden.\n  Really what you have to do here is balance the interests. And how do \nyou reconcile these differences? William French Smith, when he was the \nAttorney General, commented:\n\n       The accommodation required is not simply an exchange of \n     concessions or a test of political strength, it is an \n     obligation of each branch to make a principled effort to \n     acknowledge and, if possible, to meet the legitimate needs of \n     the other branch.\n\n  The White House is trying to meet our needs by providing the notes. \nThe White House now is taking the position, we will provide to the \ncommittee. The committee asserts that it wants these notes and needs \nthese notes in order to carry forward its inquiry. The White House has \nsaid we will make these notes available. The White House says there is \none problem with doing that, that making these notes available will \nthen be seen as a general waiver of the lawyer-client privilege. And we \ndo not want to be in that posture. We want to have assurances with \nrespect that this does not constitute a waiver of the lawyer-client \nrelationship.\n  This committee has recognized that argument because the committee has \nindicated that it is willing to accept the conditions that preclude \nthat general waiver. The White House says well, that works with the \ncommittee, but there are other investigative places that could make the \nproviding of the notes to the committee say this constitutes a general \nwaiver, which is, I think, what the law provides. So they say, ``We \nwant assurances with respect to these other bodies.''\n  One such body was the independent counsel. It was my own view that we \nshould all get the independent counsel in, have a meeting, see if we \ncannot resolve this matter, and that the committee could have, you \nknow, played a constructive role in doing that.\n  In any event, the White House went and engaged in its own direct \ndiscussions with the independent counsel and I am told they reached an \nunderstanding as of yesterday evening that will make the notes \navailable, will provide the assurances against the general waiver of \nthe lawyer-client relationship.\n  The question now becomes with respect to the House of \nRepresentatives, the White House apparently wrote to the Speaker about \nthis matter. The two chairman of the relevant committees have indicated \nthat they will not agree to the assurance, the very one this committee \nis prepared the make. I find it difficult to understand that. In other \nwords, there is nothing in these conditions that causes them to lose \nanything in terms of their position. It does not deny them their \nposition in any way with respect to future assertions that they might \nchoose to make. \n\n[[Page S18945]]\n It makes the notes available, which people say needs to be done, and \nit does it in a way that the White House is not confronted with the \nvery high risk that they have waived the lawyer-client relationship.\n\n  The Senate has recognized and respected this relationship for more \nthan a century. A waiver of the privilege would deprive the President \nand Mrs. Clinton of the right to communicate in confidence with their \ncounsel, a basic right afforded to all Americans. It is my view that \nthe committee ought to turn its attention to resolving this matter in a \nway that the committee is prepared to do with respect to itself, that \nthe independent counsel is prepared to do.\n  If that is accomplished, then the notes become available and you do \nnot have any risk of the waiver of the principle. If you go to court, \nwho knows how a court will rule. I think there is a very substantial \nchance that the court will rule against the Senate, and may in fact \nestablish limits with respect to the Senate's congressional \ninvestigatory power that some of those pressing this matter will come \nto regret. You do not know what the court's outcome will be, but I \nthink that is a very real possibility in this situation.\n  There has been a lot of movement on this issue. And it seems to me \nthat the offer now that the White House has made in an effort to try to \nresolve it is very reasonable, is justified on the law and that it \nbehooves us to try the accommodate to it and find a solution to this \nmatter, a solution which would make this information available now as \nopposed to going to court.\n  I have difficulty understanding why this matter is at this point. I \ndo not understand--I do not begin to understand why the House \ncommittees are taking this position because I think if they make the \naccommodation they have something to gain and nothing to lose. Now, if \nthey simply want to provoke a confrontation, if that is the objective, \nthat is a different story.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Will my friend yield for an observation?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. On this point, and I just got this letter faxed to me. \nIt says 12:18, but indeed it was 11:18. It is off an hour, this time \nclock, wherever this fax is operating from, which I have just sent over \nto my colleague.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Still on daylight saving time.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. And it comes from Chairman Leach. And he did point out \nto me in a conversation--and it has just taken me a little time to \nassimilate this--obviously Chairman Leach is very perplexed and \ndisturbed and will not agree to a limitation of his rights even as it \nrelates to the possible lawyer-client relationship because he feels \nthat there is testimony in the record before him to his question that \nMr. Nussbaum indicated these people at the meeting would not transfer \ninformation that should not have been transferred that would be \ninappropriate. I am summarizing it in order to save time.\n\n  And he goes down to--I will go to the last two paragraphs on page \ntwo. He says:\n\n       To accede to the White House position that disclosure of \n     the notes of the Nov. 5, 1993 meeting does not constitute a \n     waiver of the President's attorney-client privilege, one must \n     accept the proposition that a privilege attaches to this \n     meeting in the first place. Given the presence of three \n     Government lawyers at the meeting--and the indication that \n     confidential law enforcement information may have been \n     improperly disclosed to the President's private lawyer--that \n     is a proposition that legal experts the committee has \n     consulted on the subject cannot accept.\n\n  I think more importantly is his last paragraph that he points out to \nme:\n\n       Given White House denials under oath to a House Committee \n     that a transfer of information to parties outside the White \n     House occurred, White House efforts to place limitations upon \n     the House's ability to gather information necessary to \n     fulfill its legitimate oversight function takes particular \n     chutzpah.\n\n  I did not know that my colleague from Iowa would use a term that was \nfrequently used in the Northeast, particularly in the Northeast. But--\n\n       To date the White House has not consulted in any manner on \n     this issue with the House Banking Committee.\n\n  I do not mean to be arguing the case on behalf of the House, but I \nthink that what Congressman Leach is saying quite clearly is they are \nvery much concerned that under oath, the question he raised, as it \nrelates to the possible transfer of documents that would be \ninappropriate to be transferred, such as criminal referrals to people \noutside of the White House, being assured by Mr. Nussbaum that it did \nnot take place, and it appearing that maybe it did take place, he is \nnot willing to concede or give up or limit the ability of the House to \nproceed as related to what took place to those documents.\n  That raises the question, a very interesting question, of whether or \nnot even that relationship, which this Senator under most circumstances \nwould say absolutely exists between a lawyer and his client may come \ninto sharp contrast if information improperly received is passed to a \nprivate attorney, whether or not that private attorney may be examined \nas it relates to what he did, what he did not do, et cetera.\n\n  I believe that that is--this is again outside of my particular \nknowledge--but it is certainly contained within this letter. And I \nthink that is one of the things that Mr. Leach is concerned about.\n  Again, coming back to our particular proposition, I will say to my \nfriend and colleague, I think that you and I and the committee, \nDemocrats and Republicans, the minority and majority, have really gone \nas far as we possibly could. And I do not think this is a failure on \nthe part of the committee. We did put forth fact that we would not say \nthat this constituted a waiver. That is not the issue.\n  The issue is, when will you produce this documentation? As it relates \nto the independent counsel, we contacted him and the office of \nindependent counsel has informed this committee that they cannot \nconfirm or deny. So maybe they have worked it out. Obviously if the \nWhite House says that their objections have been met, I am not going to \ncontest that. But they are not in a position to confirm or deny this \nstatement, and an agreement has been reached.\n  But once again what we are hearing is the White House and the \nPresident saying one thing, and he is willing to make these documents \navailable, that ``I will not hide behind privilege,'' and yet doing \nexactly that. And that is what this Senator has difficulty \nunderstanding. We have gone, this committee and this Senate, as far as \nwe can. We have made every reasonable effort, and that is what brings \nus to this point.\n\n  I might note that in the five cases we have come forward as relates \nto the enforcement of subpoenas, in every one of those cases Congress \nhas gone forward to enforce the subpoenas.\n  I thank my friend for yielding. We just did get this communique, and \nI shared it with you as soon as we received it. I wanted to bring it to \nyour attention.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am glad the Senator brought it to my attention, \nbecause it really does underscore the problem the White House is \nconcerned about. In fact, Chairman Leach is wrong in asserting they \nwould have limitations placed upon their ability to gather information, \njust as that is not happening to us.\n  So the question then becomes, if you can get the notes which everyone \nasserts would provide an important piece of information, if you can get \nthe notes and the condition you agree to for getting the notes is that \nthe providing of the notes will not be treated as a general waiver of \nthe lawyer-client privilege, which is a perfectly reasonable condition, \nit seems to me, why would you not enter into that arrangement? What is \nthe problem? Why are the House committees taking this position? What \ngame is afoot?\n  It is not a reasonable position to take in the circumstance. They \nlose nothing by accepting the notes and agreeing to the condition. In \nfact, they get ahead of where they are now, because the notes then \nbecome available. They cannot use the furnishing of the notes to claim \nthe privilege was waived somewhere else, but if the notes are not \nprovided, they cannot make that claim elsewhere, in any event. So it is \nnot as though this sets them back. This, in fact, makes some progress \nin the inquiry.\n  I just do not understand this position, and it seems to me what this \ncommittee ought to be doing, frankly, is seeing if we cannot get the \naccommodation--well, I hear the statement from the independent counsel, \nand we \n\n[[Page S18946]]\nwould have to see what the story is there, but I understood that could \nbe resolved in the direct communications and then with respect to the \nHouse. Then you get the notes and you do not intrude on the lawyer-\nclient privilege.\n  This administration has provided an enormous amount of material and \naccess. Of course, people say a long time ago, you made a quote \neverything would be provided and there would be no invocation of \nprivilege. I was asked about that by a newspaper person the other day. \nThey said, ``Well, what about that?\"\n\n  I said, ``Well, I'm sure when the President made that statement,'' \nand, in my view, he has delivered on it essentially, ``he never \nanticipated that we would get to the point where you would make a kind \nof a sweeping request that would carry the risk of totally wiping out \nhis lawyer-client relationship.''\n  Obviously, when he made that statement, it seems to me, he was \nassuming that the request that would come would be within the area of \nreasonableness and that he would not confront one that carried with it \nthe very real risk of no more lawyer-client relationship.\n  Obviously, when it reached that point, the President's lawyer said, \n``Wait a minute, the logic of this is that you will not be able to have \nany confidentiality in your relationship with your lawyer.'' Of course, \nthen some say, ``Well, he doesn't need any, he should just tell \neverything.'' ``What do you have to hide?\"\n  But the logic of that argument is that you would never have any \nconfidential relationship.\n  In fact, when the committee sent letters down to the White House \nrequesting various materials, we recognized in the letters that we sent \nthat some of the material sought would be subject to claims of \nprivilege. In fact, we told the White House, if that were the case, to \nprovide a log identifying the date, the author, the recipient and the \nsubject matter and the basis for the privilege.\n  So this committee recognized at the outset that we could make \ninterests for which a privilege could be asserted. We did not start \nfrom the premise that asserting a privilege was off bounds. We \nrecognized it in the request that we made to the White House.\n  We have had a tremendous number of depositions, witnesses. None of \nthat has been impeded or inhibited. We have had 32 days of hearings. We \nhave had about 150 people who have been deposed. We have had, I think, \nsome 80 people who have been actually heard in open hearings.\n  Virtually all of the differences have been resolved with respect to \nproviding information. This one could be resolved. I want to underscore \nthat point again: This one could be resolved.\n  We are at the point where the White House, in effect, has said we \nwill accept the conditions the committee was willing to validate to \nprovide the notes. They are trying to find the same assurances from the \nindependent counsel and from the House of Representatives. That is not \nunreasonable. In fact, I think that is very sensible. And, therefore, \nthe opportunity is here, in effect, to resolve this matter, without \ngoing to the courts, without, in effect, running this risk of \ntrespassing on this very important relationship.\n\n  The chairman says, ``Well, you have turned over a lot of pages of \ndocuments,'' but that is not the relevant matter. Well, it is partly \nrelevant. They have turned over an incredible amount of material. The \ncommittee has worked through it. It constitutes the basis for our \nquestioning. The committee has now focused on the notes of this meeting \nand has said, ``We want the notes of those meetings.''\n  Originally, the position that was taken by Mr. Kendall was, ``Well, \nyou can get that information in a different way without actually \ngetting the notes.''\n  The majority said, ``Well, we don't accept that. We want the notes.'' \nThe White House now has made a bona fide offer to provide the notes \nwith certain assurances. This committee is prepared to give those \nassurances.\n  So if we were the only forum in which this issue might arise about \nthe waiver, there would be no problem if the committee was the only \nforum. But the fact is there are other forums, and I think the White \nHouse reasonably says if we give the notes to this special committee, \nothers will argue in those other forums that this constitutes a waiver; \ntherefore, we want assurances there as well--the independent counsel \nand the House committees.\n  It is a perfectly reasonable request. My own view is, frankly, that \nthe committee ought to take a more positive role and, in effect, bring \nthese parties in and say, ``Let's resolve this matter without a \nconstitutional confrontation.'' It is obvious that it can be done, and \nthat is the course we ought to take. That, in effect, would provide the \ninformation far, far sooner than going to court will provide the \ninformation, and it will meet, I think, a very reasonable concern on \nthe part of the White House that there is a general waiver of the \nlawyer-client privilege.\n  I would be surprised if there were Members of this body who thought \nthere should be a general waiver of all lawyer-client relationships.\n  That is not the way the Senate has acted in the past. It is not the \nposition we have taken. It was clearly not the position we took with \nrespect to witnesses before our very committee. It was not the position \nthe Senate took in the Packwood matter. I can run on back through \nhistory with respect to the decision to accord a certain respect to the \nlawyer-client relationship.\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is important that the Senate shift its \nattention to resolving this matter without a constitutional conflict. \nIn my view, that is within reach, and we ought to be engaged in the \nprocess of trying to bring that about. That would be a solution that \nwould provide the information, protect against the general waiver. That \nis something this committee is prepared to do. I understand it is \nsomething the independent counsel is prepared to do. If our colleagues \nin the House were prepared to do it, this confrontation would be set \naside and this issue would be resolved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have listened with interest to my \ncolleague from Maryland. We have discussed many of these issues in \ncommittee already, but I think it is necessary that we talk about them \nhere on the floor.\n  Let me state to my colleague, and any other colleagues who may be \nlistening, that I will stand absolutely with the Senator from Maryland \nto protect the attorney-client privilege in every circumstance, whether \nit regards the President of the United States, any citizen of the \nUnited States, or a convicted felon who is incarcerated by the United \nStates. Wherever you wish to go where there is a legitimate attorney-\nclient privilege, this Senator will stand to protect that privilege.\n  That is not an issue here. The President has the right to the \nattorney-client privilege. The President has the right to consult his \nattorneys on matters relating to his personal affairs, with the \nabsolute assurance that no committee of Congress will ever intrude upon \nthat consultation, and that no one will ever do anything that would \nweaken that right. It is one of the more fundamental rights established \nin American common law, and it must be protected.\n  I make that strong statement so that people will understand that the \nissue here is not the President's right to an attorney, or the \nPresident's right to protect the attorney-client privilege. The issue \nhere is whether or not Government attorneys, paid for by the taxpayers, \nattending a meeting with the President's private attorneys, discussing \nmatters that did not impact the Presidency, matters that took place \nprior to the President's election, have the same attorney-client \nprivilege.\n  I am troubled by the number and type of people who attended the \nmeeting with the President's private attorneys. This was a matter of \ndiscussing the President's private legal problems, so why was it \nnecessary for four members of the White House staff to be present at \nthis discussion, one of whom, though he has graduated from law school \nand has practiced as an attorney, at the time of his attendance, was \nnot involved in legal matters for the White House. He was the head of \nWhite House personnel. He was not functioning in his capacity as an \nattorney when he attended that meeting. \n\n[[Page S18947]]\n\n  I recall, Mr. President, when the office of counsel to the President \nwas occupied by a single individual. It was not necessary for the \nPresident of the United States to have a substantial law firm operating \nunder the cloak of ``counsel to the President,'' paid by the taxpayers, \nhandling the President's personal affairs.\n  If I may, I will go all the way back to an era, which I realize has \npassed and cannot be reclaimed, to find an example and use it as an \nexample of the kind of separation between personal affairs and private \naffairs that we once had. Harry Truman, as President of the United \nStates, kept a roll of 3-cent stamps in his desk. Whenever he wrote a \nletter to his mother, which he did almost daily, he would reach into \nhis desk and pull out the roll of 3-cent stamps, lick the stamp himself \nand put it on the envelope because, he said, ``Letters to my mother are \nnot public business and, therefore, I will pay the postage myself.'' I \nrealize we have come a long way from that point, and I would not expect \nthe President of the United States to take the time now to say in his \ncorrespondence, ``Well, I must pay the postage on this one,'' or ``I \nwill not pay the postage on that one.'' All of us in official life are \nso beset with correspondence that we never know whether the answer to a \nletter is a response from our official capacity or our private \ncapacity. We pay for our Christmas cards ourselves, but much of the \ncorrespondence that comes out of our office could easily fall into \neither category.\n  But it is the mindset that there must be a separation between private \naffairs and public affairs that I want to appeal to. Here is a \nPresident who appoints--as it is his perfectly legitimate right to do--\nas deputy White House counsel a man whose principal activity in the \nWhite House turns out to be handling the Clintons' personal affairs--\nVincent Foster, the focus of all of this investigation--who made \nhimself the focus by virtue of his tragic suicide. He spent most of his \ntime handling the Clintons' tax matters, the Clintons' investment \nmatters, the Clintons' personal affairs. That came out in our hearings, \nas one of the support people on the White House staff--a secretary--was \nsufficiently concerned about the amount of time Mr. Foster was spending \non nonpublic issues that she went to the general counsel for the \nPresident, Mr. Nussbaum, and asked the question, ``Is this a legitimate \nthing for Mr. Foster to be doing while being paid by the taxpayers?'' \nShe made the comment that she, as a long-time employee of the White \nHouse counsel's office, had never seen anything like that being done in \nprevious Presidencies. Specifically, she referenced the Bush \nPresidency. She was told that it is up to the counsel, Mr. Nussbaum, to \nmake the decision as to what is appropriate and what is not in terms of \ntime allocation, and as long as Mr. Nussbaum says that it is all right \nfor Mr. Foster to spend the majority of his time handling the Clintons' \npersonal affairs, that means it is all right for Mr. Foster to spend \nthe majority of his time handling the Clintons' personal affairs.\n  I raise this because it is at the core of the controversy we find \nourselves in. The Clintons obviously believe that anyone who works for \nthe counsel to the President immediately becomes subject to the \nClintons' private attorney-client privilege. If Mr. Foster was spending \nhis time doing the Clintons' personal tax affairs, I think the case \ncould be made that those tax matters could be covered by the attorney-\nclient privilege. I certainly hope that my consultation with my \nattorney on tax matters is covered by the attorney-client privilege, if \nanybody should ever challenge me. And if I use Government lawyers to do \nthat--I have not and will not--I guess the presumption in my mind would \nbe that even though they are paid by the taxpayers, because they are \ndoing this personal work for me, the work would be covered by the \nattorney-client privilege if they were private attorneys, so it should \nbe covered by the attorney-client privilege now that they are public \nattorneys.\n  Let me digress, Mr. President, long enough to make the point that all \nof us in our official capacities do indeed have to call upon Government \nemployees from time to time to advise us on private activities that \nimpinge upon our public circumstance.\n  For example, when I was called upon to put my assets in a managed \ntrust by virtue of my election as a Senator, I turned to the attorney \nin my Senate office who is familiar with Ethics Committee positions and \nrequirements and asked him for advice as to how this should be done. I \nwould expect those conversations to be covered by the attorney-client \nprivilege as I discuss with him matters of some confidentiality.\n  The trust has been formed, the assets have been placed there, and \ndocuments have been filed with the Ethics Committee disclosing all of \nthat. That is an example where I have a matter of personal concern that \nI discuss with an attorney who is on the payroll because he is in a \nposition to advise me as to how my personal affairs impact in a public \narena; in this case, the Senate Ethics Committee and the filings we are \nrequired to make here.\n  Accordingly, if the President were to turn to a member of the counsel \nto the President's office and say, ``I have a matter that stems from my \npersonal affairs but that impacts on my public duties. I would like you \nto counsel me on those affairs, and I would expect that your counsel \nwould fall within the attorney-client privilege.'' I have no argument \nwith that.\n  The argument here is a meeting where the President's personal \nattorneys, concerned with actions that took place prior to his becoming \nPresident, concerned with allegations about impropriety if not \nillegality in those matters, holds a meeting with four employees of the \nWhite House to discuss those matters, and then says, ``Those employees \nof the White House are covered by attorney-client privilege, the same \nas we are.''\n  I find that a bit of a stretch, Mr. President. I made the point in \nthe committee that there must be a dividing line somewhere between the \nPresident and Government employees. If you say, ``No, there is no such \ndividing line,'' you can then go to the point of saying any attorney \nwho works for the executive branch anywhere in the executive branch \ncan, by the President's direction, be covered by attorney-client \nprivilege. Obviously, nobody would say that is common.\n  Where does the line move back to? Does the President have attorney-\nclient privilege just with the counsel to the President? Does the \nPresident have personal attorney-client privilege with everyone in the \ncounsel to the President's office no matter how large it gets? I am \nalarmed at how large it is getting. I remember when a President needed \nonly one lawyer. If he wanted a legal opinion on something other than \nhis own direct office matters he called the Attorney General. We are \ngetting away from that now. We have a whole law firm under the title of \ncounsel to the President. It seems to be supplanting the Attorney \nGeneral in the role of advising the President on legal matters. That is \nanother issue.\n  I think the line must be drawn as tightly to the President as \npossible. The President obviously thinks the line should be drawn as \nfar away from him as possible. That is where the controversy for this \nSenator arises on this issue.\n  I am happy to exchange with my friend, the Senator from Maryland, in \nany colloquy or exchange, as long as I do not lose my right to the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. First, let me say I think the Senator has made a very \nreasoned statement about the matter. Let me simply say when Mr. Roger \nAdams was before the committee, he is a career person in the Department \nof Justice, and he is sort of the one who gives advice on Government \nethics to attorneys in the Department of Justice. That is his \nspecialty. He was asked about Foster doing private law work for the \nPresident and Mrs. Clinton. He says, ``That doesn't surprise me a bit. \nThere is a thin line between public business and private business and \nit does not offend me at all that the counsel or deputy counsel to the \nPresident does work on some personal things of the President and the \nFirst Lady.''\n  Just as the Senator indicated you might have a member of your staff, \nsuppose you are doing your disclosure statement----\n  Mr. BENNETT. Precisely, and I have no problem with that. I do have a \npersonal problem, whether it is legal or not, with the extent to which \nthis \n\n[[Page S18948]]\nPresident seems to use this White House staff. I am entitled to that \nconcern.\n  Mr. SARBANES. When Lloyd Cutler took over as White House counsel he \nraised that and apparently changes were made in the workings of the \nWhite House to more clearly draw the line between personal and public \nmatters.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have Lloyd Cutler's statement to that effect, if the \nSenator would like to hear it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think he was on point with that.\n  Let me go a step further on this question about this particular \nmeeting and your observations about the extent of it which apparently \ncauses you to question whether the lawyer-client privilege applies to \nit. Of course that, ultimately, if we press forward will be resolved by \na court.\n  Let me just read this letter from Geoffrey Hazard, a very \ndistinguished legal scholar, professor of law at the University of \nPennsylvania, and he travels all over the country talking about these \nvery problems. This was a letter to the White House counsel.\n\n       You have asked my opinion whether the communications in a \n     meeting between lawyers on the White House staff, engaged in \n     providing legal representation, and lawyers privately engaged \n     by the President are protected by the attorney-client \n     privilege. In my opinion, they are so protected.\n\n  The facts, in essence, are that a conference was held among lawyers \non the White House staff, and lawyers who had been engaged to represent \nthe President personally. The conference concerned certain transactions \nthat occurred before the President assumed office but which had \nsignificance after he took office. The Governmental lawyers were \nrepresenting the President ex officio. The other lawyers were retained \nby the President to provide private representation to him. On this \nbasis, it is my opinion that the attorney-client privilege is not \nwaived or lost.\n\n       A preliminary question is whether the attorney-client \n     privilege may be asserted by the President, with respect to \n     communications with White House lawyers, as against other \n     departments and agencies of Government, particularly Congress \n     and the Attorney General. There are no judicial decisions on \n     this question of which I am aware. However, Presidents of \n     both political parties have asserted that the privilege is \n     thus effective.\n       This position is, in my opinion, correct, reasoning from \n     such precedents as can be applied by analogy. Accordingly, in \n     my opinion, the President can properly invoke attorney-client \n     privilege concerning communications with White House lawyers.\n\n  Then he goes as he draws toward a close:\n\n       The principal question, then, is whether the privilege is \n     lost when the communications were shared with lawyers who \n     represent the President personally. One way to analyze a \n     situation is simply to say that the ``President'' has two \n     sets of lawyers, engaged in conferring with each other. On \n     that basis there is no question that the privilege is \n     effective. Many legal consultations for a client involve the \n     presence of more than one lawyer.\n       Another way to analyze the situation is to consider that \n     the ``President'' has two legal capacities, that is, the \n     capacity ex officio--in his office as President--and the \n     capacity as an individual. The concept that a single \n     individual can have two distinct legal capacities or \n     identities has existed in law for centuries. On this \n     basis, there are two ``clients'', corresponding to the two \n     legal capacities or identities.\n       The matters under discussion were of concern to the \n     President in each capacity as client. In my opinion, the \n     situation is, therefore, the same as if lawyers for two \n     different clients were in conference about a matter that was \n     of concern to both clients. In that situation, in my opinion \n     the attorney-client privilege is not lost by either client.\n       The recognized rule is set forth in the Restatement of the \n     Law Governing Lawyers, Section 126 (Tent. Draft No. 2, 1989), \n     as follows:\n       If two or more clients represented by separate lawyers \n     share a common interest in a matter, the communications of \n     each separately represented client . . .\n       (1) Are privileged against a third person. . .\n       Inasmuch as the White House lawyers and the privately \n     engaged lawyers were addressing a matter of common interest \n     to the President in both legal capacities, the attorney-\n     client privilege is not waived or lost as against third \n     parties.\n\n  Now, as he said, it has never been adjudicated in a court. It could \nbe decided differently. But this is a leading expert, and I think that \nis a very strong letter with respect to this matter.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I understand. I agree he is a leading expert. And it is \na very strong letter.\n  I also note, however, as you have, that the matter has not been \nadjudicated in a court, and I think that may well argue strongly for us \nto proceed and allow the court to so adjudicate, because if we solve \nthese matters by getting legal opinions on opposite sides and then \nreading the opinions to each other, we do not need courts. The courts \nexist to take the legal opinions on one side and the other and listen \nto them and make a decision. Many of those decisions, as the Senator \nwell knows, are decided on a five-to-four vote, with strong letters \nfrom real experts ending up on the side of the four, sometimes, when it \ngoes to the Supreme Court, and the strong letters from real experts \nending up, sometimes, on the side of the five.\n  I have heard from distinguished commentators, lawyers of sufficient \nreputation to require us to pay attention to their views, that the \nPresident, in this case, has little or no grounds to stand on. The \nlawyer you have just quoted obviously disagrees with those opinions. I \nthink that is why we have courts. It may be that this matter is \nimportant enough to be resolved once and for all, and the way to get it \nresolved is to proceed with the subpoena and let the court hear the \nmatter.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Sure.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the reason you are proceeding is in order to get the \nnotes, and if the notes can be made available under what I regard as \nperfectly reasonable conditions, why should we provoke a court \ncontroversy on this matter?\n  Mr. BENNETT. If I may respond to the Senator, quoting comments he \nmade in his opening statement, he said, ``There has been a lot of \nmovement here.'' I agree with him, that there has been some movement \nhere. But it is my observation that the movement has always come after \nthe committee has decided to get tough, that the movement on this issue \nhas come after the chairman said, ``We are going to issue a subpoena. \nWe are going to go to the floor. We are going to demand Senate \naction.'' That is when the movement started to come.\n  So when the Senator from Maryland says if it is my purpose to get the \nnotes, we can drop this and get the notes through other means, I say to \nthe Senator, I would be willing to drop this as soon as the notes \nappear. I would be willing to vacate the order for a subpoena as soon \nas the notes appear, and not provoke this kind of confrontation. But \nuntil the notes come along, the pattern of behavior that I have seen on \nthe committee says to me the best way to keep the movement going is to \nkeep the pressure on.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. First of all, it is my view, as I indicated also in my \nremarks, that the White House has been trying to reach an \naccommodation, and to some extent I think the confrontation was \nprovoked by the committee.\n  But putting that to one side, we are now at the point where the \nproposition that we are wrestling with is pretty simple. That is, if \nthe White House can get the same assurances from the independent \ncounsel and the House that it has gotten from our committee with \nrespect to this waiver question, they are prepared to provide the notes \nat once. We obviously thought that the conditions were reasonable in \ndealing with the White House on this matter, because we have agreed to \nthem.\n  I think it is reasonable for the White House then to say that we \nought not to be blind-sided or whipsawed on this thing, by other \ninvestigatory bodies, in other forums. And, therefore, we need to get \nfrom them the same or comparable assurances.\n  As I understand it--I do not have anything definitive--but I am told \nthat this matter has been worked out with the independent counsel. Of \ncourse, assuming that is the case, that itself is a further major step \nforward. Then it just, apparently, now leaves us with a question of the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Mr. BENNETT. If I could respond to the Senator? I agree. If, in fact, \nthe independent counsel has made this \n\n[[Page S18949]]\nagreement, that is a significant step forward. He says that leaves only \nthe House with which to deal. I am glad to know that, because the \noriginal condition that was sent to the committee had other agencies \nbesides the independent counsel and the House. It had the RTC and the \nFDIC. I am assuming from the Senator's statement that means the White \nHouse has now dropped the demand that those people also have a veto \npower on whether or not the notes will be given to us?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me just read a letter from the White House counsel \nto Chairman D'Amato. A copy was sent to me.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It said:\n\n       Dear Chairman D'Amato, As I informed you yesterday we \n     would, Counsel for the President have undertaken to secure \n     nonwaiver agreements from the various entities with an \n     investigative interest in Whitewater-Madison matters. I \n     requested an opportunity to meet with your staff to determine \n     how we might work together to facilitate this process. Mr. \n     Chertoff declined to meet.\n       Nonetheless, we have succeeded in reaching an understanding \n     with the Independent Counsel that he will not argue that \n     turning over the Kennedy notes waives the attorney-client \n     privilege claimed by the President. With this agreement in \n     hand, the only thing standing in the way of giving these \n     notes to your committee is the unwillingness of Republican \n     House Chairmen similarly to agree. As I am sure you are \n     aware, two of the Committee Chairmen who have asserted \n     jurisdiction over Whitewater matters in the House have \n     rejected our request that the House also enter a non-waiver \n     agreement with respect to disclosure of these notes and \n     related testimony.\n       We have said all along that we are prepared to make the \n     notes public; that all we need is an assurance that other \n     investigative bodies will not use this as an excuse to deny \n     the President the right to lawyer confidentiality that all \n     Americans enjoy. The response of the House Committee Chairmen \n     suggests our concern has been well-founded.\n       If your primary objective in pursuing this exercise is to \n     obtain the notes, we need to work together to achieve that \n     result. You earlier stated that you were willing to urge the \n     Independent Counsel to go along with a non-waiver agreement. \n     We ask that you do the same with your Republican colleagues \n     in the House. Be assured, as soon as we secure an agreement \n     from the House, we will give the notes to the Committee.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. If my colleague will yield----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me read the last paragraph because it is important \nto keep this thing current.\n\n       Mr. Chertoff has informed me that the Committee will not \n     acknowledge that a reasonable claim of privilege has been \n     asserted with respect to confidential communications between \n     the President's personal lawyer and White House officials \n     acting as lawyers for the President. In view of the \n     overwhelming support exercised by legal scholars and experts \n     for the White House position on this subject, we are prepared \n     simply to agree to disagree with the Committee on this point.\n       Accordingly, the only remaining obstacle to resolution of \n     this matter is the House.\n\n  So that is where the matter now stands.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator for that. It represents, in this \nSenator's view, a significant movement on the part of the White House \nfrom the position taken less than a week ago, when the same Jane \nSherburne gave us five conditions, two of which the majority on the \ncommittee had recommended to her, and the other three of which many \nmembers of the committee found to be unacceptable.\n  The two most objectionable of those conditions that she placed on \ngiving up the notes, Nos. 4 and 5, in her correspondence of the 14th of \nDecember have been dropped from the letter that the Senator from \nMaryland just talked about. There is no relevance.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, 4 and 5 have been dropped; 4 \nis still relevant because that involves trying to get those assurances \nfrom another investigatory body.\n  Mr. BENNETT. No. 4 has been dropped as proposed. It has been \nreplaced, in my view, with the request that the House now be involved \nbecause she wanted the House involved in No. 4 in the original letter. \nIt represents movement. But I think the tenor of No. 4 has, in fact, \nbeen dropped and replaced by the acceptance on her part of taking just \nthe House. We no longer have any references to the Resolution Trust \nCorporation and its successor and the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, which were for this Senator the two most difficult \nrequirements that the White House had placed. So we have had movement. \nWe have had significant movement. We have seen that movement come in \nresponse to the pressure created by the requirement for this subpoena.\n  The only other comment I would make with respect to Ms. Sherburne's \nletter of the 20th that the Senator from Maryland has just quoted is a \npersonal disagreement with the opening clause in her sentence in \nparagraph 3 when she says, ``We have said all along that we are \nprepared to make the notes public.'' That does not coincide with this \nSenator's memory of the way the White House has proceeded. I will take \nthe notes. I will read the notes as soon as they are provided. But I \npersonally do not agree that the White House has indeed said all along \nthat they are prepared to make the notes public. As I have said, I \nbelieve they have responded as the committee has gotten tough, and they \nare now saying things that in fact do not coincide with this Senator's \nmemory of history.\n  If I can proceed then, Mr. President, if my colleague from Maryland \nis finished with the colloquy on this issue, I want to make some \ngeneral points about why it is necessary for the committee to continue \nthis somewhat militant stance that we have taken. I have been \ninterested to watch this thing unfold as covered by the media.\n  If we were to go back to the beginning of the hearing, the reaction \non the part of people covering this issue was that it was, frankly, a \ngigantic yawn and nothing for anybody to pay any attention to, nothing \nfor anybody to get very excited about. I will not go back with a \nquotation trail beyond the month of December. But someone who wants to \ndo a historical pattern of this could follow the pattern of media \ncomments from the summertime on through the fall and then into December \nand see that people are beginning to pick up in their understanding, \npick up in their concern about this. And, interestingly enough, it has \ncome not just from the media that one would automatically assume would \nbe favorable to the Republican point of view, but it has come from \nsources that have been traditionally, shall we say, somewhat skeptical \nof Republican positions.\n  In this month alone, Mr. President, starting toward the first of the \nmonth we have the following paper trail, if you will, from some of the \nleading papers in this country.\n  The New York Times on the 6th of December with the lead editorial \nentitled ``Whitewater Evasions, Cont.'' That is an interesting lead, an \ninteresting title for an editorial. ``Whitewater Evasions, Cont.'' The \nTimes has had previous editorials on Whitewater evasions, and they talk \nabout it.\n  The final sentence of the editorial says, ``* * * what we are left \nwith is a portrait that grows cloudier by the day of an administration \nthat always dodges full disclosure.''\n  I suggest that comment by the New York Times corresponds with my \nresponse to the Senator from Maryland about the latest White House \nletter that says ``We have said all along that we are prepared to make \nthe notes public.''\n  On the 7th of December, the next day, the Washington Post has an \neditorial entitled ``The White House Mess.'' This editorial states \n``And the conflicting statements keep coming. That is the problem. Ms. \nWilliams told the Senate Whitewater Committee this summer that she has \ngiven the Clintons' lawyer access to some 24 files found in Mr. \nFoster's office that contained personal matters of the Clintons. But \nshe did not say that she was with him when he reviewed the files or \nthat the review occurred in the first family's residence, as he now \nmaintains.'' The editorial continues with the specifics of that \nparticular comment.\n  How does this editorial conclude following on the editorial of the \nNew York Times? ``Has the White House, through these twists, managed to \nthrow suspicion over matters of little consequence, or is there \nsomething serious being covered up? The question is everywhere these \ndays, in large part because of all of the improbable and implausible \nresponses that have been made to inquiries so far. If the White House \ncan clear them up, it surely should. Congress and the independent \ncounsel are clearly not going to let things stand as they are now.''\n  That was the Washington Post on Pearl Harbor day, the 7th of \nDecember. \n\n[[Page S18950]]\n\n  We go on to the 12th of December. The New York Times again, in an \neditorial entitled ``Traveling Whitewater Files,'' talks about the \nmysterious movement of files back and forth from closet to attorneys' \noffices and back to attorneys with occasional stops at basements of \nother attorneys. And it concludes with the point we have been \ndiscussing at such length here this morning, Mr. President. ``To be \nsure, citizen Bill Clinton is entitled to litigate all he wants and to \nclaim whatever privacy the courts will give him. But President Clinton, \nthe politician and national leader, cannot expect the public to be \nreassured by mysteriously mobile files and promises of openness that \ndisappear behind the lawyer-client veil.''\n  Then we go on. We get closer to today. On the 14th of December, the \nWashington Post has an editorial entitled ``Now a Subpoena \nControversy.'' It begins, ``In refusing to honor a Senate Whitewater \nCommittee subpoena for notes taken by then-White House associate \ncounsel William Kennedy during a November 5, 1993, meeting between \nWhite House officials and the Clintons' attorneys, the administration \nrisks traveling down a familiar dead end.''\n  The Washington Post apparently is losing patience.\n  The final comment of this editorial is: ``The overriding interest is \nto get at the truth. If, however, a satisfactory solution cannot be \nreached, then the courts must decide. It shouldn't have to come to \nthat.''\n  Apparently, the lawyers that advise the editorial writers for the \nWashington Post are not as easily convinced as the lawyers who have \nsent their opinions to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Just yesterday, in the New York Times again, the editorial is headed \n``Averting a Constitutional Clash.'' And I quote: ``If Mr. Clinton \nrelinquishes the documents, it would be a positive departure from the \nevasive tactics that have marked the Clintons' handling of questions \nabout Whitewater since the 1992 campaign.''\n  ``Mr. Clinton's assertion that the subpoenaed material is protected \nby lawyer-client privilege, and his quieter claim of executive \nprivilege, are legally dubious and risk a damaging precedent.''\n  Now, I cannot argue that the New York Times is as distinguished a \nlegal source as the lawyer who gave the opinion that the Senator from \nMaryland quoted, but again the lawyers who advise the editorial writers \nin the New York Times must have looked at this and they find it, to \nquote, ``Legally dubious, risking a damaging precedent.''\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Will my colleague yield----\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Just for an observation. Given the posture which the \nWhite House has taken and given the difficulty we have had in getting \ndocuments or information, given the dubious claim as it relates to \nlawyer-client privilege, is it not even harder for us, the committee, \nto accept this claim in light of the President's public statements as \nit relates to not raising privilege as a manner by which to protect \ndocuments? Does this impact on the Senator?\n  This is a statement that comes from the President on March 8, 1994, \nwhen he is appointing Lloyd Cutler, and the question was, was he going \nto invoke Executive privilege or a lawyer-client relationship \nprivilege, and he ends up with, as his answer, he says, ``It's hard for \nme to imagine circumstances in which that would be an appropriate thing \nfor me to do.''\n  Does this square then, Ms. Sherburne raising this, with what the \nPresident has said, that he would not--it is hard for him to imagine \nraising that privilege?\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator is correct to raise that quote in this \ncontext. It simply demonstrates that there are now some circumstances \nthat the President was unable to imagine that long time ago because he \nhas now asserted the privilege and we confront it.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. The meeting took place. He was aware of this meeting, \nobviously.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I believe he was aware of the meeting.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. This meeting took place well before, in November, and he \nmade the statement in March. So he was aware of the meeting. It was not \na circumstance that took place after the meeting.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I do not wish to be flippant about these matters because \nthey are important matters, but I find myself saying the lapse of \nmemory seems to fit a pattern that we have seen from other people in \nthe White House.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, going back to the editorial in the New \nYork Times of yesterday, after they made the statement that I have \nquoted about the legally dubious claims, they conclude that editorial \nwith this comment cutting straight to the issue that we are talking \nabout today on the floor:\n\n       It should still be possible to make arrangements before \n     tomorrow when the Senate is due to take up the matter. If \n     not, the Senate has no choice but to vote to go to court to \n     enforce the committee's subpoena.\n\n  Now, I have gone to the trouble of quoting all of these editorials \nleading up to this to indicate that this is not a sudden decision on \nthe part of the editorial writers of the New York Times or I would \nassume the Washington Post, whose stream of editorials has gone the \nsame way. As I say, I have not quoted from all of the papers that have \nbeen considered to be Republican friendly. I have quoted from papers \nthat would normally be expected to take the President's side on this \nissue, and I find it somewhat interesting that the leader of those \npapers concludes its editorial by saying that the Senate has no choice \nbut to vote to go to court and enforce the committee's subpoena. I see \nmy friend from Connecticut rising.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Under the same procedure, Mr. President, that it is \nunderstood I would not lose my right to the floor, I will be happy to \nengage in whatever colloquy and debate my friend from Connecticut may \ndesire.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Utah, Mr. President.\n  I just ask my colleague if he could enlighten us on whether the media \nhave ever taken a position, on any matter where access to documents was \nthe issue, they should not have total access to everything they want?\n  Going back over time, when the issue was attorney-client privilege or \nexecutive privilege, can the Senator cite to me an editorial from the \nNew York Times or the Washington Post or any other paper where the \npaper did not think they ought to have unfettered access to documents? \nMy point is that the media always want all of the documents. So we \nshould expect to see the editorials my colleague cites.\n  Does my colleague disagree with me that, unlike legal scholars who \nlook at constitutional issues, the press always takes the position that \nmaterials should be turned over?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have not done that kind of research. I will go back \nand take a look at the past media circumstance. It is my impression \nthat no one has called for breaching the attorney-client privilege for \nthe President or anybody else; that the concern here has to do with \nwhether or not that privilege extends to Government lawyers. I do not \nknow of anybody in the media who would say that if the meeting was \nconfined entirely to the President and the lawyers who had been hired \nby him and are being paid by him to represent him in his personal \nmatters, the notes should be turned over. I have not had anybody say \nthat to me. The issue is whether or not the presence of Government \nlawyers at the meeting so changed the nature of the meeting as to make \nit appropriate for the committee to ask for those notes.\n  So I understand the point that my friend from Connecticut is making, \nand I am sure that he is correct in terms of the institutional bias of \nthe press. I would stop short of saying that it applies to violating \nall kinds of privilege. I think it applies to the narrow issue here as \nto what happens by virtue of the Government lawyers having been \npresent.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me further inquire. I appreciate my colleague's \ngenerosity in allowing me to inquire. As I understand this particular \npoint, we are down to basically one problem that stands in the way of \nan agreement--we need the House to agree that the release of the notes \nby the White House will not constitute a general waiver of the \nattorney-client privilege. That seems like a small problem to work \n\n[[Page S18951]]\nout. Clearly, we would all like to avoid having to take this matter to \nthe courts. After all, precedent suggests they may just throw it back \nin our lap and say ``resolve it.'' So we spend 2 months on this issue \nand we are back where we started.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Two months, if we are lucky.\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague from Utah is probably correct. As I understand \nit, the independent counsel has already reached an agreement with the \nWhite House. It occurs to me that if the independent counsel, which has \na prosecutorial function, can reach an agreement, than the \ncongressional committees, whose fundamental function is legislative, \nshould also be able to reach an agreement. If the independent counsel \nis satisfied with the agreement, then we should also be able to reach \nan agreement.\n  I am just curious as to why it would not be in our interest to take \nsome time to have the conversation with our colleagues in the other \nbody who are apparently resisting this to see if we can work out an \nagreement and put this issue behind us.\n  Is there some compelling reason why we ought not try to do that? If \nthe independent counsel said this is totally unacceptable, I need the \nsubpoenas, I can almost understand at that point why we would have to \ngo through this process. But that is not the case. I ask my colleague \nif he would not agree with that.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. I say to my colleague that I would be happy to sit down \nwith him if it were just the two of us and see if we could arrive at an \nagreement on that point. I have learned long since, even though I am a \nrelatively new Member here, not to try to guess what the House will do \nunder any circumstance.\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague has become very wise in the few years he has \nbeen here.\n  Mr. BENNETT. So I would not presume to try to give instructions to my \ncolleagues in the House. But I think it is appropriate that we have \nthese kinds of conversations. I think the Senator from Connecticut \nraises a very logical course of action that we should consider.\n  But I am not prepared to remove the pressure that the existence of \nthis vote creates toward getting a solution because, as I said to the \nsenior Senator from Maryland, in my opinion, the movement to which he \nrefers would not have taken place if the committee had not taken the \ntough stance that it has taken.\n  The movement that we have seen in the White House position in just \nthe last 24 hours, I believe, is attributable to the pending vote that \nwe are going to take. If we take the vote and the White House and the \nHouse can come to some kind of a conclusion, then the subpoena called \nfor in this vote is rendered mute and the matter is taken care of. But \nI would rather not remove the pressure that this vote represents until \nafter the agreement is reached because I believe that the pressure of \nthis vote has had a salutary effect in moving us toward that.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for the time he has given.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I had not planned to go on this long.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator yield on this point? I think there is \na chance, once the vote is taken and the matter is sent to the court, \nthen the people may say, ``Well, let the court decide it.'' And if the \ncourt decides it, first, you do not know what opinion you will get. \nThat is, people make their reasonable calculations. Second, the \ntimeframe then becomes quite extended.\n  It seems to me, given all the admonitions about trying to avoid a \nconfrontation between the executive and the legislative branches, it \nwould behoove us to do that because I think we are at a point right now \nwhere that opportunity is right here in front of us.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator has raised a possibility which may indeed \nturn out to be the outcome. The matter becomes a matter of judgment as \nto which scenario you believe is the one that will play out, the one I \nhave posited or the one that the Senator from Maryland has posited. And \nwe will all have to vote and see which of those two scenarios is the \none that comes about.\n  Mr. President, I had not planned to go on this long. I will be happy \nto yield again to my colleague from Connecticut, but I would like to \nwrap up.\n  Mr. DODD. I will seek recognition later in my own right. I thank my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, before I leave the quotations from the media, I must \nshare with my colleagues one last editorial which comes from a source \nthat is clearly not generally favorable to Republican positions, from a \nman whose writings I am not familiar with. However, I can catch the \nflavor of his position simply from reading this particular editorial. \nHis name is James M. Klurfeld. He is the editorial page editor for \nNewsday. I will just quote a few comments, but I think it summarizes \nwhat is happening on this issue.\n  He says:\n\n       I have to admit that I haven't paid that much attention to \n     the Whitewater investigation. That is not only because it's \n     too complicated to figure out, but also because an essential \n     element of any real scandal is missing: the anticipation that \n     the high and the mighty are about to be brought down. There \n     has been, to be blunt, no scent of blood. Until now.\n\n  Mr. Klurfeld then goes on to recite some of the specifics of what has \ncome up. He says:\n\n       At the crux of the Whitewater investigation is whether they \n     knowingly got money from the Whitewater-related projects and \n     mixed it illegally with campaign money for a gubernatorial \n     re-election campaign. That case has not been made. But there \n     has always been a second Whitewater issue: whether the \n     Clintons have abused the power of the White House to obstruct \n     the investigation. And here things begin to look more \n     troubling. There are credible allegations of files removed \n     from the White House, of improper interference with the \n     investigation of Foster's death and, most recently, the White \n     House has refused to give memos of conversations involving \n     the Whitewater matter to the Senate committee, first claiming \n     lawyer-client privileges and now invoking the doctrine of \n     executive privilege.\n\n  He continues later on in the article:\n\n       What keeps nagging at me is that if my first assumption is \n     true--that there is no criminal wrongdoing involved in the \n     matter--then why is the White House and Hillary Clinton, in \n     particular, so reluctant to come clean about everything? What \n     does she have to hide? Why not just open all the files? After \n     all, Hillary Clinton worked as an investigator on the \n     Watergate matter. We all know she as smart and as sharp as \n     any lawyer in Washington, let alone Little Rock. She knows, \n     as we all know, Richard Nixon got caught up by the coverup of \n     Watergate, not the burglary itself. It is inconceivable she \n     would blunder into the same type of mistake. Unless, of \n     course, there is something to hide. Then a cover-up makes \n     sense, at least from her point of view.\n\n  Once again we find a pattern. Mr. President, I quote the summary \nsentence. Mr Klurfeld says:\n\n       There are enough unanswered questions and White House \n     evasions to justify further investigation. And I am ready to \n     pay some attention to it.\n\n  The one area that has struck me as I have listened to this whole \nthing, that for some reason reached out and grabbed my attention, \nconcerns the law firm records relating to Mrs. Clinton's billing for \nher services to Madison Guaranty. This first came up, Mr. President, \nwhen Mr. Hubbell was before our committee, and as part of the documents \nthat were furnished to us at that time, we received a summary--recap, \nto use the word that is on the document--a recap of fees, from Madison \nSavings and Loan, and then typed below it says ``FINAL RECAP.'' And \nthat is in all caps.\n  Understand, Mr. President, to put it in context, this is the legal \nwork for which Mr. McDougal has said Mrs. Clinton was paid a retainer \nof $2,000 a month. Mr. McDougal's testimony was that then-Governor Bill \nClinton came to him and said, ``We're having financial troubles. Can \nyou get Hillary some money?'' And he said, ``I'll pay $2,000 a month to \nthe Rose law firm. And she can handle the Madison affairs.''\n  To be clear in the Record, denial from the Clintons that this ever \nhappened has been entered in the record. So it is Mr. McDougal's word \nagainst the Clintons' word on that particular issue. But nonetheless, \nin the documents that came from Mr. Hubbell, here is the final recap of \nfees paid.\n  When Mrs. Clinton was asked about these fees, she said--and I am \nquoting from her press conference--``The young bank officer did all the \nwork. And the letter was sent, but because I was what you call the \nbilling attorney--in other words, I had to send the bill to get the \n\n[[Page S18952]]\npayment made, my name was put on the bottom of the letter.''\n  The strong implication there, you see, is she did little or no work, \nshe simply signed the letter because she was the billing partner, and \nthe client did not want to pay a bill if it was from an associate.\n  In an interview with the Office of Inspector General at the FDIC on \nthe same matter, we find this characterization: ``Mrs. Clinton \nindicated she did not consider herself to be the attorney of record for \nRose's representation of Madison before the ASD and presumed it to be \nRick Massey. She recalled Massey came to her and asked her to be the \nbilling attorney, which was a normal practice when an associate was \nhandling a matter.''\n  Then, Mr. President, in her affidavit on this matter that was given \nto the FDIC Office of Inspector General, she, being duly sworn, says, \n``While I was the billing partner on this matter, the great bulk of the \nwork was done by Mr. Richard Massey, who was then an associate at Rose \nand whose specialty was securities law.''\n  ``I was not involved in the day-to-day work on the project. My \nknowledge of the events concerning this representation, as set forth in \nthis Answer, has been largely derived from a review of the relevant \ndocuments, rather than my contemporaneous involvement in the \nrepresentation since Mr. Massey primarily handled the matter.''\n  The reason this is important, Mr. President, is that Mrs. Clinton \nclearly had some relevant documents she reviewed in order to conclude \nthat she was not involved in the day-to-day work on the Madison matter. \nShe had no contemporaneous memory of it. She had to go back to the \nrelevant documents.\n  Now we have what I consider to be two relevant documents, and the \nfirst one is the one that came before the committee, the recap of fees \nfor Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. I questioned Mr. Hubbell about \nthis at some length, and Mr. Hubbell finally said, ``Senator, I \napologize that I am unable to articulate to you exactly the way things \nare handled so that you can really understand what happened.''\n  I said, ``Mr. Hubbell, I'm sorry, I can't articulate to you my \nreaction to these numbers. I am not a lawyer. I have never made out a \ntime sheet, but I have paid lots of legal bills. I think I can read a \ntime sheet.'' And I went over this as I would if it were submitted to \nme, and I find the following, Mr. President.\n  In the total amounts covered by this final recap, the amount billed \nby Mr. Massey by name is $5,000, rounded. I have not added up the odd \ndollars and cents, but I have rounded it. Mr. Massey, over the period \nof this representation by the Rose law firm, billed around $5,000. Mrs. \nClinton, in that same period, billed approximately $7,700. She says she \nreviewed relevant documents that refreshed her memory, but that she was \nnothing more than the billing partner and that the work was done by Mr. \nMassey. But from these billings, Madison Guaranty was billed in Mr. \nMassey's name for around $5,000. If Mrs. Clinton was just the billing \npartner who signed for him, all of the billing should be in her name \nand his name should not appear. But if he is billing in his own name, \nthen why was it necessary for her to bill significantly more than he \ndid, if he was the one doing all the work?\n  There is an interesting pattern here, Mr. President, because in the \nmonth of May, Mr. Massey billed $695, Mrs. Clinton, $840. Thus Mrs. \nClinton billed more than Mr. Massey when the account was brought in.\n  Then very dramatically the pattern changes. In June, she only billed \n$60. I assume that is a half hour's worth of work. Mr. Massey, $186. In \nJuly, she billed $144, he billed 10 times that, $1,400, and so on. Mr. \nMassey, in November billed $552; Mrs. Clinton does not appear. In \nDecember, he billed over a thousand; she billed around $4,200.\n  Then it changes very dramatically and Mr. Massey disappears, as Mrs. \nClinton starts billing heavy-hitter numbers to the point where at the \nbottom of the sheet, when you add it all up, Mr. Massey billed around \n$5,000. Mrs. Clinton has billed around $7,700.\n  The other contemporary document which we have been able to obtain, \nwhich presumably Mrs. Clinton had available to her as she refreshed her \nmemory, was the document that came before the committee this week where \nSusan Thomases took notes on a conversation during the campaign with \nWeb Hubbell. These notes are very revealing against the background I \nhave just outlined.\n  This is what Susan Thomases testified Mr. Hubbell told her. She made \nit clear she did not know whether this was the truth or not; she was \nsimply recording what she was told. To put it in context, Mr. \nPresident, her assignment on the campaign at the time this conversation \ntook place was damage control over the Whitewater controversy.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield on that point?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Surely.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate going into these matters. As I understand it, \nwe are debating the issue of subpoenas. We are kind of revisiting what \nwe went over in the committee. My colleague has a right to do it. I am \nnot suggesting he does not. I would like to debate the issue of \nsubpoenas--that is what draws us to the floor today--instead of \nrehashing billing questions. At some point, are we going to get to the \nissue of subpoenas?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I say to my colleague, I will get to it as quickly as I \ncan. If I had not had the exchanges I had, I would have been through \nwith this a long time ago.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Having started, I want to finish the point, and I think \nit important all Members of the Senate find out about this because it \ngoes to the heart of why we are having this conversation at all.\n  Here are the notes that Ms. Thomases took of her telephone \nconversation with Web Hubbell: ``Massey has relationship with Latham \nand Hillary Clinton had relationship with McDougal. Rick''--that is to \nsay Massey--``will say he had relationship with Latham and had a lot to \ndo with getting the client in.''\n  These are the notes of the damage control person. ``This is what \nwe're going to say about how Madison Guaranty came to the Rose law \nfirm: Rick will say he had relationship with Latham and had a lot to do \nwith getting the client in. She did all the billing. Hillary Clinton \nhad number of conferences with Latham, Massey, and McDougal on both \ntransactions. She reviewed some documents. She had one telephone \nconversation in 4-85 beginning of the deal with Bev.''\n  Bev is the appropriate Arkansas State regulator handling these \nmatters.\n  ``Neither deal went through. Broker dealer was opposed by staff but \napproved by Bev under certain conditions which they never met.''\n  Now here is a crucial sentence for me: ``But for Massey, it would not \nhave been there. Rose firm prohibited from filing examiner's report.'' \nAnd at the bottom: ``Hillary Clinton was billing partner and attended \nconferences. He''--I am assuming ``he'' is Massey--``he had a major \nrole blank hours versus Hillary Clinton's blank hours.''\n  We are trying to fill in the blank, and the only document we have \nwith which to fill in the blank goes contrary to these notes. That is, \nMrs. Clinton's hours are greater than Mr. Massey's hours rather than \nless. But the interesting thing for me is the statement flat out: \n``Rick will say he had relationship with Latham and had a lot to do \nwith getting the client in.''\n  Later on: ``But for Massey, it would not have been there.''\n  The December 18 New York Times has the following comment:\n\n       In her 1992 notes, Ms. Thomases records how top campaign \n     officials discussed how to answer questions about Madison and \n     the Rose firm.\n       Her notes show that Mr. Hubbell told her that an associate \n     in the firm, Richard Massey, ``will say he had a lot to do \n     with getting client in.'' Mrs. Clinton has also said, in \n     sworn testimony to regulators, that Mr. Massey brought in \n     Madison as a client. But Mr. Massey, now a partner in the \n     Rose firm, has told Federal investigators that he does not \n     know how the firm came to represent Madison.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, I think the Senator from Connecticut makes an \nappropriate point, and we should not rehash everything that happened in \nthe hearings. I will now step down. But I go through all of this to \ndemonstrate my conviction that pressure from the committee has been \nessential to the forthcoming of documents. Whether the \n\n[[Page S18953]]\npressure has been continued badgering by the majority staff or whether \nit has been formal subpoenas or threats of subpoenas, it has taken \npressure every step of the way for us to get documents. And in every \ncase, when we have come close to getting a resolution to an issue, we \nwere told, ``Well, that document does not exist,'' or ``I do not \nremember.'' And we find the same circumstance here. After we discussed \nthe conflicting evidence, Web Hubbell told me, ``The only way you are \ngoing to find out what really happened, Senator, is to get the original \nbilling sheets.'' We now find that the original billing sheets do not \nexist.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Alabama [Mr. \nShelby] is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, point of order. This Senator was standing, \nand I have been here for some time to speak. Also, are we not going \nback and forth on either side of this matter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has made a point of order. It is \nmy understanding that it is in the Chair's discretion to recognize the \nSenator from Alabama. I am advised that he has been here for 2 hours, \nwhich is a significantly longer period of time than the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, it is not surprising to me today that we \nare where we are today--forced to seek enforcement in the courts of a \nsubpoena for documents from the White House.\n  It is no surprise to me, Mr. President, because the White House's \nrefusal to release the notes sought under this resolution is part and \nparcel of this administration's consistent and continuous way of \noperating, its modus operandi, if you will, on how to cooperate with \nthe special committee without really cooperating.\n  It goes something like this: ``Do not give up any information or \ndocuments unless you absolutely have to, and if forced to give them up, \nrelease it to the press first with your spin on it before giving it to \nthe committee.''\n  Mr. President, throughout the committee's investigation, witnesses \nfrom the White House have come before the committee and, en masse, \nfailed to recollect, remember, or to recall important meetings, \nconversations, and phone calls.\n  We have so much testimony on the record, reciting the lines, ``I \ncannot remember, I do not recall, I do not have a specific \nrecollection,'' that you would begin to wonder whether amnesia is, in \nfact, contagious.\n  We had the dance of the seven veils from the White House witnesses, \nwhom the committee was being forced to recall every time a new document \nor phone log previously unattainable mysteriously appeared in some way.\n  Interestingly, Mr. President, while White House officials were \nsuffering under the debilitating loss of memory, or selective memory, \ncareer prosecutors and law enforcement personnel were able to remember \nphone calls, conversations, and meetings with great specificity.\n  Quite frankly, the testimony before the committee has come to be the \ntale of two stories. One story was told by the Clintons' political \nappointees and long-time business partners and friends, versus the \nstory told by career professionals, civil servants, law enforcement \npersonnel and, yes, investigators.\n  Mr. President, this wholesale memory loss, evasive answers, and \nclaims of privilege against document production sounds strangely \nfamiliar, does it not?\n  Indeed, Mr. President, in the past couple of weeks I have noted what \nI believe is an increasing similarity between this White House and the \nNixon White House. In my view, the committee's need to enforce the \nsubpoena for the notes only reinforces the Nixonian comparison.\n  Last week, during the committee hearing on Whitewater, I compared \nsome of the arguments that Mr. Clinton has made with the arguments that \nMr. Nixon made in support of Executive privilege in 1973 and 1974. Now, \nsome have suggested that this is purely a political exercise. But the \nfact is, Mr. President, that this is the first time that such a \ndefense--that I am aware of--has been raised since the Nixon \nadministration.\n  Furthermore, this same defense of privilege has been tried and tested \nin the courts, and it has failed. The comparison is, therefore, self-\nevident, Mr. President, and the exercise rather instructive, giving all \nof us an opportunity to examine the reasonableness of the White House's \nclaim of attorney-client and possibly Executive privilege.\n  I would like to share some of the quotes with you. First, this is \nPresident Nixon's response to a question from a UPI reporter on March \n15, 1973.\n  He said:\n\n       Mr. Dean is counsel to the White House. He is also one who \n     was counsel to a number of people on the White House staff. \n     He has, in effect, what I would call a double privilege, the \n     lawyer-client privilege relationship, as well as the \n     Presidential privilege.\n\n  Those were the words of President Nixon. Compare those with the \nfollowing words, which were sent up to the committee by the White House \non December 12, 1995:\n\n       The presence of White House lawyers at the meeting does not \n     destroy the attorney-client privilege. On the contrary, \n     because of the presence of White House lawyers, who \n     themselves enjoy a privileged relationship with the President \n     and who are his agents, was in furtherance of Mr. Kendall's \n     and White House counsel's provision of effective legal advice \n     to their mutual client, their presence reinforced, rather \n     than contradicted, the meeting's privileged nature.\n\n  Think about that just a minute. Compare them in your own mind.\n  I will read President Nixon's address to the Nation announcing an \nanswer to the House Judiciary Committee subpoena for additional \nPresidential tape recordings on April 29, 1974.\n  President Nixon said:\n\n       Unless a President can protect the privacy of the advice he \n     gets, he cannot get the advice he needs. This principle is \n     recognized in the constitutional doctrine of executive \n     privilege, which has been defended and maintained by every \n     President since Washington and which has been recognized by \n     the courts, whenever tested, as inherent in the Presidency.\n\n  Let us compare Nixon's statement to the White House brief on behalf \nof President Clinton to the committee, December 12, 1995:\n\n       If notes of this type of meeting are accessible to a \n     congressional investigating committee, then the White House \n     counsel could never communicate, in confidence on behalf of \n     the President, with the President's private counsel, even \n     when the discussions in question are properly within the \n     scope of the official duties of the governmental lawyers. \n     Such a rule would deprive the White House counsel of the \n     ability to advise the President and his White House staff \n     most effectively regarding matters affecting the performance \n     of their constitutional duties.\n\n  You be the judge. The words of Nixon and the words on behalf of \nPresident Clinton.\n  I will now share with you a statement President Nixon made to \nreporters' questions, the National Association of Broadcasters, on \nMarch 19, 1974:\n\n       Now, I realize that many think, and I understand that, that \n     this is simply a way of hiding information that they should \n     be entitled to, but that isn't the real reason. The reason \n     goes far deeper than that. In order to make decisions that a \n     President must make, he must have free, uninhibited \n     conversation with his advisers and others.\n\n  The words of President Nixon. Compare those with the words of the \nWhite House brief on behalf of President Clinton, December 12, 1995:\n\n       The committee's action also implicates important \n     governmental interests--namely, first, the ability of White \n     House counsel to discuss in confidence with the President's \n     private counsel matters of common interest that indisputably \n     bear on both the proper performance of executive branch \n     duties and the personal legal interests of the President, and \n     second, the ability of White House counsel to provide \n     effective legal advice to the President about matters within \n     the scope of their duties, including the proper response of \n     executive branch officials to inquiries and investigations \n     arising out of the President's private legal interests.\n\n  Again, ``Private legal interests.'' Compare, again; you be the judge \nof the similarity.\n  Now, from the words of President Nixon in a letter responding to the \nHouse Judiciary Committee subpoenas requiring production of \nPresidential tape recordings and documents, June 10, 1974. What did he \nsay?\n\n       From the start of these proceedings, I have tried to \n     cooperate as far as I reasonably could in order to avert a \n     constitutional confrontation. But I am determined to do \n     nothing which, by the precedents it set, would render the \n     executive branch, henceforth and forevermore, subservient to \n     the legislative branch, and would thereby destroy the \n     constitutional balance. This is the key issue in \n\n[[Page S18954]]\n     my insistence that the executive must remain the final arbiter of \n     demands in its confidentiality, just as the legislative and \n     judicial branches must remain the final arbiters of demand on \n     their confidentiality.\n\n  The word of President Nixon.\n  Now, in the brief on behalf of President Clinton to the committee, \nDecember 12, 1995:\n\n       In a spirit of openness and with considerable expenditure \n     of resources, the White House has produced thousands of pages \n     of documents and made scores of White House officials \n     available for testimony, foregoing assertion of applicable \n     privileges. In view of this cooperation, the committee's \n     attempt, after 18 months, to invade the relationship between \n     the President and his private counsel smacks of an effort to \n     force a claim of privilege by the President, who must assert \n     that right to avoiding risking the loss, in all fora, of his \n     confidential relationship with his lawyer.\n\n  Now, you compare it. You have seen the words and the comparison. I \nthink they are relevant. This comparison, I believe, Mr. President, is \nself-evident and the exercise rather instructive.\n  I do not know whether the Clinton administration has anything to \nhide. But I do know this: The first administration to use these \narguments certainly did have something to hide, and we know what \nhappened there.\n  If the White House does not have anything to hide, and I hope they do \nnot, if there is nothing of substance in these notes, nothing damaging \nin these notes as they claim, then they should comply with the subpoena \nand produce them to the committee without any reservations, without any \nconditions, because, Mr. President, if there is nothing damaging in \nthese notes, it is incomprehensible to me why they would raise a \ndefense clearly rejected over 20 years ago.\n  Mr. President, I also would ask unanimous consent that a letter from \nMr. Hamilton, to the President, dated January 5, 1994 be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, December 14, 1995.\n     Michael Chertoff,\n     Special Counsel.\n     Richard Ben-Veniste,\n     Minority Special Counsel, U.S. Senate, Special Committee to \n         Investigate Whitewater Development Corporation and \n         Related Matters, Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Gentlemen: Pursuant to the agreement described in my letter \n     to Mr. Chertoff of December 13, 1995, I am enclosing copies \n     of the January 5, 1994, letter from James Hamilton to the \n     President (S 012511-S 012516).\n       Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Jane C. Sherburne,\n     Special Counsel to the President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                             Swidler & Berlin,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 5, 1994.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: At Renaissance you asked for my ideas \n     on management of the Whitewater and trooper matters. This \n     responds.\n       As a preface let me mention that, because of my \n     representation of the Foster family, I've had numerous calls \n     from the media about these issues and thus know the views \n     that some of them hold. Let me also say that, so far, the \n     White House generally has handled these matters well.\n       Here are my ideas, some of which are obvious and have been \n     implemented, but perhaps bear repeating.\n       1. Despite the falsity of the allegations, these remain \n     treacherous matters, L.A. Times reporters basically believe \n     the troopers (although this confidence should now be shaken). \n     Washington Post reporters consider the Lyons report a \n     ``joke'' because of its incompleteness, and suspect a cover-\n     up when it is cited in response to current inquiries. \n     Reporters are intrigued by Vince's inexplicable death, and \n     thus continue to search for Whitewater connections.\n       2. Investigations, like other significant matters, must be \n     carefully managed. One person in the White House (Bruce, I \n     assume) should be assigned responsibility for coordinating \n     information gathering, responses to official inquiries and \n     public statements about these matters. This cannot be treated \n     as an incidental assignment.\n       3. The White House should say as little and produce as few \n     documents as possible to the press. Statements and documents \n     likely will be incomplete or inclusive, and could just fuel \n     the fires.\n       4. The White House should ensure that what statements it \n     does make are consistent and coordinated. Erroneous or \n     conflicting statements could be disastrous; the Nixon White \n     House brought huge trouble upon itself by issuing inaccurate, \n     inconsistent statements about Watergate. The Washington Times \n     in particular has been dissecting current White House \n     communications.\n       5. Responses to official inquiries--both written and oral--\n     must be carefully made. Even oral misstatements could result \n     in investigations and sanctions. Moreover, the Department of \n     Justice, FBI and Park Police all leak unconscionably (and \n     already have as to these matters), and some officials \n     obviously are inclined to attack the White House's handling \n     of the inquiries.\n       6. The White House should not forget that attorney-client \n     and executive privileges are legitimate doctrines in proper \n     contexts. While the on-going release of Whitewater documents \n     to Justice seems appropriate, Bernie initially acted properly \n     in protecting the contents of Vince's files.\n       7. If politically possible, Janet Reno should stick to her \n     guns in not appointing an independent counsel for Whitewater. \n     An independent counsel--who might pursue his or her self-\n     aggrandizement rather than the truth--is a recipe for \n     trouble.\n       8. The White House must let Justice do its investigation \n     without interference. Any hint of attempts at interdiction or \n     manipulation would raise the spectre of Watergate.\n       9. The White House also should avoid any future contacts \n     with subjects of the investigation that might provoke cover-\n     up allegations.\n       10. You should continue to demonstrate that you are engaged \n     fully in the business of running the government and not \n     distracted by these side shows. If the press senses concern, \n     its efforts redouble.\n       11. Because you will continue to receive reporter questions \n     about these matters, I respectfully suggest that you always \n     be prepared personally with a response to the issues of the \n     day. I expect that ``no further comment'' often will suffice.\n       I hope the above views are at least somewhat useful. \n     Kristina and I hugely enjoyed the opportunity to visit and \n     recreate with you and Hillary in Hilton Head. The football \n     game was stupendous fun; the ``scrum play'' was the call of \n     the day. I only wish the rest of America knew you as the \n     Renaissance family does and had heard your moving remarks on \n     Saturday night.\n           Best regards,\n                                                   James Hamilton.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, just to paraphrase some of it, not all of \nit, in this advice to the President by Mr. Hamilton, the attorney:\n\n       The White House should say as little and produce as few \n     documents as possible to the press. Statements and documents \n     likely will be incomplete or inconclusive, and could just \n     fuel the fire.\n\n  Listen to this advice to the President:\n\n       The White House should ensure that what statements it does \n     make are consistent and coordinated. Erroneous or conflicting \n     statements could be disastrous; the Nixon White House brought \n     huge trouble upon itself by issuing inaccurate, inconsistent \n     statements about Watergate. The Washington Times in \n     particular has dissecting current White House communications.\n\n  Then, item No. 6 on the advice to the President:\n\n       The White House should not forget that attorney-client and \n     executive privileges are legitimate doctrines in proper \n     contexts. While the ongoing release of Whitewater documents \n     to Justice seems appropriate, Bernie initially acted properly \n     in protecting the contents of Vince's files.\n\n  Item 11:\n\n       Because you will continue to receive reporter questions \n     about these matters, I respectfully suggest that you always \n     be prepared personally with a response to the issues of the \n     day. I expect that ``no further comment'' often will suffice.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, item No. 2, back on the first page of the letter \nwhich I have introduced, to the President by Mr. Hamilton says:\n\n       Investigations, like other significant matters, must be \n     carefully managed. One person in the White House, (Bruce I \n     assume) should be assigned responsibility for coordinating \n     information gathering, responses to official inquiries and \n     public statements about these matters. This cannot be treated \n     as an incidental assignment.\n\n  However, Mr. President, rather than heeding the advice, this advice \nwhich has, in fact, led to the same mistakes that the Nixon White House \nmade, I think the White House should be forthcoming on these subpoenas. \nIf they have nothing to hide, and I hope they do not, why go through \nthe exercise? Why go through this?\n  What are we interested in, Mr. President, as this committee? We are \nlooking at the truth of what went on. Did they have information that \nthey should not have had? Where did they get this information? I \nbelieve the President would serve himself well and the American people \nif he produced these documents with no conditions, without reservation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin by addressing some of the \nissues that have been raised by my colleague from Alabama.\n  Clearly, anytime there is a confrontation between the executive \n\n[[Page S18955]]\n  branch and the legislative branch, which oftentimes happens, people are \ngoing to make similar arguments. We should not be surprised if some \nstatements sound similar.\n  But comparing Watergate and Whitewater is just ridiculous in the mind \nof this Senator--there is just no comparison whatsoever. When someone \ntries to make that sort of comparison they are just creating some sort \nof sideshow.\n  The comparison is spurious. First, no one ever sought to invade the \nattorney-client privilege of President Nixon. President Nixon raised \nthe issue of executive privilege. The appropriate committees during \nthat period respected the attorney-client privilege when it was raised. \nNow, Executive privilege was another matter, but attorney-client \nprivilege, even in Watergate, was never breached.\n  Second, when the executive privilege claims of President Nixon were \novercome, it was only through a grand jury subpoena issued by Special \nProsecutor Cox. As I mentioned earlier, the independent counsel in our \ncase has reached an agreement with the White House concerning the notes \nthat are at issue in the subpoena. So the situation is completely \ndifferent.\n  Also, during the Watergate matter, the Senate's attempt to get the \nmaterial obtained by Special Prosecutor Cox was rebuffed by the courts.\n  Finally, the Special Prosecutor's efforts to get materials in the \nWatergate matter occurred in the context of overwhelming evidence of \ncriminal conduct--obstruction, misuse of the CIA, FBI, and IRS, the \npayment of hush money, clemency for burglars. By contrast, in the \nWhitewater matter, after months of hearings by the special committee, \nthere is no evidence of impropriety much less illegality by the Clinton \nadministration.\n  In fact, my colleagues may have seen buried away in the newspaper \narticles in the last couple of days, that Pillsbury Madison & Sutro, an \nindependent law firm, just completed a report examining whether there \nshould be any additional civil proceedings against the Clintons with \nregard to Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan and the Whitewater \nDevelopment Corp. The report was commissioned by the RTC and it took 2 \nyears and $4 million for it to be completed. Mr. President, this \nreport, which I am going to ask unanimous consent be printed in this \nRecord--it was made a part of our committee record the other day--goes \ninto great detail, and concludes that no further action should be taken \nagainst the Clintons. It exonerates the Clintons.\n  So, when we compare the obstruction of justice and the great \ncriminality that a special prosecutor saw in Watergate and compare that \nwith this particular case, it just goes to confirm what many people, \nunfortunately, are feeling here. This is becoming a political sideshow, \nand it should not.\n  Every Member has the right to raise whatever issues they want, but I \ndo not think it does us any good as an institution, nor the committee, \nwhen we start drawing comparisons that have no relevancy whatsoever \nwhen it comes to the particular matter that we are being asked to \naddress.\n  Mr. President, let me also address one of the comments that was made \nby my friend and colleague from Utah, Senator Bennett. He said, in \neffect, that we need this kind of pressure to get evidence from the \nwitnesses.\n  Again, I just remind my colleagues here, this year alone we have had \n32 days of hearings and meetings on this matter. Last year we had \nextensive hearings on this matter. We have spent now a total, if you \ntake congressional committees and you take the independent counsel's \nactivities, over the last year or so, we have spent in excess of $25 \nmillion. Let me repeat that, the taxpayers have paid over $25 million \non these investigations. To date, there has been no substantial \nevidence of any illegalities or unethical behavior. That has been the \nconclusion of witness after witness.\n  The White House has submitted to the committee over 15,000 pages of \nofficial records without a single court order being necessary, not one. \nThe President's personal attorney has produced 28,000 pages of \ndocuments. Every witness that has appeared, last year and this year, \nhas come at the urging of the White House. So when my colleague from \nUtah says without the pressure of having a subpoena filed, or the \nSenate as a body taking an action--that is not borne out by the facts.\n  We can disagree with what witnesses say. We may have problems, as the \nchairman has had, with the testimony of a number of witnesses. I \nrespect that. I am not suggesting that we have all agreed with all the \ntestimony. But there is a significant difference between what has \nhappened in this matter, and what has happened in the past. We are all \nfamiliar with previous administrations that fought congressional \ncommittees tooth and nail. That has not been the case here.\n  It is very important, I think, for our colleagues and the public at \nlarge to understand that significant difference. This White House has \nbeen extremely forthcoming, extremely forthcoming when it comes to \ndocuments and when it comes to witnesses appearing before our \ncommittee. So the notion that it would be impossible to get any kind of \nnegotiated result on the issue now before us, based on what has \nhappened previous to this, is not borne out by the facts.\n  To the contrary, we have been able to reach agreement on virtually \nevery other issue that has come before us without having to go to the \ncourts. So, for those of us who stand here today and urge this body and \nurge our colleagues here to try a little bit harder to resolve this \nissue without getting to the courts, that is based on the fact that we \nhave not had to do that yet. We have completed an awful lot of work \nwithout any problems. The committee has taken over 150 depositions and \nover 70 witnesses have appeared before the committee. As the chairman \npointed out the other day in committee, we are basically through with \nthe first two phases, other than some witnesses that need to be brought \nback. But we are prepared now to move to the last phase.\n  So here we have gone through all of this without having to resort to \nthe courts. We are down to a legitimate issue here. The White House is \nnot being obstructionist, this is not Watergate. As our colleague from \nMaryland pointed out, there are significant legal scholars who believe \nthat the executive branch assertion of attorney-client privilege here \nhas merit. In fact, they go to some length and cite the case law and so \nforth that upholds their point. I know there are others who have a \ndifferent point of view. I am not arguing there are others who have a \ndifferent point of view.\n  To the chairman's credit and to his counsel's credit, there has been \nan effort here now to narrow this and get it done. As I said to my \ncolleague from Utah a few minutes ago, the independent counsel now has \nagreed to conditions with the White House. He is satisfied with an \nagreement that will protect the White House from a waiver of the \nattorney-client privilege. Our chairman in our committee would be \nsatisfied with a similar agreement. The one missing link in all of this \nis our colleagues in the other body, to get them to agree to what the \nindependent counsel has agreed to, what the chairman has agreed to, and \nwhat the White House has agreed to; that is, to turn over these \ndocuments with the understanding there has not been a general waiver of \nthe attorney-client privilege.\n  Clearly, it is not unreasonable for the White House to pursue these \nagreements. As has been pointed out by legal experts, there have been a \nnumber of cases where, if you waive the privilege in one instance, it \nis seen as subject matter waiver. So there is a legitimate interest in \ntrying to make sure that, in order to comply with committee's request \nto look at the notes from this meeting, that the President has not \nwaived his attorney-client privilege. Understandably, the President \nwants to avoid a fishing expedition that goes off in a number of \ndirections. All of my colleagues can appreciate that concern.\n  We have to remember that we are setting a precedent with our actions \ntoday. And that precedent could also affect Members of this body. Like \nthe President, we are public officials who have both public and private \nroles. Some of my colleagues on one side of the issue today may change \ntheir minds when, in the future, someone argues that they have waived \ntheir attorney-client privilege in similar circumstances. We can all \nunderstand the \n\n[[Page S18956]]\nPresident's argument, that he needed both his private attorneys and \ncounsel for the Presidency in that meeting in order to properly address \nall of the issues that might arise. As has been noted, legal scholar \nafter legal scholar after legal scholar has said that is an appropriate \ninvocation of that privilege.\n  So it seems to me we ought to try to avoid going to court on this \nissue. That is why we make the strong case we do here. It is not \nbecause someone is trying to hide documents. If that were the case, \nthen I suspect the executive branch might rely on the advice of legal \nexperts and say let us just take it to court. But they have said they \nwill turn over these documents, but do not ask us to waive, on the \nentire subject matter, the attorney-client privilege. We do not want to \ndo that. And I do not blame them for not wanting to do that. I do not \nthink anyone would, given the dangers associated with that particular \napproach.\n  So, I am still hopeful that, given the history of this White House, \nwhen you go back and look over the last 2 years, the dozens and dozens \nof witnesses, the thousands of pages of documents, an agreement can be \nworked out. I hope future administrations will look at how this \nadministration has responded, again, never requiring the committee to \ngo to court, never requiring the committee to drag witnesses in, never \nrequiring the committee to fight for documents. So, with all due \nrespect to my colleague from Utah, because of that cooperation, there \nis an opportunity to resolve this issue short of a vote by the full \nSenate. And the fact that the independent counsel has reached an \nagreement, the fact that the committee could settle for a similar \nagreement, suggests that we ought to try to meet with our colleagues in \nthe House and resolve this matter quickly and efficiently. Lets get the \nnotes and move on so this committee can complete its work.\n  My hope would be in these coming hours here that will be the result. \nSome may say, well, if we can vote on it here, we will put more \npressure on them. There will then be the vote of the U.S. Senate, \nissuing subpoenas where attorney-client privilege has been invoked. I \nthink that is a wrong approach to take on this matter.\n  I point out, Mr. President, I have referred to the Pillsbury Madison \n& Sutro report on the RTC issues. Again, I urge my colleagues to obtain \na copy of this report and to review this report and to examine the \nresults.\n  The Wall Street Journal reported the results the other day.\n  Let me quote, if I can, the Wall Street Journal story on this report:\n\n       President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton had little \n     knowledge and no control over the Whitewater project in which \n     they invested, and they weren't aware that any funds that \n     went to Whitewater may have been taken from Madison. . . . \n     Accordingly, there is no basis to sue them.\n\n  Mr. President, let me emphasize that: ``There is no basis to sue the \nPresident or the First Lady.'' That is not Democrats and Republicans \nsitting there squabbling about this; that is an independent \ninvestigation, which took 2 years, without the glare of hearings and \ncameras, and on the central issue they say that no further civil \nproceedings should take place. That is a very important piece \nconclusion.\n  So, again, I hope in the next few hours that our colleagues would \nadhere to the advice of our colleague from Maryland and others, and \ntake care of this matter without going to the courts. Let us avoid a \ndangerous precedent.\n  I know what is happening here. Some of my colleagues are thinking, \n``Well, you know, we have them on the ropes now. What are you trying to \nhide?''\n  Obviously, that is just politics. We all know that. You can cause \nsome damage with just the photograph of witnesses huddling with \nlawyers. That is titillating. That is exciting stuff. ``Now they are \nbleeding. Now we have them.''\n  That is what we really have going on here now. We ought to try to \navoid that. Our role, fundamentally, is legislative. We conduct \ninvestigations, of course, but that is primarily to help develop \nlegislation. And it seems to me that, where you have a White House that \nis cooperating, you ought to avoid a confrontation with the executive \nbranch.\n  After all, it is not clear what the third branch of government, the \njudiciary, will do. In similar cases, the courts have thrown the matter \nright back to us and have said, ``Look, you people sort this out your \nown way. We are not going to make the decision for you.'' So we may end \nup, after months of squabbling, in no better position than we are in \ntoday.\n  So I urge my colleagues, let us adopt a resolution, if you will, or \nlanguage which would urge us all to stay at that table and resolve this \nover the next few days. I believe we can. As I say, we are down to one \nlast entity here. We are down to our colleagues in the other body being \nsatisfied that this is an acceptable agreement. The independent counsel \nagrees, we agree, and the White House agrees. This is not a time to \nprovoke an unwarranted and unwise confrontation that would create \nproblems for us in the years to come.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I intend to yield to my friend and \ncolleague who has been on the floor for quite a while. If I might, \nwithout prejudicing anybody, ask my colleague----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Might I ask my colleague to give me a minute?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Sure.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. First of all, I want to thank the Senator from \nConnecticut for an observation that he has made. It is not easy when \nthere are politically charged times and atmosphere. Admittedly, this \nis. We would be disingenuous at the least to say that it was not. So I \nadmit that. Therefore, it takes even more courage for the Senator from \nConnecticut to recognize that the chairman--and, more importantly, that \nthe committee--has really made every effort to avoid unnecessary \nconfrontations, repeatedly, as it is related to documents that may have \nbeen in the possession of White House counsel, documents that may have \nbeen in the possession of Mr. Foster's counsel.\n  We have set up procedures whereby we could have review of notes, \nwhere counsel will agree, or where the ranking member and the chairman \nwould agree, so that we would not put matters into the public domain \nthat had no relationship to this committee. So we have made these \nextraordinary efforts, and indeed it was on the basis of the two \nsuggestions that the White House did concede.\n  We indicated that we were quite content to get the notes. That still \nremains our position. We are not looking to invade any legitimate claim \nor to speak to the President's counsel. At least we are not as it \nrelates to what he did, et cetera, or what advice he may have given to \nthe President. We are not asking that. That is an important \nacknowledgment. I want to thank my colleague.\n  Unfortunately, we can only speak for ourselves and we can do on the \ncommittee--Democrats and Republicans. Unfortunately, that is not the \nconnotation that has come from those many associated with the White \nHouse or from the White House spokesperson. If you could read their \nstatements, there is a failure to acknowledge the great and \nextraordinary lengths that over a period of time--not just with respect \nto this matter--we have engaged in, and certainly I would submit that \nwe made every effort not to move it, but it has finally reached a point \nwhere I determined that it was necessary for us if we are going to \nresolve this and move to this point. So I make that observation.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, I appreciate that, and I \nrealize that we will at times have disagreements.\n  I also made the observation--I ask my chairman and friend --that this \nadministration has been extremely forthcoming with witnesses and \ndocuments the committee has wanted.\n  Would not my colleague agree that is the case?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. There I have to say we have a disagreement, and we just \ndo. I am not suggesting that there have not been many areas as it \nrelates to documents that have come forth.\n  Mr. DODD. But we have not had to go to court.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is right. I think the reason that is because we \nhave made an extraordinary effort--``we'' being the committee--on a \nbipartisan basis both before, when my friend and colleague and the \nDemocrats were in \n\n[[Page S18957]]\nthe majority, and since we have carried that further.\n  So I say the committee has made the extraordinary effort in a \nbipartisan effort to interact and to do our job appropriately. But as \nit relates to the ``forthcoming,'' some of this may not be fair, but I \nwill make an observation as it relates to witnesses and production of \ndocuments. Without going through the whole thing, I believe that it has \nnot been an exercise of the same faith and bipartisanship that we have \noperated with in the committee.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate my colleague's comments. I would just say, if \nyou use other examples----\n  Mr. D'AMATO. There are always examples. Look, some people can do \nthese things better in terms of an appearance, and I do not want to, \nourselves, to degenerate into who did more and less and who withheld \nand who did not in terms of all of the administrations that the \nCongress has dealt with. But I would say it is not the quantity of \nrecords that are produced but it is the quality. It is the fact that \ninformation that is important and goes to the essence of this \ninvestigation has to be produced in a timely manner without there being \nbits and pieces. Of course, some of that comes from witnesses \nthemselves who may not be fair. And it would not be fair, for example, \nas it relates to Mrs. Thomases' testimony and also the production of \nrecords as a kind of a trickling. But the same could be said in other \nareas as it relates to the White House. But again we could disagree on \nthat. And I respect my colleague's right to share a difference of \nopinion on it.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I rise in strong support of Senate Resolution 199. Mr. \nPresident, Whitewater has come to mean many things to many people, but \nit is worth discussing how we arrived at this point. It is worth \nreviewing how Whitewater became a national story because it tells us \nsomething about the failure of the savings and loan industry and it \nalso tells us a lot about the ethics of Bill and Hillary Clinton.\n  In February 1989, Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan failed. The failed \ncost to the American taxpayers was $60 million. This may not seem like \na lot of money in Washington, but beyond the beltway it is still \nconsidered a sizable amount. In fact, the entire savings and loan \ncrisis cost the American taxpayers $150 billion, which is truly a \nstaggering amount. Is it any wonder that the Banking Committee has \nevery right--in fact, a duty--to review the cause of the crisis? While \nMadison was a small institution, its failure ranks as one of the worst. \nIt failed to the taxpayers; over 50 percent of its assets were lost. \nThe taxpayers had to pick them up. Fifty percent of its assets were \ntotally worthless.\n  Jim McDougal took over Madison from 1982 to 1986. In 4 short years, \nthe so-called assets grew from $6 to $123 million. During McDougal's \ntenure at Madison, loans to insiders increased from $500,000 to $17 \nmillion--insider loans from $500,000 to $17 million. Madison, frankly, \nwas typical of many savings and loans in Arkansas. During his tenure as \nGovernor of Arkansas, 80 percent of Arkansas State chartered thrifts \nfailed, costing U.S. taxpayers $3 billion. That is $3 billion in tax \nmoney because the savings and loan system in Arkansas was run as a cozy \noperation without any worthwhile regulatory oversight. The Whitewater \ndebacle was among one of the those risky real estate ventures that \ncaused Madison to fail. We know from the hearings held by the House \nBanking Committee that at least $80,000 in insured deposits was taken \nfrom Madison Guaranty and siphoned off to Whitewater--$80,000 of it was \nlost on Whitewater.\n  Furthermore, the claim that the Clintons lost money is just \nabsolutely false. They never had their money at risk. It was a \nsweetheart deal for the new Governor and much like the commodities \ntrade in which Hillary earned $100,000 because she read the Wall Street \nJournal. Madison was a high flier. It has been called a personal piggy \nbank for the politically elite in Arkansas. I called it a calabash of \nintrigue.\n\n  I do not often agree with the editorial pages of the New York Times, \nbut they somewhat paraphrased me and they said it was ``a stew of \nevasion and memory lapses.'' I think they are absolutely correct.\n  Mr. President, the central issue in Whitewater has been whether \nMadison received favorable treatment from the Arkansas savings and loan \nregulators because of Jim McDougal's close ties to Bill Clinton. \nEssential to the question is this: Did the losses to the taxpayers \nincrease because Jim McDougal hired the Rose law firm to press his case \nwith the State regulators which Bill Clinton had appointed?\n  The answers are becoming more clear. In just the last few days, on \nMonday, evidence was revealed that Mrs. Clinton was a lead attorney on \nmatters relating to Madison at the Rose law firm. Further, and most \nsignificant, Mrs. Clinton may have made false statements--a Federal \ncrime--to the RTC about who was responsible for bringing Madison's \nbusiness to the Rose law firm. Mrs. Clinton contended in writing to the \nRTC that Richard Massey, then a first-year associate at the firm, was \nresponsible for bringing Madison's business to the Rose law firm.\n  This is incredible, to say the least. It is unbelievable to think \nthat a first-year associate would be responsible for bringing Madison \nas a client to the Rose law firm given the Clintons' close ties to Jim \nMcDougal who ran Madison.\n  The unbelievable nature of this contrived story may be borne out in \nthe notes of one of Mrs. Clinton's best friends, Susan Thomases. Miss \nThomases was the point person for press stories regarding Whitewater in \nthe 1992 campaign. She was in charge of attempting to distance Hillary \nClinton from the failure of Madison. But her own notes read that ``Mr. \nMassey will say he had a lot to do with getting the client in.'' Her \nown notes show that the Clintons intended Mr. Massey to fabricate a \nstory about who got Madison as a client for the Rose firm. This is a \ndirect contradiction to what Mrs. Clinton had told Federal \ninvestigators. Mr. Massey has told the FDIC that he had no idea how the \nRose law firm was hired by Madison.\n  Mr. President, this is significant for two reasons. First, it \ndemonstrates the Clintons were involved in obtaining lenient treatment \nfrom the regulators for Jim McDougal and his savings and loan that was \ndeep in financial trouble. Why? Because at the same time their friend \nMr. McDougal was covering the Clintons' loan payments for Whitewater. \nMcDougal was covering the Clintons' loan payments for Whitewater.\n\n  Can you imagine two Yale-educated attorneys that have no idea how \ntheir indebtedness was being paid? They knew full well. In exchange, \nthe Governor's wife was going to exert her influence with the State \nregulators to help her friend and business partner, Mr. McDougal. It \nwas quid pro quo, pure and simple, and there is not any other way to \ndescribe it.\n  Second, Mr. President, it is becoming more apparent that Hillary \nClinton may have lied to Federal investigators. Her story that it was \nMr. Massey who obtained Madison as a client is belied by the notes of \nher best friend.\n  Mr. President, in my opinion, the Whitewater hearings and the entire \nepisode have been so full of so many half-truths, misleading statements \nand selective memories that it is only a matter of time before someone \nis guilty or charged with perjury. I think we have reached that point \nfor some already.\n  It is clear that the Clintons tried to distance themselves from \nMadison and Whitewater. Had the American public been given the real \npicture in the wake of the savings and loan crisis, I think they would \nhave reacted very differently to the insider quid pro quo way of doing \nbusiness in Arkansas, particularly since the American taxpayers paid \nfor the lax regulations.\n  Mr. President, Whitewater extends even farther than Madison Guaranty. \nIt involves a small business investment corporation called Capital \nManagement Services. This company was run by a man named David Hale. \nIt, too, served as a personal bank for the well-to-do in Arkansas.\n  Its purpose was to make loans to the disadvantaged--the \ndisadvantaged. But that turned out to be the ruling class in Arkansas. \nRegrettably, the American taxpayers paid over $3 million for the \nfailure of Capital Management. \n\n[[Page S18958]]\n\n  Mr. President, it is fact that Capital Management made a $300,000 \nloan to Whitewater. Now, you remember, it was supposed to be making \nloans to the disadvantaged. But Whitewater got $300,000. We have strong \nevidence that Bill Clinton asked that this loan be made. I think time \nwill tell that David Hale is telling the truth when he said that Bill \nClinton pressured him to make the loan to help benefit Whitewater. Here \nagain the American taxpayers have paid to subsidize Bill Clinton's \nfailed real estate venture.\n  That is essentially what these hearings are about: The loss of \ntaxpayers' money in Madison, Whitewater, and Capital Management. Mr. \nPresident, these instances may have remained Arkansas history and been \nlaid to rest but for three defining events. First, the tragic death of \nVince Foster, close friend and deputy counsel to the President; second, \ncriminal referrals made to the RTC regarding Madison and Whitewater; \nand, finally, the closing of Capital Management, David Hale's small \nbusiness company.\n  Mr. President, Vince Foster's death on July 20, 1993, and the \nhandling of his papers on the night of his death have raised the most \nquestions with the committee. We know for a fact the First Lady spoke \nwith Maggie Williams before Maggie Williams went to the White House and \nVince Foster's office. We know they spoke later that evening when \nMaggie Williams returned to her home from Vince Foster's office and \ncalled the First Lady. We also know that, at nearly 1 a.m., Maggie \nWilliams and Susan Thomases spoke. We have the sworn testimony of \nuniformed Secret Service officer Henry O'Neil, who saw Maggie Williams \nremove documents from Vince Foster's office on the night of his death.\n  Officer O'Neil is an 18-year career man with the Secret Service. All \nof this is fact. Within the last few weeks we have gathered more \ninformation that I think gives credence to the notion that files were \nindeed removed on the night of Mr. Foster's death.\n  First, two files relating to the Madison Guaranty were sent back to \nthe Rose law firm by David Kendall. Yet, files were never part of the \nbox that Maggie Williams said she took from Foster's office 2 days \nafter his death.\n  These documents were reviewed and cataloged by Bob Barnett, the \nClintons' other lawyer. The two Madison files never appeared in any \nlist compiled by Mr. Barnett. In other words, they had been removed \nfrom the boxes before they were given to Mr. Barnett.\n\n  I think the files were removed by Maggie Williams and given directly \nto Hillary Clinton. We have further evidence that Maggie Williams \nvisited the First Lady on the Sunday following Mr. Foster's death. \nPreviously, Maggie Williams has said she did not see the First Lady \nuntil later.\n  We have Secret Service logs that show Maggie Williams spent time on \nthe second floor residence of the White House on Sunday immediately \nafter Mrs. Clinton returned from the Foster funeral. I believe that at \nthis time Maggie Williams personally delivered to Mrs. Clinton whatever \nmaterial she removed from Mr. Foster's office that night.\n  What evidence do we have to suggest that Madison may have been a \nproblem or a concern for the White House or Vince Foster on July 20, \n1993? This was the same day that a search warrant was authorized for \nthe office of David Hale in Little Rock. That warrant sought \ninformation about David Hale's $300,000 loan to Whitewater via Madison \nMarketing and Susan McDougal.\n  Again, our Whitewater hearings have uncovered that the White House \nwas aware of the Hale investigation from the very beginning.\n  We have testimony from a career Small Business Administration \nofficial. The SBA briefed Mack McLarty in May 1993 about the SBA \ninvestigation of David Hale. I have no doubt that within the legal \ncircles of Arkansas, the impending search of David Hale's office was a \nwell-known fact within the community. If so, this information surely \nwould have reached Vince Foster.\n  We know Mr. Foster thought Whitewater was a ``can of worms,'' his own \nwords, even before he became deputy White House counsel. We also know \nthat the failure of Madison and the first criminal referrals were known \nto the White House.\n  In March 1993, Roger Altman, the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, \nwas informed of this referral naming the Clintons. Do we know that he \nrelayed this information to the White House? We know that about the \nsame time Altman received his briefings, two articles were faxed to \nBernie Nussbaum's office--one sent so hurriedly that its cover sheet \nwas handwritten by Josh Steiner.\n  The next day the same fax was sent again, this time by Mr. Altman's \nsecretary. It is clear he wanted the White House to know more about \nWhitewater.\n  All of these matters were known to the White House. Madison, criminal \nreferrals, David Hale, all were on the White House's mind. Maybe not \nthe public's at the time, but certainly the White House was tracking \nevents closely. Whether this was a defining moment for Mr. Foster, we \ndo not know. But the circumstantial evidence that has been brought out \nin these hearings is very strong.\n\n  Mr. President, now we begin to focus on the significance of the \nNovember 5 meeting that is the subject of this subpoena. The RTC issued \nmore criminal referrals on October 8. However, the White House had \nprior knowledge of these referrals. This is laid out carefully in the \nreport on this resolution.\n  Jean Hanson, Treasury's general counsel, imparted nonpublic \ninformation to Bernie Nussbaum. Nussbaum then directed this information \nto Bruce Lindsey. He told the President. The existence of these \ncriminal referrals became null after an October 31, 1993, article in \nthe Washington Post. Six days later the White House gathered their \nlegal team in the private office of David Kendall.\n  There, I believe, the White House imparted the information they had \nreceived in a Government capacity and used it to aid them in the \nprivate legal problems of Bill and Hillary Clinton. In other words, I \nbelieve they took information that they received because of their \ngovernmental capacity and used it for their personal and private legal \nproblems. Further, this private meeting may have led to an effort to \ngather more nonpublic information about the Clintons' problem.\n  Just days later Neil Eggleston, one of the White House attorneys \npresent in the meeting, sought inside information from the SBA about \nDavid Hale. Finally, some of what may have been discussed at this \nmeeting, I suspect, could be perceived as an obstruction of justice if \nthe White House did anything that smacks of interfering with the RTC or \nthe SBA investigation.\n  Mr. President, this is what is so important about the November 5 \nmeeting. It is really the missing link for the White House hearings. We \nknow from our hearings in 1994 that the White House received privileged \ninformation about the RTC's investigation of Madison. We do not know \nwhat the White House did with the information. The November 5 meeting \nmay finally reveal what they did.\n  It is inexcusable that taxpayers paid for these attorneys to \nessentially function as a private legal team for the Clintons. It is \ninexcusable that they would engage in this activity on Government-paid \ntime. And it is inexcusable that they have the audacity to claim \nprivilege as if they were private attorneys.\n  Mr. President, in short, the real importance of this meeting is \nwhether the heads-up the White House received from Treasury and others \nturned out to be a leg-up for the Clinton legal defense team. That \nwould be wrong, unethical, and possibly illegal. This Congress needs to \nfind out which.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me turn to another subject I have raised \noften in committee. Time and time again the subject of the First Lady's \ninvolvement in all of these issues has surfaced over and over for--soon \nit will be 3 years.\n  She handled Madison work at the Rose law firm. She was active in \nWhitewater. She spoke with Maggie Williams twice on the night of Mr. \nFoster's death, before and after Ms. Williams went to the White House. \nShe spoke with Susan Thomases who, in turn, spoke with Bernie Nussbaum \nabout calling off the official search of Foster's office. Her chief of \nstaff, Maggie Williams, was briefed about the statute of limitations \nissue, which may have affected her personally and the Rose law firm.\n  Over and over, the subject keeps coming back to Hillary Clinton. I \nhave \n\n[[Page S18959]]\ncalled for her to appear before the committee. My friend and colleague \nfrom New York has been patient, very patient--sometimes I feel too \npatient--in getting the answers. I do not think we can wait any longer, \nand I do not think we should wait any longer. We have to have the First \nLady as a witness and under oath so we can get the real answers to our \nquestions. This is the key to finding out what happened, and I do not \nknow any reason why she should not be willing to come and clarify the \nproblems we have run into. Without her testimony, no investigation will \nbe complete.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that Whitewater is a very \nserious concern. We have a witness in Arkansas, David Hale, that has \nmade a serious allegation against the President: That he pressured \nDavid Hale to make a phony $300,000 loan to Whitewater.\n  The President has denied this, but with Mr. Hale's cooperation, the \nindependent counsel's investigation has now resulted in nine guilty \npleas and five more indictments, including Jim McDougal, Bill Clinton's \nbusiness partner, and the current Governor of Arkansas, Jim Guy Tucker, \nfriend of the President and friend to David Hale.\n  Mr. President, the tide of Whitewater is rising. The scandal is \ngetting closer to the President and the First Lady. It is getting \ncloser to the White House by the day and spelling trouble for this \nPresident. What we can do here today may be the beginning of the end of \nthe Clinton White House. These notes may begin to unravel the scandal \nand the truth finally may at last be told.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am very pleased I was on the floor to \nhear my colleague from North Carolina because he has a theory about \nWhitewater, and he has every right to hold any theory he chooses. I \nrespect his right to his opinion, but I am here to tell my colleagues \nthat not only are his views not backed up by the facts, but they are \ncontradicted by the facts. I want to take just one example.\n\n  He says the Clintons were actively involved in Whitewater. He said \nthe Clintons were actively involved. Jay Stephens of Pillsbury Madison \n& Sutro just got paid by the RTC $3.6 million, and what does their \nreport say? It was referred to by Senator Dodd. I am quoting:\n\n       There is no basis to charge the Clintons with any kind of \n     primary liability for fraud or intentional misconduct. This \n     investigation has revealed no evidence to support such \n     claims, nor would the record support any claim of secondary \n     or derivative liability for the possible misdeeds of others.\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       It is recommended that no further resources be expended on \n     the Whitewater part of this investigation.\n\n  So here you have a Senator who comes to the floor and says that the \nClintons were involved when a Republican, a former U.S. attorney--and \nyou can remember there were some people in the Clinton White House who \nwere very concerned that perhaps he would not be objective--finds that, \nin fact, they have no involvement.\n  So to come on this floor and stick to a theory that has been \ndisproven I do not think does this Senate any good, especially since we \nare trying to work with the facts.\n  Madam President, $3.6 million was expended to find out that the \nClintons did not have anything to do with it, and we have a Senator \nsay, ``It's getting worse. The tide is rising. We have to have Mrs. \nClinton come before the committee,'' and all the rest.\n  I suppose there is nothing that I can say to my friend that will \ndissuade him from his theory and, therefore, I am not going to try to \ndo that, except to continue to rebut what he says with the facts.\n  He has talked about obstruction of justice. He has talked about \nperjury, and I urge him to be very careful with the kind of things he \nsays on the Senate floor, because I have to say it is very hurtful to \nreputations of people to throw those kinds of charges around here.\n  I speak today as a member of the committee who voted all along to \ncontinue this Whitewater investigation. Some of my colleagues in the \nlast vote did not vote to continue it. They felt it was a waste of \nmoney. I felt it was important to continue it under the leadership of \nmy chairman and my ranking member.\n  Why did I think it was important, and why do I think it is still \nimportant to continue this until it is done? Because I feel when \nallegations are thrown around here, either on this floor or in the \npress, it is very dangerous to allow those things to go unchallenged. \nSo what we have is a committee that can look at these allegations, can \nbring the witnesses forward and can ascertain the facts. If we do not \ndo it, then there are always going to be people out there who suspect \nwrongdoing, reputations will be ruined, and we will never get to the \nfacts. So I support the work of this committee and continuing to do it \nin a bipartisan way.\n\n  That leads me to where we are today with the subpoena. I know, \nbecause I am very familiar with my chairman and my ranking member, that \nwhen those two get together and agree on something, they can move \nmountains. I find it hard to believe that if, in fact, the Republicans \non the committee have agreed wholeheartedly to the conditions of the \nWhite House, which it appears to be so, that they cannot take it a step \nfurther, get together with the ranking member and counsel and sit down \nin a room with the other parties and reach an agreement.\n  Why do I say that? I say that because I believe to get into this \nconfrontation in the courts is, at a minimum, going to delay matters. \nIt is also going to cost more dollars, and I want to talk about that \nfor a minute.\n  We are in a Government shutdown. We are in a government shutdown \nbecause it is so important to Republicans, particularly in the House at \nthis point, that negotiations go just the way they want before they \nwill allow the Government to continue operating. Frankly, I think it is \nembarrassing for the greatest Nation on Earth to have a partial \nshutdown of the Government because certain people act like children and \nwill not do what we have to do, which is get a clean continuing \nresolution, keep the Government operational and take the argument over \nthe long-term balancing of the budget into a room and figure it out. I \nvoted for two balanced budgets in 7 years. Others have voted for other \nforms of balancing the budget. We can do it. Everyone is so concerned \nabout spending money, but not the Republicans when it comes to this \ninvestigation.\n  It is incredible to me. Madam President, $1,350,000 has been spent \nthus far by the Senate committee; $10,000 a week on little TV sets they \nhave all across that room--$10,000 a week. But they are worried about \nbalancing the budget. So you take documents and instead of handing them \nout, you put them on a screen. You cannot really see it anyway. It is a \nwaste of money, but money does not matter when it comes to Whitewater. \nBut I suppose it was too hard for our committees to hold hearings on \nthe drastic cuts in Medicare, where we did not hold any on this side \nand there was one held in the House. But when it comes to Whitewater, \nwe can meet and meet and meet. And we can enforce the subpoenas and \nwaste more taxpayer dollars and not get the documentation we want. I \nwant to see those documents. It seems to me that if we support the \nalternative that will be offered by our ranking member today, Senator \nSarbanes of Maryland, we can get everything we want. We can avoid a \ncostly subpoena battle. We can avoid, frankly, losing in the courts, \nwhich would harm the U.S. Senate out into the future, and we can get \nthe information if we sit down together with our colleagues in the \nHouse. I served over there for 10 years. I think Jim Leach and Paul \nSarbanes, Al D'Amato, and the other principals can sit down and figure \nthis out. But, oh, no, we are bringing this to a confrontation. Most of \nmy Republican friends have not even talked about that. They just talked \nabout their view of Whitewater.\n\n  Money is no object when it comes to this, friends. So when you wonder \nwhy they are shutting down the Government and they tell you, ``Oh, my \ngoodness, it is the only way we can get a balanced budget,'' ask them \nwhy we are going to spend all this money on Whitewater. I do not think \nyou will get a very good answer.\n  Waco--hearings and hearings and hearings. Ruby Ridge--hearings and \n\n[[Page S18960]]\n  hearings and hearings. Whitewater--more hearings. Medicare cuts--no \nhearings. One begins to think, are we only here to deal with politics, \nor are we here to deal with substance? So we face an unnecessary legal \nconfrontation, it seems to me. I think that the ranking member, Senator \nSarbanes, is going to offer us a very wise way out, a way that would \nresult in getting the papers that we need and keeping this away from \nthe courts, which is always costly and time consuming.\n  When you look at what has been spent so far on Whitewater, it is \nstaggering--$1.350 million in the Senate. I told you about the RTC \ninvestigation, which was $3.6 million. We just referred to the Stephens \nreport, which just was a recommendation not to file a civil lawsuit \nagainst Bill Clinton. Then you have the independent counsel, which has \ncost $22 million to date, and 100 FBI agents, not only looking at this \nPresident and his family and all of his dealings now, but all the way \nback to campaigns for Governor, and everything else. Well, I will tell \nyou, when this is over, this President and his family will have had \nmore scrutiny than a chest x-ray. Every detail--$27 million total--\nwithout including what the House has spent. We do not know what they \nhave spent because it is hidden in their Banking Committee.\n  We have had 32 hearings, or public meetings, of our Senate committee. \nSo how anybody can say, we better rush and do this subpoena and get to \ncourt because we have not had enough meetings, enough information--I \nthink, frankly, the people are losing faith in this Whitewater \ninvestigation, and I would not blame them. We do not listen to the \nimpact of cutting Medicare and Medicaid and education and the \nenvironment and shutting down the Government. We do not do that. But \nthere is hearing after hearing, millions of dollars after millions of \ndollars spent to do what? So that the Senator from North Carolina can \nget his wish and the First Lady is going to come before the Senate \ncommittee. After the Clintons have been exonerated in a $3 million \nstudy by Jay Stephens, our Republican former U.S. attorney.\n\n  Madam President, I was not on the floor when the Senator from Alabama \nspoke, Senator Shelby, but I understand that he took quotes from \nRichard Nixon and Bill Clinton, and the whole implication is that--it \nis not hard to get to the bottom line --this is terrible, and this is \ngoing to result in the President resigning. That is the implication. \nWell, I have to say, we have seen more smoking guns in this \ninvestigation than I ever saw in a cowboy movie.\n  Smoking gun No. 1: Jean Lewis' testimony--this was their star. She \nwas billed as their star, and she came before us to show how the \nadministration has muzzled her investigation. As it turns out, her \nappearance only showed, in my view, how biased her investigation was. \nShe even planned to profit from it by going into the T-shirt business. \nIt was embarrassing to think of a professional woman, who was their \nstar, who took phone calls about her T-shirt business in her office. \nThis was their star. By the way, she said her tape recorder went on by \nitself, miraculously, and she taped, without her knowing, a woman from \nthe RTC, and then she gave that tape over to the committee to show this \nother smoking gun which turned out to be not very much.\n  We also learned in that questioning period that this woman had a bias \nagainst the President. Oh, that caused a big brouhaha. She had written \nabout the President in a negative fashion, in an obscene fashion, right \nbefore she made the referrals, which named the Clintons as possible \nwitnesses. That is the number-one smoking gun, the No. 1 star of their \nshow.\n  The second smoking gun: The letter from the President's lawyer--\n  Oh, I must say, sadly, Miss Lewis got ill in front of the committee. \nI hope she is better now, I really do. But I was not finished with my \nquestioning. I do not know if I will ever have a chance to continue it \nbecause I had a lot more questions. But she became ill, clearly, and \nhad to leave.\n\n  The second smoking gun: The letter from the President's lawyer, David \nKendall, to the Rose firm attaching three Madison Guaranty files. Our \ncommittee chairman, in a public hearing, called the letter a ``smoking \ngun,'' in his words, alleging that the attached files were likely taken \nfrom the White House office of Vince Foster. Mr. Kendall testified that \nhe had not gotten the files at all from Vince Foster's office.\n  The third smoking gun: The Small Business Administration's \nmishandling of the David Hale matter. That has been referred to by my \nfriend from North Carolina.\n  Another smoking gun was the allegation that the SBA delayed the \ninvestigation of David Hale's misuse of SBA money. Well, my goodness, \nwhat did the testimony show? Not only did the SBA move forward \naggressively, under Erskine-Boles, with the investigation, but Hale was \nindicted in record time--in record time--leading some members of the \ncommittee to say that is a model for all administrations to follow \nbecause the administrator knew that David Hale, who knew the President \nand the First Lady, was from Arkansas, and he said, go after them, and \nthey did.\n  Smoking gun No. 4: The secret telephone number called by the First \nLady the night of the Foster suicide. This hung out there in the press. \nWho did she call? A secret number. Nobody knows. The telephone company \ndid not know. No one knew. The investigative team could not find out. \nWell, it was a big smoking gun. It was a phone number that was used \nwhen the White House switchboard was overloaded. It was a White House \nswitchboard number. And the testimony from Bill Burton, who spoke to \nthe First Lady, was exactly this: The First Lady called him at the \nspecific time that the committee was after, and said, ``Please make \nsure that Vince Foster's mother is told this news in the most caring \nway, with her minister present, so that she does not learn of it \nthrough news reports.'' That was smoking gun No. 4. Maybe having a \ncompassionate First Lady is a bad thing. I happen to think it is a good \nthing.\n\n  Smoking gun No. 5, the Jay Stephens report. There we were again. What \nis going to happen with this civil investigation? Are we going to see \nthat the Clintons spent a lot of time with Whitewater?\n  Madam President, $3.6 million smoking gun. Well, it just came out. \nThey said Whitewater had cost Madison Guaranty a minimal amount of \n$60,000 to $150,000. At most, there was a $60 million loss to the \ninstitution. The Clintons, as far as they could tell, did not know much \nabout Whitewater, and there was no case. Do not proceed.\n  Now we come to smoking gun No. 6, and nearing the end of my comments \ntoday, the notes of White House counsel William Kennedy. The notes were \ntaken when the President's lawyers met together when they were handing \nover the information to the private attorney. The undercurrent that has \nbeen out there is the President has something to hide, except for one \nthing. They are ready to hand over the papers. They are ready to hand \nover the papers. First, they had five conditions. They are down to one \ncondition. Down to one condition. We have agreed with that condition in \na bipartisan fashion. We think the independent counsel has, although we \nhave not confirmed it. That is our belief. Which leaves the House.\n  Now I know those people over in the House, and I like them. I think \nwe ought to talk to them face to face and get them to understand that \nby taking the position they are taking, we are not going to get the \npapers.\n  Why do we want to have a court fight that would set a bad precedent? \nIt does not make sense. All individuals have an attorney-client \nprivilege. It does not matter whether you are the poorest of the poor, \nthe richest of the rich, the most powerful or the least powerful. That \nis what is so great about our country. We do not go on political witch \nhunts and deny people their rights.\n  In this U.S. Senate in the Ethics Committee on the Packwood case, \nRepublicans and Democrats together said that the attorney-client \nprivilege for Bob Packwood must take precedence. So I have got to be a \nlittle surprised when that occurs in the Ethics Committee, and we are \nbipartisan, and suddenly here we are splitting into Democrats and \nRepublicans. That is bad for this institution. It is bad for this \ninvestigation. It is bad for the precedence of the United States. \nFrankly, I think it is bad for individual Senators. \n\n[[Page S18961]]\n\n  Who knows some day when one of us might say, I do not want people to \nsee the private notes of my attorney on a divorce. I do not want \nsomeone to see the private notes of my attorney in a child custody \ncase, or an ethics proceeding, or any kind of matter where we may be \ninvolved.\n\n  We should stand together on the principle as we did in the Packwood \ncase, and we know emotions were running high in that case, but we did \nnot invade that attorney-client privilege, as our ranking member, \nSenator Sarbanes, has pointed out far more eloquently than I because I \nam not a lawyer. I am just trying to bring some common sense to the \ndiscussion and to move along the process of the committee's work and \ngetting the notes that we want to get.\n  I think we should send the resolution back to the committee with \ninstructions to consider all reasonable ways of obtaining the notes. I \nthink that we can do it. I have seen my chairman and my ranking member \nteam up and be very persuasive, and I think if they teamed up on this \nand they sat down with their counterparts in the House, we could \nresolve this in a moment's time. That is the faith I have in their \nability to work together.\n  The bottom line is, do you want to get the notes or do you want to \nplay politics? That is the way I see it. I hope we decide we want to \nget the notes, we want to do it in a way that keeps this committee \nworking in a bipartisan fashion because, frankly, if we do not stick \ntogether on this, on the procedures, I think the American people are \ngoing to think this is all politics and all the hard work that we do to \nput light on this subject will simply not be respected.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor, and I ask unanimous \nconsent in that regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Very briefly, I reply to the honorable Senator from \nCalifornia. I do not intend to get into a point-by-point debate.\n  Mrs. Clinton has admitted while Jim McDougal was on trial in 1990, \nshe took over Whitewater affairs. She even sought power of attorney in \n1988. In fact, the Clintons have all of the Whitewater documents. They \nwere so active that they had to turn back boxes of documents to Jim \nMcDougal so he could do the return.\n  Finally, the reason Pillsbury Madison might have said there was no \nwrongdoing, they simply do not have the information that has been \navailable to this committee and will be available to the committee.\n\n  To answer one three-line quote, and I am quoting Mrs. Clinton as to \nher involvement in Whitewater, her words:\n\n       Because my husband was a fourth owner of Whitewater \n     Development Company while he was actually occupied as \n     Governor of Arkansas, it fell to me to take certain steps to \n     attempt to assure that Whitewater Development Corporation \n     affairs were properly conducted and that they complied with \n     the law.\n\n  If that does not involve her, I do not know what does. I thank the \nSenator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator would yield for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Under the same unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend from North Carolina, and I respect his \nright to hold any view he wishes, what he said is, essentially, that he \ndoes not agree with the conclusion of this report.\n  I just want to reiterate, Madam President, that $3 million was spent \non it. It was headed by a very well-respected Republican former U.S. \nattorney, James Jay Stephens. Clearly, it says, ``The evidence does not \nsuggest the Clintons had managerial control of the enterprise or even \nreceived annual reports or financial summaries. Instead, the main \ncontact seems to consist of signing loans and renewals.''\n  To suggest some 3-point-some million dollars they spent here did not \ngive them the information they need is, really, it seems to me, an \nindirect hit at Mr. Stephens and Pillsbury Madison & Sutro. I take \ngreat pride in that law firm because that is in San Francisco. I think \nthe facts do not bear out the intentions.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from Utah was on \nthe floor before I was here. It is not a great matter of importance \nthat I speak immediately, but I do have some other things that are \ngoing to demand my attention later. I wonder if the distinguished \nSenator from Utah could tell me how long he might be speaking?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not believe I will be very long, and I am happy to \nyield to my distinguished colleague, but I ask unanimous consent that \nhe be permitted to speak immediately following my remarks, which should \nnot be too long.\n  Mr. BYRD. That would be very fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator for his characteristic \ncourtesy. Could he tell me about when he might end?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not think I will be much more than 15 minutes. Pretty \nclose to 3 o'clock, maybe a little less than that.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope the Senator will not hurry.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate my colleague. I am happy to yield to him.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator would yield, given the agreement, maybe \nwe could even put in a quorum call if it catches the Senator from West \nVirginia unaware at the conclusion of the time. I am sure that is \nagreeable to the chairman.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Why do we not say--we have been trying to work this back \nand forth, and certainly the Senator from West Virginia would be \nrecognized, and if he needs an opportunity to come to the floor, and I \nmake an observation I would yield immediately. Why do we not just keep \nit at that, and he will be recognized thereafter or as soon as he comes \nto the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator from New York and I thank the Senator \nfrom Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate the action of my friend from West Virginia \nbecause I know how busy he is, as all of us are, and my friends who are \nmanaging this bill. I think I would always yield to him, if I could. \nBut he has been gracious enough to ask me to go forward.\n  It has been implied in this debate that I have been listening to that \nthe Whitewater investigation has been a waste, that it has been too \ncostly and too expensive. I have to say, I did not hear the same \narguments during the Iran-contra problem. But let me say, I would note \nthat the Whitewater investigation has resulted in five indictments, \nincluding the indictment of a sitting Governor, and nine guilty pleas \nso far.\n  We have also seen the No. 3 person at the Justice Department go to \nFederal prison. I personally feel badly about that because I liked him \nvery much. I still like him very much and I am sorry he has had that \ndifficulty. But I have to say, it shows that the Whitewater \ninvestigation has not been in vain, that it has been extremely \nimportant.\n  Frankly, the investigation is not complete. I wonder how much all of \nthat work is worth to the country. It seems to me the American people \nwould want to investigate wrongdoing. I think the record shows that the \nindependent counsel is moving ahead in an appropriate manner. And I \nbelieve the distinguished committee on White-water is moving ahead very \nwell, too. I commend the two leaders, Senators D'Amato and Sarbanes, \nfor the good way that they worked together and the tremendous amount of \nwork they have done on this--plus their counsel. Their respective \ncounsel have been as good as any I have ever seen.\n  Having said that, Madam President, I rise in support of the \nresolution to authorize enforcement of the subpoena to obtain notes \nfrom a White House meeting concerning Whitewater. I do not take this \nstep lightly, however. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I see it \nas my duty to defend the prerogatives of the executive branch and the \nseparation of powers. Indeed, I recognize that the executive branch has \na right to confidential communications regarding its core functions. \nAfter giving this issue careful thought and consideration, however, I \nhave decided that enforcing the subpoena is the proper course of action \nto take. This \n\n[[Page S18962]]\nissue transcends claims of partisanship and goes to the very \nconstitutional authority of Congress to investigate wrongdoing at the \nhighest levels of Government.\n\n  The Senate has a constitutional obligation to conduct oversight \nhearings. It is a duty we must not surrender. The President has refused \nto comply with a legitimate request to obtain information relating to \nWhitewater. After President Clinton's initial refusal to provide the \nmeeting notes, the Special Whitewater Committee took the wholly \nappropriate step of subpoenaing the notes. It is unfortunate that the \nPresident has chosen to resist the congressional subpoena. Not only has \nPresident Clinton defied a Congress that is in good faith attempting to \ninvestigate a matter of great public concern, he has chosen to do so by \nhiding behind a questionable claim of attorney-client privilege.\n  I would like to review the claim of privilege the President is \nasserting and explain to the American people why it is simply not \ncredible.\n  First, the President not only claims that the November 5 Whitewater \nmeeting is cloaked in attorney-client privilege, but that the privilege \napplies against Congress. No Congress in history, however, has \nrecognized the existence of a common-law privilege that trumps the \nconstitutionally authorized investigatory powers of Congress. While \nCongress has chosen, as a matter of discretion, to permit clear, \nlegitimate claims of privilege, it has never allowed its constitutional \nauthority to investigate wrongdoing in the executive branch to be \nundermined by universal recognition of the attorney-client privilege. \nAs Senator Sarbanes has noted, we have chosen, in our discretion, to \nrecognize the privilege with respect to some of the witnesses who have \ntestified before the Committee.\n  The attorney-client privilege exists as only a narrow exception to \nbroad rules of disclosure. And the privilege exists only as a statutory \ncreation, or by operation of State common law. No statute or Senate or \nHouse rule applies the attorney-client privilege to Congress. In fact, \nboth the Senate and the House have explicitly refused to formally \ninclude the privilege in their rules. As the Clerk of the House stated \nin a memorandum opinion in 1985: ``attorney-client privilege cannot be \nclaimed as a matter of right before a congressional committee.'' The \nattorney-client privilege is a rule of evidence that generally applies \nonly in court; it does not apply to Congress which, under article I, \nsection 5 of the Constitution, has the sole authority to ``determine \nthe Rules of its Proceedings.''\n  The historical practice of congressional committees has borne this \nout. As Joseph diGenova, a special counsel and former U.S. attorney, \nhas pointed out in an article in today's Wall Street Journal, as early \nas in the 19th century investigation of the Credit Mobilier scandal, \nCongress clearly refused to recognize attorney-client privilege. \nIndeed, in 1934, Senator Hugo Black, later one of the Supreme Court's \ngreat liberal justices, as chairman of a committee refused to recognize \nthe privilege. As recently as 1986, a House subcommittee, Committee on \nForeign Affairs, Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, took pains \nto note that it need not recognize the privilege asserted by \nindividuals involved in setting up a web of dummy corporations for the \nMarcos family.\n\n  This body cannot simply take the President's claim of privilege \nagainst Congress at face value. To do so would be to surrender an \nimportant constitutional obligation. We can not compromise the ability \nof the Congress to conduct investigatory hearings. I ask my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle to place partisan politics aside and to \nsupport the institutional integrity of this body.\n  Second, the President has stated that he is merely asserting the type \nof attorney-client privilege that any American would claim with respect \nto his or her own attorney. I do not think that any of us would \ndisagree that Mr. Clinton, as a private citizen dealing with personal \nlegal troubles, has a claim of attorney-client privilege. That goes \nwithout saying. Certainly with regard to Mr. Kendall, his personal \nattorney.\n  The problem, however, is that we do not have an ordinary citizen \nhere, nor are we in a court of law. An ordinary citizen does not \nsupervise the law enforcement resources of the Federal Government; an \nordinary citizen does not appoint or fire U.S. attorneys; an ordinary \ncitizen does not direct the FBI; an ordinary citizen does not control \nIRS or the RTC. An ordinary citizen is not in the position to interfere \nwith the legitimate law enforcement investigation of his own \nactivities.\n  Indeed, President Richard Nixon did not assert attorney-client \nprivilege. What would have happened if President Nixon had attempted to \nuse the privilege to prevent White House counsel John Dean from \ntestifying? That is essentially what is happening now. Even during the \nso-called Iran-Contra affair, Department of Justice lawyers concluded \nthat the privilege could only be claimed by lawyers preparing for \nlitigation, not preparing for congressional inquiries. Although the \ncommittee recognized attorney-client privilege for Oliver North and \ncertain others, it did so only as a matter of discretion, which the \ncommittee has a right to do.\n  Thus, if we are going to recognize any attorney-client privilege of \nthe President, we do so at our discretion. Now, in general I would be \nwilling to recognize the privilege when it validly exists. Here, \nhowever, it clearly does not, and so Congress must issue the resolution \nto enforce the subpoena.\n  Courts recognize the privilege only for communications between a \nclient and his attorney for the purpose of providing legal advice. It \nmakes perfect sense that a person would be able to discuss legal \nmatters with his or her lawyer that should not be revealed in court or \nto the opposing side. That is a well-established principle we can all \nagree with.\n  I, as well as legal experts such as former U.S. Attorney General \nWilliam Barr, former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova, and Prof. Ronald \nRotunda fail to see how Mr. Clinton can assert privilege over the \nNovember 1993 meeting. It is hard for me to understand how advice about \na private legal matter could be given at a meeting where neither the \nPresident nor the First Lady were present.\n  An additional problem is that in addition to Mr. Kennedy and Mr. \nKendall, other lawyers were at the meeting who represented the \nPresident in his official capacity. These White House lawyers had a \nduty to represent the American people as well as the Office of the \nPresident. It would be a violation of the basic ethical rules for \nGovernment lawyers to work on private legal matters for the President. \nA memo from the President's personal lawyers at Williams & Connolly \nconcedes that each group of lawyers--the Government lawyers and the \nprivate lawyers--had a different client: the Government lawyers \nrepresented the Office of the President and the U.S. Government, the \nprivate lawyers represented the President in his personal capacity. \nSince they are representing different entities, they cannot share the \nsame attorney-client privilege.\n  The administration responds to this straightforward legal point by \ndrawing an analogy to the common-interest privilege that is given to \ncoconspirators who are permitted to share advice and information in \npreparing a joint defense. This analogy collapses upon close \nexamination. The supposed common interest is that both clients \nrepresented at the November 5 meeting--the Clintons in their private \ncapacity and the Office of the President--faced adversarial legal \nproceedings. But in this setting, the only possible adversary for the \nClintons is the U.S. Government, and one group of lawyers at the \nNovember 5 meeting--those representing the Office of the President, \nrepresent the U.S. Government, and were on the payroll of the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  Therefore, the U.S. Government and those lawyers who represented it \ncould not possibly have a common interest with the Clintons in \nthwarting or defending against adversarial legal proceedings brought or \npotentially to be brought by the U.S. Government against the Clintons \nin their private capacities. In fact, the lawyers from the White House \nCounsel's Office represented the only possible adversaries of the \nPresident, and therefore there could not have been a common interest \nbetween the two groups of lawyers.\n  In fact, there is no claim that Whitewater involves the Office of the \nPresident; the issues should not involve the Presidency at all. At the \n\n[[Page S18963]]\ntime that the Whitewater affair occurred, Mr. Clinton was not even \nPresident. It is hard to say that the Office of the Presidency was \nfacing any adversary, with whom it would need to coordinate a common \ndefense.\n  The White House, in a memorandum provided to the special committee, \nclaims that this was a meeting in which the President's former private \nattorney, Mr. Kennedy, was handing off information to his newly \nretained counsel, Mr. Kendall. The White House's lawyers claim that \nthey were serving necessary and important public interests at the \nmeeting, and that they were at the meeting to ``impart information that \nhad been provided to them in the course of official duties.'' What \ninformation was imparted? Surely the transmission of Government \ninformation to private attorneys is not protected by the attorney-\nclient privilege.\n  I am deeply troubled by the fact that White House lawyers were \npresent at this meeting. After all, these lawyers do not represent the \nPresident in his personal capacity. I am concerned about the \npossibility that Government lawyers, who have an obligation to the \nAmerican people, as well as to the President, may have passed \ninformation to the Clinton's personal lawyers that the White House \nCounsel's Office may have gained through their official capacities. Is \nit the proper role of Government officials to act as messengers for Mr. \nClinton in his private capacity to the President's private lawyers?\n  These lawyers were discussing Whitewater matters that were being \ninvestigated by the Department of Justice and the RTC--legal matters \nthat would place Mr. Clinton in an adverse position to the U.S. \nGovernment. Essentially, Mr. Clinton is claiming attorney-client \nprivilege over a meeting in which Government lawyers may have been \ninvolved in a strategy session to frustrate investigations conducted by \nother parts of the executive branch. I hope that nothing occurred \nduring the meeting that would in any way sully the Office of the \nPresident. But to find out whether anything illegal occurred, the \nPresident must disclose the notes.\n\n  It is also likely that even if a privilege may have existed, it was \nwaived. After all, Bruce Lindsey, who did not serve in the White House \nCounsel's Office at this time, but rather served in the White House \nPersonnel Office, was at the meeting. He was not legal counsel to the \nPresident in either a personal or a professional capacity. To say that \nhe represented the Office of the President as legal counsel at this \nmeeting is dubious at best. Information discussed in his presence thus \nwould constitute a waiver of the privilege. Were this legal fiction to \nsurvive judicial review, virtually any discussions or conspiracies \ninvolving lawyers could be claimed as privileges.\n  In order to avoid the brewing constitutional confrontation that will \narise when this issue goes to court, I call upon the President to \nrelease the notes of the November 5 meeting now. It is in the best \ninterests of the President, of the Congress, and, indeed, of the \nAmerican people, for all the information concerning Whitewater to come \nout into the open. As Justice Louis Bradeis put so succinctly: \n``Sunlight is the best of disinfectants.'' By being forthcoming with \nthe American people, President Clinton can begin to put Whitewater \nbehind this administration. While we must, in my opinion, vote today to \nenforce the subpoena, I would hope that we will not ultimately have to \nresolve this dispute in court. I would hope that the President would do \nas he has long promised: fully comply with the investigation into the \nWhitewater affair.\n  Having said all of that, again I note that this has not been a waste \nof time--the work these two leaders on the committee have done, the \nwork the special counsel has done which has resulted in five \nindictments, nine guilty pleas, and the imprisonment of one of our top \nJustice Department officials.\n  I think those facts alone justify the work that the distinguished \nchairman of this committee has been trying to do.\n  So I want to commend him for the work he is doing, and I want to \ncommend all members of committee for the attention that they have given \nto this work. And I hope that some of the comments that I have made \nwill help on this matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, let me, before Senator Byrd comes to \nthe floor, first of all thank the Senator from Utah who also in his \ncapacity as chairman of the Judiciary Committee has a keen insight, has \nbeen here and understands this area that sometimes might be somewhat \ndifficult for people to grasp. But I think in the summation he went \nright to the heart of this matter. It is a matter of the President of \nthe United States keeping faith with his commitment to the people, a \nmatter of the President of the United States, President Clinton, \nkeeping faith not only with the people but indeed with the Congress and \nthe Senate. It is a matter of the President of the United States \nkeeping faith with the commitment that he made on March 8. On March 8, \n1994, the President held a press conference in connection with the \nappointment of Lloyd Cutler as interim White House counsel. During that \npress conference the President was asked about the possibility of \nasserting Executive privilege, and he gave a response. He said:\n\n       It is hard for me to imagine a circumstance in which that \n     would be the appropriate thing for me to do.\n\n  Madam President, once again, the President has an opportunity to keep \nhis commitment. It is not good enough to say one thing and to do \nanother. It is not good enough to promise us cooperation and then hide \nbehind technicalities. It is not good enough to say that I will produce \neverything that I can to be cooperative and getting to the bottom of \nthis matter, and then assert privilege--and then put conditions on it \nand do it in a manner in which we are forced to come to this floor.\n  So I would hope that irrespective of the votes that we take, \nirrespective of our positions, that the President would come forward--\nand come forward now and make those notes available. People have a \nright to know the Congress has a right to know, and we have worked in \nthe cooperative effort to avoid this. It is only because of the \nnecessity to see to it that we get this information in a timely way, \nthat we have taken this extraordinary action.\n  So I agree with Senator Hatch. The duty and the obligation is not \nupon this Senate. We should not have to be compelling this. It should \nbe President of the United States who steps forward and who keeps his \ncommitment; a commitment that right now he is failing to observe, a \npromise that has been made, a promise that has been made but a promise \nthat has not been kept.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the chairman yield?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I certainly will. I note that we are awaiting Senator \nByrd because he is the next scheduled person, but certainly I will \nyield. Have we made inquiry? Has the Senator been advised?\n  Mr. SARBANES. We have sent a message to him and he is on his way, is \nwhat I am told.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record at this point, in light of the comments we just \nheard, a letter to Chairman D'Amato from Jane Sherburne, special \ncounsel to the President.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, December 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate, Special Committee to Investigate \n         Whitewater Development Corporation and Related Matters, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman D'Amato: As I informed you yesterday we \n     would, Counsel for the President have undertaken to secure \n     non-waiver agreements from the various entities with an \n     investigative interest in Whitewater-Madison matters. I \n     requested an opportunity to meet with your staff to determine \n     how we might work together to facilitate this process. Mr. \n     Chertoff declined to meet.\n       Nonetheless, we have succeeded in reaching an understanding \n     with the Independent Counsel that he will not argue that \n     turning over the Kennedy notes waives the attorney-client \n     privilege claimed by the President. With this agreement in \n     hand, the only thing standing in the way of giving these \n     notes to your Committee, is the unwillingness of Republican \n     House Chairmen similarly to agree. As I am sure you are \n     aware, two of the Committee Chairmen who have asserted \n     jurisdiction over Whitewater matters in the House have \n     rejected our request that the House \n\n[[Page S18964]]\n     also enter a non-waiver agreement with respect to disclosure of these \n     notes and related testimony.\n       We have said all along that we are prepared to make the \n     notes public; that all we need is an assurance that other \n     investigative bodies will not use this as an excuse to deny \n     the President the right to lawyer confidentiality that all \n     Americans enjoy. The response of the House Committee Chairmen \n     suggests our concern has been well-founded.\n       If your primary objective in pursuing this exercise is to \n     obtain the notes, we need to work together to achieve that \n     result. You earlier stated that you were willing to urge the \n     Independent Counsel to go along with a non-waiver agreement. \n     We ask that you do the same with your Republican colleagues \n     in the House. Be assured: as soon as we secure an agreement \n     from the House, we will give the notes to the Committee.\n       Mr. Chertoff has informed me that the Committee will not \n     acknowledge that a reasonable claim of privilege has been \n     asserted with respect to confidential communications between \n     the President's personal lawyer and White House officials \n     acting as lawyers for the President. In view of the \n     overwhelming support expressed by legal scholars and experts \n     for the White House position on this subject, we are prepared \n     simply to agree to disagree with the Committee on this point.\n       Accordingly, the only remaining obstacle to resolution of \n     this matter is the House.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                            Jane C. Sherburne,\n\n                                            Special Counsel to the\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  She indicates in the letter that the President is prepared to turn \nover these notes as soon as they can achieve a formal waiver agreement \nwith the House. They have such an agreement with our committee. We have \nindicated that is acceptable to us. And they apparently reached such an \nunderstanding with the independent counsel. In fact, this letters says:\n\n       We have succeeded in reaching an understanding with the \n     independent counsel that he will not argue that turning over \n     the Kennedy notes waives the attorney-client privilege \n     claimed by the President. With this agreement in hand, the \n     only thing standing in the way of giving these notes to your \n     committee is the unwillingness of Republican House chairmen \n     similarly to agree.\n\n  I understand they are going to be meeting with the House chairmen \nthis afternoon, and hopefully out of that an understanding can be \nreached because the White House has indicated they are prepared to turn \nthese notes over if they can get these agreements. They have an \nunderstanding with our committee; they have an understanding with the \nindependent counsel, and the other relevant body where they need an \nunderstanding is with the House committees. And I gather that matter is \nbeing worked on, and hopefully it will be worked on in a successful \nway.\n  So I just wanted to enter this letter into the Record and make those \ncomments in light of the observations that were just made.\n  I notice that Senator Byrd is in the Chamber.\n  I would like to say to the chairman, I take it Senator Grams would \nseek recognition next, is that correct, after Senator Byrd?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Correct. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Could we then recognize Senator Leahy after Senator \nGrams?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Certainly.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask unanimous consent that following Senator Byrd, \nSenator Grams be recognized and following Senator Grams, Senator Leahy \nbe recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. If I might intrude for 30 seconds upon my friend and \ncolleague from West Virginia, I think it is important to note I \nmentioned that on March 8 the President had a press conference made in \nconnection with the appointment of Lloyd Cutler and specifically as it \nrelated to the question of bringing up privilege said it was hard for \nhim to imagine any circumstance which would be appropriate.\n  That this took place almost 4 months to the day after, 4 months and 3 \ndays after this meeting, it is inconceivable that the President was not \naware of this meeting where his personal attorneys were in attendance. \nSo this is not a question--it seems to me this would not be an \nextraordinary circumstance. This was the circumstance and the fact he \nwas aware of when he indicated that he would not raise the issue of \nprivilege.\n  I just thought it was important to note that for the Record. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized under the previous order.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, has the Pastore rule run its course?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Pastore rule has run its course.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. Then I shall speak out of order, that \nbeing my privilege, in view of the fact that there is no controlled \ntime at the moment.\n  Mr. President, I speak today with apologies to the two managers of \nthe pending resolution.\n  Mr. President, I should also state to Senators that I expect to speak \nfor no less than 45 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/20/senate-section/article/S18939-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18964-S18969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CIVILITY IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I speak from prepared remarks because I \nwanted to be most careful in how I chose my words and so that I might \nspeak as the Apostle Paul in his epistle to the Colossians admonished \nus to do:\n\n       Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, \n     that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern at the growing \nincivility in this Chamber. It reached a peak of excess on last Friday \nduring floor debate with respect to the budget negotiations and the \nContinuing Resolution. One Republican Senator said that he agreed with \nthe Minority Leader that we do have legitimate differences. ``But you \ndo not have the guts to put those legitimate differences on the \ntable,'' that Senator said. He went on to state, ``and then you have \nthe gall to come to us and tell us that we ought to put another \nproposal on the table.'' Now, Mr. President, I can only presume that \nthe Senator was directing his remarks to the Minority Leader, although \nhe was probably including all members on this side of the aisle. He \nalso said that the President of the United States ``has, once again, \nproven that his commitment to principle is non-existent. He gave his \nword; he broke his word. It is a habit he does not seem able to \nbreak.''\n  Mr. President, I do not know what the matter of ``guts'' has to do \nwith the Continuing Resolution or budget negotiations. Simply put, \nthose words are fighting words when used off the Senate floor. One \nmight expect to hear them in an alehouse or beer tavern, where the \nresponse would likely be the breaking of a bottle over the ear of the \none uttering the provocation, or in a pool hall, where the results \nmight be the cracking of a cue stick on the skull of the provocator. Do \nwe have to resort to such language in this forum? In the past century, \nsuch words would be responded to by an invitation to a duel.\n  And who is to judge another person's commitment to principle as being \nnon-existent?\n  I am not in a position to judge that with respect to any other man or \nwoman in this Chamber or on this Earth.\n  Mr. President, the Senator who made these statements is one whom I \nhave known to be amiable and reasonable. I like him. And I was shocked \nto hear such strident words used by him, with such a strident tone. I \nhope that we will all exercise a greater restraint upon our passions \nand avoid making extreme statements that can only serve to further \npolarize the relationships between the two parties in this Chamber and \nbetween the executive and legislative branches. By all means, we should \ndampen our impulses to engage in personal invective.\n  Another Senator, who is very new around here, made the statement--and \nI quote from last Friday's Record: ``This President just does not know \nhow to tell the truth anymore,'' and then accused the President of \nstating to ``the American public--bald-faced untruths.'' The Senator \nwent on to say that, ``we are tired of stomaching untruths over here. \nWe are downright getting angry over here''--the Senator was speaking \nfrom the other side of the aisle. Then with reference to the President \nagain, the Senator said, ``This guy is not going to tell the truth,'' \nand then proceeded to accuse the President ``and many Senators''--``and \nmany Senators''--of making statements that \n\n[[Page S18965]]\ntax cuts have been targeted for the wealthy, ``when they know that is a \nlie.'' Now, the Senator said, ``I am using strong terms like `lie.''' \nThen the Senator made reference to a lack of statesmanship: ``When are \nwe going to get statesmen again in this country? When are we going to \nget these statesmen here in Washington again?'' And then answering his \nown question, he said, ``they are here,'' presumably, one would \nsuppose, referring to himself as one such statesman.\n\n  Mr. President, such statements are harsh and severe, to say the \nleast. And when made by a Senator who has not yet held the office of \nSenator a full year, they are really quite astonishing. In my 37 years \nin this Senate, I do not recall such insolence, and it is very sad that \ndebate and discourse on the Senate floor have sunk to such a low level. \nThe Senator said, ``We are downright getting angry over here.'' Now, \nwhat is that supposed to mean? Does it mean that we on this side should \nsit in fear and in trembling because someone is getting downright \nangry? Mr. President, those whom God wishes to destroy, he first makes \nmad. Solomon tells us: ``He that is slow to anger is better than the \nmighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.''\n  Moreover, Mr. President, for a Senator to make reference on the \nSenate floor to any President, Democrat or Republican, as ``this guy'' \nis to show an utter disrespect for the office of the presidency itself, \nand is also to show an uncaring regard for the disrespect that the \nSenator brings upon himself as a result. ``This guy is not going to \ntell the truth,'' the Senator said, and then he proceeded to state that \nthe President ``and many Senators'' have made statements concerning tax \ncuts--and that would include almost all Senators on this side, because \nalmost all of us have so stated--that ``they know that is a lie,''--and \nI am quoting--that ``they know that is a lie''--admitting, the Senator \nsaid, that the word ``lie'' is a strong term. I have never heard that \nword used in the Senate before in addressing other Senators. I have \nnever heard other Senators called liars. I have never heard a Senator \nsay that other Senators lie.\n  Mr. President, the use of such maledicent language on the Senate \nfloor is quite out of place, and to accuse other Senators of being \nliars is to skate on very, very thin ice, indeed.\n  In his first of three epistles, John admonishes us: ``He that saith, \nI know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth \nis not in him.'' Mr. President, it seems to me that by that standard, \nall of us are certainly--or certainly most of us fall into the \nclassification of liar, and before accusing other Senators of telling a \nlie, one should ``cast first the beam out of thine own eye, and then \nshalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's \neye.''\n  Mr. President, can't we rein in our tongues and lower our voices and \nspeak to each other and about each other in a more civil fashion? I can \ndisagree with another Senator. I have done so many times in this \nChamber. I can state that he is mistaken in his facts; I can state that \nhe is in error. I can do all these things without assaulting his \ncharacter by calling him a liar, by saying that he lies. Have civility \nand common courtesy and reasonableness taken leave of this Chamber? \nSurely the individual vocabularies of Members of this body have not \ndeteriorated to the point that we can only express ourselves in such \ncrude and coarse and offensive language. The proverb tells us that ``A \nfool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till \nafterwards.'' Can we no longer engage in reasoned, even intense, \npartisan exchanges in the Senate without imputing evil motives to other \nSenators, without castigating the personal integrity of our colleagues? \nSuch utterly reckless statements can only poison the waters of the well \nof mutual respect and comity which must prevail in this body if our two \npolitical parties are to work together in the best interests of the \npeople whom we serve. The work of the two Leaders, the work of Mr. \nDole, the work of Mr. Daschle, is thus made more difficult. There is \nenough controversy in the natural course of things in this bitter year, \nwithout making statements that stir even greater controversy and \ndivisiveness.\n  ``If a House be divided against itself, that House cannot stand,'' we \nare told in Mark's Gospel. Surely the people who see and hear the \nSenate at its worst must become discouraged and throw up their hands in \ndisgust at hearing such sour inflammatory rhetoric, which exhales \nitself fuliginously. What can our young people think--they listen to C-\nSPAN; they watch C-SPAN. What can our young people think when they hear \ngrown men in the premiere upper body among the world's legislatures \ncasting such rash aspersions upon the President of the United States \nand upon other Senators? Political partisanship is to be expected in a \nlegislative body--we all engage in it--but bitter personal attacks go \nbeyond the pale of respectable propriety. And let us all be \nscrupulously mindful of the role that vitriolic public statements can \nplay in the stirring of the dark cauldron of violent passions which are \nfar too evident in our land today. Oklahoma City is but 8 months behind \nus. Washington, in his farewell address, warned against party and \nfactional strife. In remarks such as those that were made last Friday, \nwe are seeing bitter partisanship and factionalism at their worst. I \nhope that the leaders of our two parties will attempt to impress upon \nour colleagues the need to tone down the rhetoric and to avoid engaging \nin vicious diatribes that impugn and question the motives and \nprinciples and the personal integrity of other Senators and of the \nPresident of the United States.\n\n  It is one thing to criticize the policies of the President and his \nadministration. I have offered my own strong criticism of President \nClinton and past Presidents of both parties in respect to some of their \npolicies. I simply do not agree with some of them. But it is quite \nanother matter to engage in personal attacks that hold the President up \nto obloquy and opprobrium and scorn. Senators ought to be bigger than \nthat. Anyone who thinks of himself as a gentleman ought to be above \nsuch contumely. The bandying about of such words as liar, or lie, can \nonly come from a contumelious lip, and for one, who has been honored by \nthe electorate to serve in the high office of United States Senator, to \nengage in such rude language arising from haughtiness and contempt, is \nto lower himself in the eyes of his peers, and of the American people \ngenerally, to the status of a street brawler.\n  Mr. President, in 1863, Willard Saulsbury of Delaware, in lengthy \nremarks, referred to President Abraham Lincoln as a ``weak and imbecile \nman'' and accused other Senators of ``blackguardism.'' Saulsbury was \nruled out of order by the Vice President who sat in the Chair and \nordered to take his seat. Another Senator offered a resolution the \nfollowing day for his expulsion, but Saulsbury appeared the next day \nand apologized to the Senate for his remarks, which were quite out of \norder, and that was the end of the matter. Senators should take note of \nthis and try to restrain their indulgence for outlandish and extreme \naccusations and charges in public debate on this floor.\n  The kind of mindless gabble and rhetorical putridities as were voiced \non this floor last Friday can only create bewilderment and doubt among \nthe American people as to our ability to work with each other in this \nChamber. And that is what they expect us to do. Certainly these are not \nthe attributes and marks of a statesman. Statesmen do not call each \nother liars or engage in such execrations as fly from pillar to post in \nthis Chamber. I have seen statesmen during my time in the Senate, and \nthey have stood on both sides of the aisle. They have stood tall, sun-\ncrowned, and above the fog in public duty and in private thinking--\nabove the fog of personal insinuations and malicious calumny.\n  The Bob Tafts, the Everett Dirksens--I have seen him stand at that \ndesk--the Everett Dirksens, the Norris Cottons, the George Aikens, the \nHoward Bakers, the Jack Javitses, the Hugh Scotts, or the John Heinzes \nof yesteryear did not throw the word ``lie'' in the teeth of their \ncolleagues. Nor do such honorable colleagues who serve today as Thad \nCochran, Mark Hatfield, Ted Stevens, John Chafee, Arlen Specter, Nancy \nKassebaum, Bill Cohen, Orrin Hatch, John Warner, Dirk Kempthorne, Alan \nSimpson--oh, there is one I will miss when he leaves this Chamber--and \nmany \n\n[[Page S18966]]\nother Senators on that side of the aisle. Bob Bennett of Utah \nrecognized the rhetorical cesspool for what it was last Friday and he \nkept himself above it. He took note of it. I have never heard our \nmajority leader, I have never heard our minority leader, I have never \nheard any majority leader or minority leader accuse other Senators of \nlying. I am confident that our leaders and most Senators find such \ngutter talk to be unacceptable in this forum.\n  Mr. President, in 1986, I helped to open the Senate floor to the \ntelevising of Senate debate. On the whole, I think it has worked rather \nwell. I believed then and I still believe that TV coverage of Senate \ndebate can and should educate and inspire the American people. But in \nmy 37 years in the United States Senate, this has been a different \nyear. William Manchester in his book ``The Glory and the Dream'' speaks \nof the year 1932 as the ``cruelest year.'' I was a boy growing up in \nthe Depression in 1932. I remember it as the cruelest year. But, Mr. \nPresident, in some ways, I think this year has been even more cruel. I \nhave seen the Senate deteriorate this year. The decorum in the Senate \nhas deteriorated, and political partisanship has run rife. And when the \nAmerican people see and hear such intellectual pemmican as was spewed \nforth on this floor last Friday, no wonder there is such a growing \ndisrespect for Congress throughout the country. The American people \nhave every right to think that we are just a miserable lot of bickering \njuveniles, and I have come to be sorry that television is here, when we \nmake such a spectacle of ourselves. When we accuse our colleagues of \nlying--I have never done that. I have never heard it done in this \nSenate before. Clay and John Randolph fought a duel over less than \nthat. Aaron Burr shot and killed Alexander Hamilton for less than that. \nWhen we accuse our colleagues of lying and deliver ourselves of \nreckless imprecations and vengeful maledictions against the President \nof the United States, and against other Senators, it is no wonder--no \nwonder--that good men and women who have served honorably and long in \nthis body are saying they have had enough! They may not go out here \npublicly and say that, but they have had enough.\n  Mr. President, it is with profound sadness that I have taken the \nFloor today to express my alarm and concern at the poison that has \nsettled in upon this chamber. There have been giants in this Senate, \nand I have seen some of them. Little did I know when I came here that I \nwould live to see pygmies stride like colossuses while marveling, like \nAesop's fly, sitting on the axle of a chariot, ``My, what a dust I do \nraise!''\n  Mr. President, party has a tendency to warp intelligence. I was \nchosen a Senator by a majority of the people of West Virginia seven \ntimes, but not for a majority only. I was chosen by a party, but not \nfor a party. I try to represent all of the people of the state--\nDemocrats and Republicans--who sent me here. I recognize no claim upon \nmy action in the name and for the sake of party only. The oath I have \ntaken 13 times, and in my 50 years of public service, is to support and \ndefend the Constitution of my country's government, not the fiat of any \npolitical organization. This is not to say that political party is not \nimportant. It is. But party is not all important. Many times I have \nsaid that, and I have said that there are several things that are more \nimportant than political party. Sometimes as I sit and listen to Senate \ndebate, I get the impression that to some of us, political party is \nabove everything else. I sometimes get the impression that, more \nimportant than what serves the best interests of our country is what \nserves the political fortunes of a political party in the next \nelections. This Senate was not created for that purpose. This is not a \nforum that was created for the purpose of advancing one's political \ncareer or one's political party. In the day that the Senate was \ncreated, no such thing as political party in the United States was even \na consideration. None of our forebears who created our republican form \nof government was for a party, but all were for the state. Political \nparties were formed afterward and have grown in strength since, and \ntoday the troubles that afflict our country, in many ways, chiefly may \nbe said to arise from the dangerous excess of party feeling in our \nnational councils. What does reason avail, when party spirit presides?\n  The welfare of the country is more dear than the mere victory of \nparty. As George William Curtis once said, some may scorn this \npractical patriotism as impracticable folly. But such was the folly of \nthe Spartan Leonidas, holding back, with his 300, the Persian horde, \nand teaching Greece the self reliance that saved her. Such was the \nfolly of the Swiss Arnold von Winkelried, gathering into his own breast \nthe points of Austrian spears, making his dead body the bridge of \nvictory for his countrymen. Such was the folly of Nathan Hale, who, on \nSeptember 22, 1776, gladly risked the seeming disgrace of his name, and \ngrieved that he had but one life to give for his country. Such was the \nfolly of Davy Crockett and 182 other defenders of the Alamo who were \nslain after holding out 13 days against a Mexican army in 1836, thus \npermitting Sam Houston time enough to perfect plans for the defense of \nTexas. Such are the beacon lights of a pure patriotism that burn \nforever in men's memories and shine forth brightly through the \nilluminated ages. What has happened to all of that?\n  Mr. President, when our forefathers were blackened by the smoke and \ngrime at Shiloh and at Fredericksburg, they did not ask or care whether \nthose who stood shoulder to shoulder beside them were Democrats or \nRepublicans; they asked only that they might prove as true as was the \nsteel in the rifles that they grasped in their hands. The cannonballs \nthat mowed brave men down like stalks of corn were not labeled \nRepublican cannonballs or Democrat cannonballs. When those intrepid \nsoldiers fought with unfailing loyalty to General Thomas J. Jackson--\nwho was born in what is now Harrison County, West Virginia--who stood \nlike a wall of stone in the midst of shot and shell at the first battle \nof Bull Run, they did not ask each other whether that brave officer, \nwho later fell the victim of a rifle ball, was a Democrat or \nRepublican. They did not pause to question the politics of that cool \ngunner standing by his smoking cannon in the midst of death, whether \nthe poor wounded, mangled, gasping comrades, crushed and torn, and \ndying in agony all about them--had voted for Lincoln or Douglas, for \nBreckinridge or Bell. No. They were full of other thoughts. Men were \nprized for what they were worth to the common country of us all, not \nfor the party to which they belonged. The bones that molder today \nbeneath the sod in Flanders Field and in Arlington Cemetery do not \nsleep in graves that are Republican or Democrat. These are Americans \nwho gave their lives in the service of their country, not in the \nservice of a political party. We who serve together in this Senate, \nmust know this in our hearts.\n  I understand, and we understand, that partisanship plays a part in \nour work here. There is nothing inherently wrong with that. There is \nnothing inherently wrong with partisanship. But I hope that we will all \ntake a look at ourselves on both sides of this aisle and understand \nalso that we must work together in harmony and with mutual respect for \none another. This very charter of government under which we live was \ncreated in a spirit of compromise and mutual concession. And it is only \nin that spirit that a continuance of this charter of government can be \nprolonged and sustained. When the Committee on Style and Revision of \nthe Federal Convention of 1787 had prepared a digest of their plan, \nthey reported a letter to accompany the plan to Congress, from which I \ntake these words: ``And thus the Constitution which we now present is \nthe result of a spirit of amity and of that mutual deference and \nconcession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered \nindispensable.''\n  Mr. President, Majorian, the Emperor of the West, in 457 A.D. said he \nwas a prince ``who still gloried in the name of Senator.''\n  Mr. President, as one who has gloried in the name of Senator, I \nshudder to think of the day when, because of the shamelessness and \nreckless intemperance of a few, I might instead become one who is \nembarrassed by it.\n  Let us stop this seemingly irresistible urge to destroy all that we \nhave always held sacred. Let us cease this childish need to resort to \nemotional strip-tease on the Senate Floor.\n  Let us remember that we are lucky enough to reside in the greatest \ncountry on earth and to have the further \n\n[[Page S18967]]\nfortune to have been selected by the American people to actively \nparticipate as their representatives in this miraculous experiment in \nfreedom which has set the world afire with hope.\n  Mr. President, there are rules of the Senate and we simply cannot \nignore those rules. We must defend them and cherish them. I will read \nto the Senate what Vice President Adlai E. Stevenson said with regard \nto the Senate's rules on March 3, 1897, because I believe his \nobservation is as fitting today as it was at the end of the 19th \ncentury:\n\n       It must not be forgotten that the rules governing this body \n     are founded deep in human experience; that they are the \n     result of centuries of tireless effort in legislative hall, \n     to conserve, to render stable and secure, the rights and \n     liberties which have been achieved by conflict. By its rules \n     the Senate wisely fixes the limits to its own power. Of those \n     who clamor against the Senate, and its methods of procedure, \n     it may be truly said: ``They know not what they do.'' In this \n     Chamber alone are preserved, without restraint, two \n     essentials of wise legislation and of good government--the \n     right of amendment and of debate. Great evils often result \n     from hasty legislation; rarely from the delay which follows \n     full discussion and deliberation. In my humble judgment, the \n     historic Senate--preserving the unrestricted right of \n     amendment and of debate, maintaining intact, the time-honored \n     parliamentary methods and amenities which unfailingly secure \n     action after deliberation--possesses in our scheme of \n     government a value which cannot be measured by words.\n\n  Mr. President, we must honor these rules. The distinguished Presiding \nOfficer today, Slade Gorton of Washington, respects and honors these \nrules. We simply have to stop this business of castigating the \nintegrity of other Senators. We all have to abide by these rules.\n  Mr. President, may a temperate spirit return to this chamber and may \nit again reign in our public debates and political discourses, that the \ngreat eagle in our national seal may continue to look toward the sun \nwith piercing eyes that survey, with majestic grace, all who come \nwithin the scope and shadow of its mighty wings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is informed under the \nprevious order the next Senator to be recognized was the Senator from \nMinnesota [Mr. Grams].\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak out of \norder for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I also ask to be allowed to speak out of \norder for 5 minutes. I do think that this has been a very important \ndiscourse, but I do think it is important that a response be heard from \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I want to thank, first, the Senator from Minnesota for \naccommodating my unanimous-consent request.\n  I begin by saying I believe the Senate owes a debt of gratitude to \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia for the appropriate \nlecture that he has given each and every one of us. That speech ought \nto be reprinted and sent to every civics class in the country. It ought \nto be reprinted and sent to every legal function that is held for the \nnext several weeks, and perhaps most importantly it ought to be \nreprinted and sent to every U.S. Senator and Congressman sitting today. \nIt ought to be reread. It ought to be studied. It ought to be \nrespected. Never has his wisdom, clarity of his reasoning or his \neloquence been more evident. It needed to be said.\n  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia mentioned many giants, \npast and present, of the U.S. Senate. I add to that list the name \nRobert C. Byrd, a Senator motivated by a profound respect for this \ninstitution, a Senator driven by a profound belief in what is right, \nwhat is good, and what is so critical in this remarkable institution.\n  Today, he is right. We have lost civility. The need for bipartisan \nspirit, as we debate the critical issues of the day, could never be \nmore profound and more important. Excessive partisanship is as \ndestructive to this institution as violence is to ourselves.\n  So I express the gratitude of many who have had the good fortune this \nafternoon to have heard his remarkable words. I simply urge each of our \ncolleagues to reread his remarks, to think of them carefully, and to \nlisten to them and take the advice. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I, too, came to the floor and listened to \nthe entire presentation by the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia. I knew it would be illuminating. No Senator, I am sure, knows \nas much about the history, the record, the decorum in this institution \nthan the Senator from West Virginia. And he very often comes and \nreminds us of history and how it should relate to what we are doing \ntoday. I always find it extremely interesting. And he laces his remarks \nwith quotations from history, from great statesmen, from the Bible. \nThey are all woven together beautifully and we are all indebted for his \npresentations.\n  And I agree that it is timely and that we should all take stock of \nwhat he had to say, his admonitions, on both sides of the aisle.\n  I have been in this city, now, for 27 years--4 years as a staff \nmember to the chairman of the Rules Committee in the House of \nRepresentatives, a Democrat; 16 years in the House of Representatives, \nincluding 8 years as the minority whip, and 7 years in the Senate. I \nremember how civility collapsed in the House of Representatives during \nthe latter part of those years; the second half of the 1980's, 1985, \n1986, 1987. I remember the night I decided to run for this body. It \nbecame so uncivil that the Members were literally shouting at each \nother. A vote was held open for over 30 minutes so that one Member from \nTexas could be brought back to the Chamber and, in effect, forced to \nswitch his vote. I was ashamed of our conduct. I was ashamed of my own \nconduct that night. And I said there has to be a better place than \nthis. I hoped I would find it here.\n  I remember one time in the House of Representatives, when the Speaker \nof the House of Representatives came from the chair down into the well, \nand impugned the integrity of a Member of the House of Representatives. \nAnd I rose to my feet and demanded that the Speaker's words be taken \ndown, and the acting Speaker had to rule that the Speaker of the \ninstitution was out of order, at which point I asked unanimous consent \nthat the Record be expunged of his remarks and we be allowed to \nproceed. He was out of order. I know about excessive partisanship, \nexcessive rhetoric, and the breakdown of civility. I have seen it as a \nstaff member, as a House Member.\n  And now we come to this body. It is a body that we should all have \nreverence for, and that is what the Senator from West Virginia seeks. \nIt is a body that has always prided itself in respect for each other \nand for the rights of the individual Senator. I still chafe, sometimes, \nunder the idea that one Senator can tie up this entire institution to \nthe disadvantage of all the rest of us, or one Senator can keep us all \nwaiting while he or she comes to vote and we all stand around, \nshuffling our feet. But that is this system. It is unique. It is \nspecial. While I, as an old House Member, grumble about it, I do not \nwant a Rules Committee over here. I want the Senate to be the Senate. I \nunderstand its uniqueness.\n\n  So we do not want decorum to slip, and it has been slipping on both \nsides. But let me suggest that maybe you should think about it on both \nsides of the aisle. Because I have been seeing it slipping on the other \nside. The partisanship has been getting heated.\n  Party is not the most important thing here--not for me, not for most \nof us. I was a Democrat. I showed that party was not the important \nthing to me, that my philosophy was more important, because I ran as a \nRepublican after having been raised, I guess, as a Democrat. I am here \nbecause I care for the country and because of the things that I think \nare important for the country.\n  I submit, one of the reasons why this year has been so tough is \nbecause this year we are dealing with big issues, fundamental changes--\nfundamental changes. I care about them, not because of my party or this \nPresident or that President. I care about them because of my daughter \nand my son. I want to make sure that they have the opportunities that I \nhave had for the rest of their lives. So they do matter.\n  These are tense intense times. There are differences that really \nmatter. But we do not have to be disrespectful to \n\n[[Page S18968]]\neach other to disagree. I have a great respect for the distinguished \nminority leader. I have known him for years, worked with him, talked to \nhim. And the Senator from California, [Mrs. Feinstein] we talk \ntogether, we work together. I believe in sharing information. One of \nthe things that bothers me around here sometimes is you cannot get \ninformation from either side.\n  But I think we need to remember that these are important issues and I \nthink maybe part of what is happening here is a little chafing that, \nafter all, after 8 years we have a majority over here. We had it \nbriefly in the 1980's, but there has been a switch back. The minority \nis just unhappy with not having the votes for their issues.\n  But when we do get right up in each other's faces on these issues and \nstart using words like ``tawdry'' and ``sleazy,'' when you are talking \nabout an action of the leader, that is not the way we ought to proceed.\n\n  So, whether it is partisanship, or strong political feelings, or \nwords that are too strong, we should all just cool it a little bit. I \nthink, perhaps, as a result of the speech of the Senator from West \nVirginia and others who feel that we do need to find a way to bring \nthis under control, that we will find a way to do so. I hope we will \nwork in that vein and I certainly will support that effort with my own \nefforts.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I do.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator calls to the attention of the Senate the words \n``tawdry'' and ``sleazy'' that I once used on the floor. Of course he \nhad a purpose in doing that.\n  May I say, I never called any Senator a liar. I was not talking about \nthe personality of the majority leader in that instance. I was talking \nabout an agreement that had been broken.\n  I am very careful, I try to be careful, and sometimes I speak in \nhaste. And subsequent to that remark on this very floor one evening, I \nreferred to my having spoken in haste, and to my having used some \nwords, which I wish I had chosen differently. So nobody needs to remind \nthis Senator as to what this Senator has said. I am ready to defend \nanything I say.\n  Never once have I said that any Senator lied, or that any Senator was \na liar. And I do not intend ever to do that. That is what we are \ntalking about here today.\n  Mr. LOTT. I agree and we should not be calling each other liars, or \nother people, or anybody here on the floor. But we all ought to be \ncareful not to skate too close to the edge in the words we use, and try \nto find a way to make our case positively. I think we can all do that, \nand I hope that we will strive to do that, on both sides of the aisle, \nin the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is entitled to be recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, if I might, I believe under the previous \norder there is a unanimous consent for Senator Grams, to be followed by \nSenator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I ask unanimous consent to expand that, so Senator Mack \nmight be recognized after Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as a member of the special committee to \ninvestigate Whitewater, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support \nSenate Resolution 199.\n  For months, our committee has been trying to get to the bottom of the \ncontroversial affair known as Whitewater--the unsavory Arkansas land \ndevelopment deal whose principal investors included the President and \nthe First Lady and which contributed in large part to the $60 million \nfailure of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan.\n  This committee was initially convened to investigate the failure of \nMadison, which was bailed out at the expense of the taxpayers, and the \nrole that the Clintons' investments in Whitewater may have played in \nMadison's demise.\n  But as time has passed and the committee has dug deeper into this \nmatter, new issues regarding the Clinton administration have arisen--\nissues related to arrogance, abuse of power, lack of accountability to \nthe people, and obstruction of justice.\n  There is no clearer example of these unseemly traits than the issue \nfacing the Senate today: the President's assertion of the attorney-\nclient privilege to withhold notes taken by a taxpayer-paid public \nservant at a meeting to discuss Bill Clinton's personal legal problems.\n  On November 5, 1993, a meeting was held in Washington by seven men--\nthree private attorneys and four White House officials: White House \ncounsel Bernard Nussbaum, associate White House counsels William \nKennedy and Neil Eggleston, and White House Personnel Director Bruce \nLindsey.\n  From the information we have been able to collect, the meeting \nconcerned: first, criminal referrals related to Madison Guaranty which \nnamed Bill and Hillary Clinton as potential witnesses; and second, the \ncriminal lending practices of Capital Management Services--a federally \nlicensed company which allegedly diverted funds to Whitewater.\n  When questioned by the special committee, both Mr. Lindsey and Mr. \nKennedy refused to discuss the substance of that November 1993 meeting. \nIn addition, Mr. Kennedy refused to provide us with his notes from the \nmeeting, despite evidence showing that these notes may be significantly \nrelated to our investigation.\n  Mr. Kennedy, at the instruction of counsel for both the President and \nthe First Lady, went so far as to ignore a subpoena from our committee \nfor these notes. Instead, he and the President asserted that the \nattorney-client privilege protects them from disclosing these notes.\n  For reasons given by many of my colleagues today, this claim on a \nlegal basis is at best questionable. But in the midst of this important \ndebate over the legal ramifications of the President's abuse of this \nprivilege, I hope that the ethical issues that have surrounded this \nevent will not be ignored.\n  At the time of this meeting, Mr. Kennedy served as associate White \nHouse counsel. Like Mr. Nussbaum, Mr. Eggleston, and Mr. Lindsey, he \nwas paid not by President Clinton, but by the taxpayers. His office was \nfurnished by taxpayers' dollars. His business expenses were covered by \ntaxpayers' dollars.\n  Given these facts, it is obvious to me that Mr. Kennedy's true \nclients, the people to whom he owned his legal services, were you and \nme: the taxpayers. This relationship, however, has still not been \nhonestly recognized by President Clinton.\n  By asserting privilege over these notes, President Clinton \nessentially said that Mr. Kennedy worked for him, in spite of the fact \nthat Bill Clinton did not pay Mr. Kennedy's salary. By using this legal \ntool, Bill Clinton in essence turned his own personal legal bills over \nto the taxpayers. And that, Mr. President, is dead wrong.\n  I suppose we should not be too surprised by President Clinton's \nactions. After all, Mr. Kennedy is just one of many current and former \nemployees of the executive branch involved in this apparent coverup of \nWhitewater.\n  During our hearings, we have heard from a number of Federal \nemployees--political appointees and civil servants alike--about their \nroles in keeping this whole matter quiet and away from the eye of \npublic scrutiny.\n  It's clear to me and anyone else who has paid attention to our \nhearings that Bill Clinton has used every tool in his grasp to \nstonewall this investigation. This use of privilege to shield Mr. \nKennedy's notes from the public was the most blatant abuse of power we \nhave seen, but it has not been the only one.\n  Do not misunderstand me--I believe every citizen, including the \nPresident of the United States of America, is entitled to the \nprotections of the attorney-client privilege. But no one, not even the \nPresident, has the right to abuse this privilege, especially when doing \nso means furthering one's personal gain over the public good.\n  And even with the White House inching toward some sort of agreement, \nthe damage has already been done. The attorney-client privilege has \nalready been asserted to protect not Just Bill Clinton, but also \nPresident Clinton.\n  Today, the Oliver Stone film ``Nixon'' is opening in theaters across \nAmerica. I suggest that Bill Clinton arrange a private screening in the \nWhite House theater, as it should be most instructive for the future.\n\n[[Page S18969]]\n\n  What the people hated most about the Watergate scandal was not the \namateur break-in at the Democratic National Committee. What they could \nnot tolerate and what led to the resignation of President Nixon was the \ncover-up, the stonewalling, the fact that the President placed himself \nabove the law.\n  But Mr. President, even Richard Nixon did not hide behind the \nattorney-client privilege. Bill Clinton did.\n  Eighteen-months ago this was something that President Clinton said \nthat he would never do, as we can see from a quote from President \nClinton's remarks to a town meeting in Charlotte, NC on April 5, 1994. \nThe President said:\n\n       I've looked for no procedural ways to get around this. I \n     say, you tell me you want to know, I'll give you the \n     information. I have done everything I could to be open and \n     aboveboard.\n\n  Some have asked why it is so important that the special committee \nreceive access to Mr. Kennedy's notes. I can only answer by asking \nPresident Clinton why it was so important to him that these notes not \nbe seen. Why did he go to such lengths as to use privilege as a shield \nto hide these notes from the public?\n  Obviously, if there is nothing to hide, there is no reason to keep \nthese notes a secret or to conditionally withhold them. If there is \nnothing incriminating in these pages, why not disclose them openly and \nhonestly?\n  The fact of the matter is we will not know until we see them. And if \nthere is something there, these notes may help us piece together the \npuzzle known as Whitewater.\n  Because unlike the witnesses from the administration who have been \nexpertly coached to experience suspiciously selective memory during \ntheir testimony, these notes cannot hide anything. They cannot duck \nquestions by saying, ``My memory fails me'' or ``I can't recollect at \nthis time.''\n  And maybe that is what scares Bill Clinton the most.\n  Mr. President, it may surprise you, but I hope that these notes do \nnot incriminate anyone. Like most Americans, I want to think the best \nof our President.\n  But we have a responsibility to get to the bottom of this whole \naffair, because, like everyone who has worked for the Clinton \nadministration, we too are paid by the taxpayers. And we owe it to them \nto uncover the truth, no matter how dark or unsavory it might be.\n  That, Mr. President, is what this resolution before the Senate is all \nabout--it is what this entire Whitewater investigation is about: Our \nobligation to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the \ntruth. I urge the President to unconditionally release these notes.\n  If he does not, I hope my colleagues will join me in a spirit of \nhonesty and openness in supporting this resolution. We owe the American \npeople that much.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/20/senate-section/article/S18964-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18969-S18970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE STATEMENT OF SENATOR BYRD\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am going to speak about the issue before \nus on Whitewater, but because of the extraordinary statement by the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, I wish to make a few \nadditional comments.\n  I have been privileged to serve in this body for 21 years with \nSenator Robert C. Byrd. I have been privileged to serve with a number \nof giants--I consider him one, certainly--but giants on both sides of \nthe aisle, both Republicans and Democrats. I think of the leadership of \nSenator Byrd, who has served both as majority and minority leader, and \nhow much I appreciate and respect his leadership. I think also of our \nother Democratic leaders like Mike Mansfield, George Mitchell, and Tom \nDaschle and the great Republican leaders, Bob Dole and Howard Baker, \nwho have served with such distinction in this body.\n  I think, as I have been on this floor, of the remarkable opportunity \nI have been given to serve here. One set of my grandparents came to \nVermont and came to these shores not speaking a word of English. My \nother great-grandparents left a distant country to come to Vermont to \nseek a better way of life. Both my grandfathers were stonecutters in \nVermont. My paternal grandfather died when my father was just a \nyoungster. He died in the stone sheds of Vermont leaving a widow and \ntwo children--my grandmother, my father, and his sister.\n  My father, as a teenager, had to help support the family and never \ncompleted the schooling that his son was later able to pursue. He \nbecame a self-taught historian, certainly one of the best I ever knew. \nAnd he revered and respected the U.S. Senate.\n  So many times my father would tell me, as I sat here on the floor of \nthe Senate, that this body should be the conscience of our Nation. In \nmy first two terms, when my father was still alive, he was able to come \nand listen to Senators debate. I remember him repeating almost verbatim \nstatements made by Senators--again, both Republicans and Democrats. He \nspoke with a sense of admiration of the courage that those men, and now \nwomen, show in this body in speaking to the conscience of our Nation. \nHe talked about how this is where leaders of our Nation reside.\n  Only 15 people in the present Senate have served in this body longer \nthan I. No Democrat has served longer than Senator Byrd. I believe \nSenator Byrd has done a great service for this body today. I hope that \neach of us will read and reread what he said, because, in my 21 years \nhere, I have seen the Senate degenerate. And I do not use that word \ncasually. I have seen some of the finest Members leave, and in leaving \nsay this body is not what it used to be.\n  People truly respect the Senate. My good friend from Arkansas, \nSenator Pryor, who is on the floor today, one whose absence I will feel \ngreatly in the next Congress, and Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming, \nanother good friend, Senator Kassebaum, Senator Hatfield, Senator \nBrown, Senator Bradley, Senator Nunn, Senator Pell, Senator Simon, \nSenator Heflin, and others with whom I have talked--these are people of \ngreat experience and great quality--every one of them will tell you the \nsame thing: This Senate has changed.\n\n  Mr. President, we owe it to ourselves to listen to what Senator Byrd \nsaid, and we owe it to the Senate to listen. More than owing anything \nto Senator Byrd or me or any other Member, we owe it to the Senate \nbecause long after all of us leave, I pray to God this body will still \nbe here. And I pray to God this body will be here as the conscience of \nthe Nation.\n  If you go back and read the writings of Jefferson, if you go back and \nread the writings of the founders of this country, you know that this \nbody is a place where ideas should be debated, where the direction of \nour Nation and the conscience of our Nation should be shaped.\n  Mr. President, I fear that we are not doing this. I fear that this \ncountry will suffer if we do not listen. All of us have a \nresponsibility to listen, Republicans and Democrats alike. Presidents \nwill come and Presidents will go. We will have great Presidents, and we \nwill have Presidents who are not so great. They will come and go. \nMembers of the Senate will come and go, and we will have great Members \nof the Senate and some not so great. But all of us take the same oath \nto uphold the Constitution of this great country, and we also come here \nprivileged to help lead this country, but we ought to be humbled by the \nresponsibility that gives us.\n  I have taken an oath to uphold this country's Constitution four times \nin this body, and five times as a prosecutor before that. I hold that \noath as a very sacred trust. Each one of us ought to ask ourselves if \nwe engage in debate or actions or votes that denigrate that \nConstitution or denigrate the country or denigrate the most important \nfunctions of our Government, do we really deserve to be here? Partisan \npositions are one thing. Positions that hurt the country are yet \nanother.\n  So let us listen to what was said here.

I do not \n\n\n[[Page S18970]]\nthink that Senator Byrd has to ask himself that question. We know his \nanswer. It is one with which I agree. But all of us should ask \nourselves that question.\n  Mr. President, in later days I will speak more on the subject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/20/senate-section/article/S18969-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       DIRECTING THE SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL TO BRING A CIVIL ACTION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the resolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would like, Mr. President, to speak about Senate \nResolution 199. We have been asked this session to consider a number of \nmatters with which I did not agree. I think, frankly, this one, Senate \nResolution 199, may take a special holiday season award. I am not here \nto talk about the arguments over the attorney-client privilege issues \nor the precedent we are being asked to establish, or the failure fully \nto explore settlement of this matter in light of the President's \nwillingness to produce the notes to the Whitewater special counsel and \nto the Senate so long as a general waiver of privilege does not result. \nI will not linger on being asked to enforce a subpoena that was not \nproperly served.\n  Let me direct my colleagues' attention to one aspect of this matter \nthat has not yet been explored: We are being asked to authorize Senate \nlegal counsel to commence an action that cannot be brought.\n  Senate resolution 199 expressly proposes that we, the Senate, direct \nour Senate legal counsel to bring a civil action to enforce a subpoena \nof the Special Committee To Investigate Whitewater Development \nCorporation and Related Matters for notes taken by an associate counsel \nto the President. The statute under which we are being asked to \nauthorize the proposed civil contempt proceeding expressly precludes \njust the kind of legal action we are being asked to authorize, one that \nwould create a confrontation with the executive branch.\n  The second sentence of section 1365 of title 28, United States Code, \nprovides:\n\n       This section shall not apply to an action to enforce, to \n     secure a declaratory judgment concerning the validity of, or \n     to prevent a threatened refusal to comply with, any subpoena \n     or order issued to an officer or employee of the Federal \n     Government acting within his official capacity.\n\n  This, of course, was put in the statute to avoid putting the courts \nin a position of having to resolve a conflict between the other two \nindependent branches of government.\n  So long as it would not violate anyone's attorney-client privilege, I \nwould be extremely interested in knowing what Senate legal counsel has \nadvised the special committee with regard to subpoenas to the White \nHouse and for White House legal counsel notes and with regard to their \nenforceability by way of civil action. I think before the Senate is \nasked to authorize it, we ought to know whether the civil contempt \nproceeding we are being asked to authorize is even legal. Does the \nspecial committee have a legal opinion from our Senate legal counsel on \nthe viability of the action proposed? If so, I would like to have it \nput in the Record.\n  This dispute arises, as the special committee's report explains, from \na demand for documents to the White House in response to which the \nWhite House identified Mr. Kennedy's notes as privileged.\n  The special committee goes to great lengths in its report to argue \nMr. Kennedy was not acting as a personal attorney to the President and \nthe First Lady, but then dismisses the conclusion that follows. If Mr. \nKennedy attended the meeting in his role as associate counsel to the \nPresident, then it would appear that no legal action can be brought \nunder section 1365. The special committee cannot have it both ways.\n  So I think we should consider that which we are being asked to \nauthorize. I know millions of dollars have been spent on this \ninvestigation. I know we will probably spend millions more. But at \nleast when we vote we ought to know whether we are voting to do \nsomething that can be done.\n  We have no need to authorize legal action, least of all one that \ncannot be brought under the terms of the very statute under which \nauthorization is being sought.\n  I appreciate the distinguished chairman arranging this time for me.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, in order to attempt to move the flow, I \nwould ask unanimous consent that following Senator Mack, Senator Simon \nbe recognized, and following Senator Simon, Senator Thompson be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And then Senator Glenn.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. And then followed by Senator Glenn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I had initially come to participate in the \ndebate on Whitewater, but there was a speech of some 45 minutes or so \nby Senator Byrd a little bit earlier that made reference to some \ncomments I made in the Chamber of the Senate last Friday. The Senator \nreferred to my use of the word ``guts'' and drew from that that I was \nimplying that a number of Senators maybe did not have the guts to \npresent an alternative proposal.\n\n  It would be easy for me to come here with a sense of defensiveness \nand anger, but I do not. I come to the floor to speak--I am not quite \nsure how long, and I am not quite sure what about, other than it was \nclearly not my intention to impugn the integrity or the intentions of \nmy colleagues in the U.S. Senate.\n  I really have been, I think, driven to come to the floor this \nafternoon, as I said, not out of anger but, frankly, out of love. I \nhave strived in my life to try to make civility one of my No. 1 \nconcerns. And when I heard civility being talked about, and I heard it \nbeing talked about with reference to words that I had said last Friday, \nit made me take notice, it made me think about that impassioned speech \nthat I gave last Friday.\n  Let me say that I feel very strongly about what I had to say about \nwhat was going on with respect to the budget and the failure to get a \nbalanced budget and the importance of getting a balanced budget and \nwhat that means for this country, for America, for future generations, \nfor children, for my grandchildren. I felt that very deeply.\n  But since I apparently--maybe I should take out the word \n``apparently'' so there would be no question--since I have been charged \nwith breaking rule IXX, I apologize to my colleagues in the U.S. \nSenate. I am driven to do this even though I know there are those who \nwould say, ``Oh, you should never apologize, never engage in a defense \nof your actions because, you know, that brings too much attention to \nwhat you've done.'' But I come to the floor of the U.S. Senate to once \nagain say to my friend and colleague, and somebody whom I respect \ntremendously, Senator Daschle, who in essence is kindness, that in no \nway did I attempt or did I mean to challenge the minority leader.\n  I have no ill-feelings toward Senator Byrd. He is right to remind us \nof the rules of the U.S. Senate. But I hope that we would all take \nnotice of that, Democrat and Republican alike.\n  For me to stand here on the floor of the U.S. Senate and imply or \nallow others to conclude that I am the only one that might have pushed \nthe envelope with respect to words used would, in fact, be a tragic \nmistake. So I hope that we would all listen to what Senator Byrd had to \nsay.\n  If my coming forward today to react to Senator Byrd's comments will \nhelp reduce the rhetoric and allow us to return to a time of greater \ncivility, then my coming to the floor will have been worth it.\n  I do not know how many times I thought of how we could begin the \nprocess of bridging the differences between us, of truly understanding \nhow the other side truly believes the policies, the ideas, and the \nprinciples they put forward instead of always questioning the motive. \nAnd so I welcome those on the other side of the aisle who want to be \nengaged in discussions about how we bridge that divide, how we could \nbegin the process of really truly finding out how it is that we can \nsatisfy your concerns and at the same time satisfy ours, instead of \nthere always having to be one winner. \n\n[[Page S18971]]\n\n\n  If I did not mention it, again I will mention M. Scott Peck's book \n``The World Waiting To Be Born'' and some of the other books that he \nhas written, ``People of the Lie: The Hope for Healing Human Evil,'' \nhis discussion about evil in America. His initial book, at least the \none that most of us are familiar with is ``The Road Less Traveled.'' We \ndo need more civility and more grace in our lives in America today.\n  So, Mr. President, I could not allow this situation to develop \nwithout again responding from my heart and from my soul to say that if \nmy words the other day, in fact, have heightened or have increased the \nlack of civility, I apologize to my colleagues. But I ask you as I do \nthis that you be honest with yourselves, ask yourself about your \nactions and about your rhetoric. Ask yourselves the question, How, in \nfact, can we find a way to work together?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. D'Amato).

Mr. President, first, if I may comment on the remarks of \nour colleague from Florida. It was a gracious and generous statement on \nhis part. I think all of us--Paul Simon has been guilty, like most of \nus have been guilty from time to time, of getting--you know, we get a \nlittle wrought up more than we should from time to time.\n  Part of the answer to the question raised by Senator Mack is, if we \nassume that our colleagues are just as sincere about their position as \nwe are, it makes for a different kind of an atmosphere.\n  If my colleagues have real good memories, you may remember I was a \nPresidential candidate at one time. I remember a reporter for one of \nthe major newspapers telling me that he had been talking to Senator \nHelms and Senator Thurmond, with whom I frequently disagree, and both \nof them spoke very highly of me. He wanted to know how that could be, \nand I mentioned, whenever I get into a debate I try to remind myself \nthat the other person is just as sincere as I am.\n\n  I think that helps. But that is not the sole answer. The question \nthat Senator Mack poses is, How can we work together more? It is not a \nquestion easily answered. But I think it is very important for the \nfuture of the Senate and the future of our country, and I thank him for \nposing the question.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/20/senate-section/article/S18971-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18971-S18974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       DIRECTING THE SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL TO BRING A CIVIL ACTION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the resolution.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I rise on the subject that the Presiding \nOfficer knows more about than I do, because he has had to sit through \nall these Whitewater hearings. I have been designated by the Judiciary \nCommittee as a Democrat to sit on that hearing along with Senator Hatch \nbeing designated by the Republicans from the Judiciary Committee.\n  What do we do? I think whenever--it really is kind of related to what \nwe have just been talking about--whenever we can work things out \nwithout confrontation, I think we are better off in this body, and the \nNation is better off.\n  I really believe the White House has gone about as far as they can go \nwithout just giving up completely on this constitutional right that \npeople have in terms of the lawyer-client relationship.\n  I am also concerned about the amount of time that we are taking on \nthis question. I cast one of three votes against creating the \ncommittee. Senator Glenn, who is on the floor, cast one and Senator \nBingaman, who is on the floor, cast one. My feeling was, we were going \nto get preoccupied and spend a lot of time on something that really did \nnot merit that amount of time.\n  We have spent infinitely more time: 32 days of hearings, as the \nPresiding Officer knows better than I, on this; 152 individuals have \nbeen deposed; the White House has produced more than 15,000 pages of \ndocuments; and Williams & Connolly, the President's personal attorney, \nhas produced more than 28,000 pages of documents. We have spent a huge \namount of time.\n  We have spent much more time on Whitewater in hearings than we spent \non health care in hearings last year on an issue infinitely more \nimportant to the people of this country; much more time on Whitewater \nthan on hearings on drugs, for example. We may have had 2 or 3 days of \nhearings on drugs this year. I do not know. It certainly is not more \nthan that. We have had 1 day of hearings so far this year on Medicare.\n  I think when we spend huge amounts of time on this, we distort what \nhappens in our country. I read the excellent autobiography of the \nPresiding Officer, Senator D'Amato, and unlike a lot of autobiographies \nthat are obviously written by someone else, it is pure vintage Al \nD'Amato. But I know Al D'Amato, our distinguished colleague, represents \na State with a lot of poverty. We have spent infinitely more time on \nthis issue than we have spent on the issue of poverty in our country. \nMr. President, 24 percent of our children live in poverty. No other \nWestern industrialized nation has anything close to that.\n  I hope we use the telephone a little more frequently, get together a \nlittle more and see if we cannot work this thing out without \nconfrontation. I think everyone benefits.\n  Let me add one final thing. I am 67 years old now. I have been around \nlong enough to know that when we get into these things, we really do \nnot know the ultimate consequences. It is like throwing a boomerang: It \nmay hit here, it may hit there, it may hit somewhere else.\n  I hope this resolution is turned down and the alternative of Senator \nSarbanes is approved. But I am a political realist. I know that is not \nlikely to happen, because of the partisan kind of confrontation that \nhas occurred and is occurring in this body much too much. But I hope we \ntry, once this gets over, to pull our rhetoric down, and I think all of \nus benefit when that happens.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nIllinois for his eloquent and heartfelt remarks. He has the admiration \nof us all. He is going to be missed in this institution.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes with regard to \nthe issue at hand having to do with the subpoena and the President's \nclaim of privilege to resist that subpoena.\n  I have been called upon over the past several weeks and months on \nmany occasions, by members of the media, and others, to comment on the \nWhitewater investigation, to give my opinion. Others have, too, I am \nsure. In my case, I was minority counsel to the Watergate committee \nmany years ago. People want to draw those comparisons.\n  I refuse to make those comparisons. I do not think it is appropriate \nto make those comparisons. In fact, I have said as little as possible \nabout the whole matter. I left town as a much younger man, having spent \na year and a half investigating Watergate, and I had been on another \ncommittee assignment or two as counsel to the U.S. Senate. Some time \nago, I kind of became tired of investigating and, frankly, would like \nto spend more of my time in trying to build things up than in trying to \nappear to be trying to tear things down.\n  I think there is something important going on here that has to be \ncommented upon with regard to the issue at hand. It looks like perhaps \nsomething might be worked out with regard to this particular subpoena, \nwith regard to the particular notes that are being sought by this \nsubpoena, and I hope that is the case. But there is something more \nimportant that is happening here that is going to have ramifications, I \nam afraid, for the next several months in this body and in this \ncountry, and that is, we should not get so caught up in the fine print \nand lose sight of the fact that, once again, we have a President who is \nclaiming privilege to shield information from a committee of the U.S. \nSenate and ultimately from the American people, and it is a very, very \nweak claim at best. But even if it were a strong claim, Mr. President, \nit concerns me greatly that the President, under these circumstances, \nwith the history that we have in this country of congressional \n\n[[Page S18972]]\ninvestigations and the obvious need that the Congress has and \ncongressional committees have for information to get to the bottom of \nany perceived wrongdoing, that the President would choose to stand \nbehind a privilege to keep this information from coming out.\n  It cannot stand. It cannot be successful. I have watched the \npredicament that is unfolding in the Senate with increasing concern, \nthinking any day that it might be resolved, but by resisting this \nsubpoena and trying to keep this information from the public, I believe \nthe President is making a tragic mistake. His action will only serve to \nraise questions as to what is being hidden. It will keep this \ninvestigation alive much longer than it otherwise would. It will fuel \nthe cynicism of a public that is already all too distrustful of its \npublic institutions. And for what purpose?\n\n  The White House says that the President is taking this position in \norder to defend a principle, and that principle is the President's \nright to private conversations with his attorney. But nobody is \ndisputing that right. What is being disputed is the President's right \nto privileged conversations with lawyers who are Government officials \npaid by the taxpayers when the matters involved are personal in nature \nand do not have to do with the Presidency.\n  This assertion of the attorney-client privilege by ordinary citizens \nin the face of congressional subpoenas have been consistently struck \ndown by this Nation's courts. The privilege is designed, basically, for \nlitigation between private parties. In case after case, the courts have \nconcluded that allowing it to be used against Congress would be an \nimpediment to Congress' obligation and duty to get to the truth and \ncarry out its investigative and oversight responsibilities.\n  If the President is claiming special status because he is President, \nthen his assertion is really one of executive privilege and not \nattorney-client privilege. While I can still remember Sam Ervin's \nrepeated admonitions that no man is above the law and that we are \nentitled to every man's evidence, I still concede that executive \nprivilege can be a valid claim, under some circumstances. However, the \nPresident must assert it.\n  As I understand it to this point, he has chosen not to assert \nexecutive privilege. Of course, there may be political consequences \nassociated with the claim of executive privilege, but the President \ncannot have it both ways. He cannot assert attorney-client privilege as \na defense to a congressional subpoena which, if asserted by a private \ncitizen, would stand little chance of prevailing, and then try to place \nthe shroud of the Presidency around it without claiming Executive \nprivilege.\n  As best I can tell, Mr. President, no President in history has ever \nclaimed attorney-client privilege to defeat a congressional subpoena.\n  Richard Nixon did not claim attorney-client privilege. He allowed \nWhite House counsel, John Dean, to testify. Ronald Reagan did not claim \nattorney-client privilege during Iran-Contra. Notes and documents of \nhis White House counsel were produced, along with those of the lawyer \nfor the National Security Council, the lawyer for the Foreign \nIntelligence Advisory Board, and the lawyer for the Intelligence \nOversight Board. In both of these investigations, those documents were \nproduced without the claim of any sort of privilege.\n  President Nixon finally claimed Executive privilege with regard to \nthe White House tapes and, of course, ultimately saw his claim of \nprivilege defeated in the Supreme Court in the case of U.S. versus \nNixon. So if the President is going to assert greater privilege \nprotection than any of his predecessors, perhaps he is doing it solely \nfor the purpose of protecting a legal principle. But the President must \nunderstand that the people are going to assume that there may be other \nreasons, in light of this country's history.\n  So let us examine the strength of the President's legal position. In \nthe first place, an invocation of the attorney-client privilege is not \nbinding on Congress. It is well established that in exercising its \nconstitutional investigatory powers, Congress possesses discretionary \ncontrol over witnesses' claims of privilege. It is also undisputed that \nCongress can exercise its discretion completely without regard to the \napproach that courts might take with respect to that same claim.\n  In the 19th century, House committees refused to accede the claims of \nattorney-client privilege that developed from actions taken during the \nimpeachment trial of Andrew Johnson and in the investigation of the \nCredit Mobilier scandal. House committees in the 1980's also rejected \nclaims of attorney-client privilege. For example, in 1986, the House \nvoted 352 to 34 to deny the privilege claims of Ferdinand Marcos' \nattorneys.\n  The Senate, too, has rejected invocations of attorney-client \nprivilege on numerous occasions. In 1989, the Subcommittee on Nuclear \nRegulation rejected the privilege claim with respect to its \ninvestigation of restrictive agreements between nuclear employers and \nemployees who might impact safety.\n  The subcommittee's formal opinion rejecting the claim of privilege \nasserted:\n\n       We start with the jurisdictional proposition that this \n     Subcommittee possesses the authority to determine the \n     validity of any attorney-client privilege that is asserted \n     before the subcommittee. A committee's or subcommittee's \n     authority to review or compel testimony derives from the \n     constitutional authority of the Congress to conduct \n     investigations and take testimony as necessary to carry \n     out its legislative powers. As an independent branch of \n     government with such constitutional authority, the \n     Congress must necessarily have the independent authority \n     to determine the validity of non-constitutional \n     evidentiary privileges that are asserted before the \n     Congress.\n\n  Importantly, as the Congressional Research Service found, ``No court \nhas ever questioned the assertion of that prerogative * * *.'' Indeed, \na 1990 Federal court decision, In the Matter of Provident Life & \nAccident Co., found that whatever a court might hold concerning \napplication of a claim of attorney-client privilege in a court \nproceeding, ``is not of constitutional dimensions, [and] is certainly \nnot binding on the Congress of the United States.'' Instead, \ncommittees, upon assertion of the privilege, have made a determination \nbased on a ``weighing [of] the legislative need against any possible \ninjury.''\n  This longstanding history, Mr. President, of discretionary \ncongressional acceptance of the attorney-client privilege reflects the \nbasic differences between judicial and legislative spheres. The \nattorney-client privilege is not constitutionally based. It is a judge-\nmade doctrine based on policy considerations designed to foster a fair \nand effective adversary legal system. It theoretically promotes the \ninterest of an individual facing an adversary civil or criminal action.\n  But the U.S. Senate is not a court. We do not have the authority to \nmake final determinations of legal rights, or to adjudicate \nindividuals' liberty or property. In fact, it is probably \nunconstitutional under the separation of powers doctrine for us to be \nbound by judicially created common law rules of procedure. Under \nArticle I, section 5 of the Constitution, each House determines its own \nrules. And the rule of this body in connection with attorney-client \nprivilege claims is longstanding and consistent: We balance the \nlegislative need for the information against any possible injury. And, \nof course, a committee of this body has made that determination.\n  Does President Clinton want to rely on a technical, legal defense \nwhen the issue is whether his own White House has engaged in \nwrongdoing? The legislative need is obvious: to determine the truth of \nallegations of potential wrongdoing at the White House. Enforcing the \nsubpoena furthers that interest. The integrity of the investigatory \nprocess is at stake here. The President's only potential interests are \nthe free flow of information that is protected by Executive privilege, \nand the desire to shield what is potentially damaging information. To \nme, the balance is very clear: The subpoena must be complied with.\n\n  Even if we were to abandon our historic discretionary consideration \nof attorney-client privilege in favor of adopting judicial rules for \nits application, we would still reject the objections to the subpoena. \nCourts would not find the attorney-client privilege to apply on these \nfacts.\n  Courts do not view the attorney-client privilege as a fundamental \njudicial \n\n[[Page S18973]]\nprocedural requirement that is vital for fairness. The most prominent \nexpert on the law of privileges and evidence, Dean Wigmore, wrote of \nthe attorney-client privilege the following: ``[i]ts benefits are all \nindirect and speculative, its obstruction is plain and concrete * * *. \nIt is worth preserving for the sake of a general policy, but it is \nnonetheless an obstacle to the investigation of truth. It ought to be \nstrictly confined within the narrowest possible limits consistent with \nthe logic of its principle.'' The second, sixth, and seventh circuits \nhave all adhered to that approach. Although the submissions by the \nWhite House counsel's office and the Clintons' private attorneys read \nthe privilege very broadly, the courts construed it very narrowly.\n  Courts universally require the party asserting the existence of the \nattorney-client privilege to bear the burden of establishing its \nexistence. Blanket assertions of the privilege are rejected. The \nproponent must demonstrate conclusively that each element of the \nprivilege is satisfied. This means that specific facts establishing an \nattorney-client privilege must be revealed. Conclusory assertions are \nnot sufficient. And the proponent must also prove that the privilege \nhas not been expressly, or by implication, waived.\n  In this respect, it must be noted that courts have rejected the \nlinchpin of the President's argument supporting the existence of an \nattorney-client privilege here. He claims that if the information \nrequested by the subpoena were produced to the special committee, the \nprivilege would be waived as to other conversations in other \nproceedings. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nCircuit specifically has held to the contrary. In its 1979 decision \nMurphy versus Department of the Army, the court ruled that disclosure \nof allegedly privileged material to a congressional committee would not \nwaive the privilege in any future litigation. As CRS notes, ``There \nappears to be no case holding otherwise, and several which have \nfollowed Murphy.''\n  The President simply has not proven that the elements exist which are \nnecessary to satisfy the attorney-client privilege. For courts to \naccept the privilege, the attorney must be acting as an attorney for \nthe client and the communication at issue must be made for the purpose \nof securing legal services. That is not true here for two major \nreasons.\n\n  First, attendees at the critical November 5 meeting, including \nindividuals who were not acting as attorneys for President Clinton. \nBruce Lindsey is a lawyer, but he did not act as the President's lawyer \nin this meeting. Nowhere in either the White House or Clinton personal \nlawyer submissions is any claim made that Mr. Lindsey passed \ncommunications from either the President or Mrs. Clinton to any other \nlawyer. Nowhere in his testimony before the special committee did Mr. \nLindsey establish that he was present at this meeting as a lawyer for \nPresident Clinton or that he discussed confidential communications \nbetween himself and the Clintons.\n  Several of those present were Government lawyers, including Mr. \nKennedy, to whom the subpoena was directed, Mr. Nussbaum and Mr. \nLindsey. And a Government lawyer cannot establish a personal \nrepresentational relationship with the President about a private \nmatter. In prior administrations, when the President had private legal \nissues, a private attorney was hired because the Government attorney \ncould not raise the attorney-client privilege in the context of a \nGovernment investigation. That is the situation we have here. This was \nparticularly true where the facts that were the subject of a Government \ninvestigation relate to the President's personal, not official, acts. \nHere, of course, the acts are not only personal, but predate President \nClinton's assumption of the Office of the Presidency.\n  So the discussion, by the President's own admission, concerned \nlogistics, dividing responsibilities among different groups of lawyers, \nnot providing legal advice. Such communications simply fall outside the \nscope of the attorney-client privilege. In fact, they are no different \nthan any other communications among Presidential advisers. Their \ncharacter is not changed by the fact that some of the participants have \nlaw degrees. Hence, to the extent that official Government business was \ndiscussed at this meeting, the only theory preventing its disclosure \nwould be, again, executive privilege, which the President refused to \ninvoke.\n  Moreover, the communications at this meeting were made in the \npresence of persons who were not lawyers for President Clinton. Because \nthe attorney-client privilege inhibits discovering truth, the courts \nare quick to find that the privilege has been waived. Where attorneys \nvoluntarily disclose confidential client communications with a third \nparty, the privilege is destroyed. The communication is no longer \nconfidential and a justification for the privilege disappears. \nConfidentiality was lost for these communications because attorneys for \nthe President shared information with others who did not represent the \nPresident. Lawyers cannot serve two masters. Those who represent the \nGovernment as a client do not represent the President as a client.\n  For this reason, the President's claim of a joint defense privilege \nis not applicable. President Clinton raises this argument because he \nclaims that the conversation of November 5 involved two clients: The \nPresident in his official capacity, and the President in his personal \ncapacity. But these are not two different clients facing a common \nadversary. The President in his official capacity is represented by \nGovernment lawyers. A Government lawyer's client is the Government, and \nthat client's interest may be to enforce the laws against the President \nas an individual. That is a different interest than that represented by \nthe President's personal lawyers. Thus, these lawyers were potential \nadversaries, not lawyers sharing information for multiple clients \nagainst a common adversary.\n  Additionally, courts have adopted the crime-fraud exception to the \nattorney-client privilege. Courts will not apply the privilege to \ncommunications that may facility the commission of improper acts. The \nnotes that are the subject of the subpoena concern a meeting at which \ndiscussions may have been held about certain information that may have \nbeen improperly passed to private lawyers for purposes of preparing a \ndefense.\n  The work product privilege has also been raised, Mr. President, but \nit does not apply to this conversation, either. The attorney work \nproduct privilege is not constitutionally based and applies to Congress \nonly on a discretionary basis. Further, it is qualified. It is not \nabsolute. The sufficient showing of need will brush aside the work \nproduct privilege. The Clinton briefs quote broad generalities about \nthe privilege, but as the Supreme Court held in Hickman v. Taylor, ``We \ndo not mean to say that all [] materials obtained are prepared * * * \nwith an eye toward litigation are necessarily free from discovery in \nall cases.'' The materials at issue were not prepared in anticipation \nof litigation on behalf of President Clinton. Mr. Kennedy was a \nGovernment lawyer. His notes could not have been taken in anticipation \nof preparing litigation strategy for President and Mrs. Clinton. His \nclient was the Government, not the Clintons, therefore, work product \nprivilege is simply inoperative.\n\n  Even if this doctrine applied, it is readily overcome when production \nof material is important to the discovery of needed information. Some \ncourts have even refused to call the doctrine a privilege. In short, \nMr. President, President Clinton simply has not met the burden of \nshowing that either of these privileges apply to the notes that are the \nsubject of this subpoena. His legal position is unprecedented and \nextremely tenuous. Clearly, Congress does not have to honor such a \nposition.\n  I suggest to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that we do \nnot want to establish a precedent that says that future Presidents can \nuse White House counsel with regard to personal matters or even matters \nthat occurred before the President was elected and be shielded from \ncongressional inquiry.\n  With regard to the references to partisanship that we have read and \nheard so much about, now that the battle lines have seemingly been \ndrawn on this matter, we are told it will pretty much be a partisan \nvote. I find it somewhat ironic that over the past several years that \nmany of those who wanted to investigate seemingly everything that came \ndown the pike, now have \n\n[[Page S18974]]\ngotten to be sensitive about congressional overreaching and \npartisanship.\n  Unfortunately, it always just seems to depend on whose ox is being \ngored. You look back over the congressional investigations and you will \nsee that invariably there is some partisanship involved in it because \nthe majority party investigates the President of the other party and \nthe minority party cries ``politics'' and talks about how much money we \nare wasting and how much money we are spending. I remember those \nconversations back when some of these other investigations over the \nyears were started. The pattern seems to be the same.\n\n  So now we can all assume our natural and customary positions as \nRepublicans and Democrats, or we can actually look to the merits of the \ncase. I suggest that we do that. I think the American people would \nappreciate it. It would not be unprecedented.\n  The vote in the Senate to form the Watergate Committee, for example, \nwas a unanimous vote at a time when still most people thought that it \nwas, in fact, a third-rate burglary. When it came time to subpoena \nPresident Nixon's White House tapes, the vote on the Watergate \nCommittee was unanimous, including that of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Hawaii, Senator Inouye. When it came time to sue the President to \nenforce that subpoena, I signed the pleadings as counsel to the \ncommittee. All this was not because the proceedings were totally free \nof partisanship. It was because we believed the privilege was not being \nproperly asserted by the President. I respectfully suggest that the \nsame is true here.\n  I still have hope that the President will reconsider his position--\nnot over the question of a handful of notes--over the general \nproposition of whether at this particular time in our history we want \nto see another President claim a privilege to keep information from the \nAmerican people.\n  We are not writing on a blank slate here, Mr. President. Our country \nhas a history with regard to such matters and it has had an effect on \nus as a people. This day in time when a President who withholds \ninformation from the public has a higher duty and a higher burden than \never before. The people want the facts. They want the truth. The \nPresident, any President, should have a very good reason for denying \nit. The President in this case simply does not have one. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous consent agreement the \nSenator from Ohio is to be recognized.\n  The Chair, in my capacity as a Senator from the State of New York, \nasks unanimous consent that, thereafter, Senator Murkowski from Alaska \nbe recognized.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/20/senate-section/article/S18971-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18974-S18975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CONCERN FOR CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to speak very briefly about the \nremarks that Senator Byrd made on the floor. Mr. President, the subject \nthat Senator Byrd brought up today is something that has been bothering \nme in an increasing way all during this year. Perhaps it is because \nsome of the tensions are particularly high with regard to the \ndirections that the Government, the Congress, is trying to take us this \nyear. These concerns have bothered me as much as they have Senator Byrd \nand not just in the examples he mentioned earlier today but some \nothers, also.\n  I think it is time to reflect briefly on that and I will not take the \nSenate's time for very long, but I want to make a few remarks in \nsupport of his earlier statement.\n  Our Government is formed with the respect of the view of all parties. \nWe look back and our Constitution did not establish a benevolent \nmonarchy where one person makes the decisions for all of our country \nand moves us ahead or behind on the decisions of one person. We have \nsplit powers in Government. We have a legislative, executive and a \njudicial branch of Government. We have seen our system of \nconstitutional Government evolve into 435 House Members and 100 Members \nof the U.S. Senate. Mr. President, 535 people were sent here not to be \nof one mind or one kind of person or one view, but sent here expecting \nto bring our varied views from all over the country and work out the \nbest solution to what the future of this country may be.\n\n  Try as they may, no one person or one small group has all the wisdom \nso that they can confidently say we are right and you are wrong. That \nis not the way we are set up. And when it comes down to where we stoop \nto just name calling, which has happened on the floor, it tells more to \nme about the speaker than it does about the object the speaker happens \nto be belittling at the moment.\n  I think we maybe should remember something that too often is \nforgotten on the floor. That is, you cannot build yourself up by \ntearing someone else down. When someone uses belittling or semi-\ninsulting language to the President of the United States, does that \ndemean the President? No, it does not. It demeans the speaker. And it \nbrands the speaker as someone who is, perhaps, covering up an inability \nto deal with the matters at hand by attacking the other side in a \nbelittling way. The resort to invective and character assassination is \nnot constructive legislative discourse, as the voters expected. We have \nseen examples here on the floor in the last few months of signs being \nput up, ``Where is Bill? Where is Bill? Hey, where is Bill?'' Arms \nwaving, ``Where is Bill?'' Playing to the cameras and referring to the \nPresident as ``that guy,'' repeatedly.\n  We had, one evening here, over by the exit door over there on the \neast side of the floor, a number of House Members who had come over \nhere and were on the floor that day. Senator Byrd was making a short \nstatement, and they were milling around and actually laughing at \nSenator Byrd, laughing out loud at Senator Byrd on the Senate floor, \nsneering at him. When we called attention to them there, they kept \nright up, one person in particular.\n  What has happened? I do not think we would have seen that some years \nago. It is insulting, No. 1; insulting, not just to the President or \nnot insulting just to Senator Byrd; it is insulting to the Senate of \nthe United States of America. To me that is a new low. Is it any \nwonder, when we see our own Members behaving like that, any wonder why \npeople have their doubts about the Congress of the United States?\n  ``Politics,'' a great word, it stems from an old Greek word meaning \n``business of all the people.'' I cannot think of anything in a \ndemocracy, anything in this United States of America, that deserves \nmore respect and deserves more effort, nothing is more important than \nthat business of all the people.\n  We bemoan the lack of respect for Congress, while we need the \ngreatest faith between the people of this country and their elected \nofficials. We need the greatest faith, underline that, faith between \neach other here, if we are to accomplish what we are all about. We want \nto know that everyone here is working for the best long-term interests \nof the United States of America and not just trying to salve their own \negos at the moment by making belittling remarks about others here or \nabout the President.\n  If we had a scale here and faith was on one end, doubt would be over \nhere on the other. How do we move that scale toward faith? How do we \nrestore faith? Not by casting insulting remarks at other officials. You \nhave faith, you have confidence in our institutions, in our \nlegislative, executive and judicial branches--we must have faith in \nCongress. We must do the things that will engender faith and confidence \nin Congress. We must do the things that will engender faith and \nconfidence in the Presidency, whether Democrat or Republican, the \noffice of the Presidency of the United States, the chief executive \nofficer of our Nation. We must have faith and confidence in the Senate. \nWe must have faith and confidence in Senators. We must have faith and \nconfidence in each other if we are to accomplish our job.\n  As Senator Byrd said, to use deprecating language toward each other \nor toward the President moves toward doubt; it moves toward doubt and \ndissension, and not toward that kind of faith that we need if we are to \ndo our job. That just makes our problems even more intractable.\n  We are all proud of our mothers, of course. I am proud of my mother. \nShe has long since departed this world, but she used to have a lot of \nlittle homilies and a lot of little sayings. I still remember some of \nthem today.\n  When we, as kids, were being too critical of someone I remember my \n\n[[Page S18975]]\n  mother saying this one, ``There is so much bad in the best of us, and \nso much good in the worst of us, it ill-behooves any of us to speak \nbadly about the rest of us.''\n  Maybe here on the Senate floor, when we get a little carried away \nsometimes back and forth, it gets very personal--as it has gotten too \npersonal recently. Maybe we need to remember that. Here, where the \nbusiness of all the people, the melding of ideas is supposed to take \nplace, where the business of all the people is taking place on this \nfloor, our conduct has to contribute to that, not detract from it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/20/senate-section/article/S18974-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18975-S18983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       DIRECTING THE SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL TO BRING A CIVIL ACTION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the resolution.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this is a difficult issue for all \nMembers of this body relative to the business at hand and the necessity \nof proceeding with the subpoena. I suggest that probably not since the \ndays of the Watergate constitutional confrontation has this body \nconsidered an action that is as serious as the one that we are \nconsidering here today.\n  It is the feeling of this Senator from Alaska that this day did not \nhave to come, but it is here. The subpoena was not something that was \ninevitable. But we are here today for one reason and only one reason, \nand that is because we have a situation where our President refuses to \ncooperate with this Senate investigation and turn over the notes that \ncould be very crucial to the public's understanding of the Whitewater \nscandal.\n  The President and the administration seem to be hiding behind the \nshield of attorney-client privilege. At the same time, one can see \nthrough the raising of the specter of executive privilege. You cannot \nhave it both ways. It is one or the other.\n  The White House claims that it will turn over these notes on one \nhand, and then lays down conditions, conditions that are so totally \nunreasonable that what the President is really saying is that he will \nnot turn over the notes in the sense of full disclosure.\n  It is interesting, because from the day these hearings began, in July \nof 1994, my colleague from New York, Senator D'Amato, and I made \nseveral appeals on this floor concerning various issues, the statute of \nlimitations and others, relative to questions that had been raised to \nwhich were not forthcoming responsible answers. So, back in July of \n1994, the White House, at that time, professed the President's desire \nto cooperate, cooperate with the formation of the special committee of \nwhich I am a member. The President said that he, too, was interested in \ngetting the facts--all the facts out on Whitewater.\n  At nearly every turn of the committee's deliberations the White House \nhas tried to make these deliberations more difficult, more prolonged, \nrefuses to answer more questions, and seems to have a shorter memory. \nWhat this committee is charged with doing, under the able leadership of \nSenator D'Amato, is to hold the President to his promise to cooperate \nwith this committee. One has to ask if the administration has an \nulterior motive, or other reason, for not cooperating? At all times it \nseems what the President professes is not necessarily what the \nPresident ultimately means. I do not have to go into the issue of \nbalancing the budget with OMB's figures or CBO figures--that's an \nargument for another time. But I think the American public is now aware \nthat what the President professes is not necessarily what the President \nmeans.\n  We see this pattern repeated again and again and again. That is part \nof the problem here today, Mr. President. The American public has seen \nthis pattern over and over, and the concern now is that the President's \ntactics have almost conditioned the public for a norm. The public has \ncome to expect this from the administration as a consequence because of \nthis repeated inconsistency, and has become used to it. That is very \ndangerous. At times it seems that, because of the President's track \nrecord, the public's expectations and standards for the President are \nlower.\n  I think we agree that we have an obligation to hold the President \naccountable. The President must be held to his promises. Today, we must \nhold the President accountable by preventing him and his administration \nfrom withholding information from the American public, information that \nthe public is entitled to know. We have to put an end to the stalling \nand to the delay tactics that have become so familiar to the Special \nWhitewater Committee. Even the media is beginning to pick up on it. You \ncan hardly find a newspaper article today where the term \n``stonewalling'' and ``the President'' do not appear in tandem.\n  These delay tactics that this committee has endured, which I know \nmany of my colleagues have elaborated at great length on today, can \nonly lead to one conclusion: The administration has led a deliberate \nand systematic effort to cover up. And cover up what? What is there to \nhide? Why is the administration fighting us and being so reluctant to \nturn this information over?\n  I want to bottom line the seriousness of the vote that we are going \nto be taking at some point in time. Chairman D'Amato outlined what our \ninvestigation is all about. The investigation of Madison Guaranty and \nWhitewater have led to felony convictions and resignations. Think about \nthat. That is pretty serious, Mr. President. The investigation so far \nhas led to felony convictions and resignations, and there are those \nthat just pooh-pooh this matter and simply say, well, we have not \nreally learned anything. We have some convictions. We have some \nresignations.\n  The McDougals, the owners of Madison Guaranty, were involved in \nnumerous improper loans and land deals which led to the loss of tens of \nmillions of taxpayer dollars. Witnesses testified before the committee \nthat the Whitewater Corp., which is half owned by the Clintons and half \nowned by the McDougals, had improperly ``kited'' funds.\n  That is serious, Mr. President. That is very serious. I spent 25 \nyears in the banking business as the chief executive officer of a \nstatewide organization. I know what cease and desist orders mean \nrelative to mandates by the controller of currency, the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation.\n  What was going on in Madison Guaranty was clearly illegal. There is a \nstory that has yet to be told relative to the obligations of the \nvarious agencies that examined that financial institution. I am \nconvinced that those examiners were doing a conscientious job relative \nto the reporting of the true condition of that organization, and they \nwere reporting up to their level. And for reasons that have yet to be \nmade clear to the committee and made public, no action was taken by the \nadministrators associated with the insurance of the depositors with \nMadison Guaranty.\n  So, clearly, there were pressures brought to bear on the top \nregulators by political influences that surrounded Madison Guaranty not \nto take action relative to the illegal activities that were associated \nwith Madison Guaranty, whether it be the kiting of the checks or the \nmanner in which clearly Madison Guaranty, under the McDougals, was \nbeing operated almost for the benefit of a few selected individuals who \nwere receiving favorable loans at favorable interest rates. The loans \nwere rewritten to bring the due dates current. The interest was simply \nadded to the principal to bring those loans current.\n  These are all flagrant violations that suggest, if you will, not just \ninappropriate or improper handling, but an illegal activity of a very, \nvery serious nature subject to formal charges by the banking \nauthorities and the regulators. But we did not see that, Mr. President. \nThat did not occur as the true condition of Madison Guaranty become \nknown to the regulators.\n  I think that there is a story yet to be told. I hope that we find \nthose that are willing to come forth and explain to the committee why \nappropriate action was not taken when indeed Madison Guaranty was \nrunning amuck, running almost as a personal extension of the McDougals \nand some of their friends. \n\n[[Page S18976]]\n\n  We have been attempting to get information in the committee. The \ncommittee has been hindered from obtaining information because of \nnumerous delays, stonewalling tactics. One of the things that is very, \nvery hard for this Senator to accept is the convenient loss of memory.\n  Susan Thomases, the First Lady's friend and adviser, responded, ``I \ndo not remember'' over 70 times to even the most basic questions asked \nby this committee. These were not everyday events; these were \nsignificant events from very, very bright people who were associated \nwith a responsibility to perform. And to suggest that they cannot \nremember, over 70 times in testimony, significant events is pretty hard \nto accept by the committee.\n  Maggie Williams, the First Lady's chief of staff, a very, very \nbright, articulate person, told the committee over 140 times that she \ndid not recall. Once in a while, OK. I cannot recall every specific \nevent that happened last year, but in regard to important matters, I \ncan tell you what happened last year. And I can tell that certain \nevents stand out in one's memory, Mr. President. For example, I have \nbeen deposed by attorneys relative to business activities of the \norganizations that I have run, and those proceedings, those types of \nproceedings, do stand out in your memory. It may be very convenient to \nsay I do not recall, but to do it 140 times to the committee in \nresponse to some very, very basic questions about some dramatic events, \nevents that some of the witnesses themselves documented, is simply \npretty hard to accept.\n  During the week of the committee's investigation we learned now of \nthe possibility of more cover up in the White House, and we have \ndiscovered that files are missing.\n  Mrs. Clinton's law firm represented Madison Guaranty against the \nState and Federal investigations that were occurring. Mrs. Clinton \nprofessed that she did ``very minimal work'' on the Madison Guaranty \ncase. On Monday, the committee learned that the First Lady's statement \nmay need to be questioned.\n  The personal notes of the close friend and adviser to the First Lady, \nSusan Thomases, were disclosed in the committee and revealed the \nfollowing:\n  One, that Mrs. Clinton actually had numerous conferences, which have \nbeen documented, with the Madison Guaranty officials.\n  Two, that Mrs. Clinton made several efforts to keep the failing \nthrift afloat. Obviously, that was her job as counsel representing the \nRose law firm. There is nothing wrong with that. But the fact is, we \nare not able to get the documentation to just how far those efforts \nwent.\n  And lastly, that Mrs. Clinton was solely responsible for all the law \nfirm's bills for the Madison case. The accuracy of that should be able \nto be ascertained relatively easily by documentation, but we do not \nhave the documentation.\n  Earlier this month, Webster Hubbell, former Assistant Attorney \nGeneral and former Rose law firm partner, who is now serving 21 months \nin Federal prison, also testified that Mrs. Clinton did little work on \nthe Madison Guaranty case. However, the committee was able to produce \nbilling records showing that Mrs. Clinton billed the Madison account \nfor more than $6,000.\n  Again, I would remind my colleagues that the suggestion that this \nmatter is not really very important, that nothing has been proven, \nWebster Hubbell would contend otherwise. He is serving 21 months in \nFederal prison relative to his role. And again, he was former Attorney \nGeneral and former Rose law firm partner.\n\n  What is all this concern about? Why should the committee or the \nSenate or especially the American people be concerned about Madison \nGuaranty and Whitewater? Because, Mr. President, when Madison Guaranty \nultimately failed, the American taxpayer picked up the cost, which was \nsomewhere between $47 million and $60 million. The scam that went on at \nMadison was underwritten by the U.S. taxpayers.\n  We know that Mrs. Clinton had involvement to some extent through the \nRose law firm in some of the activities of Madison. And I am not \nsuggesting that those were inappropriate. Why can we not find out? Why \ndo they not tell us? What are they hiding? As I said earlier, Mrs. \nClinton billed over $6,000 to the Madison Guaranty account. According \nto the Rose law firm's accounting records, Mrs. Clinton did perhaps \nmore work on Madison than anyone at her firm except one junior \nassociate. Now everything that the committee learned may be just the \ntip of the iceberg because the Rose law firm claims that its billing \nfiles that recorded Madison activity from 1983 to 1986 are missing.\n  Let me repeat that, Mr. President. The Rose law firm now claims that \nits billing files that recorded Madison activity from 1983 to 1986 are \nmissing. Well, it sounds more like ``I don't remember'' 70 times or ``I \ndon't recall'' 140 times. And here is a sophisticated law firm with a \nlong, long tenure, a respected law firm. There are a number of lawyers \nin this body, and I think they are all familiar with the meticulous \nprocess of billing. We always joke about the lawyer: Start talking to \nthe lawyer and the clock starts. If you have ever received a billing \nfrom a lawyer, you have some idea how meticulous they are. They do not \nforget very much. They are trained to do that. The young attorneys bill \nout so much an hour, and they are expected to bill out so much a day. I \nhave a daughter who occasionally reminds me of that as a young lawyer. \nBut nevertheless to suggest that these are now missing from 1983 to \n1986 is incredible.\n  I am reminded here of a reference that was made in the New York Post \ntoday. And this may or may not be pertinent, but it is certainly \nsuggestive. It says, ``A Rose law firm clerk said he was told to shred \ndocuments in February of 1994 shortly after a Whitewater special \nprosecutor was appointed.''\n  As a consequence, Mr. President, the files contain information of \njust how involved perhaps the First Lady might be in the Madison \nGuaranty issue. The files could provide the committee with details of \nwho contacted whom and what was discussed about Madison. It is rather \ncurious to me that we do not have information from the RTC, Resolution \nTrust Corporation, which took over from the organization when it \neventually failed. Upon such a takeover, there is inevitably a series \nof events that must occur. Madison was taken over by an organization, \nand then that organization failed and the RTC must have ultimately \ntaken control over all the Madison records.\n  Now, those records should contain billing statements that were sent \nfrom the Rose law firm to Madison Guaranty. They might not be as \nspecific as the Rose law firm's own records that would document \nspecific topics and the details of the legal representation, however, \nthe RTC records might be able to shed some light on the amount that the \nfirm billed, the amount of time spent on the case, and may reference \ncertain specific subject matters. I suggest that this might be an \navenue that the committee investigates. It would seem to me it would be \nappropriate to make a determination whether or not the RTC has those \nrecords from Madison Guaranty and, if not, then attempt to determine \nwhat happened to the records. I think this could shed some light on \ndetermining how much the Rose law firm was reimbursed for its \nrepresentation of Madison Guaranty.\n  Now, Susan Thomases' own notes appear to contradict the sworn \ntestimony of Mrs. Clinton in an affidavit of 1994 in which she said \nthat she had little or no involvement in Madison.\n  Let us find out. Come on up with the evidence. Come up with the \nrecords. Yet, when we attempt to get the evidence, the Rose law firm \nsays their records are missing from 1983 to 1986. Were those shredded? \nThe Rose law firm, I think, owes the committee an explanation. \nThomases' notes show that Mrs. Clinton had numerous conversations with \nMr. McDougal, the Madison Guaranty's President, about a preferred stock \nplan and brokerage deals that the thrift was proposing to State \nregulators to keep Madison in business.\n  The only way to find out the extent that Mrs. Clinton was involved is \nto review the law firm's records. But as I have said before, these \nfiles seem to have mysteriously vanished. Apparently the files were \nremoved--perhaps by Webster Hubbell. We believe that the files may have \nbeen stored in his garage for a period of time. No one \n\n[[Page S18977]]\nseems to have any accurate knowledge of where the files are now. So to \nsuggest that there is nothing here that bears examination, that there \nis nothing here that should not be brought before the public, I think, \nis an injustice to the committee members and those who have worked so \nhard to bring the facts forward.\n  I am personally, as a member of the committee, tired of the \nwithholding tactics. I am tired of the stonewalling, tired of the \nexcuses, ``I don't recall,'' ``I can't remember.'' I think we are at a \ncrucial point now, a point in which this body can and should make the \nWhite House accountable. The committee's request for William Kennedy's \nnotes is not unreasonable, Mr. President. The meeting that occurred \nbetween the President's private attorneys and the Government attorneys \ngoes to the very heart of our investigation, an investigation to \ndetermine whether the White House misused official information. So I \nregret that the events have come to this extent today, to the vote that \nwe are going to be taking at some time. However, it is the White House \nthat forces the hand of this body to act. And I would again encourage \nthe President to reconsider and come forthwith the information that has \nbeen asked by the committee and keep his promise to fully disclose \ninformation. I believe that the American public has a right to know. \nAnd it is certainly responsible for this committee to make such a \nrequest and initiate such action if that material is not forthcoming.\n  Mr. President, I ask for only one other item to be included in the \nRecord, and that is a recap of the fees from Madison Guaranty Savings & \nLoan. And it is January, 1985. It identifies specific billings. It does \nnot have a total on it for services rendered, but that can be \nascertained by anyone looking at it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     RECAP OF FEES FROM MADISON GUARANTY SAVING & LOAN--FINAL RECAP     \n1983: None                                                              \n1984: None                                                              \n1985: January--None                                                     \nFeb./Mar./April/1985: None                                              \nMay 1985:                                                               \n  Baledge...........................

I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I also commend our \ndistinguished chairman of the Banking Committee, of the special \nWhitewater committee, for the good work that he has done.\n  Mr. President, we are here today because the Senate special \nWhitewater committee has finally reached the point where we have to say \nenough is enough. In our efforts over the past year to take testimony, \ngather documents, collect phone records, review handwritten notes, we \nfound that, rather than cooperation and responsiveness, we have been \nmet with a pattern of delay, obstruction and obfuscation.\n  After spending months trying to get access to various documents and \nphone records the old-fashioned way--we requested them--we discovered \nthat a wide variety of records were being withheld. So we were forced \nto threaten to issue subpoenas.\n  This started a trickle of information. Usually the information \narrived either late the evening before or the morning of the hearing.\n  But then we realized we were not receiving the documents to which the \ncommittee was entitled, so the chairman moved to actually issue \nsubpoenas for anything and everything. In fact, after subpoenas were \nissued, surprise, surprise, documents and phone records began coming \nin, records that previously could not be found or could not be \naccessed.\n  On top of the resistance to releasing documents and the long delays \nin releasing phone records, we have also had some amazing instances of \nnot only lapse of memory, but in one instance a witness, April Breslaw, \nsaid she was not able to identify her own voice on tape. To anybody who \nhas not done so, if you want to witness a truly amazing discussion, you \nshould read the transcript where Chairman D'Amato asked Ms. Breslaw if \nshe was the one that was actually on the tape. Ms. Breslaw said that \nthe quality of the tape was not great, she was not sure that she was \nthe one on the tape, and she did not know what to think.\n  Mr. President, we have seen some truly remarkable things. Months ago \nwe had a witness who claimed that he lied to his diary, another witness \nwho cannot remember his own notes.\n  But the strategy, I think, of obfuscation and obstruction has been \ntaken to an art form in the testimony of Susan Thomases, the First \nLady's close friend and associate. Over and over we heard Mrs. Thomases \ntell the committee that she ``did not recall,'' had ``no specific \nrecollection,'' she had ``no personal knowledge'' of various events and \nphone calls surrounding the search of Vince Foster's office, the \nremoval of documents from his office, the transfer of documents to a \ncloset in the White House residence, and the discovery of the so-called \nsuicide note.\n\n  Yet, after much digging and digging and a dribble and drabble, and a \nbit here and a bit there, phone records, we found that in fact she was \nomnipresent on the telephone lines of the White House during the \ncritical times in question and she was calling the people who were \ndirectly involved. But obviously a minor matter like that a potential \nmajor investigation of the suicide of a White House aide, she could not \nremember what actually went on.\n  I believe today's Washington Post noted--or yesterday's Washington \nPost noted--that ``Thomases failed to recall virtually all the events \nRepublicans question her about, and for the first time since this round \nof hearings began in August, Democrats dropped their defense of an \nadministration witness. . .''\n  Mr. President, that is what we have been facing throughout this \ninvestigation--fact by fact, record by record, note by note, and \ndocument by document, we have been dragging the truth out of the \nadministration and its associates, little by little.\n  If anybody had any question as to whether there may be something to \nhide, if you simply look at the pattern of delay, and refusal and \ndragging of \n\n[[Page S18978]]\nfeet, it should become obvious that there is a concerted effort by the \nWhite House not to give all the information they have. Everyone should \nunderstand this has been the underlying current of Whitewater since the \nbeginning.\n  The initial stories of this administration at nearly every step of \nthe way have proven to be incomplete, inaccurate, or just plain untrue. \nIt is only after pressure from Congress and the media that the truth, \nslowly, slowly, slowly trickles out. And we do not have it all yet.\n  We come to the infamous Kennedy notes. This time they cannot claim \nthat they do not remember or cannot recall. They cannot say the records \ncannot be found by the phone company. They cannot claim they are not \nsure if it is their voice on the tape. They cannot claim they cannot \nfind the files or the billing records are missing.\n  So what is left? They now claim that the notes made by a White House \ncounsel, an official of the Government, of a meeting to discuss the \nWhitewater, Madison financial and legal activities, where there is \nsignificant allegations of wrongdoing which involve violations of \nGovernmental laws and which involve the exposure of the Federal \ninsurance trust funds, taxpayer trust funds, to private claims, they \nsay meetings between a Government official, a White House counsel and a \nprivate attorney should not be released because they would violate the \nattorney-client privilege.\n\n  The President has said he is standing on principle to defend his \nrights as a private citizen to have meetings with his lawyers. Well, \nthere is no question the President has a right to have a private \nmeeting with his private counsel. But if you read the Op-Ed article in \ntoday's Wall Street Journal by Joseph diGenova, he goes through \ninstance after instance of congressional investigation where the \nvarious privileges were held by the other party when they were in power \nand in charge of the investigation not to be applicable to \ncongressional investigations.\n  Let us take a moment to talk about the principle which the President \nis defending. We have to remember that during 1993, the investigative \nwheels were in motion in three different Federal agencies, all pointing \na finger at some activities that involved the top political elite, the \npolitical infrastructure of Arkansas.\n  The RTC, the agency investigating the S failures, was looking into \nthe activities of Madison Guaranty, specifically in the \nmisappropriation of a $260,000 loan by now-Arkansas Governor Jim Guy \nTucker, the embezzlement and conspiracy by bank owner Jim McDougal, and \na loan illegally diverted to the Clinton 1984 reelection campaign. The \nSmall Business Administration was working putting together a criminal \ncase against David Hale and Capital Management Services.\n  In this case we find Mr. Hale accusing the President of pressuring \nhim to make an illegal loan to Jim McDougal, which eventually leads to \nMr. Hale's conviction and the indictment of the current Governor of \nArkansas. The Little Rock U.S. attorneys' office was in possession of \nan earlier criminal referral on Madison Guaranty in which massive check \nkiting was alleged.\n  Mr. President, while all the investigative work was going on, \npolitical appointees of the President at the Department of the Treasury \nwere briefed in late September 1993 about the contents of the RTC's \ncriminal referrals I just briefly described.\n  Unfortunately, instead of holding this information close, handling it \nas responsible governmental officials should handle the very sensitive, \nnonpublic information relating to a potential criminal investigation \nand/or action to be pursued by the Federal Government, the political \nappointees, Jean Hanson and Roger Altman, made the decision to tell the \nWhite House about the investigations. Then on September 29, 1993, Jean \nHanson briefed then-White House counsel Bernie Nussbaum.\n\n  One of the key facts which we discovered during our earlier hearings \nwas that while Mrs. Hanson clearly had the details of the referrals and \ndiscussed them with the White House, she had been told by the RTC, \nspecifically Mr. Roelle, that while the Clintons were not targets of \nthe investigation, ``* * * the language of that referral could lead to \nthe conclusion that if additional work were done [that is, further \ninvestigative work] the President and Mrs. Clinton might possibly be \nmore than just witnesses.''\n  That, Mr. President, is from the deposition of Jean Hanson, given to \nthe inspector general of the RTC.\n  And, of course, in October 1993, the possibility of further \ninvestigative work being done by the U.S. Attorney for the FBI was not \na closed question. As we now know, the U.S. attorney in Little Rock, \nPaula Casey, is a Clinton appointee and while she declined to do any \nfurther investigative work on the first referral, had just received the \nsecond and had not at that time recused herself.\n  Which brings us to the November 5, 1993 meeting between the Clintons' \nattorneys. Again, as we now know--and it has taken us a long time to \nget all of these details, even to find out about the November 5 \nmeeting--when several Federal agencies were investigating the \nactivities of Jim McDougal, Jim Guy Tucker and David Hale, the \ninvestigators have indicated that if more investigation was done, it is \npossible that the Clintons would become more than just witnesses.\n  Mr. President, we ought to add here, also from what we have now \nlearned, it is or should be an open question as to whether there is any \ncomplicity of the lawyers who were representing the participants in the \nshady transactions which resulted in losses to Federal insurance funds. \nAs a general proposition, an attorney friend of mine who has worked on \na number of these cases says that where there is wrongdoing of a \nconsistent pattern by a federally insured institution, usually the law \nfirm knows about it or may possibly be involved in it. There is a real \nquestion as to what involvement a law firm representing an illegal \nscam-ridden operation has in the criminal activity.\n  In this instance, obviously, Jim McDougal used Madison Guaranty, the \nsavings and loan, as his piggy bank and did many things with it. At the \ntime he was doing that, the Rose law firm was representing Madison \nGuaranty, and the partner in charge was Mrs. Clinton.\n  My colleague from Alaska has raised the question about what happened \nto the files. Mr. President, that is a very important matter to \nconsider, because I have worked in law firms, and you cannot walk in \nand take the files out of a law firm. You cannot go in and clean out \nthe files. How did the original files from the Rose law firm wind up in \nthe hands of political allies of the Clintons here in Washington? It \nwould seem to me that when the RTC took over Madison Guaranty, they \nbecame the client and had the right to the files at the law firm \nrepresenting the taken-over institution. Did they give their approval \nto removing those files? That is a question that bears further \ninvestigation.\n  But let us go back to the specific instance of November 5. According \nto David Kendall's memo which he sent to the committee, he said that we \ncan assume, just for the purposes of this discussion, that every bit of \ninformation possessed by the participants was discussed at the meeting. \nHe said, ``Go ahead and assume it, as you make this decision.'' He did \nnot say it conclusively. We don't have the notes. But that means for \nthe purposes of this question of whether we ought to compel the \nproduction of the notes, we can assume that not only was the Clintons' \nprivate lawyer told about the details of the case by Mr. Nussbaum and \nMr. Eggleston, he could also have been told that ``if further \ninvestigative work'' were done his client's status could possibly shift \nfrom witness to something else, to something more serious.\n  This is a question that has bothered me throughout the investigation \nof what went on at Whitewater.\n  Mr. President, I had a not-too-pleasant discussion with Mr. Nussbaum \nthe first time he came before the committee because I did not feel he \nwas representing the people of the United States as White House counsel \nshould. I asked him if he had taken the time to advise and instruct the \nother people in the White House who had come in possession of this \nvital nonpublic information that could be used, if it were to get into \nthe hands of those who were potential targets of the investigation, to \nprepare their defense, perhaps even to change or get rid of evidence to \nprepare themselves to prevent prosecution or active pursuit by the \nGovernment of its rights. \n\n[[Page S18979]]\n\n  Mr. Nussbaum told me that it was totally, totally unrealistic. He \nsaid: These people--I don't have to tell them that you shouldn't misuse \ninside information or nonpublic information you're getting--these \npeople knew their responsibilities, knew their roles. I didn't have to \ngo around telling these people not to do that and, indeed, Senator, \nwith all respect--I realize you feel strongly about this, too--with all \nrespect, Senator, there is not a single shred of evidence that anybody \nmisused this information in any way. Not a single shred of evidence \nthat documents were destroyed, people tipped off.\n  Mr. President, obviously, when he said there is not a shred of \nevidence, I pointed out to him that was precisely what we were \nconcerned about. We were concerned about the reports of the former \nnonlawyer, nonlegal intern, runner or clerk in the Rose law firm who \ntalked about shredding documents. That is why we are concerned about \nthe broader picture.\n  But let me return to the President's statement that he was \nwithholding the notes of the meeting on principle. Is he saying he \nbelieves it is his right for Government attorneys, who by virtue of \ntheir position, come into possession of confidential information, in \nthis case information about an investigation into the Clintons' \nbusiness partner in Whitewater development, an investigation about Mrs. \nClinton's client, the law firm, the Rose law firm, about his Arkansas \npolitical allies and about his own 1984 campaign, to have this \ninformation transferred to his own attorney when it may directly \ninvolve himself, his wife, their legal liabilities and the legal \nliabilities of their political allies?\n  Is he saying, as a President he has the right to know of these \ninvestigations into his associates and political allies, as well as his \nown campaign. Is he saying he has the right to know that if further \nwork was done, he might become more than just a witness?\n  Does the President seriously want to defend the principles that he \nshould not only receive tipoffs, but he should also have the right to \nget the information to his private attorneys in order to prepare his \nand his wife's defense if needed?\n  What other individual in America could get this special treatment? \nWho else would dare claim that meetings in which tipoffs of \nconfidential information about an investigation into a business \npartner, political ally, to his own campaign, to his wife's law \npractice should be protected from investigation? I hope that he was not \nserious if this is the principle he wishes to defend.\n  I think there are principles the President should be standing up for. \nNo. 1, breach of the public trust is as serious an offense as \ncommitting a crime. No. 2, in exchange for the powers and \nresponsibilities given the Government, the people expect fairness, \nevenhanded justice, impartiality, and they hold the basic belief that \nthose in power can be trusted to be good stewards of their power. No. \n3, They do not expect those in power to give themselves special \ntreatment, tipoffs or the ability to hide documents.\n  Congress must also believe that those in high positions of \nresponsibility are telling us the truth. When we ask questions or make \ninquiries, we trust the administration will tell the truth, will be \nhonest, and when we get an answer, it is a full and complete one.\n  Unfortunately, throughout this Whitewater investigation, beginning \nwith questions we asked in the Banking Committee in February of 1994, \nit appears that a guiding principle for some has been that the ends \njustify the means. The ends, as outlined in the memo from my good \nfriend James Hamilton to the President, was you should not provide \nanything; make sure you do not give them too much information; keep \nyour head down; do not let anything out.\n  I am afraid that this tone is apparently set from the top; that \nsomehow that the public's best interest is served if the private \ninterests of the President and First Lady are served, whether that be \ntheir political interest, the interest of the Presidency or even their \ncommercial activities prior to the time they became the President and \nFirst Lady.\n  As I have said many times before, this ethical blurry, coupled with a \nset of standards that seem to imply if you are not indicted, you are \nfit to serve, has caused several administration officials to resign and \ncontinues to hound this administration still today.\n  To my colleagues in the Senate, I urge that we move forward with the \nsubpoena. We need to get the full details of what was given to the \nprivate attorneys by the Government attorneys and what I think may have \nbeen a gross violation of public trust, if not more.\n  I commend the chairman for his dogged pursuit, his evenhanded manner \nin affording all sides an opportunity to be heard, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the committee on this request.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, earlier this year, I joined an almost \nunanimous Senate in voting to support a broad resolution creating a \nspecial committee to investigate the Whitewater matter. I believe this \ninvestigation must be both vigorous and fair.\n  First and foremost, it is our responsibility to find the facts and \nthe truth. That is what people want. But, as we look for the truth, we \nmust do everything possible to be fair and to respect the rights of \neveryone involved.\n  So I believe there are two fundamental questions that must be \nanswered in deciding whether to seek this subpoena:\n  First, is the subject matter of this subpoena necessary to find the \ntruth in the Whitewater matter?\n  And, second, is this subpoena being sought with respect for the \nfundamental rights of those involved? Or is it being sought in order to \ncarry on a political fishing expedition?\n  The material sought by the special committee are the notes of Mr. \nWilliam Kennedy from a meeting of the President's personal and official \nlawyers at a private law office on November 5, 1993. It is important to \nnote that Mr. Kennedy, although an Associate White House Counsel at the \ntime this meeting took place, had represented President Clinton before \nhe was elected to the White House.\n  The special committee has determined that Mr. Kennedy's notes of this \nmeeting are a necessary part of their investigation; they are necessary \nto help get at the truth. I respect that. I believe Mr. Kennedy's notes \nshould be made available to the special committee and to Mr. Kenneth \nStarr, the Independent Counsel investigating Whitewater. And I am \npleased that the President has consented to the release of these notes.\n  That should be the end of the story. This issue should be resolved. \nMr. Kennedy's notes should be released without anybody having to go to \ncourt. That seems to be enough to satisfy the Independent Counsel, Mr. \nStarr, a Republican. That is enough to satisfy the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, Senator D'Amato, also a Republican. But it \ndoes not seem to be enough to satisfy Speaker Gingrich and the \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives.\n  They appear to want more than Mr. Kennedy's notes. They also appear \nto want the President to surrender one of his fundamental rights, the \nright of attorney-client privilege. Whether a Republican or a Democrat \noccupies the White House, that President should enjoy the same rights \nas any other American. And that includes the right to communicate in \nconfidence with his attorney, doctor, or minister.\n  This is not, as some have said today, a question of hiding the facts. \nInstead, it is a question of protecting a fundamental right--the \nfundamental right to talk candidly with your lawyer, your doctor, or \nyour minister without having your words used against you. I do not care \nif we are talking about the President of the United States or the most \naverage of Americans, that is one of the things--one of the values, one \nof the liberties--that make this country special.\n  To me, it is that simple. If the President is willing to authorize \nthe release of Mr. Kennedy's notes--as he is--there is no reason to go \nto court. There is no reason to challenge the President's right to \nmaintain the confidentiality of his communication with his legal \ncounsel.\n  For these reasons, I will oppose the resolution before us today.\n  Mr. President, it is with great pride that I note an act of kindness \nand selflessness by Ashley Silvernell from Forsyth, MT. \n\n[[Page S18980]]\n\n  Ashley was walking down the street a few days ago when she spotted a \n$100 bill in front of Eagle Hardware store. Now, $100 means a lot to \nanybody, but to someone in middle school it's a pot of gold. Without \nhesitation, however, Ashley turned the $100 in to the store manager, \nKen Allison. Ashley asked for no reward.\n  It turns out that just a few days earlier, a family from Wyoming was \nshopping in the store that day and accidentally dropped the money. They \ndidn't have credit cards. The family later called Mr. Allison from \nWyoming, but never dreamed that the money would be found. When Ashley \nturned the $100 bill in, as you can imagine the family was thrilled.\n  Ashley's act should recall for this U.S. Senate what the holidays are \nall about. As we are knotted here in gridlock, 5 days before Christmas, \nwe must remember that honesty and good judgment are qualities to strive \nfor everyday of our lives. Ashley's good will is an inspiration to us \nall and must not go unnoticed.\n  And on behalf of myself and the thousands of Montanans who certainly \nwill be inspired by her story, I would like to thank Ashley Silvernell \nfor making a difference.\n  Thank you. And I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate Resolution \n199. I would like to focus on this from a slightly different \nperspective from those that have been suggested so far. In particular, \nI would like this body to consider the following question: Has \nPresident Clinton, in withholding material Congress is seeking for an \nobviously legitimate purpose, acted consistently with the standard of \nconduct set by every President who has served since President Nixon?\n  Regrettably, Mr. President, I conclude that he has not. Accordingly, \nI believe it is incumbent on the Senate to adopt the pending \nresolution.\n  President Nixon's assertion of executive privilege precipitated a \nconstitutional crisis that ultimately played a major role in forcing \nhis resignation. Since that time, Presidents have been extremely \ncautious in using privilege as a basis for withholding materials from \nlegitimate Congressional inquiries. They have been especially cautious \nwhen this withholding of information might suggest to a reasonable \nperson that privilege might be being asserted to cloak Presidential or \nother high level wrongdoing.\n  The reason for this caution is clear: relations between the branches \nand the people's confidence in their Government suffer greatly when the \nPresident gives the appearance of withholding information in order to \nprotect himself or others close to him from public scrutiny of \npotential wrongdoing.\n  This practice was codified in a directive from President Reagan \nissued on November 4, 1982. Addressed to all general counsels, the \ndirective describes how President Reagan wanted the assertion of \nexecutive privilege handled.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nmemorandum be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, let me quote from the memorandum:\n\n       The policy of this Administration is to comply with \n     Congressional requests for information to the fullest extent \n     consistent with the constitutional and statutory obligations \n     of the Executive Branch.\n       While this Administration, like its predecessors, has an \n     obligation to protect the confidentiality of some \n     communications, executive privilege will be asserted only in \n     the most compelling circumstances, and only after careful \n     review demonstrates that assertion of the privilege is \n     necessary.\n       Historically, good faith negotiations between Congress and \n     the Executive Branch have minimized the need for invoking \n     executive privilege, and this tradition of accommodation \n     should continue as the primary means of resolving conflicts \n     between the Branches.* * *\n\n  To this end President Reagan set up prudential limitations regarding \nthe assertion of privilege even where a claim might be legitimate:\n\n       Congressional requests for information shall be complied \n     with as promptly and as fully as possible, unless it is \n     determined that compliance raises a substantial question of \n     executive privilege.\n       A substantial question of executive privilege exists if \n     disclosure of the information requested might significantly \n     impair the national security (including the conduct of \n     foreign relations), the deliberative processes of the \n     Executive Branch or other aspects of the performance of the \n     Executive Branch's constitutional duties.\n       Every effort shall be made to comply with the Congressional \n     request in a manner consistent with the legitimate needs of \n     the Executive Branch.\n       The Department Head, the Attorney General and the Counsel \n     to the President may, in the exercise of their discretion in \n     the circumstances, determine that executive privilege shall \n     not be invoked and release the requested information.\n\n  Similarly, those advising Presidents since President Nixon have \nuniversally recommended great caution before assertions of privilege \nare made. One particular aspect of this advice is well worth quoting:\n\n       An additional limitation on the assertion of executive \n     privilege is that privilege should not be invoked to conceal \n     evidence of wrongdoing or criminality on the part of \n     executive officers.\n       The documents must therefore be reviewed for any evidence \n     of misconduct which would render the assertion of privilege \n     inappropriate.\n       It should always be remembered that even the most carefully \n     administered department or agency may have made a mistake or \n     failed to discover a wrongdoing committed inside or outside \n     the Government. Study, Congressional Inquiries Concerning the \n     Decisionmaking Process and Documents of the Executive Branch: \n     1953-1960.\n       The greatest danger attending any assertion of Executive \n     Privilege has always arisen from the difficulty, perhaps \n     impossibility, of establishing with absolute certainty that \n     no mistake or wrongdoing will subsequently come to light \n     which lends credence to congressional assertions that the \n     privilege has been improperly invoked.''\n\n  This passage comes from a 1984 opinion written by Robert B. Shanks, \nDeputy Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel.\n  Mr. Shanks was responding to the Deputy Attorney General's request \nfor an opinion regarding Congressional subpoenas of Department of \nJustice Investigate Files. His opinion can be found at 8 Op. OLC 252. \nIt well summarizes, I think, the dangers that any assertion of \nprivilege may present even where the assertion is undertaken for \nlegitimate reasons, but where its bona fide is bound to be suspect.\n  Now I recognize, Mr. President, that the principal label President \nClinton is placing on this privilege claim is attorney-client--although \nhe has not disavowed a claim of executive privilege.\n  But even apart from the fact that it is unclear whether the President \nhas a separate attorney-client privilege in communications with \ngovernment lawyers apart from his executive privilege, it does not seem \nto me that the label should matter. In either case the need to protect \nthe President's authority to assert privilege where he really needs to, \nand to prevent gratuitous undermining of the public's faith in its \ngovernment present the same overwhelming arguments for caution.\n  Now it is clear to me that no matter what the basis of the \nPresident's assertion of privilege here, it does not meet the standards \nthat previous Presidents have followed in these matters.\n  The meeting at issue was apparently about a matter so far from the \ncore interests of the Presidency that it required the involvement of \nprivate lawyers to defend the President's interests. It has nothing to \ndo with national security. And it is impossible to believe that \nfurnishing these notes will in any way impair the President in the \nperformance of his constitutional functions.\n  Moreover, given that the President's associates have managed to force \nthe appointment of an independent counsel by withholding and removing \nfiles relevant to the Department of Justice's investigation into \nVincent Foster's death, it seems to me that the President should take \nhis obligation of candor even more seriously than is ordinarily the \ncase.\n  Thus, even if President Clinton has a valid claim of privilege--a \npoint on which I am profoundly skeptical--I believe he ought not assert \nit here.\n  He has given no reasons weighty enough to justify its assertion.\n  And indeed, what he has said about this matter shows a surprising \nlack of perspective regarding the circumstances in which such \nassertions should be made.\n  President Clinton is quoted in the press as saying that he ``doesn't \nthink he should be the first President in history'' not to protect \ncommunications arguably protected by the attorney-client privilege. I \ndon't know if this statement was accurately reported, but if it \n\n[[Page S18981]]\nwas, frankly it is as peculiar as some of the other claims that the \nPresident has been making in the last few weeks.\n  Without going back very far in history at all, we can all come up \nwith examples where Presidents have waived possible attorney-client \nprivilege claims in the face of congressional requests for information.\n  Indeed, if Congress is really and legitimately interested in \nsomething, such waivers are the norm, not the exception.\n  Let us look at the select committee's 1987 investigation of the Iran-\nContra matter. The hearings, reports, and depositions are replete with \nreferences to notes, interviews, and testimony from government lawyers \nobviously covering potentially privileged materials. These include \nnotes of then White House Counsel Peter Wallison, testimony from \nAttorney General Meese and Assistant Attorney General for the Office of \nLegal Counsel Charles Cooper, and National Security Council counsel \nPaul Thompson.\n  Similarly, when Congress became concerned about issues arising out of \nthe United States relations with Iraq, President Bush provided numerous \nmaterials to various committees investigating these matters. And these \nmaterials could have been the subject of claims of attorney-client \nprivilege at least as strong as the one President Clinton is making \nhere.\n  Indeed, President Bush even provided notes and other materials \nrelating to meetings among lawyers including the White House counsel \nand the counsel to the National Security Council regarding how to \nrespond to congressional document requests. President Bush also \ninterposed no bar to these lawyers' testifying before Congress and \nresponding to questions.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, as recently as 2 days ago President Clinton's \nown White House counsel voluntarily provided to members of the \nJudiciary Committee an opinion of the Assistant Attorney General for \nthe Office of Legal Counsel regarding his interpretation of an \nantinepotism statute as not limiting the President's appointment power.\n  This opinion undoubtedly would be subject to as strong an attorney-\nclient privilege claim as one can imagine the President making. But the \nWhite House counsel provided it, knowing that it would waive any \nprivilege claim, because he believed it was in the interest of the \nPresident for the Judiciary Committee to have it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter transmitting this opinion be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, December 18, 1995.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Hon. Joe Biden,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch and Senator Biden: At my request, \n     Walter Dellinger has reexamined the question of the \n     application of the anti-nepotism statute, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 458 \n     to the President's nomination of William Fletcher to the \n     Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I am forwarding to you Mr. \n     Dellinger's memorandum which concludes that the section does \n     not apply to the presidential appointment of federal judges.\n       His analysis of the text and its history confirms that the \n     position of judge on a federal court is not an office or duty \n     ``in any court'' within the meaning of section 458; that it \n     was not considered to be so by the Congresses that enacted \n     either the original or the current version of the section; \n     and that it has never been treated as such by any subsequent \n     President or Senate. The evident purpose of this statute was \n     to prevent judges (and, as revised in 1911, person working \n     for judges) from appointing their relatives to such positions \n     as clerks, bailiffs, and the like. On the other hand, the \n     novel view that section 458 applies to the nomination by the \n     President of Article III judges would commit one to the \n     conclusion that a number of distinguished judges had served \n     their country illegally, including Augustus and Learned Hand.\n       Mr. Dellinger has also concluded that the statute does not \n     apply to presidential appointment of judges because of the \n     well-established ``clear statement'' rule that statutes will \n     not be read to intrude on the President's responsibilities in \n     matters assigned to him by the Constitution, including the \n     appointments power, unless they expressly state that Congress \n     intends to limit the President's authority. The Supreme Court \n     has applied this principle often, even to statutes the text \n     of which would otherwise clearly appear to cover the \n     President.\n       Any assumption that section 458 limits the President's \n     authority to appoint Article III judges--and that such a \n     limitation would not raise any serious constitutional \n     question--would establish a precedent that would profoundly \n     alter the constitutional separation of powers in ways that \n     sweep well beyond the statute at issue here. Any assumption \n     that general statutory language should be read to limit \n     the authority of the President of the United States to \n     carry out his constitutional responsibilities would \n     overturn important executive branch legal determinations \n     by a succession of Assistant Attorneys General including \n     William H. Rehnquist, Theodore B. Olsen, Charles J. Cooper \n     and William Barr and by Deputy Attorney General Lawrence \n     Silberman, in addition to clearly applicable Supreme Court \n     decisions.\n       In light of its text, its statutory history, and the \n     constitutional principle embodied in the clear statement \n     rule, it is beyond doubt that any court would find section \n     458 to be inapplicable to the presidential appointment of \n     federal judges. I hope that the Senate will not base its \n     important decision regarding the nomination of Mr. Fletcher \n     on the view that section 458 applies to it.\n       Many thanks for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Jack Quinn,\n                                         Counsel to the President.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. In short, there is nothing extraordinary or \nunprecedented in the Select Committee's interest in these notes and the \ncommittee's desire to get them is far from extraordinary or \nunprecedented in the history of Congressional-Presidential relations.\n  Rather, what is extraordinary and inconsistent with the way \nPresidents since President Nixon have handled such questions is \nPresident Clinton's assertion of privilege.\n  This is particularly striking given the circumstances surrounding \nthese materials; circumstances suggesting to many reasonable observers, \nincluding the editorialists quoted on the floor today, that there is a \nissue of potential high level wrongdoing at issue here.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make one final point. Some have said \nthat if we vote to enforce the subpoena, all efforts to reach a \nnegotiated settlement of this matter will cease.\n  Mr. President, that would greatly surprise me. The courts have stated \ntime and time again that both branches have an obligation to \naccommodate each other's interests in these matters. Thus, if either \nbranch were to cease all efforts at accommodation, it would do great \ndamage to its legal case. Moreover, it is in both branches' interest, \nand indeed it is both branches' constitutional duty, to try to resolve \nthis matter without going to court.\n  Therefore I do not think any Member of this body should view a vote \nto enforce this resolution as a vote to end our efforts at resolving \nthis matter without going to court.\n  Rather, even if we adopt this resolution and Senate Legal Counsel \nbegins work on legal papers, I am sure the committee will at the same \ntime continue its efforts to obtain these notes with the President's \nconsent. And it is my hope that, resolution or no resolution, the \nPresident will provide them promptly.\n  That is his duty, as it is our duty to defend the committee's ability \nto investigate potential wrongdoing.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                               The White House\n\n                                     Washington, November 4, 1982.\n\n\n     memorandum for the heads of executive departments and agencies\n\n     Subject: Procedures Governing Responses to Congressional \n         Requests for Information\n       The policy of this Administration is to comply with \n     Congressional requests for information to the fullest extent \n     consistent with the constitutional and statutory obligations \n     of the Executive Branch. While this Administration, like its \n     predecessors, has an obligation to protect the \n     confidentiality of some communications, executive privilege \n     will be asserted only in the most compelling circumstances, \n     and only after careful review demonstrates that assertion of \n     the privilege is necessary. Historically, good faith \n     negotiations between Congress and the Executive Branch have \n     minimized the need for invoking executive privilege, and this \n     tradition of accommodation should continue as the primary \n     means of resolving conflicts between the Branches. To ensure \n     that every reasonable accommodation is made to the needs of \n     Congress, executive privilege shall not be invoked without \n     specific Presidential authorization.\n       The Supreme Court has held that the Executive Branch may \n     occasionally find it necessary and proper to preserve the \n     confidentiality of national security secrets, deliberative \n     communications that form a part of the decision-making \n     process, or other information important to the discharge of \n     the Executive Branch's constitutional responsibilities. \n     Legitimate and appropriate claims of \n\n[[Page S18982]]\n     privilege should not thoughtlessly be waived. However, to ensure that \n     this Administration acts responsibly and consistently in the \n     exercise of its duties, with due regard for the \n     responsibilities and prerogatives of Congress, the following \n     procedures shall be followed whenever Congressional requests \n     for information raise concerns regarding the confidentiality \n     of the information sought:\n       1. Congressional requests for information shall be complied \n     with as promptly and as fully as possible, unless it is \n     determined that compliance raises a substantial question of \n     executive privilege. A ``substantial question of executive \n     privilege'' exists if disclosure of the information requested \n     might significantly impair the national security (including \n     the conduct of foreign relations), the deliberative processes \n     of the Executive Branch or other aspects of the performance \n     of the Executive Branch's constitutional duties.\n       2. If the head of an executive department or agency \n     (``Department Head'') believes, after consultation with \n     department counsel, that compliance with a Congressional \n     request for information raises a substantial question of \n     executive privilege, he shall promptly notify and consult \n     with the Attorney General through the Assistant Attorney \n     General for the Office of Legal Counsel, and shall also \n     promptly notify and consult with the Counsel to the \n     President. If the information requested of a department or \n     agency derives in whole or in part from information received \n     from another department or agency, the latter entity shall \n     also be consulted as to whether disclosure of the information \n     raises a substantial question of executive privilege.\n       3. Every effort shall be made to comply with the \n     Congressional request in a manner consistent with the \n     legitimate needs of the Executive Branch. The Department \n     Head, the Attorney General and the Counsel to the President \n     may, in the exercise of their discretion in the \n     circumstances, determine that executive privilege shall not \n     be invoked and release the requested information.\n       4. If the Department Head, the Attorney General or the \n     Counsel to the President believes, after consultation, that \n     the circumstances justify invocation of executive privilege, \n     the issue shall be presented to the President by the Counsel \n     to the President, who will advise the Department Head and the \n     Attorney General of the President's decision.\n       5. Pending a final Presidential decision on the matter, the \n     Department Head shall request the Congressional body to hold \n     its request for the information in abeyance. The Department \n     Head shall expressly indicate that the purpose of this \n     request is to protect the privilege pending a Presidential \n     decision, and that the request itself does not constitute a \n     claim of privilege.\n       6. If the President decides to invoke executive privilege, \n     the Department Head shall advise the requesting Congressional \n     body that the claim of executive privilege is being made with \n     the specific approval of the President.\n       Any questions concerning these procedures or related \n     matters should be addressed to the Attorney General, through \n     the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal \n     Counsel, and to the Counsel to the President.\n                                                    Ronald Reagan.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on a day when some 260,000 federal employees \nremain idle because the Congress has not completed work on the annual \nappropriations bills--its most fundamental constitutional task--this \nbody has before it a measure dealing with Whitewater that is unwise, \nand, quite frankly, wholly unnecessary. Instead of acting on the \nremaining appropriations bills, instead of completing our most basic \ntask, we are being asked to divert our attention and adopt a resolution \nwhich is, I believe, nothing more than a vehicle to promote the \npolitical fortunes of some.\n  The special committee, which the Senate created to investigate the \nWhitewater matter, has held more than a month of hearings. They have \nheard testimony from more than 150 witnesses. The White House, in \nconjunction with these hearings, has produced more than 15,000 pages of \nmaterial, while the law firm of Williams and Connolly, which represents \nthe President and Mrs. Clinton, have produced an additional 28,000 \npages. And through it all, the American taxpayer has been billed more \nthan $27 million dollars.\n  Yet, despite this, the American people are being led to believe that, \nunless the Senate adopts this resolution, which would require the \nSenate Legal Counsel to go into federal court in an attempt to enforce \na Senate subpoena, some facet of the investigation will go uncovered. \nMr. President, nothing could be further from the truth.\n  The fact is that the White House has already stated its willingness \nto supply the material the Senate has asked for. The President has said \nhe will make available the documents in question; notes taken by a \nformer White House attorney during a November 1993 meeting. He has, as \nI think these actions show, acted in a reasonable, good faith manner. \nBut at the same time the President has been willing to produce the \nsubpoenaed material, he has also asked that he not lose the fundamental \nprivilege of attorney-client confidentiality.\n  Mr. President, every American has the right to talk to a lawyer fully \nand frankly without fear that the government will compel the disclosure \nof these personal communications. The President of the United States, \nbe he Democrat or be he Republican, is no different. He is, like every \nother American citizen, entitled to the benefits of the attorney-client \nprivilege.\n  In view of the President's offer of cooperation, the Committee's \nattempt, to invade the relationship between the President and his \nprivate counsel smacks of an effort to force a claim of privilege by \nthe President, who must assert that right to avoid risking the loss, in \nall forums, of his confidential relationship with his lawyer. This \neffort, at this time, and in light of the President's willingness to \ncomply with the Senate's subpoena, simply smacks of political \npartisanship.\n  Why else, if not simply to score political points, would the majority \nreject the President's offer? Why not accept the material, which the \nmajority says it needs, and get on with the investigation? Why go to \ncourt, an action that will only prolong the investigation, if there is \nno intent to simply win headlines and seek political advantage?\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues who may be inclined to support \nthis resolution will reconsider their position. I hope they will \nreexamine the road down which we may be traveling, and vote against the \nsubpoena resolution.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, if I might seek recognition, first, for \nthe purposes of propounding a unanimous-consent agreement.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will consent with the understanding that I do not lose \nmy right to the floor after the unanimous-consent agreement is \npropounded.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We imagine it will include the Senator within it.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Absolutely. First of all, I thank the ranking member, \nSenator Sarbanes, as well as Senator Pryor, for giving Senator Specter \nan opportunity to proceed. He is going to use about 10 minutes. \nThereafter, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Pryor be recognized \nfollowing Senator Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the pending resolution, but I \nexpress at the outset my concern about some of the legal arguments \nwhich have been raised that the attorney-client privilege does not \napply to Congress, to congressional investigations. It is not necessary \nfor me to reach that issue in my own conclusion or judgment here, that \nthe attorney-client privilege does not apply, but I do express that \nconcern.\n  There has been an argument raised that the attorney-client privilege \nis different from the privilege against self-incrimination because the \nprivilege against self-incrimination has a constitutional base. In my \nview, however, there is a constitutional nexus to the attorney-client \nprivilege which arises from the constitutional right to counsel. Since \nthe citations of authority limiting the attorney-client privilege in \nthe context of congressional investigations--since those cases were \nhanded down, there has been a considerable expansion in constitutional \nlaw on the right to counsel--Gideon versus Wainright, in 1963, \nasserting that anybody was entitled to counsel if they were haled into \ncourt on a felony charge, whereas, the practice in the prior period had \nbeen that the right to counsel did not apply, and the expansion of \nwarnings and waivers under Miranda versus Arizona. So I think the \nbreadth of the conclusion that the attorney-client privilege is not \nconstitutional is certainly entitled to some skepticism at the present \ntime.\n  It is my view, however, that the attorney-client privilege does not \napply here to preclude enforcement of this subpoena because the \nattorney-client privilege simply, on the facts, does not \n\n[[Page S18983]]\napply. Upjohn versus United States contains the basic proposition that \nthe attorney-client privilege is the oldest of the privileges for \nconfidential communications known to the law, with the citation to \nWigmore. The Supreme Court in the Upjohn case says that the purpose of \nthe attorney-client privilege is to encourage full and frank \ncommunications between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote \nthe broader public interest in the observance of law and the \nadministration of justice. The privilege recognizes that sound legal \nadvice and advocacy serve public ends, but such advice or advocacy \ndepends upon lawyers being fully informed by their clients.\n  In the Westinghouse versus Republic of the Philippines case, the \nThird Circuit articulated this view: ``Full and frank communication is \nnot an end in itself, but merely a means to achieve the ultimate \npurpose of privilege, promoting broader public interest in the \nobservance of law and the administration of justice.''\n  The Third Circuit, in the Westinghouse case, goes on to point out, \n``because the attorney-client privilege obstructs the truth-finding \nprocess, it is narrowly construed.''\n  The essential ingredients for the attorney-client privilege were set \nforth in United States versus United Shoe Machinery Corp., a landmark \ndecision by Judge Wyzanski, pointing out that one of the essentials for \nthe privilege is that the communication has to have a connection with \nthe functioning of the lawyer in the lawyer-client relationship. \nProfessor Wigmore articulates the same basic requirement.\n  As I take a look at the facts present here and a number of the \nindividuals present, there was not the attorney-client relationship. \nThere were present at the meeting in issue David Kendall, a partner at \nthe Washington, DC, law firm of Williams & Connolly, recently retained \nas private counsel to the President and Mrs. Clinton. That status would \ncertainly invoke the attorney-client privilege. Steven Engstrom, a \npartner of the Little Rock law firm that had provided private personal \ncounseling in the past. That certainly would support the attorney-\nclient privilege. James Lyons, a lawyer in private practice in \nColorado, who had provided advice to the President when he was \nGovernor, and to Mrs. Clinton at the same time. But then, also present, \nwere Bruce Lindsey, then director of White House personnel, who had \ntestified that he had not provided advice to the President regarding \nWhitewater matters. Once parties are present who were not in an \nattorney relationship, the attorney-client privilege does not continue \nto exist in that context, where they are privy to the information. \nThere was Mr. Kennedy, himself, associate counsel to the President--\nWilliam Kennedy, who said he was ``not at the meeting representing \nanyone.'' Then you had the presence of then counsel to the President, \nMr. Bernard Nussbaum, and also associate counsel to the President, Mr. \nNeal Eggleston, who were present, not really functioning in a capacity \nas counsel to the President or Mrs. Clinton.\n  So, as a legal matter, when those individuals are present, the \ninformation which is transmitted is not protected by the attorney-\nclient privilege. And then you have, further, the disclosure which was \nmade by White House spokesman, Mark Fabiani, to the news media \ncharacterizing what happened at the November 5 meeting, and discussing \nthe subject matter of the meeting, which would constitute as a legal \nmatter, in my judgment, a waiver of the privilege.\n  So that recognizing the importance of the attorney-client privilege, \nI would be reluctant to see this matter decided on the basis that \nCongress has such broad investigating powers that the attorney-client \nprivilege would not be respected. As I say, we do not have to reach \nthat issue. On the facts here, people were present who were not \nattorneys for the President or Mrs. Clinton. Therefore, what is said \nthere is not protected by the attorney-client privilege. The later \ndisclosure by the White House spokesman, I think, would also constitute \na waiver. For these reasons, and on somewhat narrower grounds, it is my \nview that the resolution ought to be adopted and the subpoena ought to \nbe enforced.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, here we are, almost the night before \nChristmas, in the U.S. Senate, the House of Representatives, and we \nfind ourselves still in session. We do not find ourselves, tonight, \nironically, talking about what to do about the budget impasse. We do \nnot find ourselves on the floor of the U.S. Senate this evening talking \namong each other and colleagues as we should about how to reopen the \nGovernment.\n  No, Mr. President, we find ourselves this evening talking about a \nmore arcane and mundane situation, something called Whitewater. \nWhitewater has become the fixation of one of our political parties. \nThere is no secret about that.\n  Today, the Republicans control the Congress. They set the agenda for \nwhat committees meet, when they meet, what issues come before those \ncommittees, what issues are brought before the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. I think it very timely, Mr. President, for us to examine the \npriorities of this session of Congress.\n  I think it very interesting to note that tonight, a few hours before \nChristmas, when we had hoped to be back in our home States or wherever \nwe might have been, when all of the employees of the Federal Government \nwho are furloughed would prefer to be working and serving the public, \nas they do so well, we find ourselves once again engaged in what I call \nthe Whitewater fixation.\n  Here are the priorities that are established not by this Senator, not \nby this side of the aisle, but by our colleagues who might be well \nmeaning on the other side of the aisle. I think it bears listening to \nfor a few moments, Mr. President, to see that in this year we have had \nsome 34 hearings relating to Whitewater. That would be the red bar \ngoing up the chart. Thirty-four hearings in 34 days of the U.S. Senate \nthat have been designated for Whitewater--the Whitewater fixation.\n  How many days have been set aside for Medicaid funding? Mr. \nPresident, six hearings, Mr. President--six compared to 34 for the \nWhitewater fixation.\n  How many hearings have we held in the U.S. Senate in the calendar \nyear 1995, in this session of Congress, that relate to education \nfunding, Mr. President? Four hearings--four hearings compared to 34 \nhearings of Whitewater.\n  And how many hearings, Mr. President, have we had on the Medicare \nplan, as proposed by the majority party? How many days of hearings have \nwe heard about Medicare? One day, one hearing. There it is, the small \ngreen bar on the bottom of the chart.\n  That tells the story, Mr. President, I think of priorities for 1995 \nand this session of Congress, where the priorities \n\n[[Page S18984]]\nlie with the leadership of this Congress and what we really are faced \nwith in determining what to do about this very critical vote this \nevening on what I call the Whitewater fixation.\n  Mr. President, that is not the end of the story about the so-called \nWhitewater fixation and the Whitewater priority, because I think that \nsometimes we fail to recognize, as we go through 1 week, 1 month, one \nCongress at a time, continually appropriating money to chase the \nWhitewater fixation and to further study the Whitewater matter. I think \nfrom time to time it might be good to recapitulate how much it is \nactually costing the American taxpayers to engage the U.S. Senate, the \nresources of the special counsel, the resources of our Senate \ncommittees, in dealing with the Whitewater concern.\n  For example, the first special counsel that was named to look into \nthe Whitewater matter, who, I might add, was a Republican and in very, \nvery good standing, Mr. Fiske, Mr. Fiske, as special counsel, spent \n$5.9 million--$5.9 million, Mr. President, in his investigation of the \nWhitewater matter. Mr. Fiske, evidently, did not find enough. He did \nnot find a smoking gun. He did not nail any scalps to the wall, so Mr. \nFiske was relieved of his responsibility. He was relieved. He was \nfired.\n  Then came on to the scene Mr. Kenneth Starr, who has spent, from \nAugust 5, 1994 to March 31 of 1995, $8.7 million in the investigation \nof this illusory situation known as Whitewater. Mr. Starr could not \nfinish his work, Mr. President. He had to come before the Congress and \nhe had to have more money as a special counsel. So he comes back to the \nCongress this April. From April to November of 1995, independent \ncounsel Kenneth Starr spent another $8 million.\n  So we are adding up the figures. No, we could not quite spend enough \nmoney to satisfy Mr. Starr. In two appropriations, we could not spend \nenough to satisfy Mr. Fiske. He got no indictments of any consequence. \nHe did not nail any scalps to the wall.\n  So what happens next? We hire, by the RTC, the Pillsbury law firm, \nbasically a firm with very strong Republican connections. I might add, \na very splendid law firm, according to all reports. The U.S. taxpayer \nwrites a check for $3.6 million to the Pillsbury law firm in \nCalifornia, to come forward with a report that basically says this: The \nClintons are clean, the RTC should not pursue any criminal action \nwhatever against the Clintons, nor this administration.\n  Mr. President, that is still not enough: $3.6 million, $5.9 million, \n$8.7 million, $8 million. So now we have to go back and see what our \nown committee spent: in 1994, $400,000; in 1995, $950,000--a total, Mr. \nPresident, of $27.6 million that we have spent that we can account in \nthis illusory situation, this illusory item known as Whitewater.\n  This is the Whitewater fixation. This is the Whitewater fixation, Mr. \nPresident, that I think really is the Whitewater witch hunt. It is the \nwitch hunt of the 1990's. It has become a waste of the taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  What we are doing today is simply, in my opinion, showing where the \npriorities of this session of Congress are: with 34 hearings dedicated \nto Whitewater, 6 hearings dedicated to Medicaid, four hearings \ndedicated to education, and 1 hearing dedicated to Medicare. That is \nthe priorities of this particular Congress thus far, in 1995.\n\n  We have had brilliant arguments this afternoon and, I think, some \nbrilliant arguments in the Banking Committee, perhaps, on each side of \nthe aisle, relative to the question of the privilege created between \nattorney and client. I am not going to argue this. I am not a \nconstitutional lawyer. I am not one who specialized in this particular \narea of the law. But I would just say this. I think it is very, very \nnecessary for the American public at this time to have the knowledge \nthat this administration in no way is trying to keep the U.S. Senate, \nthe Banking Committee charged with this particular concern, keeping the \nnotes of November 5, taken by Bill Kennedy, away from this committee.\n  The White House has repeatedly said: We want you to have these notes. \nWe think you should have these notes. We will give you these notes, \ntaken by Mr. Kennedy and/or Mr. Lindsey. I forget which. But, what we \nwant to make sure is that we are not waiving the very important, \ncrucial matter of the attorney-client privilege.\n  If we can, basically, in a political arena, invade or take away this \nprivilege in any form, shape or fashion, if we erode that particular \nprivilege, if we come before the U.S. Senate and say that privilege \ndoes not exist, then what is the next step? Are we going to come to the \nU.S. Senate and say we do not think we need to have a doctor-patient \nprivilege? We want to do something about eroding that? So we start \npecking away at that.\n  I do not think that should be the business of the Senate at this \nparticular time, to start eroding and emasculating the particular right \nthat we revere in the common law and have for so many years, and that \nis the right of privilege created between lawyer and client.\n  The White House wants to know how far this action extends. Should \nthey make these notes available, they are seeking clarification. That \nis basically what this is about and I am very, very concerned that some \npeople are making a very, very overrated political issue about the \nWhitewater matter.\n  The Senate has spent a total of $1.35 million in 1994 and 1995 on the \nWhitewater matter. I would like to ask this question. What is the \ncharge? What is the accusation against the White House? What is the \naccusation against any of the people who have been brought before the \ncommittee in the last 12 months, before the Senate committee? What are \nthey being charged with?\n  I would like to also know if anyone is taking cognizance of the fact \nthat, even though some may be enjoying this event and may be making a \nlittle political hay out of it from time to time, I wonder if anyone \nhas taken cognizance of how much the legal fees and the expenses of \nthese witnesses are, some of whom certainly cannot afford the very, \nvery high cost of counsel.\n\n  The $27 million that the taxpayers have spent on the Whitewater \ninvestigation is almost three times what it would have been to have \nclosed down Madison Savings & Loan institution in Little Rock, AR. The \nWhite House has provided, I think, according to the information that we \nhave, over 15,000 pages of documents to the Senate committee. The \nPresident's personal attorney has produced more than 28,000 documents \nfor the Senate committee. The Senate committee has deposed some 152 \nindividuals. The Senate committee has heard testimony from 78 people \nduring the hearing, in the hearing examination process.\n  All of this activity has been done with the total cooperation of the \nWhite House. And still there is no smoking gun. The so-called smoking \ngun that some say would be found in the notes taken by Mr. Kennedy and/\nor Mr. Lindsey, those particular notes, in my opinion, even though I \nhave not been privy to seeing them, probably, in all likelihood, \ncontain no more of a smoking gun than has been found in the past \nseveral months during this investigation and during the tenure of two \nspecial counsels, Mr. Fiske and now Mr. Starr.\n  I think we are going to have to face, Mr. President--I do not know \nwhen this comes up, perhaps in February--we are going to be faced with \na decision. OK, we spent some $27 million on this, and I am not sure \nthat includes the cost of all of the army of FBI, of the RTC, of the \nFDIC, all of the Federal employees, all of the Federal negotiators, all \nof the resources of the Federal Government, all the copying, the \nprinting, the committee reports and all this--I am not certain that \nthis cost even covers that particular amount. But we are going to be \nfaced in the Senate, in February, I believe, if I am correct, with \nanother question. Are we going to appropriate another $5, $6, $8 \nmillion for the committee to continue down this same path of dragging \nthese people before the committee, of interrogating them, of asking \nthem to pay for their own lawyers' fees and basically bringing them in \nand putting them in the lockbox, so to speak, as they wait their turn \nto testify before the committee? Is this the best that we can do in all \nof these months and all of these years of investigating this thing \ncalled Whitewater? During this period of the Whitewater witch-hunt? \nDuring this period of Whitewater fixation?\n  I think we are better than that. I think this Senate is better than \nthat. \n\n[[Page S18985]]\n\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, could I ask just for a moment, so we \nmight be able to hotline a resolution of this matter and I will yield \nthe floor right back to my colleague?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I will be glad to yield.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, after having \nconsulted with my friend and colleague, Senator Sarbanes, that the time \nbetween now and 7:15 be equally divided, excluding the Senator's time. \nAfter the Senator concludes his remarks, the time after the Senator \nconcludes his remarks be equally divided in the usual form for debate \non Senator Sarbanes' substitute amendment; that no other amendments or \nmotions to recommit be in order, that it be in order for the amendment \nto amend both the preamble and resolving clause, and that at 7:15 the \nSenate vote on the Sarbanes amendment and upon the disposition of the \namendment the Senate vote on passage of Senate Resolution 199, as \namended, if amended, and that the preceding all occur without any \nintervening action or debate.\n\n\n             Amendments--Nos. 3101, 3102, and 3103--En Bloc\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, also, I will send three amendments to the \ndesk which have been cleared by the other side, my friend in the \nminority. I ask they be considered en bloc, agreed to en bloc, and I \nwill move to reconsider.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Are these the amendments directed toward a possible \ndeficiency in the issuing of the subpoenas?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is correct. They are the technical amendments that \ndeal with the issuance of the subpoena.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as regards \nthe amendments? If not, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments--Nos. 3101, 3102 and 3103--were considered and agreed \nto en bloc, as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3101\n\n(Purpose: To amend the resolution to reflect the serving of the second \n                               subpoena)\n\n       The first section of the resolution is amended by striking \n     ``subpoena and order'' and inserting ``subpoenas and \n     orders''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3102\n\n(Purpose: To amend the resolution to reflect the serving of the second \n                               subpoena)\n\n       After the sixth Whereas clause in the preamble insert the \n     following:\n       ``Whereas on December 15, 1995, the Special Committee \n     authorized the issuance of a second subpoena duces tecum to \n     William H.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection to the request for a \nvote on the Sarbanes amendment at 7:15 and a vote on the resolution \nafter the 7:15 vote?\n  Mr. SARBANES. The consent request was broader than that. I do not \nthink there is any objection to the unanimous-consent request which was \nread by the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is their objection to the request of the \nSenator from New York?\n  If not, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank my friend and colleague for extending us this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am going to conclude once again by saying that \npersonally I think holding 34 hearings on Whitewater this year is \nenough. I think spending $27.6 million is enough. I think that \nexpending these amounts of resources that we have expended, for the FBI \nand all of the other investigation teams, whatever, looking into \nWhitewater that have been utilized by the Federal Government I think \nfrankly is more than enough.\n  I hope--and I urge my colleagues on each side of the aisle--if there \nis something wrong that someone has done, let us name the cause, let us \nbring them to justice, and let us do what is necessary. But, Mr. \nPresident, to keep this issue out, to keep it dangling as it is today, \nto keep it as an issue that I fear is becoming politicized to a very \ngreat extent, and to not recognize the simple unfairness that we have \ncreated in not bringing charges when we might or might not have charges \nto bring but to just to keep that issue out there over and over and \nover and day after day, month after month, millions after millions of \ndollars, I think is unfair. I think this institution is better than \nthat.\n  I hope that we will reach down and find in our souls somewhere a way \nto finally conclude the Whitewater witch hunt and our fixation on the \nWhitewater matter.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time from now \nuntil 7:15 is equally divided.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the three \namendments just adopted en bloc be in order at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Have the three amendments been agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3104\n\n  (Purpose: To direct the Special Committee to exhaust all available \n avenues of negotiation, cooperation, or other joint activity in order \nto obtain the notes of former White House Associate Counsel William H. \n                             Kennedy, III.)\n\n  Mr. SARBANES.

Mr. President, I note that the preamble is also \namended. But under the unanimous consent request, it is in order to \namend both the preamble and the resolve clause. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And no other amendments or motions to recommit are in \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The vote will occur at 7:15 and the time between now \nand then to be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How much time is then available to each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 27 minutes to each side.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes and ask that the Chair notify \nme upon the expiration of the 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, very simply put, takes the position \nthat rather than going to court at this point, the special committee \nshould exhaust all available avenues of negotiation and cooperation, or \nother joint activity, in order to obtain the notes and to work \ncooperatively with the White House and other parties to secure the \ncommitment of the independent counsel and the House of Representatives \nnot to argue that the furnishing of the notes, the production of the \nnotes, constitutes the waiver of attorney-client privilege.\n  We have been lead to understand that the independent counsel is \namenable to such an arrangement in his discussions with the White \nHouse, although that has not been confirmed with us. But that is my \nunderstanding. This committee has agreed to this proposition.\n  As the chairman indicated, two of the conditions the White House put \nforward when it offered the notes is that we will make the notes \navailable, but we want to guard against the total waiver of the \nattorney-client privileges. One of those conditions was that the \ncommittee would not take the position in any forum that the production \nof the notes constituted a general waiver of the attorney-client \nprivilege. In effect, that was recognized by the committee as a \nreasonable proposition and agreed to.\n  The question now is, if the House committees would agree to the same \nproposition, the notes are forthcoming, if you eliminate then the risk \nof the waiver of the attorney-client privilege? I have heard discussion \non the floor today--I did not challenge it on every occasion--that \nthere is no reasonable claim here to a lawyer-client privilege. That is \nnot what the experts tell us. Professor Hazard, who is one of the \nleading men in the country on this, has been rather clear in thinking \nthere is an attorney-client privilege.\n\n  In addition, once you waive it, you then have the risk of waiving \nyour confidential relationship with your lawyer with respect to all \nmeetings--not just with respect to this meeting. In any event, I think \nit serves our purposes to try to work this matter out.\n  As I understand it, the discussions took place in the House today \nwith the chairmen of the relevant House committees, and it seems to me \nthat those discussions ought to continue and that we ought to get a \nposture hopefully on the part of the House committees comparable to the \nposition this committee has taken and comparable to what the \nindependent counsel has taken.\n  It behooves us to try to avoid a confrontation, and it serves the \nSenate's purposes not to go to court if the matter can be resolved in a \nway that has been suggested. What is before us is a process whereby we \ncan obtain the notes and yet not have any trespass or intrusion into \nthe attorney-client privilege.\n  This is a very important issue. One of my colleagues said earlier \nthere is no case about the Congress dealing with the attorney-client \nprivilege. The Congress has not trespassed the attorney-client \nprivilege. One of my colleagues cited a quote of the President who said \nhe would provide any information available. That was a year and a half \nago, I guess. My reaction to that is obviously when he said it, he \nnever envisioned that we would face the prospect of an unreasonable \nintrusion into the attorney-client privilege. I never thought that \nwould happen, and when confronted with it here, the question is, how \ncan we work through it? We can get these notes, not waive the attorney-\nclient privilege, and proceed with our inquiry. Of course, that would \nmake the notes available immediately. That is the path that I think the \nSenate should follow.\n  So I think it would serve the Senate well to make a further effort at \nworking with the White House and the other parties to get the kind of \nunderstanding from all of the relevant investigatory bodies--and we are \nnow talking about the House committees--in view of the decision of the \nindependent counsel; that furnishing of the notes is not a general \nwaiver of the privilege. We recognize that is reasonable. The \nindependent counsel apparently recognizes that it is reasonable. If we \ncan just close the loop with respect to the House committees, this \nmatter can be settled. The notes will be furnished.\n  There is a letter from the White House counsel saying, ``We have \nsucceeded in reaching an understanding with the independent counsel \nthat he will not argue that turning over the Kennedy notes waive the \nattorney-client privilege claim by the President.''\n  With this agreement in hand, the only thing standing in the way of \ngiving these notes to your committee is the unwillingness of Republican \nHouse chairmen similarly to agree.\n  I understand they entered into discussion this afternoon with the \nHouse chairmen in respect to this very issue. Of course, the House \nchairmen, as I see it, have nothing to lose by the agreement. The notes \nbecome available. The agreement does not preclude them from any action \nthat is currently available to them. It would not eliminate any course \nof conduct that they wished to follow that is currently available to \nthem.\n  The White House has indicated that as soon as they secured such an \nagreement from the House, they would provide the notes to the \ncommittee. So it seems to me that we ought not to provoke a \nconstitutional confrontation. We ought not go to the courts in order to \nresolve this issue. I suggest to my colleagues, although many have \nasserted that there is a weak attorney-client privilege, I think just \nthe contrary. In any event, the court may well decide that there is a \nstrong attorney-client privilege which, of course, would have an impact \non the investigatory authority of the Congress. It would be a prudent \ncourse of action to resolve the matter without going to the courts. \nThere is every indication that that may well be possible.\n  That is the situation in which we now find ourselves. This committee \nhas recognized it as reasonable. The independent counsel has recognized \nit as reasonable. And if we can get the House committees to follow the \nsame path, the notes can be furnished, there is no trespass on \nattorney-client, the committee can continue its work and continue to do \nit now. If we go to court, we have a long time ahead of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, first, let me say that I am forced to \noppose the amendment for a number of reasons. I certainly do not \nquestion the sincerity of my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, in an attempt \nto bring about a successful mediation, successful in that it would \nresult in the notes being turned over. I absolutely had no doubt from \nthe beginning he has pursued this and worked to achieve this end. I am \nforced to oppose this, though, because there are a number of problems \nthat I could see taking place.\n  No. 1. I believe that this amendment could result, if passed--if \nadopted, this approach could result in prolonging what has really been \na very long, now unnecessary, delay. This issue of these records and \nother records really goes \n\n[[Page S18987]]\nback to August 25 and reaches a high point, begins to reach a high \npoint in November, starting November 2 and culminates in December when \nwe actually issue subpoenas.\n\n  One actually has to understand that we did, in fairness again to the \ncommittee, issue these subpoenas on a bipartisan basis. We attempted to \navoid it, attempted to mediate this before we finally came to the \nconclusion that we had to issue the subpoenas. And it was only then, \nwhen the White House raised the issue of privilege, the attorney-client \nprivilege, that we kind of parted ways.\n  When I say we parted ways, there was a recognition by the majority \nthat this privilege, on our part we felt, did not apply, and there was \na concern on the part of the minority that the White House was within \nits realm. But, notwithstanding the differences of opinion, I must say \nthat my colleagues on the Democratic side urged an attempt to work this \nout. The fact is, though, we have been working toward this, I think, \nfor several weeks very intensively. When I say ``we,'' I am talking \nabout counsel--majority counsel, minority counsel--working to attempt \nto resolve this. We had offered basically to say we will not intrude \ninto Mr. Kendall, we will not ask or seek a waiver. We say that this \nsets no precedent, so therefore you will not be bound in other areas. \nWe will agree to those things. And that is basically now the position \nthat the White House counsel finally came around to. But understand, it \nonly came around to that after we indicated we would go forward and \npush this issue on the subpoenas. Very, very grudgingly did they come \nto this position, and they came to this position very late in the game. \nNotwithstanding that, we indicated that we would accept.\n  Now, the problem we have is when we get into this language and we say \nthat this committee will exhaust all available avenues of negotiation, \ncooperation, or other joint activity with the White House, the \ncommittee would have to attend more meetings, have endless \nnegotiations--it could possibly take us, we do not know how long--\nignores what we have done, good faith work and negotiation starting in \nAugust and culminating finally when we have said basically enough is \nenough. If we cannot resolve the matter--reasonable people disagree; \nyou contend it is privileged material; we do not believe that to be the \ncase--we are going forward. And that is how we come here. If we were to \nadopt the amendment that is now being considered, we would put off the \ntime when the committee could enforce the subpoena for Lord knows how \nlong.\n  I believe that my colleague really wants good faith negotiations and \nwants those notes. I do not know when the House may or may not agree to \nthis. We have been told that the independent counsel has agreed. I have \nno doubt that, if that is the representation that has come from the \nWhite House, that is the case. But this amendment could literally \nrequire the committee to negotiate on behalf of the House, and this \nwould be unprecedented and would require the committee to delay even \nmore.\n\n  Now, let me go to the merits of this. This amendment, if we read \nlines 1 through 19, says, ``Where the White House has made a well-\nfounded assertion, supported by respected legal authorities, that the \nNovember 5, 1993, meeting is protected by the attorney-client \nprivilege.''\n  Let me say, No. 1, no President has ever raised the attorney-client \nprivilege. He just has not done it. It is unprecedented. No. 2, we \nwould have to be conceding that this is well-founded. And \nnotwithstanding that there may be a legal scholar or some who would \ngive testimony to this who might believe this to be the case, I have to \ntell you that I do not believe that this is a well-founded assertion, \nas Senator Thompson, I believe, so scholarly and so powerfully argued; \nthat the attorney-client privilege certainly did not apply to this \nmeeting even given the limited circumstances that we understand as to \nhow this meeting came about, even conceding--and I think if we were to \ngo further, we would find out there would be ample testimony and proof \nthat there is no way that that privilege should attach to this meeting.\n  Notwithstanding, we offered to say there would be no deem, no waiver, \nof any attorney-client privilege. We did that. That was not the White \nHouse that came forth. They rejected that. It was only when we said we \nwere going to issue a subpoena that they then said, well, here we are \ncoming forth. Again, I think we have to discern the legitimate attempts \nat compromising, which absolutely comes from my colleagues on the \nDemocratic side on the Banking Committee but was not supported by the \nactions and activities of the White House. That we have to distinguish.\n  I am very much concerned that we would be prevented from pursuing \nother avenues of investigation in regard to White House contacts with \nthe President's personal lawyers and we would not be able to see if \nthere were other Whitewater joint defense meetings, and that is a very \ncritical point.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me go to something that I do not take \nlightly, but I have mentioned it and I will mention it again. There are \npolitical overtones. Make no mistake about it, there absolutely are.\n  But you see, Mr. President, when the President of the United States \nsays, as he has on a number of occasions, on March 8, in a press \nconference in connection with the appointment of Mr. Cutler, during \nthat press conference the President was asked about the possibility of \nasserting privilege, and he gave the following response. He said, ``It \nis hard for me to imagine a circumstance in which that would be an \nappropriate thing for me to do.''\n  I believe Senator Thompson answered quite compellingly, and argued \nthat, what does he do, he goes and raises a privilege that has never \nbeen raised because he did not want to be in an embarrassing position \nwhen he said ``executive privilege,'' when he spoke quite clearly on \nthis on a number of occasions.\n  By the way, March 8, 1994, is a very important date. Let me tell you \nwhy. Because that was 4 months after this meeting. He knew about that \nmeeting. Understand what he said. ``It is hard for me to imagine \ncircumstances in which that would be an appropriate thing for me to \ndo.'' This was not an event that transpired after March 8. This took \nplace 4 months before.\n  This is not the first time that the President made that assertion. \nIndeed, on April 5, 1994, I believe in North Carolina, again in \nresponse to a question, the President said, ``I look for no procedural \nways to get around this. And I tell you, you want to know, I'll give \nyou the information. I have done nothing, and I will be open and above \nboard. I have claimed no executive privilege.'' Indeed, he did not \nclaim that, and obviously the interpretation is, ``nor will he.''\n  Remember, this was 5 months to the day after this meeting. So this is \nnot a circumstance that occurs after something that will be \nextraordinary, not anticipated.\n  So, Mr. President, I have to say that we have gone that extra step. \nWe have gone that extra mile. We have gone to the point that we may \nhave even--and I believe we have, because if you look at the points \nthat we have conceded in that letter, which I do not have here, a \nletter where the five points initially were submitted to us, that we \nhave indicated that we are not going to say this is a waiver of \nprivilege, although we do not believe there is a privilege, nor will we \nraise and look to examine Mr. Kendall.\n  I believe if you look at all the constitutional authorities where \nprivilege has been waived by the actions of the parties, that is, by \nthose who are nonlawyers or those who are nonparticipants or outside of \nthe scope of the legal arguments, you waive that privilege. Where \npeople who attended that meeting speak about that meeting, a waiver of \nthat privilege is, notwithstanding that we agreed on points 2 and 3, \nthat we suggested that the committee would limit its testimony and \ninquiry about this meeting to the White House officials who attended \nit, that we would not seek to examine Mr. Kendall.\n\n  I believe that constitutionally we have a right to actually examine \nMr. Kendall, absolutely. If that meeting was not privileged, we have a \nright to examine him. But we said, ``Look, we want the notes. We don't \nwant to create a situation where you have this argument.'' That is why \nwe came up with \n\n[[Page S18988]]\nthis offer. Understand, this is not the White House's offer. It was our \noffer. Now, they have accepted, and they attempted to put additional \nconditions.\n  Indeed, if my House colleagues go along with this, fine. We will go \nforward. But I would only suggest if the effort was made, and the \neffort has been made and has been made by both the minority and the \nmajority on this committee for months now, and as it relates to these \nspecific notes for 3 weeks, hard bargaining, working at it, giving \nsuggestions, that that which we put forth in good faith could have been \nand should have been accepted. That is unfortunately the kind of \nsituation that we have encountered as we attempt to gather the facts \nand the information.\n  So I put it to you that I would hope that we would get these notes, \nthat we would get them without the necessity of having to go to court. \nI hope that the White House will make them available. If our brethren \nin the House agree, then that resolves it, then so be it. But I do not \nbelieve, in good conscience, I could recommend to my colleagues that we \ndelay the implementation mechanism with the caveat that the door will \nbe open.\n  It is open, even after we pass this, if we do pass this resolution, \nto go forward and seek enforcement of it. I made the commitment that I \nwould move to withdraw that enforcement action upon the proffer of the \nnotes of Mr. Kennedy. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, how much time do we have on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's side has about 12 minutes, and \nthere is 17\\1/2\\ for the other side.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, how much time does this side have \nremaining? Parliamentary inquiry, how much time is left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is approximately 17\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator form Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, just as a country lawyer who tried a few criminal \ncases over a period of 20 years--I never had a case involving attorney-\nclient privilege, so I do not profess to be an expert on it--I would \nsay based on listening to some of the scholars on some of the talk \nshows and what I have read, and I have a couple bright youngsters on my \nstaff that I have discussed it with, I would say it is probably a 50-50 \nproposition if it went to court. But I am not here really to debate \nthat.\n  The thing that is mildly perplexing to me is, I was watching the news \nthis afternoon, CNBC and CNN, and they kept saying the Senate \nWhitewater committee is seeking a subpoena to force the President to \nhand over the notes of young William Kennedy taken at this infamous \nmeeting and in the President's attorney's office.\n\n  As I understand it, that is not really the issue here. The issue here \nis whether or not we will agree to allow the President to hand over the \nnotes, which he has agreed to do and to the chairman and the members of \nhis party's side of the committee agreed to. The committee agreed to \nit. I thought it was a fine resolution of the matter. But I also think \nthat the President was entirely within his rights to say, ``I will be \nhappy to hand these notes over to you, but I do not want to waive the \nattorney-client privilege forever from now on on any other meeting.''\n  Is that a fair statement? Let me ask the Senator from Maryland, is \nthat a fair statement?\n  Mr. SARBANES. What the President said is, ``I need the same assurance \nthat the committee was going to give, because they saw it as being \nreasonable from other investigatory bodies, like the independent \ncounsel and the House committees.'' The independent counsel has agreed \nto do it. If you could get it from the House committees, then the \nPresident could turn over the notes, he would not waive the attorney-\nclient privilege, you would not have intruded into the privilege, and \nyet the notes would have been made available to the Senate committee.\n  It is a perfectly reasonable position.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. It, to me, is like the best of all worlds, I say to the \nSenator. I would have hoped that instead of getting into this all-day \ndebate in the Senate, that the chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate committee, their counterparts in the House, the independent \ncounsel--I do not know that there is any great sense of urgency about \nthese notes--and the three of them, that group sit down and agree to \nthis.\n  One additional minute.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield one additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. So all I am saying, Mr. President, is it seems it is not \na constitutional crisis. This does not reach the level of some of those \ninfamous battles of the Watergate hearings or even Iran-contra. But it \njust seems to me that in the interest of comity, in the interest of \ntaking advantage of an offer by the President to say here they are, \ntake them, but you know, let us let the House and the independent \ncounsel both say, as well as the Senate, that we are not waiving, that \nthe White House is not waiving.\n  The President is personally not waiving the attorney-client \nprivilege. I daresay there is not a Member of the U.S. Senate that \nwould have made a more generous offer under the same conditions than \nthe President of the United States has made in this case.\n  So I yield back such time as I have to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to the Senator from Arkansas that it has been \nsuggested to us by the courts, which have said, ``Each branch should \ntake cognizance of an implicit constitutional mandate to seek optimal \naccommodation through a realistic evaluation of the needs of the \nconflicting branches in the particular facts situation.''\n  In other words, if we can work out an accommodation, that is what we \nought to do, not provoke a confrontation. And, Attorney General William \nFrench Smith noted, ``The accommodation required is not simply an \nexchange of concessions, or a test of political strength, it is an \nobligation of each branch to make a principled effort to acknowledge \nand, if possible, to meet the legitimate needs of the other branch.''\n  As I say, I think, in this instance, if we work at it, we can get the \nnotes and not trespass on the attorney-client privilege. That ought to \nbe the objective.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield to the minority leader whatever time he may \nuse.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member of the \ncommittee. I appreciate having the opportunity to express myself on \nthis important matter. Today, Mr. President, is December 20. The \nholiday season is upon us, and the Senate is in session. A casual \nobserver of the events of the past few weeks --the Government \nshutdowns, the rancorous budget negotiations--might expect to find the \nSenate debating such critical issues as how we provide for our \nchildren's future and our parents' retirement, or how we protect our \nprecious natural resources while still balancing the Federal budget. \nOne might expect.\n  Sadly, we are not debating such important subjects. No, we are here \non the Senate floor debating an issue in which the American people have \nsaid repeatedly they have very little interest--Whitewater--or, more \nspecifically, the Senate inquiry into Whitewater.\n  How did we end up here? How did the Senate come to find itself \nconsidering a resolution that pushes this body toward an inevitable \nand, in my view, wholly unnecessary confrontation with the White House?\n  The answer, Mr. President, is that the Senate finds itself here by \ndesign.\n  The majority in the Senate, faced with the prospect that the \nexhaustive investigation into the Whitewater matter will produce little \nin the way of substantive results, has crafted a legal and \nconstitutional confrontation. This confrontation, the majority hopes, \nwill \n\n[[Page S18989]]\nfinally accomplish what all the Whitewater Committee hearings, \ndepositions, and subpoenas have failed to accomplish: political damage \nto the President. That is why the Senate is on the floor, on December \n20, debating a Whitewater resolution.\n  Mr. President, other Members on both sides of the aisle have laid out \nthe legal arguments surrounding this resolution. And make no mistake \nabout it, there are some difficult legal questions at issue here. We \nall recognize and accept there are good-faith differences of opinion on \nthose issues.\n  But let us be honest. If this debate were solely about the legal \nmerits of the White House's assertion of the attorney-client privilege, \nand general waivers of that privilege, then I doubt we would even be \nhaving this debate at all.\n  That, Mr. President, is precisely what is so troubling about this \nwhole matter. It is not a dispute about conflicting interpretations of \nlaw. It is not a dispute about the arcania of the attorney-client \nprivilege, or attorney-work product privileges, or any legal privileges \nat all. This is about an old-fashioned, hardball political \nconfrontation, pure and simple.\n  I am not an attorney, but let me briefly state my perspective. The \nattorney-client privilege is a basic, fundamental tenet of our legal \nsystem. The privilege reflects the long-held belief of the courts that \nconfidential communications between attorneys and their clients should \nremain confidential. Every American has the right to talk frankly to \nhis or her lawyer. Indeed, the courts, in creating this privilege, \nbelieved that the protection of the privilege would lead to a surer \nrendering of justice in our legal system. The President of the United \nStates, like every other American, is entitled to the protection of the \nlaw.\n  So this resolution represents a dangerous encroachment on a basic \nprotection in our legal system. It is also unnecessary.\n  The proponents of this resolution conveniently omit a very crucial \nfact, and that fact is that the White House has repeatedly offered to \nprovide the notes in question--the notes taken by associate White House \ncounsel William Kennedy, the notes that are the target of the special \ncommittee's subpoena.\n  Let me repeat that. The White House is willing to provide--it has \nbeen said many, many times--the documents that the committee seeks. \nThere is no question about that. All the White House asks is that the \nspecial committee assist in efforts to secure the agreement of the \nindependent counsel and the House that the White House has not waived \nits attorney-client privilege.\n  In fact, Mr. President, the White House apparently has already \nsecured the concurrence of the independent counsel that no waiver will \noccur when the notes are provided to the Senate committee. So the only \nremaining issue is the position of the House of Representatives.\n  So let us, very briefly, review the facts. The attorney-client \nprivilege is a fundamental tenet of our legal system.\n  President Clinton has legitimately asserted the privilege in this \ncase.\n  The White House has offered to provide the notes to the committee, \nprovided the attorney-client privilege is respected.\n  The Special Committee will receive the notes from the White House \nimmediately if it will only agree to this limited, reasonable \ncondition.\n  Those are the facts. That is all there is to it. It is not \ncomplicated.\n  The proponents of this resolution seem determined to seek conflict, \nwhen conciliation is within easy reach. Before we vote on this \nresolution, I think everyone should ask ourselves why that is. Why, \nwhen there is a solution at hand, should we pursue a deliberate \nstrategy of conflict?\n  Every Member of the Senate knows that a President's private legal \ninterests may, from time to time, legitimately affect the official \noperations of the office of the Presidency. In fact, I can imagine no \ngroup that might be more sensitive to how private and public interests \ncan sometimes converge than the Members of the U.S. Senate.\n  Let there be no misimpression: The precedent set in this case may \ninvolve the President of the United States, but it will affect Members \nof the U.S. Senate. We will be bound--directly--by what we decide \ntonight.\n  The pending resolution is an unnecessary, headline-seeking ploy, \ndesigned for one reason and one reason only: to damage the President \npolitically. I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwill reconsider the course they have chosen.\n  I encourage my Republican colleagues to resist the temptation to \nscore political points.\n  We have serious work to do. Let us stop wasting our time on a cynical \npolitical exercise and get on with that work. I hope that all Senators \nwill vote for the Sarbanes amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you, Mr. President. First, I want to compliment \nthe distinguished Senator from New York, Senator D'Amato, chairman of \nthis committee, because I do believe that this has been a very delicate \nset of hearings. They have lasted a long time. They have involved an \nawful lot of discovery work, trying to get to the truth. I truly \nbelieve he has conducted this committee in a very, very proper and \npropitious manner.\n  We are here tonight in one of the rare episodes and events in this \ncommittee on Whitewater's history, where we have not been able to \nagree. On most matters of importance, under the leadership of Senator \nD'Amato, with the excellent cooperation of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, most serious confrontational matters \nhave been resolved amicably and, if not directly in the manner sought \nby the majority party, at least to the satisfaction of the majority and \nthe chairman and with the cooperation of the minority. But somehow or \nanother we find ourselves tonight in a position that is different than \nany of the others.\n\n  I want to say as a practicing attorney I never had an opportunity to \ninvolve myself in the privilege that attorneys have with reference to \ntheir work product for their clients. I understand that it is a \nserious, serious thing but I also understand that this attorney-client \nprivilege, to keep confidential conversations between lawyers and their \nclients, does not really exist just because the client says so or \nbecause an attorney claims it is so. It has to meet certain tests.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the tests and why I think the \nPresident should have given this subject matter over to the committee \nin August of this year. For those who say we can resolve it here \ntonight, and that the President wants to cooperate, let me tell you \nthat this committee started trying to get this information in August of \nthis year and we are almost at Christmas. In fact, I believe it started \nAugust 25. On Christmas day--it will be the months of September, \nOctober, November, December, that is 4 months. So it has not been with \ngenuine accommodation that the President's lawyers have seen fit to \nhelp with this truth-requiring set of facts.\n  Let me say that 20-some years ago Chief Justice Burger noted that \nwhen privileges are called upon ``it is not lightly created nor \nexpansively construed for they''--that is the privileges--``are in the \nderogation of the search of truth.''\n  In other words, if you are looking for truth, you have to construe \nthis kind of privilege narrowly because it is in derogation of finding \nthe truth. It keeps the truth hidden, because there is a real reason \nfor hiding it. So it is to be construed narrowly.\n  Let me move on and tell you what I found from my reading from the \nstaff work that lawyers have put into this. Let me read you my \ndefinition of the attorney-client privilege, and I believe this is \nrather well settled. When I read through these factors--think of the \nfacts in this case. My good friend, Senator Bumpers, says this is a 50-\n50 case. I believe this is a 90-10 case, maybe a 95-5 case.\n  First of all, these are the elements: First, where legal advice of \nany kind is sought from a professional legal advisor; second, acting as \nsuch; third, the communications relating to that purpose; fourth, made \nin confidence by the client; fifth, are at the client's insistence; \nsixth, permanently protected \n\n[[Page S18990]]\nfrom disclosure by himself or the legal advisor; and seventh, unless \nwaived.\n  Now, Mr. President, and fellow Senators, while I have not been an \nintegral part of the Whitewater hearings, I am on the committee. At \nleast I am of late, and I believe it is my responsibility before I vote \ntonight, to at least discuss briefly how those qualifications and \nqualities are not met in this case.\n  First of all, the meeting was held to discuss President Clinton's \nprivate financial legal matters--but not all of the attorneys present \nat the meeting were private Clinton attorneys. Instead, three of the \nlawyers from the White House Counsel's office, and Bruce Lindsey, who \nwas White House policy advisor responsible for dealing with media \ninquiries into Whitewater, were present at the meeting with Clinton's \nprivate lawyer. Therefore, because they were public employees with no \nresponsibility for the management of the President's pre-Whitewater \naffairs, their presence precludes the claim of personal attorney-client \nprivilege by the President. Their mere presence waives it. It is no \nlonger a privileged subject matter.\n  One of the stated purposes of that meeting was to discuss pending \ninquiries into Whitewater.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes and 40 seconds.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I yield 3 minutes and 40 seconds to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me proceed as quickly as I can because I want to \ngive Senator D'Amato as much time as he can to wrap this up.\n  The President's claim of attorney-client privilege, as I see it, \nrests on very shaky legal ground, and there are other reasons that it \ndoes not fit these qualities that I have just described, and I will \nhave those printed in the Record.\n  I believe this committee has a responsibility to the people of the \nUnited States. It is not wonderful or marvelous or something we all \nthink is good, that we have to have these hearings. But we have some \nresponsibilities. When facts of the type that are before us here \npresent themselves, we have a responsibility and the Senate confirmed \nthat responsibility by the adoption of a resolution. It said ``Go find \nout the truth,'' as I understand it. The chairman has been seeking the \ntruth with reference to these various incidents and episodes. This one \nis a sad one because it centers around the office of a man who \ncommitted suicide, who had worked there, and I am not bringing up the \nsuicide to rehash it. It is difficult. What happened there is not easy \nfor us to go after, but it does mean that we should search for the \ntruth.\n  Clearly, the President owes us some explanations here, of those who \nwork for him. He owe us some explanations, some facts. It is high time \nwe get these facts, because essentially, they were made in a setting \nthat was not part of the attorney-client relationship as the common law \nin the United States defines it, and should be made available to the \ncommittee.\n  I have more observations. Mr. President, today we will hear a lot \nabout the attorney-client privilege. As an attorney, I understand the \nneed to keep confidential certain conversations between lawyers and \ntheir clients. I also understand the need for a President to consult \nwith his private attorneys on matters which occurred in his private \nlife prior to his coming to the White House.\n\n  However, in this case I believe that the President has gone too far, \nand in fact has purposefully sought to impede the special committee's \nsearch for the truth by hiding behind a tenuous claim that the \nattorney-client privilege protects the notes of a meeting between the \nPresident's private lawyers and his political advisors in the White \nHouse counsel's office.\n  Over 20 years ago, the Supreme Court examined another President's \nclaim of privilege with respect to documents sought by congressional \ninvestigators. In rejecting President Nixon's claim of executive \nprivilege, Chief Justice Burger noted that privileges, which prohibit \nthe discovery of relevant evidence, ``are not lightly created nor \nexpansively construed, for they are in derogation of the search for \ntruth.''\n  By raising what is, at best, a tenuous claim of attorney-client \nprivilege, it is clear that the President seeks at every opportunity to \nfrustrate the Whitewater Committee's search for the truth. I hope that \nwith this vote, my colleagues will agree that we should get on with the \ninvestigation and put an end to the White House's needless stall \ntactics. This investigation must begin before it can end, and this vote \nfinally will put an end to the delay and allow the dispute over the \nattorney-client privilege to be decided in a court of law.\n  Everyone recognizes that the President has a legitimate right to \nassert the attorney-client privilege under the proper circumstances. \nHowever, the facts of this case clearly indicate that the President is \nnot entitled to assert the privilege.\n  The elements of the attorney-client privilege are well-settled: Where \nlegal advice of any kind is sought from a professional legal advisor \nacting as such; the communications relating to that purpose made in \nconfidence by the client; are at the client's insistence permanently \nprotected from disclosure by himself or the legal advisor unless the \nprotection is waived.\n  The notes of the November 1993 meeting at the office of President \nClinton's private attorneys are not protected by the privilege for at \nleast three reasons:\n  First, the meeting was held to discuss President Clinton's private \nfinancial and legal matters, but not all of the attorneys present at \nthe meeting were private Clinton attorneys. Instead, three lawyers from \nthe White House Counsel's office and Bruce Lindsey, who was White House \nPolicy Advisor responsible for dealing with media inquiries into \nWhitewater, were present at the meeting with Clinton's private lawyers.\n  Because they were public employees with no responsibility for the \nmanagement of the President's pre-White House affairs, their presence \nprecludes any claim of the personal attorney-client privilege by the \nPresident.\n  Second, one of the stated purposes of the November meeting was to \ndiscuss the pending press inquiries into Whitewater. At the time of the \nmeeting, the media began to question the White House about allegations \nof improper handling of SBA loan funds by the President and Jim \nMcDougal and about the pending RTC criminal referral on Madison \nGuaranty. Clinton's private attorneys convened with White House \nadvisors to discuss how to respond to these media inquiries.\n  In order to gain the protection of the attorney-client privilege, \nconfidential communications must relate to legal advice. The privilege \ngoverns performance of duties by the attorney as legal counselor, and \nif chooses to undertake other duties on behalf of his client that \ncannot be characterized as legal, then the communications related to \nthose additional duties are not protected. In this case, his attorneys \nmet to discuss media and political strategy. These activities clearly \nare not legal in nature, and thus the notes should not be protected.\n  Third, President Clinton waived the attorney-client privilege by \nallowing Bruce Lindsey, who was neither his private attorney nor a \nmember of the White House Counsel's office, to attend the meeting. At \nthe time of the meeting, Bruce Lindsey was White House Policy Advisor \nand a spokesman for the Administration. He advised the President on \nmedia and public relations matters, and was specifically tasked to \nhandle Whitewater press inquiries.\n  The law implies a waiver of the attorney-client privilege whenever \nthe holder of the privilege voluntarily allows to be disclosed any \nsignificant part of a confidential communication to one with whom the \nholder does not have a privileged relationship. Since Bruce Lindsey was \nneither a White House attorney nor a private attorney, he enjoyed no \nattorney-client privilege with the President. The fact that the \nPresident allowed him to attend the meeting waives the attorney-client \nprivilege with respect to matters discussed at the meeting.\n  The President's claim of attorney-client privilege rests on very \nshaky legal ground. With that in mind, I think that if my colleagues \nexamine the White House's behavior concerning these notes, coupled with \nthat of Mr. Kennedy and his private attorney, they should conclude that \nthe only reason that the White House has raised this \n\n[[Page S18991]]\nissue is because the President seeks to delay for as long as possible \nthe legitimate fact-finding responsibility of the committee. Up until \nthis point, the committee's work largely has been bi-partisan, but the \nWhite House's stonewalling has caused our work to become highly \npoliticized. This is unfortunate.\n  The special committee has sought Mr. Kennedy's notes through \nreasonable means for quite some time, and only recently has the \nPresident chosen to assert the attorney-client privilege to frustrate \nour efforts to obtain them. I understand that the counsel for the \nspecial committee asked the White House for these notes several months \nago, and that the request went unanswered until only recently, when the \nWhite House refused to make them available.\n  Because we were unable to obtain the notes from the White House, the \ncommittee then was forced to call Mr. Kennedy to testify about the \nmeeting. While before the committee, he asserted that he would refuse \nto produce the documents because his client, the President, had \nasserted certain privileges, including the attorney-client privilege.\n  Upon Mr. Kennedy's assertion of privilege, the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator D'Amato, agreed to allow the parties to submit legal \nbriefs on the issue. After rejecting the arguments of counsel on \nattorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine, the committee \nvoted to compel, Mr. Kennedy to produce the documents. It then served a \nsubpoena on Mr. Kennedy's attorney, who had accompanied him to his \nappearance before the Committee when the issue of the attorney-client \nprivilege arose.\n  Upon being served, Mr. Kennedy's attorney informed the committee that \nhe ``was not authorized'' to receive the subpoena. This despite the \nfact that he sat with Mr. Kennedy during his testimony and previously \nhad received correspondence from the committee on Mr. Kennedy's behalf. \nBecause of this additional unnecessary delay, the committee was forced \nto reconvene and reissue the subpoena to Mr. Kennedy personally.\n  One they realized that the committee did not intend to abandon its \nrequest for Mr. Kennedy's notes, the White House tried another delay \ntactic: they sent up an ``offer'' to the committee to release the \nnotes, subject to certain conditions. In fact, the White House offered \nfive conditions before they would turn over the notes. Two of these \nconditions were agreed to previously by the Republican counsel for the \nspecial committee.\n  The other three were essentially nonoffers. The conditions were so \nvague and imprudent that the White House must have known that we would \nnot agree to them. One condition required the committee to obtain from \nthe independent counsel and other congressional investigatory bodies an \nagreement to abide by the terms of the White House's offer to the \nspecial committee. Imagine that: the White House asked the Senate \nWhitewater Committee to interfere with the independent counsel's \ninvestigation of this matter. Is this not precisely what the White \nHouse said we should not do when the independent counsel originally \nundertook his investigation? Clearly all of this was done just for the \npurpose of delay.\n  Throughout this entire matter, however, the White House has claimed \nto the press that the notes contain nothing to implicate the White \nHouse in any wrongdoing and that the special committee is engaged in a \nwild goose chase. Other White House aides have claimed to the media \nthat they have nothing to hide and that Chairman D'Amato and the \nSpecial Committee are undertaking a political fishing expedition.\n  They claim to have nothing to hide, yet they fight the committee at \nevery turn. This policy of stonewalling while claiming that the \ninvestigation is politically motivated sounds an awful lot like the \ntactics employed by the President 20 years ago in response to another \ncongressional investigation. In fact, here is what Charles Colson, one \nof President Nixon's advisors said about the way the Clinton White \nHouse is handling this investigation: ``I can't believe my eyes and \near. These people are repeating our mistakes.''\n  Not only are former advisors to President Nixon amazed by the way the \nWhite House has handled this investigation--the New York Times \neditorial page yesterday also questioned the President's tactics. In \nits editorial, the Times noted that the White House's invocation of the \nattorney-client and executive privilege was ``a distortion of the \ndoctrine's history to raise it to block a legitimate congressional \ninquiry into the Clinton's Arkansas financial dealings and the official \nconduct of senior administration aides.'' The Times goes on to \nacknowledge that absent a ``decent resolution, the Senate has no choice \nbut to go to court to enforce the Committee's subpoena.\n  Mr. President, I too, think that we have no choice at this point but \nto go to court. It is unfortunate that President Clinton and his \nadvisors have chosen to delay and ridicule the committee's efforts in \nthe press. The time has come to get on with the business of the \nWhitewater Committee, and to do so again in a less political manner. \nAllowing a court to decide this issue is the only way to achieve those \ngoals.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, I intend to offer a more lengthy \nstatement, but I was tied up on other matters. I want to offer a \ndimension on the attorney-client privilege that I think is helpful for \nour colleagues to be aware.\n  The question of attorney-client privilege has arisen on a number of \noccasions recently and I just share an experience of how it was handled \nin a bipartisan, and I think a most responsible fashion.\n  My colleagues are much aware in the recently concluded Packwood \nmatter there was the issue of a diary. Aside from that, during the \ncourse of our investigation, a number of times arose in which a \nquestion of attorney-client privilege was asserted. First let me say, \non a bipartisan basis with every member of the Ethics Committee in \nconcurrence, we agreed with respect to those assertions of privilege, \nthat we ought to subject those to an independent outside nonpartisan \nreview.\n  In that context, by coincidence, in light of the role that this was \nlater to play, I engaged the services of Ken Starr, and he \nindependently reviewed and the committee accepted his recommendations \nin each and every case. Not only were there questions of conversation \nbut there were also questions of documents.\n  In a similar vein to the concern that the President of the United \nStates has legitimately voiced today, Senator Packwood's counsel was \nunderstandably concerned that if any particular document was released, \nthat that may be deemed a waiver with respect to other documents that \nwere covered under the attorney-client privilege.\n  Let me say in that context, once again, the committee agreed in \nbipartisan fashion not to assert that the privilege has been waived \nwith respect to any subsequent conversation or any subsequent document \nwhich might come to the attention of the Ethics Committee that would be \narguably a predicate for arguing that a prior submission of a document \nconstituted a waiver.\n  That is the bipartisan way of doing it. The President faces a \nHobson's choice. In one instance he has come forward and indicated he \nwants to make the contents of those notes available--no ifs, ands or \nbuts. The problem that he faces in doing so without getting the signoff \nby others who would have jurisdictional basis to proceed, is that the \nwaiver doctrine might be asserted against him.\n  I think what my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, has done by way of the \namendment that he has offered here today provides a responsible way for \nus to achieve what we ought to be interested in: That is, the contents \nof the document. Yet we respect and recognize the attorney-client \nrelationship.\n  Madam President, as a member of the Banking Committee I oppose this \nresolution, and I am very disappointed that the Republican members of \nthe committee are taking this step. I believe it is premature and \ncounterproductive and totally partisan.\n  The heart of this issue revolves around notes taken by Associate \nWhite \n\n[[Page S18992]]\nHouse Counsel William Kennedy at a meeting held on November 5, 1993. \nNotes that have already been offered to the Banking Committee.\n  This meeting raises several legitimate and serious attorney-client \nprivilege issues that must be resolved before the Senate charges ahead \ninto these unchartered waters. We may be setting precedents here today \nthat have far reaching implications.\n  For those truly interested in knowing the content of Mr. Kennedy's \nnotes, and in a timely manner, this resolution will only retard any \nefforts to secure those notes which have already been offered to the \ncommittee. Only through good faith negotiations will we be able to \naccomplish the goal of securing the notes and protecting legitimate \nprivilege issues at the same time.\n  The Supreme Court has stated that the Attorney-client privilege ``is \nthe oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to \nthe common law.''\n  The purposes of the privilege are to encourage full and frank \ncommunication between attorneys and their clients and to protect not \nonly the giving of professional advice to those who can act on it but \nalso the giving of information to the lawyer to enable him to give \nsound and informed advice.\n  The privilege applies with equal force among a client's attorneys, \nwhether or not the client is present during the conversation. It is \nwell-settled that the attorney-client privilege extends to written \nmaterial reflecting the substance of an attorney-client communication.\n  Every person at the November 5, 1993 meeting was an attorney who \nrepresented the Clintons in either their personal or their official \ncapacities. As an attorney myself and a former attorney general, I \nstrongly believe this meeting was fully covered by the attorney-client \nprivilege.\n  I dare say any citizen of this country who was told he could not have \na confidential communication with his attorney would be outraged.\n  This is a crucial point: This all could be avoided if the Senate \nwould take the same position that Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr took \njust yesterday when he agreed that the release of the document did not \nconstitute a waiver of the President's privileges.\n  How foolish the Senate looks today--wasting our time and resources--\nwhen this could be so easily resolved.\n  Any independent observer must be drawn to the conclusion that the \nreason we are forcing this issue is an attempt to embarrass the \nPresident. Why else would we not take the same approach that the \nindependent prosecutor has taken?\n  If the President were to turn over these documents without an \nagreement on the privileges, what would be the consequences?\n  Clearly what we have here is an attempt by the majority to put the \nPresident in a catch-22 situation. If he releases the document without \nfirst securing an agreement, he could be waiving his attorney-client \nprivileges with his attorney David Kendall on all Whitewater related \nmatters. If he exercises his legitimate privileges, he is accused of a \ncoverup.\n  The courts will prove the President is taking the legally appropriate \nstep in exercising his attorney-client privilege on this meeting. But \nwe all know he will suffer from a public perception that he is hiding \nsomething. That is why the majority is forcing this issue today.\n  It is clear how this issue should be handled if scoring political \npoints were not the main goal here.\n  The Senate's most recent experience with the attorney-client \nprivilege claim arose during the Ethics Committee proceedings against \nSenator Bob Packwood.\n  Apart from the diary dispute, the Ethics Committee had an assertion \nby Senator Packwood that certain other documents were covered by the \nattorney-client or work-product privileges. To resolve that claim, as \nChairman of the Ethics Committee, I asked Kenneth Starr to make \nrecommendations to the committee and both parties agreed in advance to \naccept his recommendations.\n  With respect to the diaries, the committee agreed ``to protect \nSenator Packwood's privacy concerns by allowing him to mask information \ndealing with attorney-client and physician-patient privileged matters, \nand information dealing with personal, private, and family matters.\n  Kenneth Starr reviewed Senator Packwood's assertions of attorney-\nclient privilege. The committee abided by all of Mr. Starr's \ndeterminations and did not call upon the court to adjudicate any of the \nattorney-client privilege claims.\n  In addition, the Ethics Committee on other occasions agreed with \nSenator Packwood's attorney upfront that to provide documents did not \nwaive the attorney-client privilege. Let me read from one of the \ndocuments we released. This is a conversation between Mr. Muse, one of \nthe Senator's attorneys, and Victor Baird, chief counsel for the Ethics \nCommittee.\n\n       Mr. Muse. Victor, what I don't want to do is get on a \n     slippery slope with regard to waiver of any of the issues you \n     and I have talked about, and with reference to your letter of \n     January 31 on the other hand, there is a date that can be \n     fixed based on the memorandum which attaches diary entries, \n     and I'm prepared to give you that, and identify and show it \n     to Mr. Sacks as a representative of Arnold and Porter, \n     provided it is understood there is no waiver. It would simply \n     reorient them to something they already know that they \n     received, if that's acceptable to you.\n       Mr. Baird. Right. And we understand that by your sharing \n     the memo with them, and their being able to provide us with \n     the dating information that we want if you will, that it is \n     not going to waive the privilege so that we are entitled to \n     look at the memo or anything like that.\n       Mr. Muse. All right.\n\n  This is clearly a better precedent for us to follow if we want to act \nin a bipartisan, professional manner. If all we are doing is scoring \npolitical points, we should proceed on the path we are heading toward \ntoday.\n  The administration has asked the committee to agree that turning over \nthe notes does not waive attorney-client privilege. The independent \nprosecutor has already agreed and can now proceed with his \ninvestigation, getting the material we are seeking without a lengthy \nand costly court fight.\n  Why cannot this committee and this Senate accept Judge Starr's \njudgment and follow the same course. That is what the Ethics Committee \ndid and in a bipartisan unanimous manner.\n  Which brings up another question. If there is a respected former \njudge who has been given an almost unlimited budget and staff of highly \ntrained attorneys and investigators, doing a thorough investigation of \nthis issue, what is the purpose of this Senate Whitewater \ninvestigation?\n  The Senate will spend millions on this. We do not have the capability \nor resources as does Judge Starr. It is taking countless hours of \nSenate time when we have a government shutdown, and important \nlegislation like welfare reform, that is more properly our focus.\n  The administration has asked the Banking Committee to agree that to \ngive us the Kennedy notes does not waive the attorney-client privilege. \nThe independent prosecutor has already agreed and can now proceed with \nhis investigation.\n  The Senate should do the same. Put this resolution aside today. And \nlet the Senate operate in a more professional, noncombative, and \nbipartisan approach. This debate is an extraordinary waste of time.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes and 19 seconds.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I have 3 minutes and 19 seconds?\n  Madam President, why are we here? December 20, getting close, maybe a \nday or two, during this holiday time? Great events, budget pressures, \nGovernment technically shut down in some areas? It has been suggested--\npolitics, injure the President.\n  Madam President, if one were to examine the facts, the facts will put \nthat contention to rest. It is unfair. That is unfair.\n  On August 25, 4 months ago, we requested this information. Let me \ntell you when we got what I considered to be the first really bona fide \nreply to our offer to say, ``You do not waive the lawyer-client \nrelationship.'' That was us. We did that, the committee. We did not \nhave to. We said, ``You do not have to waive it.'' We did not get a \nreply--and then here is the reply, and it was a conditioned acceptance \nwith all kinds of conditions: No. 1, that we had to \n\n[[Page S18993]]\nconcede that the meeting was privileged. We do not. The White House \ncould not even accept our proposal, the one that they are now \nattempting to get the House to accept, until 6 days ago.\n  So why are we here now? Because, without us pushing forward, we would \nnot have even had a conditional acceptance of our proposal. We would \nnot have even had it. Six days ago was the first time. When did they \nfinally accept our proposal that they are now trying to push through? \nTwo days ago. So, when someone says, ``Why are you here December 20,'' \nit is because the White House has stonewalled us--stonewalled. The \nAmerican people have a right to know. President Clinton made promises. \nHe said, ``I will not raise privilege, I will not hide behind that.'' \nAnd he has broken those promises.\n  The Senate has a right to know and we have a right to be dealt with \nin good faith. I do not lay this over to my colleagues on the other \nside. They have attempted to work together to get this information. But \nit is the White House.\n  Madam President, those notes simply are not privileged. The people \nwho took those notes were Government employees. Mr. Lindsey was not \nworking in the White House counsel's office. Yet, notwithstanding that, \nwe are still willing to say, fine, we will not say that any privilege \nthat you might have would be waived. Give us the notes.\n  I make an offer here, and I repeat it again. Mr. President, give us \nthe notes. We will continue--even after we vote, I am willing to drop \nthis matter, regardless of what the House does. We do not have to go \nand test this out. But keep your commitment to the people of this \ncountry. Keep your commitment. We should not be here. You, Mr. \nPresident, have created this problem that necessitates us going forth.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is there time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 1 minute, 45 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, the White House has tried very hard, I \nthink, to provide information to the committee. This particular issue \narose in November. The White House made several offers. The first was \nturned down. Then the White House said, look, we will give you the \nnotes. We will provide these notes, but we want to be protected against \nthe assertion that there has been a general waiver of the lawyer-client \nrelationship--an eminently reasonable position.\n\n  This committee recognized it as being reasonable because we agreed \nthat the providing of the notes would not constitute a general waiver. \nThe independent counsel has agreed to that.\n  All that is left are the House committees, and I, for the life of me, \ncannot understand why they would not agree to it as well. So there is \nno need to press this matter to a constitutional confrontation between \nthe Congress and the Executive. A procedure has been worked out. The \ncommittee, this committee, has recognized it. The independent counsel \nhas recognized it. The House committees now need to recognize it, and \nthen the notes can be produced.\n  The White House has said as much in a letter to Chairman D'Amato \ntoday, that they would produce the notes immediately, once that was \nachieved.\n  It is my own view that we should be working to achieve it. I am frank \nto say I think we should be part of a constructive effort to bring that \nsolution about, and that is what this amendment would commit us to do.\n  I urge its support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nNo. 3041, offered by the Senator from Maryland.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Madam President, I am pleased that an agreement has \nbeen reached to enable S. 1340 to pass the Senate. I have worked \nclosely with Majority Leader Dole and Minority Leader Daschle on this \nissue that is vitally important to livestock producers in South Dakota \nand the Nation.\n  This issue has been a troubling one for producers in South Dakota for \nmore than a year now. Frankly, I still say that the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture can take immediate action today and not have to wait for \nthis legislation to become law.\n  Yesterday, I called Secretary Glickman to discuss this with him. He \ntold me he was watching Senate action on this issue and would appoint a \nCommission.\n  Madam President, now is the time to act. Twice before I have urged \nthe Secretary to take this action. I ask unanimous consent that two \nletters on this subject be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. \n  \n[[Page S18995]]\n\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. This past August I chaired a field hearing of the \nSenate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee in my home state \nof South Dakota. It was the first time that a Commerce Committee \nhearing had been held in South Dakota and the turnout was tremendous.\n  Hundreds of people attended the hearing and witness after witness \nclearly demonstrated the importance of this issue and the need for \naction is needed because extremely low prices for fed cattle and calves \ndeeply hurt South Dakota ranchers. Further, the impact of this will be \nfelt beyond our ranches. It affects our rural communities, as well as \nlarger towns and cities. With ranchers having fewer dollars to spend, \nsmall businesses in our small towns could be put in jeopardy.\n  What is of great concern to producers is the fact that while cattle \nprices are nearing, or at record lows, retail prices have not shown any \nsignificant drop.\n  This represents a combination punch to South Dakota ranchers --as \nproducers, they are getting fewer dollars for their livestock; yet, as \nconsumers, ranchers--armed with fewer dollars--are forced to pay more \nto put their own product on the dinner table.\n  To say this is a concern of my fellow South Dakotans is a gross \nunderstatement. Thousands of South Dakotans have written, called, or \nvisited with me on this. They rightly are concerned about the impact of \nthe current situation on their ability to run their farms and \nbusinesses and provide for their families.\n  I would like to commend the South Dakota Secretary of Agriculture, \nDean Anderson, for being a national leader on this issue. Dean was \nresponsible for bringing this matter before the National Association of \nState Departments of Agriculture who have called for an investigation \nthat we are asking for in this bill. I am proud of Secretary Anderson's \nleadership on this matter.\n  In summary, I am pleased the Senate is taking action in support of \nSouth Dakota ranchers. However, this action could get delayed in the \nother body. Therefore, I ask once again that Secretary Glickman \nimmediately appoint a Commission on this subject. Either way, I will \nnot rest until this Government finally addresses this disturbing \nproblem facing our livestock producers.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 17, 1995.\n     Hon. Dan Glickman,\n     Secretary, Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I am writing you to ask you to appoint \n     a commission to make recommendations on action needed to \n     assure competitive markets in the livestock industry.\n       As you well know Mr. Secretary, for some time now there has \n     been great concern among livestock producers about packer \n     concentration in the marketing of livestock. In 1992, \n     Congress appropriated $500,000 for the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture to issue a report on this very subject. That \n     report is due shortly. However, that report only contains \n     data through 1993. Since 1993, retail price spreads and the \n     prices that producers have received for their livestock do \n     not even compare with the 1992 or 1993 numbers.\n       The Congress continues to be concerned on this subject. In \n     August, the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation \n     Committee held a field hearing in Huron, South Dakota, on \n     this matter. The high attendance and strong concern by South \n     Dakota ranchers was overwhelming and universal. Previously, I \n     requested that you appoint an independent counsel to \n     recommend an action plan to remedy problems livestock \n     producers are experiencing due to captive supplies by \n     livestock packers. Legislation is expected to be introduced \n     shortly to establish a Presidential Commission on this \n     matter.\n       Mr. Secretary, you have the authority to establish a \n     commission immediately and begin to find solutions to this \n     problem. You do not need to wait for legislation. An \n     independent review would ensure a completely unbiased report \n     for an appropriate action plan.\n       I urge your prompt attention to this request and look \n     forward to working with you to resolve this problem.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry Pressler,\n     United States Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 22, 1995.\n     Hon. Dan Glickman,\n     Swecretary, Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I ask that you appoint an independent \n     counsel to recommend an action plan to remedy problems \n     livestock producers are experiencing due to captive supplies \n     by livestock packers. I also ask that the counsel's report be \n     made simultaneously with USDA's report on captive supplies \n     that is expected in December.\n       As you know, I recently held a U.S. Senate Commerce, \n     Science and Transportation Committee field hearing on captive \n     supplies, controlled markets and impacts on consumers and \n     producers. There was a large turnout for this hearing. \n     Collectively, the witnesses clearly articulated the need for \n     federal action on this issue. With livestock prices near \n     record lows, consumers are not seeing the price of meat go \n     down at the grocery store as the market should dictate. \n     Something must be done soon.\n       Several things were learned at the hearing. The hearing \n     record will show widespread concern that something needs to \n     be done to ensure fair and competitive pricing in the \n     livestock industry. One troubling fact was discovered at the \n     hearing. It was learned that the data in the captive supply \n     report USDA is expected to release in December only covers \n     the years 1992 and 1993. As you know, the current cattle \n     prices are near record lows, while in 1992 cattle prices were \n     near record highs.\n       I believe an independent counsel could review existing \n     data, including the report you expect to release this \n     December. As you know, federal officials have been studying \n     this issue since 1992, while concentration in the packing \n     industry has grown during this time. An independent counsel \n     would be able to review studies and documents of USDA, \n     Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and quickly review \n     current market conditions. An independent review would ensure \n     a completely unbiased report on an appropriate action plan. \n     We do not need to wait for months after USDA issues its \n     report to determine the best course of action. An independent \n     counsel could take care of that and help resolve this issue. \n     Now is the time to act. We don't need any more reports.\n       Mr. Secretary, many cattlemen in South Dakota may not make \n     it this year unless the pricing problem is corrected. The \n     current retail price spread cannot be explained or justified \n     with ranchers receiving such low prices for their cattle. I \n     share the cattlemens' concerns over possible market \n     manipulation.\n       I urge your prompt attention to this request, and look \n     forward to working with you to resolve this problem.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry Pressler,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Thank you, Madam President. I rise today in support of S. \n1340, a bill to provide for a commission to study the concentration of \npackers in the United States. I am very pleased to be a cosponsor of \nthis legislation. It is my hope that the Senate will pass this bill \nwithout prolonged debate, so that the livestock producers of this \ncountry will have a few answers to the questions they have about the \npackers.\n  This bill will provide the hardworking men and women who work on the \nland raising livestock to have an insight into what is occurring in the \nmarket today. The producers in this country have, recently, seen \nextremely low prices for their livestock. This is related to several \ndifferent trends in the market. Among these trends is the low number of \npacking houses left in the country. This concentration of packing \nhouses places a burden on the producer to sell his or her livestock to \na select location close to their operation. In my State of Montana, \nthis is a very real burden, since we no longer have a packing house in \nour State.\n  Another of the concerns that the producers have center around the \nnumber of live cattle that the packers own at this time. The terms of \ncontracts let on these cattle are not widely known and those that are \nknown are extremely confusing to all involved. These contracts have \nplaced many of the smaller producers in the peril. The small operation \nin the country that may run less than a hundred head of cattle feel the \npinch the packers have put on them through the major operations in the \nMidwest.\n  The most easily measured and common aspect of the concentration of \npacking houses, relates to the consumer cost of meat. Recently I was in \na local grocery store, and noticed the cost of a pound of hamburger and \nwas astounded. My astonishment came from the fact that I had just \nreturned from Montana, where I had witnessed the price being paid for \nlive cattle at the sale ring. The difference in the price per pound for \nlive cattle compared to the price we must pay for the final product is \nway beyond the lines of reason. And $20 cows do not draw the price of \n$5-a-pound steak. Where is the responsibility to the producers of the \nlivestock in this country?\n  Madam President, it is my hope that this measure will pass today and \nthat the President will quickly sign and nominate the members of the \nstudy \n\n[[Page S18996]]\ncommission. The time has come that we need to find out the \ndiscrepancies in the pricing system for our meat, today. Thank you and \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank my colleague from Minnesota.

Madam President, on Monday, December 18, my good friend \nfrom New York, Senator D'Amato and I, sent a letter to Secretary of \nState Warren Christopher, urging the Clinton Administration to \nreconsider its decision to sell 120 Army tactical missile systems \n[ATACMs] to the government of Turkey.\n  I was troubled to learn last night that the Clinton Administration \nintends to proceed with the sale. This transfer is ill-advised, to say \nthe least. I strongly urge the Administration to reconsider its \ndecision or at the very least, place clear, indisputable restrictions \non deployment and use of these weapons.\n  This transfer does not make sense. Generally, it is disturbing \nbecause the Turkish government has used U.S. and NATO military \nequipment repeatedly in the past to advance policy and military \nobjectives that are clearly not in our best interests.\n  As all of us are well aware, the Turkish government in 1974 used NATO \nmilitary equipment when it invaded the island of Cyprus. More than two \ndecades later, Cyprus remains divided, with one side subjected to an \noccupation force of 35,000 Turkish troops. I have held a great interest \nin resolving the Cyprus dispute. This is a matter of strong, bipartisan \ninterest. The Clinton Administration has stated that it intends to make \na serious effort to reunite Cyprus. Frankly, I cannot see how the \nproposed missile sale helps our nation achieve this goal. I believe the \nopposite is true, and that is very unfortunate.\n  I also am concerned about American made military equipment being used \nto prolong the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. It has been \ndocumented that Turkey has transferred U.S. and NATO military hardware \nto the Azeris, who have made use of this equipment against civilian \npopulations in the besieged Nagorno-Karabagh region. It is my \nunderstanding that it is contrary to U.S. policy for a buyer of U.S.-\nmade military equipment to transfer such equipment to a third party. \nWhat assurances do we have from Turkey that it intends to abide by this \npolicy?\n  Finally, I am concerned that this missile sale could serve to prolong \ncontinued violence between the Turkish Army and the Kurds. For more \nthan a decade the Turkish government has waged a brutal war against the \nKurdish people. Human rights watch [HRW] estimated that the conflict \nhas resulted in the death of 19,000 Kurds, including 2,000 civilians, \nand the destruction of 2,000 villages. More than 2 million Kurds have \nbeen forced from their homes.\n  HRW also reported that in 29 incidents from 1992 and 1995, the \nTurkish Army used U.S.-supplied fighter-bombers and helicopters to \nattack civilian villages and other targets. Further, U.S. and NATO-\nsupplied small arms and armored personnel carriers have been used in a \ncounter-insurgency campaign against thousands of Kurdish villages.\n  Clearly, these instances stretching over a period of more than two \ndecades are contrary to our nation's interests as well as our own moral \nsensibility. In the face of this evidence, the President now wishes to \nsupply the Turkish Army with 120 ATACMs. What exactly are ATACMs? \nBasically, the U.S. Army handbook describes the ATACM as a conventional \nsurface-to-surface ballistic missile launched from a M270 launcher. \nEach missile has a warhead that carries a combined payload of 950 small \ncluster bomblets, which can spray shrapnel over a large area.\n  The practical use of an ATACM does not leave much to the imagination. \nThis kind of missile can be used to disable numerous human and material \ntargets at once and very quickly. Kurdish villages and organized teams \nof Kurdish dissidents easily could be targets for ballistic missile \nattack. This would be a terrible tragedy.\n  The Administration has argued that these missiles are a necessary \ndeterrent against two potential aggressors along Turkey's borders--Iran \nand Iraq. I believe these missiles are far from necessary. Consider the \nfollowing: Turkey is an ally of the United States. It is a member of \nNATO. The Turkish military's Incrylik air base is a launching point for \nour enforcement of the no-fly zone over Northern Iraq. And Turkey will \nparticipate in the enforcement of the Dayton peace accord in Bosnia. I \nwould think that the strategic importance of Turkey to the United \nStates and Europe is enough to deter any foolish military action by \neither Iran or Iraq. If our nation can mobilize the world to expel Iraq \nfrom the tiny nation of Kuwait, imagine our response if Iraq or Iran \neven made a hostile gesture toward Turkey. Clearly, the \nAdministration's ``deterrent\" argument to justify the missile sale is \nhollow at best.\n  Indeed, I can find no credible political, economic or strategic cause \nthat is furthered by the sale of the ATACMs to Turkey.\n  Madam President, just last month, Congress took a strong stand \nagainst Turkish aggression in the region by voting to cap US economic \nsupport funds for Turkey. This is an important step. My friend from New \nYork, Senator D'Amato, and I are sponsors of legislation that would \ntake even tougher action. It is my hope that we in Congress can all \nagree that there must be an added price for US economic and military \nassistance to our allies, particularly our NATO allies, and that price \nis morally responsible use of U.S. assistance. I do not see how the \nAdministration's missile sale fits even that basic standard. \n\n[[Page S18997]]\n\n  We have seen a number of different initiatives designed to bring \npeace to troubled regions, such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, Northern \nIreland, Cyprus, and the Middle East. However, the Administration needs \nto demonstrate our nation's strong interest in bringing the violence in \nKurdistan and Nagorno-Karabagh to an end. The sale of 120 ATACMs moves \nour nation in the wrong direction and could further fuel the war and \ndestruction in both regions.\n  Though the Administration has announced it intends to pursue the \nsale, I make one last plea to urge it to reconsider its decision. If \nthe Administration intends to complete the sale, I would urge at the \nvery least that it impose a few basic conditions. In short, if these \nmissiles are for national self-defense, the sale should be conditioned \nsolely for that purpose. More to the point, the missiles should not be \nplaced so as to pose a threat to the people of Greece and Cyprus. \nFurther, the Turkish government should promise that none of the \nmissiles be transferred to Azerbaijan. And finally, the missiles should \nnot be used to prolong the violence in Kurdistan. The Clinton \nAdministration at the very least should insist on these conditions at \nthe very least. The Clinton Administration also should make clear that \nfailure to abide by these conditions could undermine future economic \nand military assistance.\n  Again I believe this sale to be bad policy. It is a mistake. However, \nif the Administration intends to pursue this sale, it should at the \nvery least make clear that this nation insists on this equipment being \nstrictly limited to self-defense. If we are going to be forced swallow \nthis very bitter bill, the Administration should try to make it less \nbitter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the letter to Secretary \nChristopher be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 18, 1995.\n     Hon. Warren M. Christopher,\n     Secretary of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: We are writing to express our strong \n     opposition to the Clinton Administration's proposed sale of \n     120 army tactical surface-to-surface missiles (ATACMS) to \n     Turkey.\n       As you well know, for more than a decade the Turkish \n     government has waged a brutal war against the Kurdish people. \n     According to recent data from Human Rights Watch (HRW), the \n     conflict has resulted in 19,000 military and civilian dead, \n     2,000 villages destroyed and more than 2 million being forced \n     from their homes.\n       What concerns us deeply is the use of American-made \n     military equipment to commit these atrocities and to prolong \n     the war against the Kurdish people. Specifically, it has been \n     reported that in 29 incidents from 1992 and 1995, the Turkish \n     Army has used U.S.-supplied fighter-bombers and helicopters \n     to attack and fire against civilian villages and targets. \n     Further, U.S. and NATO-supplied small arms and armored \n     personnel carriers have been used in a counter-insurgency \n     campaign against thousands of Kurdish villages.\n       The Kurds are not the only ones to have been subjected to \n     attack with U.S. or NATO equipment from Turkey. Indeed, the \n     record of the last twenty years is disturbing. Most notably, \n     the Turkish military used NATO military hardware when it \n     invaded and occupied the now-divided island of Cyprus. \n     Further, Turkey has transferred US and NATO weapons to \n     Azerbaijan, where they have been used against civilian \n     Armenians residing in Nagorno-Karabagh.\n       In the face of this history, the President now wishes to \n     supply the Turkish Army with 120 ATACMS, each of which is \n     capable of carrying a warhead payload of 950 small cluster \n     bombs. With these weapons, the Turkish Army has the \n     capability to launch a horrendous ballistic missile attack on \n     the Kurdish people. The results would be equally disturbing \n     if any of these missiles ended up in the hands of the Azeris, \n     or were deployed within range of either Cyprus or Greece.\n       Mr. Secretary, the Clinton Administration has taken a great \n     interest in achieving peace in troubled regions, such as \n     Bosnia-Herzegovina, Northern Ireland, Cyprus, and the Middle \n     East. However, the Administration needs to demonstrate our \n     nation's strong interest in bringing the violence in \n     Kurdistan and Nagorno-Karabagh to an end. By arming Turkey \n     with 120 ATACMS, we would send the opposite message and \n     further fuel destruction in both regions.\n       The time has come for the United States to take a stand for \n     peace throughout the entire Middle East. For that reason, we \n     urge the Clinton Administration to reconsider its proposed \n     sale of tactical surface-to-surface missiles to Turkey.\n       Thank you for your attention to this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Larry Pressler.\n     Alfonse M. D'Amato.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/20/senate-section/article/S18996-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Madam President, over 3 years ago, in September 1992, \nteacher Susan Ross of Yorktown High School in Yorktown Heights, NY, \ncontacted my office to inform me of a wonderful new project which she \nhad recently developed for her ninth grade students. She had just \norganized a cultural exchange program between her students and the \nstudents of Monroe County High School in Monroeville, AL. As part of \nthe program, she wanted to get my recollections of what is was like \ngrowing up in Alabama and in the South.\n  Yorktown Heights is located about a half-hour's drive from New York \nCity in a rural area surrounded by farming towns. Monroeville is the \nhometown of writer Harper Lee and was the model for the fictional town \nof Macomb in her Pulitzer Prize winning novel ``To Kill a \nMockingbird.'' The courthouse in Monroeville actually served as part of \nthe set for the Academy Award-winning film version.\n  This classic novel, which Ms. Ross has taught her classes off and on \nfor 26 years, proved to be the catalyst for her program. One year, \nwhile reviewing the books that she would use in her class for the \nupcoming school term, she realized, in her words: ``I was teaching a \nbook about a culture I knew nothing about, and I was possibly doing a \ndisservice to it. To understand the issue from the character's point of \nview, you need to go to the source, so I did.''\n  Going to the source meant first approaching her counterparts in \nMonroeville. First, she contacted Monroe County High School Principal \nPat \n\n[[Page S18998]]\nPatterson, who put her in touch with Paralee Broughton, a 9th and 10th \ngrade teacher at the high school. Ms. Broughton told Susan that since \n``To Kill a Mockingbird'' would serve as the central link between the \ntwo schools, she should get in touch with Mrs. Sarah Dyess, whose \neighth-grade students were reading the book.\n  With the help of Ms. Broughton, Mrs. Dyess, and other teachers, \neducators, and administrators in Monroeville, Ms. Ross established a \ntruly unique and stimulating cultural exchange program which she hoped \nwould teach respect for each other's cultural differences and \nindividuality and give students an understanding of basic universal \nhuman rights that are vital to democratic society. The project came to \nbe known as Understanding and Appreciating Cultural Diversity, and was \nto help create cultural awareness and understanding through letters, \ntapes, pictures, and interviews. As part of the program, Ms. Ross' \nstudents would create all these materials and exchange them with \nstudents from the other school. The program is special because it was \nthe first time that a project of this nature and scope had been done \nbetween any schools from the North and South.\n  Ms. Ross had high hopes for her program, the key to which was \novercoming stereotypes. It was not to be simply a pen-pal \ncorrespondence exercise. Instead, each class was to communicate with \nthe other class as a group, each serving as a microcosm of its \ncommunity. To get the exchange underway, the students at Yorktown \ncompiled a written and visual profile of their community, including its \nhistory and information gathered through interviews with local \nofficials. They provided an analysis of the town's transportation, \nentertainment, and shopping facilities.\n  The Alabama students, under the guidance of their teacher Mrs. Dyess, \ncompiled a videotape of their community which they sent to their \nfriends in New York. Monroeville sent Yorktown an autographed copy of \n``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' while Yorktown in turn sent Monroeville \nbooks set in the Hudson Valley, including Washington Irving's ``The \nLegend of Sleepy Hollow.''\n  Their teacher watched as the students' misconceptions began to \ncrumble. She saw lackadaisical youngsters grow interested in reading \nwhen they began believing that the South was a real and \nmultidimensional place. They learned that there are many different \nSouths, just as there are Norths, and both groups learned that it is \ndangerous to generalize about any region.\n  While learning of each others' differences, the exchange also made \nobvious the similarities between Yorktown Heights and Monroeville. Both \nare a mix of suburban and small town. Both have many working farms in \nthe community. The two schools are about the same size, 900 or so \nstudents. In both places, the school is a vital link in the community \nand there are strong family values present.\n  The program has had its lighthearted movements along the way. \nYorktown students were surprised to discover upon receiving a copy of \nMonroe County's yearbook that the students did not wear overalls. On \nthe other side of the connection, one Yorktown student, Guy Gentile, \nwas surprised to be asked by one of his Monroeville counterparts ``If I \nwalk out the street--in Yorktown--will I be shot?''\n  Soon, other schools learned of Ms. Ross' innovative program and \nexpressed an interest in becoming involved. Her students eventually \nbegan an exchange with a school in Louisiana to gain a better \nunderstanding and awareness of the influence of French culture on the \nUnited States. On November 14 of this year, Ms. Ross called to let me \nknow that two of her current students were visiting Monroeville as part \nof the Bridging the Miles program, as it is now called.\n  Overall, the program has served as a bridge for students who would \notherwise depend on often inaccurate and shallow media stereotypes. Ms. \nRoss said that a typical Yorktown student's opinions of Southerners \nwere formed by movies such as ``My Cousin Vinny'' and television shows \nlike ``The Beverly Hillbillies.'' The students were surprised to learn \nof the extent to which the racial climate in the South has changed \nsince the 1930's, when ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' was set. They had not \nexpected students who were so open about race and who participated in \nschool activities together regardless of race.\n  In Monroeville, the students realized we have a tendency to cluster \neveryone in one stereotypical unit and mark them as being nondescript \npeople. The sharing of poetry and letters has given the students a \nwhole new perspective on the relationship between North and South.\n  The program begun by Ms. Ross has gained a great amount of attention \nall over the country, having been spotlighted by The New York Times, \nAtlanta Journal-Constitution, and the CBS television network. So far, \nmost of its funding has come directly from Ms. Ross; this is how \nstrongly she believes in what she is doing. Hopefully, the program will \ncontinue to expand and promote further understanding among the many \ndiverse areas of the United States.\n  Just as programs such as the one between Yorktown and Monroeville \ndemonstrate that it is wrong to generalize and stereotype about regions \nof the country, the energy, drive, and example of Susan Ross prove that \nit is also harmful to generalize about the health of our public schools \nand the commitment of public school teachers. I congratulate her for \nher broad-mindedness and innovativeness in educating young people.\n  It is my hope that others interested in ways of improving American \neducation will see the great benefits that can be realized through \nprojects such as this. One thing that makes us unique as Americans is \nour diverse cultural heritages that bind us together even as we \nmaintain our regionally distinct traditions and customs. We tend to \nthink of exchange programs only in terms of those between citizens of \ndifferent nations, and these are indeed important and valuable tools \nfor learning about our world. But as Ms. Ross and students of Yorktown \nHigh School and their counterparts at Monroe County High School have \ndemonstrated, we have so much to draw from different regions within the \nUnited States itself that it is not necessary to go out of our own \ncountry to experience a cultural exchange. I commend her and wish her \nevery continued success for her programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/20/senate-section/article/S18997-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Kalbaugh, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/20/senate-section/article/S18998-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nwithdrawal and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/20/senate-section/article/S18998-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  At 12:10 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 395.

A bill to direct the Office of Personnel Management to \nestablish placement programs for Federal employees affected by \nreduction in force actions, and for other purposes.\n\n\n           the public servant priority placement act of 1995\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Robb, \nSarbanes, and Mikulski to introduce the Public Servant Priority \nPlacement Act, a bill to assist Federal workers who lose their jobs as \na result of downsizing. This legislation would require Government \nagencies to give priority consideration to these employees when filling \nvacancies.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government is in the process of \nsignificant downsizing, and that process is likely to intensify \nsubstantially in the coming years. Under current law, 272,000 civilian \npositions will be eliminated by fiscal year 1999. If an agreement is \nreached to balance the budget, that number probably will be much \nlarger.\n  Mr. President, it is easy for some to ignore the plight of these \nworkers by talking derisively of so-called faceless bureaucrats. But \nall of these workers are human beings with families, bills to pay, and \nobligations to meet. For most, getting laid off is a painful and \ntraumatic event. And for many, the financial implications are severe.\n  Most dislocated employees are hard-working, talented, skilled, and \ndedicated individuals who have contributed much to our Nation. They did \nnot lose their jobs because they were lazy, or because they did poor \nwork. They were simply innocent victims of forces larger than \nthemselves.\n  Mr. President, in an effort to assist these employees, and to ensure \nthat their talents are not lost entirely to the Government, agencies \nhave developed their own placement programs for former employees. The \nmost successful such program is the Department of Defense's Priority \nPlacement Program, or PPP. Under the program, involuntarily separated \nworkers are granted a preference when vacancies are filled. Since PPP's \ninception in 1965, over 100,000 DOD employees have been placed \nsuccessfully elsewhere in the Department. Unfortunately, the program's \nplacement rate has been reduced in recent years because fewer job \nopportunities have been available.\n  In coming years, few Federal agencies are likely to excape the budget \naxe. Some agencies probably will be eliminated altogether. It is \ncritically important, therefore, that Congress work to ensure that all \ndisplaced workers get the support they need.\n  Mr. President, the Office of Personnel Management operates two \ngovernment-wide placement programs that supplement the efforts of \nindividual agencies. Yet OPM's programs are not sufficient, in part \nbecause agencies all too often do not grant any preference to workers \ndisplaced from other agencies. According to a 1992 report by the \nGeneral Accounting Office, in fiscal year 1991, OPM's programs had \n4,433 registrants and made 110 placements. Although OPM has made \nimprovements to its programs since 1992, there clearly remains a need \nfor a coordinated, mandatory, Governmentwide placement program.\n  The Public Servant Priority Placement Act would direct OPM to \nestablish such a program for RIF'd employees. It also would require \nagencies to institute their own intra-agency placement programs for \nthese workers. Unlike the current placement programs, except for DOD's, \nagencies would be required to offer positions to dislocated workers if \nthey are qualified.\n  Under this legislation, if an agency has a vacancy it cannot fill \ninternally, such as through a promotion, it would be required to offer \nthat position to a qualified RIF'd employee of that agency who meets \ncertain criteria relating to classification and pay, and who is located \nwithin the same commuting area. If no such employee exists, then that \nagency shall offer the vacancy to a comparably-situated, well-qualified \nRIF'd employee from another Federal agency. Should no RIF'd employee \nmeet these criteria, then the agency may hire a person who is outside \nof the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, I introduced a very similar bill in the last Congress, \nand I am pleased that the concept has begun to attract support. A \nbipartisan bill was introduced a week and a half ago in the House, a \ncomponent of which is almost identical to the bill we are introducing \ntoday.

A bill to establish a demonstration project to provide that \nthe Department of Defense may receive Medicare reimbursement for health \ncare services provided to certain Medicare-eligible covered military \nbeneficiaries; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n  the uniformed services medicare subvention demonstration act of 1995\n\n Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, when we ask men and women to serve \nin our Nation's Armed Forces, we make them certain promises. One of the \nmost important is the promise that, upon the retirement of those who \nserve 20 years or more, a graceful nation will make health care \navailable to them for the rest of their lives. Unfortunately, for many \n65-and-over military retirees, promises are being broken.\n  When the military's Civilian Health and Medical Program of the U.S. \n[CHAMPUS] was established in 1966, just 1 year after Medicare, 65-and-\nover military retires were excluded from CHAMPUS because it was felt \nthey could receive care on a space-available basis from local military \nhospitals and they would not require health care services from the \nprivate medical community. For many years, there were few problems and \nplenty of available space, but as military bases and their hospitals \nhave closed, more and more retirees are finding it increasingly \ndifficult to receive the care they have been promised.\n  For many, being denied access to the local base hospital means they \nare completely reliant on Medicare. While Medicare is a valuable \nprogram that serves millions of Americans well, it was not designed as \ncompensation for service to our country. Our military retirees, how-\never, have all served our Nation for a minimum of 20 years, and many \nfor 30 years or more. With all the sacrifices they have made during \ntheir careers, I believe military retirees clearly have earned the \nbenefits that they were promised.\n  While many health care options have been discussed that would \nappropriately reward the contributions of our military retirees, at a \nminimum they ought to be able to use their Medicare reimbursement \neligibility wherever they choose, including the military health system. \nOur military treatment facilities also ought to be able to accept \nMedicare reimbursement and serve as Medicare providers for people who \nare eligible for both Medicare and for care in the military treatment \nsystem.\n  For this reason, today I am joined by Senators Inouye, McCain, \nHutchison, and Inhofe in introducing a bill to establish a 2-year \ndemonstration project that will allow Medicare to reimburse the Defense \nDepartment for health care services provided to Medicare-eligible \nbeneficiaries who are also eligible to receive care in military \ntreatment facilities. Called subvention. Medicare reimbursement to \nmilitary treatment facilities has long been a priority of military \nretirees, and I believe passing this bill and getting this project \nunder way should be a top priority for the Congress.\n\n  I am aware that some of my colleagues have also wrestled with this \nproblem and have tried many different ways to establish a subvention \nprogram. As I introduce this bill, the Senate Armed Services Committee \nis working with the Pentagon and the Health Care Financing \nAdministration [HCFA] to outline a demonstration project. In the House \nof Representatives, Congressman Joel Hefley has introduced a bill to \nbegin a subvention effort. While my subvention project is different \nthan these, I believe it complements their efforts.\n  This program will not increase the cost to the taxpayer because it \nwill ensure that DOD cannot shift costs to HCFA, and that the total \nMedicare cost to HCFA will not increase. In fact, I believe subvention \ncould actually save money. The Retired Officers Association, in their \nletter to me of December 15, 1995, reports that:\n\n       Using 1995 as a baseline, the eligible Medicare population \n     will grow by 1.6 million beneficiaries by 2000. This will \n     increase Medicare's cost by $7.7 billion if new beneficiaries \n     rely on Medicare as their sole source of care. But, with \n     subvention and DOD's 7 percent discount to the Health Care \n     Financing Administration (HCFA), the aggregate cost increase \n     can be reduced by $361 million over that same time frame. \n     Because health care will be managed, further savings could be \n     realized which could be passed on by DOD to Medicare through \n     reduced discounts.\n\n  This legislation is strongly supported by many military and veterans \norganizations. I would ask unanimous consent to include in the Record \n18 statements of support from the following groups: The Retired \nOfficers Association, National Association for Uniformed Services, Air \nForce Association, National Military Families Association, Veterans of \nForeign Wars of the United States, The American Legion, The Retired \nEnlisted Association, Reserve Officers Association of the United \nStates, Military Service Coalition of Austin (Texas), Association of \nthe United States Army, Air Force Sergeants Association, Non \nCommissioned Officers Association of the United States of America, \nUnited States Army Warrant Officers Association, Chief Warrant and \nWarrant Officers Association United States Coast Guard, Naval \n\n[[Page S19003]]\nReserve Association, Naval Enlisted Reserve Association, Association of \nMilitary Surgeons of the United States, and Jewish War Veterans of the \nUnited States of America.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                               Alexandria, VA,\n\n                                                December 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: The Retired Officers Association (TROA) \n     with its 400,000 members (including 68,000 auxiliary \n     members), strongly endorses your bill to authorize the \n     Department of Defense (DoD) to test an innovative concept \n     called Medicare subvention, which would allow Medicare to \n     reimburse DoD for care provided to Medicare-eligible \n     uniformed services beneficiaries through the Military Health \n     Services System. Uniformed services retirees and their \n     families are entitled to medical treatment in military \n     treatment facilities (MTFs) on a ``space available'' basis. \n     However, DoD can't afford to enroll authorized Medicare-\n     eligible retirees in its new Tricare program and will not \n     make available ``space available'' care for older retirees \n     unless Congress changes the law to allow reimbursement from \n     Medicare.\n       Using 1995 as a baseline, the eligible Medicare population \n     will grow by 1.6 million beneficiaries by 2000. This will \n     increase Medicare's cost by $7.7 billion if new beneficiaries \n     rely on Medicare as their sole source of care. But, with \n     subvention and DoD's 7 percent discount to the Health Care \n     Financing Administration (HCFA), the aggregate cost increase \n     can be reduced by $361 million over that same time frame. \n     Because health care will be managed, further savings could be \n     realized which could be passed on by DoD to Medicare through \n     reduced discounts. In addition to saving money for Medicare, \n     taxpayers and beneficiaries, subvention will:\n       Promote military medical readiness,\n       Give older retirees the freedom to choose where they would \n     like to get their health care services, i.e., either from \n     civilian or military sources,\n       Prevent retirees from being ``shoved out'' of Tricare Prime \n     (DoD's HMO-like program) when they turn age 65,\n       Enable those 65 and older to choose the military managed \n     care approach for their comprehensive, cost-effective health \n     care, and\n       Allow Congress and the government to keep the life-time \n     health care promises made to those who served.\n       In closing, we applaud your efforts to introduce \n     legislation that will test the viability of subvention and \n     its potential cost savings to the government. The potential \n     benefits of subvention are detailed in the enclosed fact \n     sheet.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael A. Nelson,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                        for Uniformed Services\n\n                               Springfield, VA, December 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: I am writing to express strong support \n     for your legislation directing the conduct of a demonstration \n     project to authorize Medicare reimbursement to the Department \n     of Defense and its medical facilities for care provided in \n     military treatment facilities (MTFs) and in DoD managed care \n     networks.\n       Military retirees and their families are the only federal \n     employees who lose their employer provided health care upon \n     reaching age 65. Although eligible to use MTFs on a space \n     available basis, deep cutbacks in health care personnel and \n     funding as well as hospital closures resulting from Base \n     Realignment and Closure Commission actions have shoved \n     hundreds of thousands of retirees out of military medicine.\n       Medicare eligible retirees served in WWII, Korea, Vietnam \n     and the long Cold War. They were recruited and reenlisted by \n     promises of lifetime medical care. Now when they need it most \n     they are being disenfranchised. Further, DoD's TRICARE \n     program excludes them despite the fact that these retirees \n     earned military sponsored health care through years of \n     arduous service and paid for Medicare through payroll \n     deductions.\n       Your Medicare reimbursement legislation will allow these \n     patriots and their families to use their Medicare benefits in \n     military treatment facilities which will save scarce Medicare \n     trust funds while providing the necessary funds needed for \n     their care. Your Medicare reimbursement bill is win-win \n     legislation for everyone--Medicare, taxpayers, beneficiaries \n     and military medicine.\n       I very much appreciate your leadership on this issue and \n     you have our full support. We are confident that this \n     demonstration will prove the need for a permanent \n     reimbursement program.\n            Sincerely,\n\n                                              J.C. Pennington,\n\n                                     Major General, USA (retired),\n      President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                        Air Force Association,\n\n                                 Arlington, VA, December 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: The members of the Air Force \n     Association strongly support your legislative initiative to \n     develop a demonstration project to authorize Medicare \n     subvention. Medicare Subvention would provide military \n     retirees with seamless health care coverage regardless of \n     age.\n       Most military members believe they were promised, through \n     tradition and practice, ``health care for life,'' when \n     deciding to choose a career in the military. In the past, \n     Medicare eligible retirees have received health care in the \n     military treatment facilities (MTFs) on a ``space available'' \n     basis. However, cutbacks in health care funding and medical \n     personnel, and base hospital closures resulting from base \n     realignment and closure, is likely to force many Medicare \n     eligible retirees out of the military medical system.\n       Military retirees are the only group of retired government \n     employees who lose their health benefit upon reaching age 65. \n     At age 65, retirees must enroll in Medicare or continue to \n     take the risk of receiving health care on a space available \n     basis in the MTFs or if eligible Veterans Administration \n     facilities. Under current law, Medicare eligible retirees \n     cannot enroll in TRICARE unless changes are made to the \n     Social Security Act allowing Medicare subvention.\n       You have the Air Force Association's full support for the \n     Medicare subvention demonstration program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       R.E. Smith,\n      President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          Veterans of Foreign Wars\n\n\n                                         of the united states,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: Thank you for taking the initiative to \n     introduce legislation that is so important to the Veterans of \n     Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW). Specifically, we \n     have repeatedly sought legislation that would allow the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to reimburse the \n     Military Health Service System for care provided to Medicare-\n     eligible military retirees and their spouses in the Military \n     Health Service System. This inter-departmental reimbursement \n     proposal is referred to as ``Medicare subvention''. It would \n     improve present government health care services to taxpayers \n     in a more cost-effective and service-efficient manner than is \n     presently the case.\n       Today, more than half the 2.1 million members of the \n     Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW) who are \n     eligible to receive Medicare are military retirees who fought \n     in World War II, Korea, and/or Vietnam. Hence, they now must \n     receive medical treatment in the civilian community or \n     private sector at a higher cost than could be provided in a \n     military treatment facility. To further compound this problem \n     most VFW military retirees prefer to continue to receive \n     their medical care in military facilities whenever and \n     wherever possible. To make this point, at our last national \n     convention held in August 1995 our voting delegates \n     unanimously passed VFW Resolution No. 643 titled ``Health \n     Care for Medicare Eligible Military Retirees.'' A copy is \n     attached to this letter. Our position is to have Congress \n     pass legislation that allows Medicare eligible retirees and \n     their dependents to continue to receive the high quality of \n     military medical service they are familiar with and are \n     accustomed to receiving.\n       Thank you for your past and present efforts on behalf of \n     all military retired veterans. They have earned military \n     sponsored health care through past years of arduous service. \n     Today, they are the only federal employees who lose their \n     employer provided health care upon reaching age 65. Your \n     proposed legislation will correct this inequity.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Paul A. Spera,\n                                               Commander in Chief.\n       Attachment: as stated.\n\n                           Resolution No. 643\n\n\n          health care for medicare eligible military retirees\n\n       Whereas, military retirees find it difficult to be treated \n     at military facilities once they become eligible for Medicare \n     since the military is not allowed to take Medicare money and \n     hospital Commanders are reluctant to provide care for which \n     they receive no reimbursement; and\n       Whereas, there is presently a bill before the House of \n     Representatives, H.R. 861, by Congressmen Randy (Duke) \n     Cunningham and Duncan L. Hunter that would allow military \n     retirees and veterans to use their Medicare benefits at \n     military or VA hospitals; and\n       Whereas, this would reduce the government's cost of \n     providing health care since the government hospitals can \n     treat these patient less expensively than paying Medicare to \n     civilian medical facilities; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United \n     States, that we urge Congress to support passage of \n     legislation that would allow military retirees and veterans \n     to use their Medicare entitlements in military or VA \n     hospitals.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  \n[[Page S19004]]\n\n\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 19, 1995.\n     Sen. Phil Gramm,\n     Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: The American Legion commends you for \n     introducing and fully supports the ``Medicare Subvention \n     Demonstration Project Act.'' This bill, which proposes a two-\n     year demonstration program at selected sites, serves to \n     implement an adopted American Legion mandate, namely medicare \n     subvention or reimbursement of Department of Defense (DOD) \n     medical facilities by the Department of Health and Human \n     Services (DHHS) for treatment of enrolled medicare-eligible \n     military retirees and their dependents.\n       Recognizably, this demonstration project legislation \n     represents a significant first step in the direction of full-\n     fledged medicare subvention which has been long supported by \n     The American Legion. The goal of this effort would improve \n     access to needed health care services for this dual-eligible \n     population while assuring the demonstration does not increase \n     the total federal cost of both programs. It is our aspiration \n     that this legislation become law, and that it eventually be \n     implemented at all military medical facilities throughout the \n     country.\n       Most importantly, this bill would ease the tremendous \n     frustration expressed by medicare-eligible military retirees \n     and their dependents that their government has reneged in its \n     promises of free, lifetime, heath care in exchange for \n     decades of service to this nation in time of war and peace. \n     Military retirees and their dependents are the only group of \n     Federal retirees who essentially lose their health care \n     coverage when they become 65 and are no longer eligible for \n     CHAMPUS/TRICARE coverage. Aside from the Department of \n     Defense itself providing health care for this group--which it \n     states it can no longer afford--medicare subjection appears \n     to provide the only viable solution to resolve the health \n     care crisis experienced by this growing group of deserving \n     veterans who have served their country for so long. Enclosed \n     is a copy of American Legion Resolution No. 107, ``Department \n     of Defense Health Care Reform for Military Beneficiaries,'' \n     which supports the proposed legislation.\n       Military retirees have seen the promise of lifetime health \n     care, and other promises, being broken which is not only a \n     demoralizing factor, but one which can and will impact on \n     recruiting and retaining a quality force if it is left \n     unresolved.

Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm, On behalf of The Retired Enlisted \n     Association (TREA), and its Auxiliary, I want to express our \n     collective appreciation to you for introducing legislation \n     that will require a demonstration project authorizing \n     Medicare reimbursement to the Department of Defense when \n     treating Medicare eligible military retirees seeking care \n     from the Military Health Services System (MHSS) within the \n     demonstration area.\n       Medicare eligible military retirees began their service \n     during World War II or the Korean War and continued their \n     service through the Cold War and the many conflicts during \n     that era, including the Vietnam War.\n       Without your Medicare reimbursement legislation, too many \n     of these dedicated American patriots would find themselves \n     disenfranchised from the Military Health Care System despite \n     decades of promises of health care for life from the \n     military.\n       If TREA can be of assistance to you on this most important \n     issue, please don't hesitate to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John M.

Phil Gramm,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: Our Military Service Coalition in \n     Austin, Texas is extremely pleased with your authorship of \n     such a balanced and unique approach to the Military Medicare \n     Subvention debate. It is our opinion that your proposed \n     ``Medicare Subvention Demonstration Project Act'' provides \n     for both fiscal soundness and an operationally feasible \n     method to test the theory and concept of Military Medicare \n     Subvention.\n       Clearly, this legislation is a pragmatic alternative to \n     other proposals that were simply too progressive, too soon. \n     We believe that although, theoretically attractive, they were \n     simply too far reaching and were introduced without any clear \n     method to gain a better understanding of any potential \n     adverse impact on both providers and customers.\n       Again, you and your staff are to be commended on the \n     introduction of such a well coordinated and reasoned approach \n     to legislative change which we believe will begin to improve \n     our existing military health care delivery systems. We \n     appreciate the opportunity you gave us to work closely with \n     your staff during the development of this fine effort.\n       May God continue to bless your efforts to make health care \n     more accessible to our Nation's Veterans.\n           Respectfully,\n     Bruce Conover, President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                Association of the\n\n\n                                           United States Army,\n\n                                 Arlington, VA, December 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: Medicare Subvention, the reimbursement \n     of the Department of Defense for the medical care it provides \n     to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, has long been a goal of \n     the Association of the United States Army. Despite the \n     bureaucratic resistance that often meets new ideas, \n     Subvention continues to pass every test of fairness and logic \n     to which it is subjected. In an age of constrained budgets \n     and fiscal restraint, Medicare Subvention is an initiative \n     that makes too much sense to ignore and actually holds the \n     promise of saving money.\n       On behalf of the more than 100,000 members of the \n     Association of the United States Army, thank you for your \n     courage in confronting the bureaucratic resistance by \n     introducing legislation to permit a demonstration of Medicare \n     Subvention. While I believe a test is unnecessary to show \n     that value of Subvention, the demonstration will remove any \n     doubt that this is an initiative in which there are no \n     losers. The Medicare-eligible military beneficiary wins. The \n     military health care system wins. The Health Care Financing \n     Administration wins and, in the final analysis, the American \n     people win because a quality product will be delivered to a \n     deserving segment of our population at a lower cost and in a \n     more practical manner.\n       Medicare Subvention does not answer all the concerns we \n     have with the military medical system, but it goes a long way \n     to help one segment of the beneficiary population. It is an \n     idea whose time has come. Thank you again for your \n     willingness to sponsor a bill that will make Medicare \n     Subvention a reality.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Jack N. Merritt,\n     General, USA Retired.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                         Air Force\n\n\n                                        Sergeants Association,\n\n                              Temple Hills, MD, December 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm, On behalf of the 160,000 members of the \n     Air force Sergeants Association, thank you for your \n     introduction of Medicare subvention legislation before the \n     United States Senate. Our shared concern for health care \n     needs of our oldest military retirees will, hopefully, result \n     in legislative action on your bill during this Congress, with \n     the eventual goal of attaining subvention for all over-64 \n     military retirees.\n        As you are aware, current law requires that over-65, \n     Medicare-eligible military retirees be thrown out of formal \n     participation in the Military Health Services System (MHSS) \n     simply because they have attained that age and status. For \n     many, this effectively ends their care possibilities within \n     the MHSS, because ``space-available'' care in Military \n     Treatment Facilities is increasingly difficult to obtain.\n       Most other federal employees keep their federal health \n     insurance upon reaching age 65. Therefore, the current \n     practice toward over-65 military retirees is discriminatory \n     and must end. The full-scale enactment of Medicare subvention \n     could result in the ability of many of our older military \n     retirees to participate in DOD's new health care program, \n     TRICARE. Your efforts to begin the process are needed and \n     appreciated. As always, feel free to ask for AFSA's support \n     of this or any other legislation of mutual concern.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 James D. Station,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Non Commissioned Officers Association of the United \n           States of America,\n                                Alexandria, VA, December 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: The Non Commissioned Officers \n     Association of the USA (NCOA) wishes to express strong \n     support for your efforts to introduce legislation directing \n     that a demonstration project be conducted to authorize \n     Medicare reimbursement to the Department of Defense (DoD) for \n     medical care provided in Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) \n     and in the department's managed care networks. It is very \n     important that your bill include TRICARE and the Uniformed \n     Services Treatment Facilities in the demonstration.\n       NCOA and it's members are very concerned that the efforts \n     of DoD to improve health care availability and accessibility \n     through implementation of the TRICARE program for all \n     military beneficiaries are being hampered simply because \n     Medicare will not reimburse DoD for the medical treatment \n     provided to the age-65 military retiree. NCOA cannot just \n     standby and watch a group of military retirees who earned a \n     free lifetime medical care benefit be disenfranchised from \n     that benefit.\n       In this regard, NCOA applauds your efforts and supports \n     your legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Michael F.

The bill includes TRICARE and the \n     Uniformed Services Treatment Facilities in the demonstration.\n       Military retirees and their families are the only federal \n     employees who lose their employer provided health care upon \n     reaching age 65. Although eligible to use MTFs on a space \n     available basis, deep cutbacks in health care personnel and \n     funding as well as hospital closures resulting from Base \n     Realignment and Closure Commission actions have shoved \n     hundreds of thousands of retirees out of military medicine.\n       Medicare eligible retirees served in WWII, Korea, Vietnam \n     and the long Cold War. They were recruited and reenlisted by \n     promises of lifetime medical care. Now when they need it most \n     they are being disenfranchised. DoD's TRICARE program \n     excludes them despite the fact that these retirees earned \n     military sponsored health care through years of arduous \n     service and paid for Medicare through payroll deductions.\n       NMFA is aware that Medicare reimbursement to DoD will only \n     benefit those living in areas where MTFs exist and/or TRICARE \n     Prime is available and continues to support offering all non-\n     active duty military beneficiaries the option of enrolling in \n     the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. Nonetheless, \n     Medicare reimbursement to DoD will benefit many who would \n     otherwise lose access to the military system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Sylvia E.J.

Although eligible to use MTFs on a space \n     available basis, deep cutbacks in health care personnel and \n     funding as well as hospital closures resulting from Base \n     Realignment and Closure Commission actions have shoved \n     hundreds of thousands of retirees out of military medicine.\n       Medicare eligible retirees served in WWII, Korea, Vietnam \n     and the long Cold War. They were recruited and reenlisted by \n     promises of lifetime medical care. Now when they need it \n     most, they are being disenfranchised. Further, DoD's TRICARE \n     program excludes them despite the fact that these retirees \n     earned military sponsored health care though years of arduous \n     service and paid for Medicare through payroll deductions.\n       Your Medicare reimbursement legislation will allow these \n     patriots and their families to use their Medicare benefits in \n     military treatment facilities which will save scarce Medicare \n     trust funds while providing the necessary funds needed for \n     their care.

BRALLIAR,\n\n                                         LT General, USAF, MC Ret.\n                                       Executive Director.\nMr. McCain. Mr. President, today I am cosponsoring with Senator \nPhil Gramm the Uniformed Services Medicare Subvention Demonstration \nAct, this bill would allow Medicare reimbursement to the Department of \nDefense for care provided by the military system to Medicare-eligible \nuniformed services beneficiaries.\n  In the case of those Medicare-eligible uniform services beneficiaries \nwho enroll in the Department's managed health care plan, Tricare, this \nlegislation would authorize a demonstration project that allows \nMedicare to pay DOD based on a reduced rate per enrollee of 93 percent \nfrom what Medicare pays eligible health maintenance organizations. In \nthe case of DOD beneficiaries who do not enroll in Tricare, Medicare \nwould pay military treatment facilities [MTFs] for services provided \nbased on the methodology it would use in paying a discounted rate of 93 \npercent of what Medicare pays a similar civilian provider.\n  Under current law, DOD retirees may receive care free of charge at a \nMTF on a space available basis. There are currently about 1.2 million \nuniformed services beneficiaries age 65 and older. By 1997, this number \nis expected to grow to 1.4 million. It is estimated that 97 percent of \nthese retirees are eligible for Medicare. An estimated 324,000 of these \nindividuals currently use military health care facilities on a regular \nbasis when space is available, at a cost of $1.4 billion per year from \nDOD's annual appropriation. Due to budgetary considerations, DOD soon \nwill no longer have the resources to treat Medicare-eligible \nbeneficiaries unless it is able to obtain Medicare reimbursement.\n  For military retirees, the cost of care provided through civilian \nproviders in the Medicare Program is significantly higher than if the \ncare is provided at a military hospital. One study by DOD found that \nthe cost of care at a military hospital is 10-24 percent less. Such \nsavings are further supported by a GAO study of six hospitals in which \nestimated savings to the CHAMPUS Program ranged from $18 to $21 \nmillion. With Medicare reimbursement, DOD will be able to treat more \nMedicare-eligible beneficiaries at lower cost to the Government.\n  There would be substantial benefits to our military readiness \nassociated with this legislation. Under this demonstraion project, the \nreadiness of the military health care system would be enhanced in two \nsignificant ways. First, military treatment facilities would be able to \nmaintain their service capacity despite DOD budgetary restrictions due \nto the infusion of Medicare funds. Second, DOD physicians and other \nmilitary health care personnel will be able to treat the broad range of \nmedicare problems presented by retired beneficiaries, thereby assisting \nthem to maintain and expand their knowledge and skills.\n  Even more important, this legislation is important to overall \nmilitary personnel readiness. Particularly in times of conflict, our \nArmed Forces depend heavily on the high quality of career mid-level and \nsenior management. We must therefore continue to attract such personnel \nto serve full military careers, often comprising 30 years of service \nand sacrifice. Offering an attractive retirement benefits package, \nincluding military health care during retirement, and keeping our \nGovernment's promises concerning such benefits, is essential to \nmaintaining these key personnel.\n  I believe that this bill is at least budget neutral and will save the \nGovernment money. It will seek a reduced reimbursement from Medicare \nonly for \n\n[[Page S19007]]\nnew beneficiaries who otherwise obtain care through Medicare within the \nCivilian sector. DOD concludes that subvention will reduce Government \ncosts. Allowing Medicare reimbursements for DOD health care has been a \nlong standing proposal. This bill would allow us to demonstrate the \ninitiative on a limited basis to ensure that it provides the promised \nbenefits to Medicare recipients who are retired uniform service \nbeneficiaries, to Department of Defense's health care system and to the \nMedicare trust fund. I hope it is a demonstration we can implement to \nincrease success for broader application.\n  Mr. President, this bill is important to the military, its retires \nand the Nation. The military needs to maintain its readiness and its \nability to provide the best care possible. Retirees who have served \ntheir careers in our uniformed services, and who have also paid into \nthe Medicare trust fund like other Medicare beneficiaries, deserve the \nfull range of choice that this legislation offers. They should be able \nto use their Medicare coverage wherever they are eligible to receive \ncare, including a military treatment facility or the Tricare Program.\n  This legislation is supported in principal by the Department of \nDefense and fully by all the uniformed services organizations and the \nmajor veterans organizations, including the entire military coalition. \nAdditionally, the Senate has already taken a positive position on \nMedicare subvention when it earlier this year passed a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution in the Defense authorization bill. I am proud to be \npart of an effort with Senator Phil Gramm to continue to move forward \non this important legislation for military service members and their \nfamilies.\n  Again, this legislation should provide the catalyst to demonstrate \nthat, in fact, those career uniformed service members continue to have \noptions in terms of health care and allows them to continue to be able \nto choose their health care provider like most Americans. For the \nactive service member and their families they will continue to enjoy \nthe highest quality health care that is our duty to provide.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SARBANES:\n  S. 1488. A bill to convert certain excepted service positions in the \nU.S. Fire Administration to competitive service positions, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                  U.S. Fire Administration Legislation\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to convert eight remaining excepted service positions at \nthe U.S. Fire Administration to competitive service status.\n  During its first few years of operation, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency used an excepted service authority provided under the \nFire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 in order to quickly staff the \nNational Fire Academy with personnel who were uniquely qualified in \nfire education.\n  In the early 1980's, after the Academy's original vacancies had been \nfilled and the Academy was up and running, it became FEMA's policy to \nfill openings at the NFA through a competitive civil service hiring \nsystem. Today, 91 of the NFA's 99 employees are under the general \nschedule with only eight employees who were hired in the 1970's and \nearly eighties remaining in excepted service status. As a result, these \nremaining eight are subject to significant limitations within the USFA. \nAlthough they each average over 17 years of Federal service and were \nhired solely because of their strong backgrounds and unique \nqualifications in fire education, they are legally barred from \ncompeting for management positions within the Fire Administration. The \nremaining eight excepted service employees are not even allowed to \nserve on details to competitive service jobs--even within their own \norganization--without an official waiver from the Office of Personnel \nManagement.\n  Mr. President, I am proposing to remedy this situation. The \nlegislation which I am introducing will enable the Director of the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency and the Director of the Office of \nPersonnel Management to convert any employees appointed to the Fire \nAdministration under the Federal Fire Protection and Control Act, to \ncompetitive service--without any break in service, diminution of \nservice, reduction of cumulative years of service, or requirement to \nserve any additional probationary period with the Administration. Those \nconverted under this legislation shall also remain in the Civil Service \nRetirement System and retain their seniority. This practice is \nconsistent with other federally supported training academies. The \nCongressional Budget Office has indicated that there would be no cost \nfor this conversion, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. MURRAY:\n  S. 1489. A bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate \na portion of the Columbia River as a recreational river, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                    COLUMBIA RIVER BASIN LEGISLATION\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today \nto designate the 50-miles of the mid-Columbia River known as the \nHanford Reach--the last free-flowing stretch of the river--a wild and \nscenic river and to improve fish and wildlife habitat downstream of the \nreach.\n  Although I have been working for less than a year with the community \nand members of my Hanford Reach Advisory Panel to develop a broadly-\nsupported means of protecting the river corridor, the effort to save \nthe reach has been underway for 30 years.\n  The Hanford Reach is an issue whose time has come.\n  While most of the Columbia River Basin was being developed during the \nmiddle of this century, the Hanford Reach and other buffer areas within \nthe Hanford Nuclear Reservation were kept pristine, ironically, by the \nsame veil of secrecy and security that lead to the notorious nuclear \nand chemical contamination of the central Hanford site. Today, these \nrelatively undisturbed Hanford buffer areas are wild remnants of a \ngreat river and vast shrub-steppe ecosystem that have been tamed by \ndams, farms, and other economically important development.\n  As the last free-flowing stretch of the Columbia between the Canadian \nborder and Bonneville Dam, the significance of the Hanford Reach has \nonly recently become fully appreciated. Mile for mile, it contains some \nof the most productive and important fish spawning habitat in the lower \n48 States. The cool, clear waters of the Columbia River that sweep \nthrough the reach have the volume and velocity to produce ideal \nconditions for spawning and migrating salmon. The reach produces 80 \npercent of the Columbia Basin's fall chinook salmon, as well as \nthriving runs of steelhead trout and sturgeon. It is the only truly \nhealthy segment of the mainstem of the Columbia River.\n  At a time when the Pacific Northwest is struggling to restore \ndeclining salmon runs--and spending hundreds of millions annually on \nrestoration and enhancement efforts--protecting the Hanford Reach is \nthe most cost-effective step we can take. That is why the Northwest \nPower Planning Council, Trout Unlimited, conservation groups, tribes, \nand many other regional interests involved in the salmon controversy \nsupport designation of the reach under the National Wild and Scenic \nRivers Act.\n  The reach is also rich in other natural and cultural resources. Bald \neagles, wintering and migrating waterfowl, deer elk, and a diversity of \nother wildlife depend on the reach. It is home to dozens of rare, \nthreatened, and endangered plants and animals, some found only in the \nreach.\n  This part of the Columbia Basin is also of great cultural importance. \nNative American culture thrived on the shores and islands of the reach \nfor millennia, and there are over 150 archaeological sites in the \nproposed designation, some dating back more than 10,000 years. The \nreach's naturally-spawning salmon and cultural sites remain a vital \npart of the culture and religion of Native American groups in the area.\n  The southern shore of the reach chronicles a different kind of \nhistory: the story of the Manhattan project and defense nuclear \nproduction during the cold war. Nowhere else in the world is there a \nhigher concentration of nuclear facilities, some of which are on the \nNational Register of Historic Places, than along this stretch of the \nColumbia River.\n  In stark contrast to the old defense reactors is the section of the \nreach \n\n[[Page S19008]]\ndominated by the White Bluffs, whose towering but fragile cliffs offer \ndramatic scenery and opportunities for solitude. Irrigation water \nflowing through unstable Ringold formation sediments has caused part of \nthe White Bluffs to slide into the River, smothering spawning \nbeds, reducing water quality, and even deflecting the course of the \nriver. This constitutes one of the great threats to the reach.\n\n  The reach offers residents and visitors recreation of many types--\nfrom hunting, fishing, and hiking to kayaking, waterskiing, and \nbirdwatching--and adds greatly to the quality of life and economy of \nthe area.\n  My legislation builds on a foundation begun in the 100th Congress by \nSenators Dan Evans and Brock Adams, and Congressman Sid Morrison, who \nenacted legislation which called for a moratorium on development within \nthe river corridor and a detailed study of policy options. Our bill \nimplements the preferred alternative of the Hanford Reach EIS, which \nrecommended Congress designate the reach a recreational river under the \nNational Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.\n  With the guidance of my Hanford Reach Advisory Panel, the legislation \nalso contains some refinements and protections. For example, the bill \nexplicitly allows current activities, such as agriculture, power \ngeneration and transmission, and water withdrawals along the river \ncorridor to continue. It excludes private property, which comprises \nonly about three percent of the study area. The legislation also \nguarantees that local government and other local interests have a \nformal role in the management of the river corridor, which will come \nunder the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  The legislation also includes provisions which complement the Wild \nand Scenic River designation. The Secretary of Interior and relevant \nFederal agencies are directed to work with local and State sponsors in \ndeveloping a program of education and interpretation related to the \nHanford Reach. The city of Richland and area tribes, among others, have \nbeen working with the Department of Energy on a museum and regional \nvisitor center proposal and are eager to make the natural and human \nhistory of the reach part of the project. Federal agencies should help \ncoordinate with local sponsors on this initiative.\n  There is also great interest in the tri-cities, and among some \ngovernment agencies, in improving the habitat value, access, and \nappearance of the Columbia River shoreline in the area, much of which \nis lined with high, steep levees that were put into place before the \nnetwork of Columbia River dams controlled the flow of the River and \nreduced the need for such flood control structures. Migrating salmon \nand wildlife now face a sterile gauntlet, populated by predatory fish \nspecies, in this part of the River.\n  This bill directs the Army Corps of Engineers, which built, owns, and \nmaintains the levees, to coordinate with local sponsors on \ndemonstration projects to restore the rivershore. In the short-term, \nthe bill directs the corps to undertake some small levee modification \nprojects under their existing Section 1135 Project Restoration Program, \nassuming the local sponsors meet program requirements for planning and \ncost-sharing. The cities of Kennewick and Pasco, and the Port of \nKennewick, have already indicated an interest and ability to pursue \nthis course of action. In the long-term, the corps is directed to \nundertake a comprehensive study of the levees and determine if \nrivershore restoration in the area is feasible and an important Federal \npriority.\n  I am proud of the way this legislation was developed. It is the \nproduct of an open, consensus-building process that heard from \nvirtually every interested group in the community and in the region. \nThe bill was drafted with the assistance of a diverse panel of \ncommunity leaders from local government, business, labor, and the \nconservation community.\n  I am deeply grateful to the members of my Hanford Reach Advisory \nPanel for their public spirited commitment of their valuable time, \nenergy, and creativity. Sue Frost, manager of the Port of Kennewick; \nChris Jensen, Pacso City Council; Joe King, Richland City Manager; Rick \nLeaumont with the Lower Columbia Basin Audubon Society; John Lindsay, \npresident of TRIDEC; Kris Watkins with the Tri-Cities' Visitor and \nConvention Bureau; and Jim Watts with the Oil, Chemical and Atomic \nWorkers did an outstanding job tackling the tough issues associated \nwith this legislation and developing a consensus proposal.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to enact \nthis historic and balanced measure.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMON (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Leahy, and Mrs. \n        Boxer):\n  S. 1490. A bill to amend title I of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 to improve enforcement of such title and benefit \nsecurity for participants by adding certain provisions with respect to \nthe auditing of employee benefit plans, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n               the pension audit improvement act of 1995\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, Senator Jeffords and I are introducing the \nPension Audit Improvement Act of 1995 today in order to improve the \nquality of audits performed pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 [ERISA]. The bill repeals the limited scope audit \nexemption, enhances ERISA auditor qualifications, and requires speedy \nreporting of serious ERISA violations discovered during plan audits.\n  Over the past few years, both the Inspector General of the Department \nof Labor and the GAO have issued reports documenting the need to \nstrengthen the quality of pension audits. Recent investigations by \nSecretary Reich of 401(k) plans further demonstrate the need for \nCongress to Act promptly on this measure.\n  I want to commend Senator Jeffords for his interest and work in \nsupport of this bill. I also want to commend Secretary Reich for the \nDepartment's substantial work and effort in support of this bill. I am \nalso pleased to report that this bill is supported by the American \nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants, and I thank them for their \nefforts to move this bill forward. I ask unanimous consent to have a \nsummary of the bill printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record,  as follows:\n\n                 Pension Audit Improvement Act of 1995\n\n\n                              current law\n\n       Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n     1974 (ERISA), requires that pension plan administrators \n     obtain a financial audit of employee benefit pension plans. \n     ERISA's audit requirement was designed to protect employee \n     benefit plan assets and assist the Labor Department's \n     enforcement activities by insuring the integrity of financial \n     and compliance information disclosed on the annual report \n     filed with the government.\n       Under  current  law,  plan  auditors  are permitted to \n     exclude plan assets invested in regulated institutions, such \n     as banks or insurance companies, from the annual audit. This \n     exclusion, referred to as a limited-scope audit, prohibits \n     auditors from rendering an opinion on the plan's financial \n     statements in accordance with professional auditing \n     standards. Consequently, there is no assurance that plan \n     assets are secure. About fifty percent of plan audit reports \n     contain a limited scope audit disclaimer, resulting in \n     approximately $950 billion dollars in pension plan assets \n     that are not subject to a full financial audit.\n       Federal law enforcement agencies including, the Office of \n     the Inspector General of the Department of Labor, the General \n     Accounting Office (GAO) and the Pension and Welfare Benefits \n     Administration of the Department of Labor have found that \n     current ERISA audits do not consistently meet professional \n     standards, therefore, hundreds of millions of dollars in \n     pension funds are not being adequately audited.\n\n\n     major provisions of the pension audit improvement act of 1995\n\n       The Pension Audit Improvement Act is designed to improve \n     the integrity of private audits of employee pension plan \n     benefits to better protect retirees and active workers future \n     retirement income. In order to insure that pension funds are \n     adequately safeguarded, this bill repeals the limited scope \n     audit exception, enhances ERISA auditor qualifications, and \n     requires speedy reporting of serious ERISA violations \n     discovered during plan audits.\n\n                   1. Repeal of limited scope audits\n\n       The bill repeals the limited-scope audit. Limited scope \n     audits were originally designed to exempt institutions that \n     were already examined by federal or state agencies from \n     duplicative detailed audits. The Inspector General of the \n     Department of Labor, has found, however, that a significant \n     number of these financial institutions are not audited \n     annually increasing risks to plan participants of inadequate \n     retirement security. \n\n[[Page S19009]]\n     Eliminating the limited scope audit will not require that the plan's \n     accountant duplicate the work of a bank or insurance company \n     audit. It is expected that the ERISA plan auditors will \n     rely on the reports of the financial institution, meeting \n     certain certified public accounting standards, which speak \n     to the reliability of that audit. This ``single audit'' \n     approach would fulfill the purposes of the audit \n     requirement without imposing the additional cost of \n     independently reviewing the financial institution's \n     records. At the same time, accountants will now be able to \n     issue audit reports that provide employees the assurance \n     that their retirement income is secure.\n\n      2. Reporting and enforcement requirements for pension plans\n\n               a. Prompt reporting of serious violations\n\n       ERISA's current reporting rules create a time lag between \n     the detection of a reportable event and the filing of the \n     annual report which increases the risk to plan participants \n     and beneficiaries that full recoveries will not be made. This \n     audit bill requires faster reporting duties on auditors who \n     discover serious violations or whose services are terminated \n     by the employer client. This provision should substantially \n     enhance ERISA enforcement because the Department of Labor \n     will receive notices of violations from plan auditors, up to \n     eighteen months, before the Department currently receives \n     this information.\n       The new reporting rules apply only to the most egregious \n     violations like theft, embezzlement, bribery or kickbacks. \n     The primary reporting obligation remains with the plan \n     administrator. Auditors report serious violations directly to \n     the Labor Department only if the administrator fails to \n     notify within a specific time frame.\n\n                         b. Auditor termination\n\n       The bill also requires a pension plan that terminates an \n     accountant to promptly notify the Secretary of Labor. The \n     plan's notice must specify the reasons for termination, and a \n     copy of the notice must be sent to the accountant.\n\n                    c. Penalty for failure to report\n\n       The bill provides a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against \n     any accountant or pension plan that violates the reporting \n     requirement. A violation could also result in criminal \n     sanctions.\n\n           3. Enhanced qualifications for ERISA plan auditors\n\n       The Department of Labor reports that it ``continues to \n     detect substantial auditing work'' by ERISA auditors. This \n     bill creates a peer review and continuing professional \n     education requirement for ERISA plan auditors. The bill also \n     gives the Secretary of Labor regulatory authority to insure \n     the quality of plan audits.\n       The bill requires that qualified public accountants \n     participate in an external quality peer review relevant to \n     employee benefit plans within a three year period prior to \n     conducting an ERISA audit. This review must meet recognized \n     auditing standards as determined by the Comptroller General \n     of the United States. The bill also requires that qualified \n     public accountants performing ERISA plan audits satisfy \n     specific continuing education requirements.\n\n                4. Clarification of fiduciary penalties\n\n       The bill provides the Secretary of Labor the discretion to \n     reduce the current civil penalties (the penalty is an amount \n     equal to 20% of amount recovered pursuant to a settlement \n     agreement for breach of fiduciary duty). The Secretary has \n     determined that the automatic penalty disadvantages plan \n     participants because it serves as a ``disincentive'' for \n     parties to settle with the Department.\n       The bill also clarifies that ERISA's anti-alienation rule, \n     which protects pensions from third party creditors, does not \n     protect fiduciaries who breach ERISA and cause a loss to the \n     plan. The bill clarifies that ERISA does not prohibit a plan \n     from offsetting a fiduciary's, or criminal wrongdoer's \n     pension benefits when such person causes a loss to the plan.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Simon, to introduce the Pension Audit Improvement \nAct of 1995. I'd also like to thank the Department of Labor and the \nAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants who have worked very \nclosely with us to produce this bill.\n  The primary purpose of this legislation is to repeal the limited \nscope audit exception currently in the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act [ERISA]. Similar bills have been introduced by my \ncolleagues Senators Kassebaum and Hatch in previous years. The current \nbill has the added feature of putting some teeth into private auditor \nenforcement efforts and responsibilities.\n  Limited scope audits are audits where independent accountants are not \nrequired to examine, test, or evaluate funds or assets held in trust by \nbanks or other regulated financial institutions. This provision in \nERISA has created a major loophole in the oversight of pension plans. \nWhile the assumption is that these institutions are adequately audited \nby federal agencies, these audits are generally done only once every \ntwo years. More significantly, when an independent auditor is \nrestricted from examining significant information in an audit, she \ngenerally disclaims any opinion about whether that plan's financial \nstatements are correct.\n  Workers and retirees have the right to except that somebody is making \nsure that their pensions are there when they retire. The sheer numbers \nof private pension plans over 900,000, make it virtually impossible for \nthe government to possibly maintain a viable enforcement effort without \nthe help of private plan auditors. Also, is it realistic to expect an \naccountant, who has continuing ties with an employer, to identify and \nreport to the Department of Labor questionable transactions between the \nplan and plan sponsor?\n  The current enforcement system incorrectly assumes, to a large \ndegree, that independent public accountants will detect serious \nviolations in a timely manner. A 1987 report, by the Department of \nLabor's Office of Inspector General found that in 71% of their reviews, \nthat the independent auditors had failed to discover existing ERISA \nviolations. In a more recent 1989 report, the Inspector General found \nlarge numbers of audits didn't adequately examine or test plan assets \nand lacked timely reporting of ERISA violations.\n  Furthermore, these studies indicate a number of problems with the \ndetection of potential ERISA violations, including: incomplete or \ninadequate information being reported, the ability of the government to \nexamine only about one percent of these plans per year, and that \nprivate plan audits do not consistently meet generally accepted \nprofessional accounting standards.\n  The intent of the Pension Audit Improvement Act is to increase the \noverall integrity of private pension plan auditing enforcement \npractices. To enhance the integrity of audits this bill will subject \nqualified public accountants to external peer review. In addition, \npublic accountants performing ERISA audits will be required to satisfy \ncontinuing education requirements emphasizing employee benefits ERISA \nrules.\n  In addition, this bill will place new, expedited reporting duties on \nauditors whose services are terminated by the plan administrator before \nthe audit is completed and, for those auditors who discover evidence of \nserious violations such as theft, embezzlement, bribery or kickbacks. \nAuditors will be required to report these violations directly to the \nDepartment of Labor only if the administrator fails to notify the \nDepartment within a specified time frame. The primary reporting, of any \nviolation, still remains with the plan sponsor.\n  I look forward to working with all interested parties in turning this \nbill into a first step toward strengthening our current pension \nenforcement system. Although, these changes to ERISA's reporting rules \nmay seem minor they have the potential to create lasting reform with \nrespect to the enforcement of Title I of ERISA. Giving private sector \nauditors the tools and responsibility of early detection of violations \nwill prevent workers from losing hard earned pension benefits.\n  We simply must do a better job of safeguarding the pension benefits \nof a growing number of workers and pensioners. The economic security of \ntens of millions of Americans depends on these benefits being \nadequately protected.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRAMS (for himself, Mr Heflin, Mr. Pryor, Mr. McConnell, \n        Mr. Conrad, Mr. Coverdell, and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 1491. A bill to reform antimicrobial pesticide registration, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                       anti-microbial legislation\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation reforming the burdensome regulatory process for pesticide \napprovals under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide \nAct.\n  I am pleased to say that my legislation achieves that goal while \npreserving and improving upon our Nation's public health.\n  This legislation is a product of compromise between the affected \nindustry \n\n[[Page S19010]]\nand the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  The spirit of bipartisanship is best exemplified by the list of my \ncolleagues joining me in this effort, including Senator Heflin, Senator \nPryor, Senator McConnell, Senator Conrad, Senator Coverdell and Senator \nSantorum.\n  As members of the Agriculture Committee, their support for this \ncommonsense legislation is essential and appreciated.\n  Mr. President, Congress has finally begun to recognize the severe \nburdens we place upon America's job creators when we impose regulatory \nlegislation without respect to its cost or ultimate benefits.\n  So I am pleased that we have made significant progress this year in \nreforming and reducing some of that regulatory burden, and I believe \nthis legislation takes us another step forward.\n  The pesticides covered by this legislation, called antimicrobial \nproducts, include common household disinfectant cleaners, bleaches, \nsanitizers, and disinfectants.\n  Antimicrobials play an important and beneficial role in controlling \ndisease and in maintaining a high public-health standard in hospitals, \nnursing homes, clinics, schools, hotels, restaurants, and even in our \nown homes.\n  Because emergency workers rely on antimicrobial pesticides to \ndisinfect contaminated water supplies, they are especially valuable \nduring times of natural disasters, such as flooding in the Midwest, \nhurricanes in Florida, and earthquakes in California.\n  Yet despite the critical role antimicrobials play in maintaining \npublic health, and the efforts of our colleagues to develop a \nresponsible solution, there have been significant and unintended delays \non the EPA's part in approving these products for use.\n  Unfortunately, those delays in the registration process have stifled \nthe ability of the industry to market new products--products which \ncould have an even more significant impact on the public health.\n  I would like to share an example.\n  A new product which provides extraordinary effectiveness against a \npowerful form of bacteria was developed by an international supplier of \ncleaning and sanitizing products.\n  Not only was this new product found to be extremely effective, but it \nwas also developed to break down rapidly once it had achieved its \nsanitizing work. In short, it effectively helped destroy bacteria while \nit reduced the likelihood of environmental damage.\n  While this revolutionary product had proven merits, the company could \nnot get the product approved by the EPA for over 2 years because of the \ncumbersome approval process.\n  At the end of that 2-year period, the EPA granted its approval and \nagreed that this product was of great importance to public health and \nthe environment. It's unfortunate that it has taken so long for the \nGovernment to recognize what its manufacturer had long known.\n  Such examples have become commonplace. Because of this inappropriate \nbacklog of anti-microbial applications pending within the EPA that have \nlittle or no chance of being resolved within a reasonable period of \ntime, the need for legislative reform is clear.\n  Our legislation will establish process for expediting the review of \nanti-microbial products.\n  It incorporates predictability into the system without compromising \npublic health and safety. it encourages industry and Government to work \ntogether to actually improve products which can better guarantee our \npublic health.\n  In a legislative climate that is too often partisan and \nuncompromising, this bill is an example of how Congress, the \nadministration and its Federal agencies, industry, and consumers can \npool their efforts to achieve a common end.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues who have cosponsored this bill, the \nanti-microbial industry, user groups, and the EPA for coming together \nto work out the details of this bill. I urge the rest of my colleagues \nto join us in supporting this commonsense reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/20/senate-section/article/S19001-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 607\n\n  At the request of Mr. Warner, the name of the Senator from Michigan \n[Mr. Abraham] was added as a cosponsor of S. 607, a bill to amend the \nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act \nof 1980 to clarify the liability of certain recycling transactions, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 984\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Kansas \n[Mr. Dole] was added as a cosponsor of S. 984, a bill to protect the \nfundamental right of a parent to direct the upbringing of a child, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1183\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatfield, the name of the Senator from Illinois \n[Mr. Simon] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1183, a bill to amend the \nact of March 3, 1931 (known as the Davis-Bacon Act), to revise the \nstandards for coverage under the act, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1379\n\n  At the request of Mr. Thomas, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n1379, a bill to make technical amendments to the Fair Debt Collection \nPractices Act, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1386\n\n  At the request of Mr. Burns, the name of the Senator from Mississippi \n[Mr. Cochran] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1386, a bill to provide \nfor soft-metric conversion, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1400\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from Iowa \n[Mr. Grassley] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1400, a bill to require \nthe Secretary of Labor to issue guidance as to the application of the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to insurance company \ngeneral accounts.\n\n\n                                S. 1419\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from New \nYork [Mr. D'Amato] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1419, a bill to \nimpose sanctions against Nigeria.\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 25\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the name of the Senator from Connecticut \n[Mr. Dodd] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Concurrent Resolution 25, \na concurrent resolution concerning the protection and continued \nviability of the Eastern Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/20/senate-section/article/S19010-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19010-S19011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                     WHITEWATER SUBPOENA RESOLUTION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                   D'AMATO AMENDMENTS NOS. 3101-3103\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO proposed three amendments to the resolution (S.

Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the \nbudget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office \nunder section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for \nSenate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, \nthe first concurrent resolution on the budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough December 18, 1995. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, \nand revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 1996 concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. \nRes. 67), show that current level spending is under the budget \nresolution by $131.3 billion in budget authority and by $55.0 billion \nin outlays. Current level is $43 million below the revenue floor in \n1996 and $0.7 billion below the revenue floor \n\n[[Page S19012]]\nover the 5 years 1996-2000. The current estimate of the deficit for \npurposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $190.7 billion, \n$54.9 billion above the maximum deficit amount for 1996 of $245.6 \nbillion.\n  Since my last report, dated December 7, 1995, Congress cleared for \nthe President's signature the Commerce, State, Justice, and the \nJudiciary Appropriations Act (H.R. 2076). These actions, and the \nexpiration of continuing resolution authority on December 15, 1995, \nchanged the current level of budget authority and outlays.\n  The report follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 19, 1995.\n     Hon.

BREIHAN: A COMMITTED PUBLIC SERVANT\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe 38-year career of a dedicated public servant who makes the Internal \nRevenue Service look good. Donald L. Breihan, who is the district \ndirector of the Columbia District of the IRS and who runs the service's \n11 offices across South Carolina, will retire January 5. To put it \nsuccinctly, he'll be missed.\n  For 16 years, Don's down-to-earth, hands-off style of managing nearly \n400 IRS employees in South Carolina has transformed many local tax \ninitiatives and programs into national models. On the job, he is known \nthroughout the Nation for his fairness and professionalism. And in the \ncommunity as an adjunct professor at the school of business at the \nUniversity of South Carolina and as a past member of the board of \ndirectors of the Combined Federal Campaign, Don is known for his \ndedication and service.\n  Don has been head of the Columbia District since 1980. In his years \nthere, he is credited with developing an award-winning Federal/State \nTax Administration Sharing Program. As the IRS Southeast Region \nFederal/State Sharing Program executive, he coordinates Federal/State \nprograms in the nine Southeastern States. Don also oversees the \noperation of Federal tax administration in South Carolina--a job in \nwhich he manages the collection of $11 billion in Federal tax every \nyear from 1.5 million filers of Federal income tax returns.\n  Don was born 60 years ago in St. Louis, MO. He joined the IRS after \nhe got a bachelor's degree in accounting from St. Louis University. In \n1973, he started training in the agency's executive development program \nand became assistant district director of its Richmond, VA, office \nlater that year. After a stint in Baltimore, he moved in 1980 to \nColumbia to take over IRS operations for the State of South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, Don Breihan is not a native of our Palmetto State, but \nhe quickly earned the respect to be treated like one. His hard work, \ncommitment and spirit of dedication make him a tried and true South \nCarolinian. His brand of public service won't be able to be replaced.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to recognize the years of \nenergy and devotion that Donald L. Breihan has worked to make our State \na better place. I am glad that he is making South Carolina his \npermanent home. And I wish him and his wife Nancy all the best during \nDon's retirement and many more happy years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/20/senate-section/article/S19012-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19012-S19013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE MEXICAN PESO CRISIS\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today marks the 1-year anniversary \nof a sad chapter in Mexico's history and a sad chapter in American \nfinancial management by the Clinton administration. After the sudden \ndevaluation of the Mexican peso on December 19, 1994, the Mexican \neconomy continued to collapse. In response to the economic crisis, the \nClinton administration circumvented Congress and unilaterally committed \n$20 billion of United States taxpayer funds to bail out Mexico.\n  The public relations campaign conducted by the Clinton administration \nand the Mexican Government have attempted to portray the Mexican \nbailout as a success and that, given enough time and enough money--\nUnited States taxpayers' money--conditions in Mexico will eventually \nimprove. Public relations campaigns and publicity stunts \n\n[[Page S19013]]\naside, the facts are that the Clinton administration's taxpayer funded \nbailout of Mexico is a colossal failure.\n  In early 1994, Mexico was hailed by the administration as a hallmark \nof success and was embraced as a partner in the North American Free-\nTrade Agreement. The subsequent 2 years have revealed that this image \nwas a costly mirage forced upon the American and Mexican citizens. \nMexico has become a dependent of the United States, looking north for \nmore money to bail out its failed economic and social policies. But the \nanswer to Mexico's problems is, and always has been, in Mexico City, \nnot Washington, DC.\n  I have been saying for almost 1 year that the Clinton \nadministration's bailout was an ill-conceived disaster. It is not just \nmy opinion, it is the cold hard facts--evidenced by the Mexican \neconomic figures. The last few months have demonstrated that the \nMexican financial sector can no longer disguise what is happening in \nMexico. Mexico's economic crisis is now 1 year old and there is no \nindication of any meaningful improvement in Mexico's real economy: \nRecord numbers of Mexicans are out of work, interest rates are soaring, \nthe people are starving, and the country is reeling under increasing \nsocial and political unrest.\n  Mr. President, we must look at the objective facts, and the \nperformance of the Mexican peso is an excellent starting point. On \nDecember 20, 1994, the peso was trading at 3.97. Yesterday the peso \nclosed at 7.54 against the dollar--that is a 50-percent drop in 1 year.\n  Mr. President, no one wants to hold pesos because they are considered \nworthless. As reported by the New York Times on November 11, 1995, ``In \nthe land of the peso, the dollar is common coin.'' But the Mexican \nGovernment continues to spend United States taxpayer dollars in their \nfrantic and futile attempt to support the peso. Money from our Exchange \nStabilization Fund--the ESF--that was supposed to be used to support \nthe dollar. The Clinton administration's use of the ESF was \nunprecedented, and legally tenuous. In August of this year, I sponsored \nthe Senate passed an amendment to the ESF statute which will prevent \nthis administration from using the ESF as the President's personal \npiggybank again.\n  The currency speculators will continue to reap huge profits from the \nfluctuating peso. On December 22, 1994, Mexico adopted a floating rate \nregime, which can only be successful if people have confidence in the \nMexican Central Bank. The Central Bank's performance so far has failed \nto inspire such confidence. These problems are exacerbated by the \ncontinuing dismal condition of the Mexican banking system. I have been \nsaying all year that the Mexican banking system is the weak link in any \nfinancial recovery. In May of this year, the Banking Committee held a \nhearing to review the condition of the banks and their apparent \ninaccurate reports. The end result in that the Mexican Government is \nbailing our Mexican banks. On December 15, 1995, the Mexican Government \nannounced that it was buying $2 billion of bad loans from Banamex, \nMexico's largest financial groups. Where is the Meixcan Government \ngetting this money? From the U.S. taxpayers?\n  In the year since the peso's collapse, Mexico has received over $23 \nbillion from the United States and the IMF and it has not solved \nanything.\n  American taxpayer dollars have been spent paying off private \ninvestors and not one dime of it is staying in Mexico or helping the \nMexican people. Over 1 million jobs have been lost and annual inflation \nhas exceeded 50 percent. It is clear the bailout is a failure, so I \nhope that this administration will not consider throwing more good \nmoney after bad.\n  Mr. President, I want to address a related matter concerning the IMF. \nOn October 18, I sent a letter to the Managing Director of the IMF, Mr. \nCamdessus, requesting the public release of the so-called ``Whittome \nReport''. Two months later, the Congress and the American public still \nhave not seen the Report. The Whittome Report is the result of an \ninternal study by the IMF of its surveillance and response to the \nMexican crisis. According to news articles, the Whittome Report \nconcluded that the IMF distorted its own reporting on Mexico in \nresponse to political pressure from the Mexican Government. The Report \napparently provides a comprehensive analysis of the IMF's monitoring \nand response to the Mexican Economic Crisis. The Congress and the \nAmerican people need all the information we can get on this multi-\nbillion dollar bailout.\n  The United States is the single largest financial contributor to the \nIMF, almost \\1/4\\ of their funds, and we deserve some answers. The IMF \nhas sent $11.4 billion to Mexico this year and they will disburse $1.6 \nbillion more every 3 months until August of next year. So when you add \nthe indirect contributions the United States has made from the IMF to \nthe $12.5 billion the United States has given directly to Mexico, it is \nobvious that we all have a very large stake in this game. When we have \nquestions--we deserve answers.\n  It is unconscionable that full disclosure has not been given the \nCongress--or the American taxpayer--about what happened in this Mexican \nbailout. The Treasury Department has classified the Whittome Report so \nthe American people cannot read it and make their own judgment about \nhow this crisis was handled. That's wrong.\n  In October I introduced a resolution calling for the IMF to release \nthe Whittome Report and requesting that the Treasury Department \ndeclassify it so that the American public can judge it for themselves. \nIf this report is not declassified and made available to the public and \nthe Congress by the start of the next session, I will ask my colleagues \nto vote for this resolution and take further steps to obtain the \ninformation we deserve.\n  Mr. President, the Mexican peso crisis is now 1 year old. It is time \nto reassess the situation and learn all we can from the mistakes that \nwere made. At a time when we are struggling to balance our own budget, \nand make necessary cuts in social programs, we must think long and hard \nabout spending United States tax dollars to bail out Mexico's financial \nproblems.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/20/senate-section/article/S19012-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RETIREMENT OF DAVID COLE\n\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, David Cole, the officer in charge \nof the Memphis office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service is \nsoon to retire. Today I wish to pay tribute to this dedicated civil \nservant.\n  For 34 years David Cole has labored in the vineyards at INS, and, \nalong the way, he earned a law degree from Memphis State University. \nAll who have come in contact with Dave have been impressed with his \nknowledge, his dedication, and his integrity.\n  David Aaron Cole joined the agency as an immigration patrol inspector \non August 15, 1961, at Laredo, TX, following his graduation from \nMississippi State University in Starkville. Dave answered the call \nduring the Berlin crisis and entered the military, assuming active duty \nstatus on December 23, 1961, where he served until August 27, 1962. He \nthen returned to the U.S. Border Patrol in Laredo.\n  On January 6, 1966, Dave was promoted and transferred from the Border \nPatrol to Boston as a records and information specialist. In August \n1967, he was promoted and transferred to records and information \nspecialist in New York City and became chief of records in 1970.\n  On November 19, 1970, Dave was selected as officer in charge, \nMemphis, TN, where he has faithfully served since then.\n  Mr. President, Federal employees are often the brunt of jokes, \ncartoons, and talk shows. There are thousands like David Cole who \nfaithfully do their job without recognition or fanfare.\n  I salute David Cole for his commitment to public service and for his \ndedication to the people he served. I wish him the very best as he \nretires from public service and begins a new career in the private \nsector.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/20/senate-section/article/S19013-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19013-S19014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GENERALIZED SYSTEM OF PREFERENCES\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, renewal of the Generalized System of \nPreferences [``GSP''] duty-free import program is currently up for \nconsideration as part of the budget reconciliation package. The GSP \nprogram allows duty-free imports of certain products into the U.S. from \nwell over 100 GSP eligible nations as a way to help less developed \nnations export into the U.S. market. While I support this program, \n\n[[Page S19014]]\nit is essential to remember that from its inception in the Trade Act of \n1974, the GSP program has provided for the exemption of ``articles \nwhich the President determines to be import-sensitive.'' This is a \ncritical provision to many of our industries.\n  Mr. President, a clear example of an import sensitive article which \nshould not be subject to GSP is ceramic tile. The U.S. ceramic tile \nmarket has been repeatedly recognized as extremely import-sensitive. \nDuring the past thirty-years, this U.S. industry has had to defend \nitself against a variety of unfair and illegal import practices carried \nout by some of our closest trade partners. Imports already dominate the \nU.S. ceramic tile market and have done so for the last decade. They \ncurrently provide nearly 60 percent of the largest and most important \nglazed tile sector according to the 1994 year-end government figures.\n  Moreover, a major guiding principle of the GSP program has been \nreciprocal market access. Currently, GSP eligible beneficiary countries \nsupply almost one-fourth of the U.S. ceramic tile imports, and they are \nrapidly increasing their sales and market shares. U.S. ceramic tile \nmanufacturers, however, are still denied access to many of these \nforeign markets.\n  Also, previous abuses of the GSP eligible status with regard to some \nceramic tile product lines has been well documented. In 1979, the USTR \nrejected various petitions for duty-free treatment of ceramic tile from \ncertain GSP beneficiary countries. With the acquiescence of the U.S. \nindustry, however, the USTR at that time created a duty-free exception \nfor the then minuscule category of irregular edged ``speciality'' \nmosaic tile. Immediately thereafter, foreign manufacturers from major \nGSP beneficiary countries either shifted their production to \n``specialty'' mosaic tile or simply identified their existing products \nas ``specialty'' mosaic tile on customs invoices and stopped paying \nduties on these products. These actions flooded the U.S. market with \nsuperficially restyled or mislabeled duty-free ceramic tile.\n  Mr. President, in light of the increasing foreign dominance of the \nU.S. ceramic tile market, for whatever reason, the U.S. industry has \nbeen recognized by successive Congresses and Administrations as \n``import-sensitive'' dating back to the Dillon and Kennedy Rounds of \nthe General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Yet during this same \nperiod, the American ceramic tile industry has been forced to defend \nitself from over a dozen petitions filed by various designated GSP \neligible countries seeking duty-free GSP treatment for their ceramic \ntile sent into this market.\n  The domestic ceramic tile industry has been fortunate, to date, in \nthe fact that both the USTR and the International Trade Commission thus \nfar have recognized the ``import-sensitivity'' of the U.S. market and \nhave denied these repeated GSP petitions that would result in further \nimport penetration. If, however, just one petitioning nation ever \nsucceeds in gaining GSP benefits for ceramic tile, then all GSP \nbeneficiary countries also are entitled to GSP duty-free benefits for \nceramic tile. If any of these petitions were grated, it would eliminate \nAmerican tile jobs and could devastate this domestic industry.\n  Mr. President, I believe an import sensitive and already import-\ndominated product such as ceramic tile should not have to continually \ndefend itself against repeated duty-free petitions but should be \nexempted from this program in some manner. While I understand USTR has \nserious reservations about granting exemptions without periodic review, \nI am hopeful we can find some common ground so that the ceramic tile \nindustry does not have to defend itself each and every year.\n  While I support reauthorization of the GSP program, I trust and \nexpect that import-sensitive products such as ceramic tile will not be \nsubject to GSP.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/20/senate-section/article/S19013-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19014-S19015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HOWARD H.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:.\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2547) to designate the United States \n     courthouse located at 800 Market Street in Knoxville, \n     Tennessee, as the ``Howard H. Baker, Jr., United States \n     Courthouse.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I am pleased to support this bill \nwhich will designate the new United States Federal Courthouse in \nKnoxville, TN as the Howard H. Baker, Jr. United States Courthouse. I \nthink it is fitting that this newly purchased courthouse be named for \none of the most distinguished members ever to grace this body, a true \ngentleman who served his Nation for nearly 20 years as Senator from \nTennessee, Senate Majority Leader, and, finally, White House Chief of \nStaff.\n  Senator Howard Baker begin his career as an attorney in Huntsville \nand nearby Knoxville, TN, after his graduation from the University of \nTennessee School of Law. In 1966, he was elected to the United States \nSenate. Here, he established a lasting reputation as an outstanding \nlawmaker. Because of his broad appeal in our home state, the people of \nTennessee chose to reelect him in 1972 and again in 1978.\n  In 1973, I had the opportunity to work under Senator Baker as he \nserved as Vice Chairman of the Senate Watergate Committee. His \nleadership on this investigatory committee proved to be an asset as he \nhelped this investigation during one of the most difficult time in our \nNation's history.\n  From 1977 to 1981, Senator Baker served as Republican Leader of the \nSenate. In 1981, he became first Republican in more than 25 years to be \nelected Senate Majority Leader, a post he held until his retirement in \nJanuary of 1985. During all of his Senate service, Senator Baker was \nknown for his fair and impartial treatment of members from both sides \nof the aisle. He was also known in the Senate as someone who could \nbring both sides of an issue together, especially when political \npartisanship was intense.\n  In 1987, Senator Baker again answered his country's call, returning \nto public service as Chief of Staff to President Reagan. His tenure \ncame at a difficult time for the Reagan Administration, during the \nIran-Contra controversy. Senator Baker helped to steer the \nAdministration through this trying situation, uncovering the relevant \ndetails of the controversy and helping to convey them to the public.\n  My friend, Howard Baker, who recently celebrated his 70th birthday, \nhas retired from public service but continues to work on the behalf of \nmany worthwhile causes. Over the years, he has received a number of \nawards and honors including The Presidential Medal or Freedom and the \nJefferson Award  for  Greatest  Public Service Performed by an Elected \nor Appointed Official. In addition,  he has been presented a number of \nhonorary degrees from several institutions of higher education, \nincluding: Bradley, Centre College, Dartmouth, Georgetown, Pepperdine, \nand Yale.\n  As Senator Baker has served his country and Tennessee admirably and \nwell for nearly two decades, and it is my hope that the U.S. Senate \nwill see fit to observe this service by naming the U.S. Courthouse in \nKnoxville in his honor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I rise today in support of the bill \noffered by Senator Thompson and myself, which would designate the U.S. \nCourthouse located at 800 Market Street in Knoxville, Tennessee, as the \n``Howard H. Baker, Jr. United States Courthouse.''\n  In 1966, Senator Baker became the first Republican ever popularly \nelected to the U.S. Senate from Tennessee, and he won reelection by \nwide margins in 1972 and 1978. Senator Baker first won national \nrecognition in 1973 as the Vice Chairman of the Senate Watergate \nCommittee. He was the keynote speaker at the Republican National \nConvention in 1976, and a candidate for the Republican Presidential \nnomination in 1980.\n  He served in the Senate from 1967 until January 1985, and concluded \nhis Senate career by serving two terms as \n\n[[Page S19015]]\nMinority Leader (1977-1981) and two terms as Majority Leader (1981-\n1985).\n  I came to know Howard Baker when I was making my decision to run for \nthe U.S. Senate. He listened carefully, gave me excellent counsel, and \nhelped steer me and my wife Karyn in the right direction as we made our \ndecision. Like so many of my colleagues here in the Senate, I continue \nto rely on his advice, and am proud to call him my friend.\n  Madam President, the Howard Baker Courthouse will stand as a \nwonderful tribute to a dedicated and distinguished senator, Howard \nBaker. I urge my colleagues to support this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that it is the policy of the United \n     States to deny Iran the ability to support international \n     terrorism and to fund the development and acquisition of \n     weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them by \n     limiting the development of petroleum resources in Iran.\n\n     SEC. 4.

DESCRIPTION OF SANCTIONS.\n\n       The sanctions to be imposed on a person under section 4(a) \n     are as follows:\n       (1) Export-import bank assistance for exports to sanctioned \n     persons.--The President may direct the Export-Import Bank of \n     the United States not to guarantee, insure, extend credit, or \n     participate in the extension of credit in connection with the \n     export of any goods or services to any sanctioned person.\n       (2) Export sanction.--The President may order the United \n     States Government not to issue any specific license and not \n     to grant any other specific permission or authority to export \n     any goods or technology to a sanctioned person under--\n       (A) the Export Administration Act of 1979;\n       (B) the Arms Export Control Act;\n       (C) the Atomic Energy Act of 1954; or\n       (D) any other statute that requires the prior review and \n     approval of the United States Government as a condition for \n     the exportation of goods and services, or their re-export, to \n     any person designated by the President under section 4(a).\n       (3) Loans from united states financial institutions.--The \n     United States Government may prohibit any United States \n     financial institution from making any loan or providing any \n     credit to any sanctioned person in an amount exceeding \n     $10,000,000 in any 12-month period (or two or more loans of \n     more than $5,000,000 each in such period) unless such person \n     is engaged in activities to relieve human suffering within \n     the meaning of section 203(b)(2) of the International \n     Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n       (4) Prohibitions on financial institutions.--The following \n     prohibitions may be imposed against financial institutions \n     sanctioned under section 4(a):\n       (A) Designation as primary dealer.--Neither the Board of \n     Governors of the Federal Reserve System nor the Federal \n     Reserve Bank of New York may designate, or permit the \n     continuation of any prior designation of, such financial \n     institution as a primary dealer in United States Government \n     debt instruments.\n       (B) Government funds.--Such financial institution shall not \n     serve as agent of the United States Government or serve as \n     repository for United States Government funds.\n\n     SEC. 6. ADVISORY OPINIONS.\n\n       The Secretary of State may, upon the request of any person, \n     issue an advisory opinion, to that person as to whether a \n     proposed activity by \n\n[[Page S19016]]\n     that person would subject that person to sanctions under this Act. Any \n     person who relies in good faith on such an advisory opinion \n     which states that the proposed activity would not subject a \n     person to such sanctions, and any person who thereafter \n     engages in such activity, may not be made subject to such \n     sanctions on account of such activity.\n\n     SEC. 7. DURATION OF SANCTIONS; PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER.\n\n       (a) Delay of Sanctions.--\n       (1) Consultations.--If the President makes a determination \n     described in section 4(a) with respect to a foreign person, \n     the Congress urges the President to initiate consultations \n     immediately with the government with primary jurisdiction \n     over that foreign person with respect to the imposition of \n     sanctions pursuant to this Act.\n       (2) Actions by government of jurisdiction.--In order to \n     pursue such consultations with that government, the President \n     may delay imposition of sanctions pursuant to this Act for up \n     to 90 days. Following such consultations, the President shall \n     immediately impose a sanction or sanctions unless the \n     President determines and certifies to the Congress that the \n     government has taken specific and effective actions, \n     including, as appropriate, the imposition of appropriate \n     penalties, to terminate the involvement of the foreign person \n     in the activities that resulted in the determination by the \n     President pursuant to section 4(a) concerning such person.\n       (3) Additional delay in imposition of sanctions.--The \n     President may delay the imposition of sanctions for up to an \n     additional 90 days if the President determines and certifies \n     to the Congress that the government with primary jurisdiction \n     over the foreign person is in the process of taking the \n     actions described in paragraph (2).\n       (4) Report to congress.--Not later than 90 days after \n     making a determination under section 4(a), the President \n     shall submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n     Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives a report which \n     shall include information on the status of consultations with \n     the appropriate foreign government under this subsection, and \n     the basis for any determination under paragraph (3).\n       (b) Duration of Sanctions..--The requirement to impose \n     sanctions pursuant to section 4(a) shall remain in effect \n     until the President determines that the sanctioned person is \n     no longer engaging in the activity that led to the imposition \n     of sanctions.\n       (c) Presidential Waiver.--(1) The President may waive the \n     requirement in section 4(a) to impose a sanction or sanctions \n     on a person in section 4(b), and may waive the continued \n     imposition of a sanction or sanctions under subsection (b) of \n     this section, 15 days after the President determines and so \n     reports to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives that it is \n     important to the national interest of the United States to \n     exercise such waiver authority.\n       (2) Any such report shall provide a specific and detailed \n     rationale for such determination, including--\n       (A) a description of the conduct that resulted in the \n     determination;\n       (B) in the case of a foreign person, an explanation of the \n     efforts to secure the cooperation of the government with \n     primary jurisdiction of the sanctioned person to terminate \n     or, as appropriate, penalize the activities that resulted in \n     the determination;\n       (C) an estimate as to the significance of the investment to \n     Iran's ability to develop its petroleum resources; and\n       (D) a statement as to the response of the United States in \n     the event that such person engages in other activities that \n     would be subject to section 4(a).\n\n     SEC. 8. TERMINATION OF SANCTIONS.\n\n       The sanctions requirement of section 4 shall no longer have \n     force or effect if the President determines and certifies to \n     the appropriate congressional committees that Iran--\n       (1) has ceased its efforts to design, develop, manufacture, \n     or acquire--\n       (A) a nuclear explosive device or related materials and \n     technology;\n       (B) chemical and biological weapons; or\n       (C) ballistic missiles and ballistic missile launch \n     technology; and\n       (2) has been removed from the list of state sponsors of \n     international terrorism under section 6(j) of the Export \n     Administration Act of 1979.\n\n     SEC. 9. REPORT REQUIRED.\n\n       The President shall ensure the continued transmittal to \n     Congress of reports describing--\n       (1) the nuclear and other military capabilities of Iran, as \n     required by section 601(a) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Act of 1978 and section 1607 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1993; and\n       (2) the support provided by Iran for acts of international \n     terrorism, as part of the Department of State's annual report \n     on international terrorism.\n\n     SEC. 10. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committees \n     on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and Foreign Relations \n     of the Senate and the Committees on Banking and Financial \n     Services and International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (2) Financial institution.--The term ``financial \n     institution'' includes--\n       (A) a depository institution (as defined in section 3(c)(1) \n     of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), including a branch or \n     agency of a foreign bank (as defined in section 1(b)(7) of \n     the International Banking Act of 1978);\n       (B) a credit union;\n       (C) a securities firm, including a broker or dealer;\n       (D) an insurance company, including an agency or \n     underwriter;\n       (E) any other company that provides financial services; or\n       (F) any subsidiary of such financial institution.\n       (3) Investment.--The term ``investment'' means--\n       (A) the entry into a contract that includes responsibility \n     for the development of petroleum resources located in Iran, \n     or the entry into a contract providing for the general \n     supervision and guarantee of another person's performance of \n     such a contract;\n       (B) the purchase of a share of ownership in that \n     development; or\n       (C) the entry into a contract providing for participation \n     in royalties, earnings, or profits in that development, \n     without regard to the form of the participation.\n       (4) Person.--The term ``person'' means a natural person as \n     well as a corporation, business association, partnership, \n     society, trust, any other nongovernmental entity, \n     organization, or group, and any governmental entity operating \n     as a business enterprise, and any successor of any such \n     entity.\n       (5) Petroleum resources.--The term ``petroleum resources'' \n     includes petroleum and natural gas resources.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3106\n\n (Purpose: To deter investment in the development of Libya's petroleum \n                               resources)\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk in \nbehalf of Senators Kennedy and D'Amato, and I ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Santorum), for Mr. \n     Kennedy, for himself and Mr. D'Amato, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3106.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . APPLICATION OF THE ACT TO LIBYA.\n\n       The sanctions of this Act, including the terms and \n     conditions for the imposition, duration, and termination of \n     sanctions, shall apply to persons making investments for the \n     development of petroleum resources in Libya in the same \n     manner as those sanctions apply under this Act to persons \n     making investments for such development in Iran.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I rise in support of the Kennedy-\nD'Amato amendment to S. 1228, the Iran Oil Sanctions Act of 1995.\n  What can one say about Libya. It has now been over 4 years since the \nUnited States indicted two Libyan agents, Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and \nAbdel Basset Ali Megrahi, for responsibility in the bombing of Pan Am \nFlight 103 in December 1988. So far there has been no action, no \nsurrender of these men. We must answer the cry for justice by the \nfamilies of the 270 victims of this terrorist attack, 189 of them \nAmericans, with 35 from New York State.\n  For us to add Libya to a bill placing sanctions on those countries \nwhich seek to develop Iran's petroleum resources is, I feel, a \njustified action. We must send the message that terrorism, sponsorship \nof terrorism, and those who subsidize terrorism will not be ignored.\n  Mu'ammar Qadhafi brazenly dismisses the indictment while at the same \ntime pounding his chest, bragging to the world that he has again \nwithstood American aggression. His offer to try the two agents in a \nLibyan court is a mockery of justice and an insult to the families of \nthe victims.\n  Just yesterday, a Scottish businessman was charged in a Boston court \nwith violating the U.S. embargo on Libya by attempting to export over \n250,000 dollars' worth of computers and related equipment. This is only \nfurther proof that Qadhafi is still up to his old games and is trying \nto flaunt our sanctions against him.\n  I want to discuss, very briefly, the amount of oil that the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD] countries \nbuy from Libya. According to the Energy Department, OECD countries \nbought over $7 billion in oil from Libya in 1994. The worst offenders \nwere Italy, with over $3 billion and Germany with over $1 billion.\n  As far as how this legislation would effect Libya, one need only look \nat the \n\n[[Page S19017]]\ncontracts signed by European firms in the last few years. Just in \nAugust, a Spanish company Repsol, awarded a Cypriot company a $155 \nmillion contract to build a crude oil pipeline in Libya. Furthermore, \nEuropean companies such as Agip--Italy, Total--France, Petrofina--\nBelgium, OMV--Austria, and Veba--Germany, have all signed contracts for \nupstream activities in Libya and would be affected by this bill.\n  While the focus of the underlying bill has been Iran and an attempt \nto stop the subsidizing of Iranian terrorism, I cannot see why we \nshould not seek to prevent the subsidizing of Libyan terrorism at the \nsame time? More importantly, who is to say that the attack on Pan Am \n103 was not directed by Iran and conducted by the Libyans. If this were \nthe case, than we will get two terrorist states with one bill.\n  There can be no rest until the individuals who ordered, directed, and \npaid for the commission of the terrible crime of the bombing of Pan Am \nFight 103 are brought to justice, no matter where they may be located. \nThe investigation of the bombing must continue to be vigorously and \nintensively pursued. Libya, with a long and documented history of \nobscene violations of human rights and international law, must pay the \nprice for its part in this slaughter and its past support for other \ninternational terrorist acts.\n  It is for this reason, that I enthusiastically agree with the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and am glad to have worked with him on this issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I offer an amendment to apply the \nsanctions in this legislation to Libya.\n  I support the pending bill which is intended to provide a stronger \ndeterrent to the development of nuclear weapons by Iran by applying \neconomic sanctions to those in other countries who substantially assist \nIran in Oil production.\n  My amendment extends the same sanctions to those who help Libya in \noil production. Its purpose is to use stronger economic sanctions to \nencourage the Government of Libya to turn over the two suspects \nindicted for the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.\n  On December 21, 1988, 7 years ago tomorrow, in one of the worst \nterrorist atrocities in recent years, Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up \nover Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 citizens of 21 nations, including \n189 Americans.\n  In November 1991, two Libyan national were indicted for carrying out \nthat bombing. Despite U.N. economic sanctions which have been in force \nsince 1992, the Government of Libya has refused to turn over the \nsuspects, and the two suspects remain in Libya under the protection of \nColonial Qadhafi.\n  Many of us on both sides of the aisle have called for stronger \ninternational sanctions against Libya, including an international oil \nembargo, and our proposals have had the strong support of both Senator \nD'Amato and Senator Helms.\n  Because of Libya's earlier well-known support for terrorism, the \nUnited States imposed our own oil embargo against Libya during the \nReagan administration in 1986, 2 years before the Pan Am bombing. Our \nefforts since the Pan Am bombing to persuade other nations to join the \noil embargo have not succeeded, primarily because several European \ncountries purchase oil from Libya and refuse to support such a measure.\n  Additional sanctions on Libya are essential if we are to have any \nchance of bringing the terrorists to trial. This bill offers an \neffective opportunity to enact such sanctions.\n  According to experts familiar with oil production investment in \nLibya, this action may very well affect the investment plans of \nnumerous foreign oil companies.\n  as in the case of Iran, this amendment will not prevent any foreign \ncompanies from doing business in Libya. But they will not be able to do \nso with the benefit of U.S. assistance.\n  This Christmas season is a very difficult time for the families of \nthe victims of Pan Am flight 103. We cannot bring back their loved \nones. What we can do is take every available step to see that the \nterrorists charged with committing this atrocity are finally at long \nlast brought to justice. This is one such step, and I urge the Senate \nto support it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I rise in support of S. 1228, the Iran \nOil Sanctions Act of 1995. This bill would put sanctions on foreign \ncompanies that invest in Iran and thereby help that country develop its \noil and gas resources. The increased revenue from such enhanced oil \nproduction augments Iran's ability to fund its development of nuclear \nweapons and its support for international terrorism.\n  Since the Iranian Revolution in 1979, American administrations with \nbipartisan congressional support have used economic sanctions to hinder \nIran's support for international terrorism and to make it harder for \nthat country to get materials and revenues to strengthen its nuclear \nand conventional weapons programs.\n  Earlier this year, just prior to the Banking Committee's March 16 \nhearing on our country's economic relations with Iran, the committee \nlearned that then existing restrictions on such relations did not \nprohibit the Conoco Co. from signing a contract with Iran to develop a \nhuge offshore oil field in the Persian Gulf. The Clinton administration \nimmediately announced that while Conoco's actions were not illegal, \nthey were inconsistent with our policy of bringing pressure on Iran, \nboth politically and economically to change its unacceptable behavior. \nThe President then on March 15 issued an Executive order prohibiting \nU.S. persons from entering into contracts for the financing or the \noverall supervision and management of the petroleum resources of Iran.\n  On May 8, President Clinton issued another Executive order that \nimposed significant new economic sanctions on Iran, including a \nprohibition on trading in goods or services of Iranian origin, a ban on \nexports to Iran, and a ban on new investment or bank loans to Iran. The \nnew prohibitions applied to U.S. persons, wherever they may be, \nincluding the foreign branches of U.S. entities.\n  The Clinton administration also urged other countries to support \nUnited States efforts to pressure Iran economically and persuaded our \nG7 allies to avoid any collaboration with Iran that might help that \ncountry develop a nuclear weapons capability. A number of foreign \ncorporations, however, are supporting Iran's efforts to increase its \noil and gas production. S. 1228 seeks to persuade such companies from \nassisting Iran as the latter uses its oil and gas revenues to fund \nbehavior harmful to the international community.\n  At the Banking Committee's October 11 hearing on S. 1228, Under \nSecretary of State Tarnoff told the committee that a straight line \nlinks Iran's oil income and its ability to sponsor terrorism, build \nweapons of mass destruction, and acquire sophisticated armaments. He \nalso told us that the administration was making great efforts to \npersuade other nations to cooperate with our embargo of Iran. He \nexpressed concerns, however, that we not enact legislation that would \nmake it more difficult to get that cooperation. Chairman D'Amato \nassured Under Secretary Tarnoff that he wanted to work with the \nadministration in crafting legislation that would persuade foreign \ncompanies to cooperate with our embargo of Iran.\n  Prior to the December 12 committee markup of S. 1228, Chairman \nD'Amato, Senator Boxer, myself, and other members of the committee \nworked with the administration to develop a bill the administration \ncould endorse. Agreement was reached and on December 12, the committee \nadopted a substitute version of S. 1228 that President Clinton \nsupports.\n  It does not target trade but rather new investment contracts that \nenhance Iran's ability to produce oil and gas. The bill also provides \nthe President the necessary flexibility to determine the best mix of \nsanctions in a particular case, and to waive the imposition, or \ncontinued imposition, of sanctions when he determines it is important \nto the national interest to do so. In using these authorities, the \nPresident is directed to consider factors such as the significance of \nan investment, the prospects of cooperation with other governments, \nU.S. international commitments, and the effect of sanctions on U.S. \neconomic interests and regional policies. Finally, S. 1228 authorizes \nthe Secretary of State to provide advisory \n\n[[Page S19018]]\nopinions on whether a proposed activity would be covered to avoid \nunnecessary uncertainty on the part of companies and friction with \nallies.\n  This bill was reported out of committee by a vote of 15 to 0. It is a \nbill I support because it will make it more difficult for Iran to fund \nits efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction and its support for \ninternational terrorism. I urge its enactment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be considered read and agreed to, the committee amendment be \nagreed to, the bill be deemed a third time, passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the \nbill be placed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 3106) was agreed to.\n  So the committee amendment was agreed to.\n  So the bill (S. 1228), as amended, was deemed read for a third time, \nand passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1228\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Iran Oil Sanctions Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The efforts of the Government of Iran to acquire \n     weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them and \n     its support of international terrorism endanger the national \n     security and foreign policy interests of the United States \n     and those countries with which it shares common strategic and \n     foreign policy objectives.\n       (2) The objective of preventing the proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism \n     through existing multilateral and bilateral initiatives \n     requires additional efforts to deny Iran the financial means \n     to sustain its nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile \n     weapons programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that it is the policy of the United \n     States to deny Iran the ability to support international \n     terrorism and to fund the development and acquisition of \n     weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them by \n     limiting the development of petroleum resources in Iran.\n\n     SEC. 4.

ADVISORY OPINIONS.\n\n       The Secretary of State may, upon the request of any person, \n     issue an advisory opinion, to that person as to whether a \n     proposed activity by that person would subject that person to \n     sanctions under this Act. Any person who relies in good faith \n     on such an advisory opinion which states that the proposed \n     activity would not subject a person to such sanctions, and \n     any person who thereafter engages in such activity, may not \n     be made subject to such sanctions on account of such \n     activity.\n\n     SEC. 7. DURATION OF SANCTIONS; PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER.\n\n       (a) Delay of Sanctions.--\n       (1) Consultations.--If the President makes a determination \n     described in section 4(a) with respect to a foreign person, \n     the Congress urges the President to initiate consultations \n     immediately with the government with primary jurisdiction \n     over that foreign person with respect to the imposition of \n     sanctions pursuant to this Act.\n       (2) Actions by government of jurisdiction.--In order to \n     pursue such consultations with that government, the President \n     may delay imposition of sanctions pursuant to this Act for up \n     to 90 days. Following such consultations, the President shall \n     immediately impose a sanction or sanctions unless the \n     President determines and certifies to the Congress that the \n     government has taken specific and effective actions, \n     including, as appropriate, the imposition of appropriate \n     penalties, to terminate the involvement of the foreign person \n     in the activities that resulted in the determination by the \n     President pursuant to section 4(a) concerning such person.\n       (3) Additional delay in imposition of sanctions.--The \n     President may delay the imposition of sanctions for up to an \n     additional 90 days if the President determines and certifies \n     to the Congress that the government with primary jurisdiction \n     over the foreign person is in the process of taking the \n     actions described in paragraph (2).\n       (4) Report to congress.--Not later than 90 days after \n     making a determination under section 4(a), the President \n     shall submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n     Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives a report which \n     shall include information on the status of consultations with \n     the appropriate foreign government under this subsection, and \n     the basis for any determination under paragraph (3).\n       (b) Duration of Sanctions..--The requirement to impose \n     sanctions pursuant to section 4(a) shall remain in effect \n     until the President determines that the sanctioned person is \n     no longer engaging in the activity that led to the imposition \n     of sanctions.\n       (c) Presidential Waiver.--(1) The President may waive the \n     requirement in section 4(a) to impose a sanction or sanctions \n     on a person in section 4(b), and may waive the continued \n     imposition of a sanction or sanctions under subsection (b) of \n     this section, 15 days after the President determines and so \n     reports to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives that it is \n     important to the national interest of the United States to \n     exercise such waiver authority.\n       (2) Any such report shall provide a specific and detailed \n     rationale for such determination, including--\n       (A) a description of the conduct that resulted in the \n     determination;\n       (B) in the case of a foreign person, an explanation of the \n     efforts to secure the cooperation of the government with \n     primary jurisdiction of the sanctioned person to terminate \n     or, as appropriate, penalize the activities that resulted in \n     the determination;\n       (C) an estimate as to the significance of the investment to \n     Iran's ability to develop its petroleum resources; and\n       (D) a statement as to the response of the United States in \n     the event that such person \n\n[[Page S19019]]\n     engages in other activities that would be subject to section 4(a).\n\n     SEC. 8. TERMINATION OF SANCTIONS.\n\n       The sanctions requirement of section 4 shall no longer have \n     force or effect if the President determines and certifies to \n     the appropriate congressional committees that Iran--\n       (1) has ceased its efforts to design, develop, manufacture, \n     or acquire--\n       (A) a nuclear explosive device or related materials and \n     technology;\n       (B) chemical and biological weapons; or\n       (C) ballistic missiles and ballistic missile launch \n     technology; and\n       (2) has been removed from the list of state sponsors of \n     international terrorism under section 6(j) of the Export \n     Administration Act of 1979.\n\n     SEC. 9. REPORT REQUIRED.\n\n       The President shall ensure the continued transmittal to \n     Congress of reports describing--\n       (1) the nuclear and other military capabilities of Iran, as \n     required by section 601(a) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Act of 1978 and section 1607 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1993; and\n       (2) the support provided by Iran for acts of international \n     terrorism, as part of the Department of State's annual report \n     on international terrorism.\n\n     SEC. 10.

CLARIFICATION OF REIMBURSEMENT TO STATES FOR \n                   FEDERALLY FUNDED EMPLOYEES.\n\n       Section 124 of the joint resolution entitled ``A joint \n     resolution making further continuing appropriations for the \n     fiscal year 1996, and for other purposes'', approved November \n     20, 1995 (Public Law 104--56) is amended by adding at the end \n     thereof the following new subsection:\n       ``(b)(1) If during the period beginning November 14, 1995, \n     through November 19, 1995, a State used State funds to \n     continue carrying out a Federal program or furloughed State \n     employees whose compensation is advanced or reimbursed in \n     whole or in part by the Federal Government--\n       ``(A) such furloughed employees shall be compensated at \n     their standard rate of compensation for such period;\n       ``(B) the State shall be reimbursed for expenses that would \n     have been paid by the Federal Government during such period \n     had appropriations been available, including the cost of \n     compensating such furloughed employees, together with \n     interest thereon due under section 6503(d) of title 31, \n     United States Code; and\n       ``(C) the State may use funds available to the State under \n     such Federal program to reimburse such State, together with \n     interest thereon due under section 6503(d) of title 31, \n     United States Code.\n       ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term `State' \n     shall have the meaning as such term is defined under the \n     applicable Federal program under paragraph (1).''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on November 28, I introduced legislation \nto fix an inadvertent effect of the 6-day Government shutdown between \nNovember 14 through November 19, 1995. That bill, S. 1429, with the \namendment that I currently am introducing, will allow hundreds of State \nemployees who administer the disability determination program of the \nSocial Security Administration and who administer vocational \nrehabilitation programs for the Department of Education to receive the \npay that they lost during the Government shutdown. The fact that they \n\n[[Page S19020]]\nwere not paid was not intended, but it has occurred, and I and those \nwho have cosponsored this legislation are anxious to fix this problem. \nMy distinguished cosponsors include Senators Lott, Warner, Stevens, \nCohen, Exon, Pressler, Hutchison, Cochran, Bingaman, Thomas, Kerrey, \nGrassley, and Harkin.\n  Mr. President, the furlough pay language that the Congress adopted as \npart of House Joint Resolution 122, the Further Continuing Resolution \nfor Fiscal Year 1996, was the language that previous Congresses have \nadopted to provide compensation to Federal employees during periods of \nGovernment closure.\n  This language was enacted to provide compensation to Federal \nemployees affected by Government closure in 1984, 1986, 1987, and 1990. \nThis language was provided to Congress to the Administration to meet \nour stated intent that Federal workers should not suffer a loss of pay \nas a result of the 6-day closure of the Federal Government.\n  I introduced S. 1429 when it was brought to my attention that the \nlanguage included in the Continuing Resolution regarding the payment of \ncompensation might not cover all employees who were subject to the \nfurlough, mostly State employees paid with Federal funds to administer \nFederal programs.\n  The affected agencies and the General Accounting Office have reviewed \nthe language that I am offering as a substitute to S. 1429 and indicate \nthat it will fix this inadvertent consequence. It will ensure that \nthese State employees receive their pay, or in cases where States used \ntheir own funding to pay these workers, the State can be reimbursed for \nthose costs.\n  Mr. President, it was and is clearly the intent of the Congress to \npay Federal workers and State workers who administer Federal programs \nfor the 6-day period of the Government shutdown. The language I am \noffering will carry out this intent, and I urge my colleagues to adopt \nthe bill, S. 1429, as amended.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I support this legislation which makes \nclear that it is the intent of Congress that all furloughed Federal \nworkers, including federally funded State workers, affected by the \nshutdown of the Federal Government receive their pay.\n  The Congress adopted furlough pay language as part of the continuing \nresolution, House Joint Resolution 122, to provide compensation to \nFederal Employees affected by the recent 6-day Government closure.\n  The continuing resolution has been interpreted by some to not cover \nall employees who were affected by the Government closure. For \ninstance, there are State employees paid with 100 percent Federal funds \nwho make disability determinations and administer unemployment \ninsurance benefits who may not be covered by the language in the \ncontinuing resolution regarding the payment of employees who were \nsubject to furlough.\n  This legislation ensures that 100 percent federally funded State \nemployees affected by the furlough receive their pay as Congress \nintended, and that States using their own funds to make up for the lack \nof Federal funds for these employees are reimbursed to carry out 100 \npercent federally supported functions.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the bill be deemed read a third time, passed, \nas amended, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the bill be placed at the appropriate place \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 3107) was agreed to.\n  So the bill (S. 1429), as amended, was deemed read a third time, and \npassed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1429\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, I have waited around the floor of the \nSenate tonight because I wanted to make a few remarks about where we \nstand in this battle for some sanity around here in the Congress.\n  We are now in the 5th day of our second Government shutdown this \nyear. It seems to me if we have any obligation, it is to keep the \npeople's business moving forward. It is totally unnecessary to have \nthis shutdown, but for the fact that there are some who want to \nessentially hold a legislative gun to the head of President Clinton and \nuse the threat of a shutdown, indeed, the fact of a shutdown, to force \nhim to sign a 7-year budget that in his opinion will harm the American \npeople because there are terribly deep cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, \neducation and the environment, and tax increases on those people \nearning under $30,000 a year.\n  So the President is not going to agree to that. So there are those on \nthe Republican side, particularly on the House side, who believe that \nshutting down this Government is a perfectly legitimate way for them to \nexpress their dissatisfaction with President Clinton for not signing \nthis very extreme and very radical budget.\n  The President is not going to sign it. The American people do not \nwant a President who will fold under that kind of tactic. And here we \nstand. No reason at all. I was here on the weekend, Sunday, when the \nDemocratic side offered an opportunity to resolve this, pass the \nresolution, the continuing resolution, keep the Government going, and \ncontinue the hard and fast negotiations that have begun. But no. I have \nnever seen anything quite like it.\n  I saw a freshman Republican Member of the House on national \ntelevision tonight, all smiles. He thinks this is really fun and games. \nHe said he did not care if the Government ever opened up again as far \nas he was concerned. He would not vote to keep the Government going \nuntil the President signed a budget he agreed with.\n  I think that representative ought to read the Constitution. He may \nnot understand that we have a separation of powers and a balance of \npowers. The fact of the matter is, as much as this representative does \nnot like it, President Clinton is a Democrat and so are many Members of \nthe House and Senate. The Republicans do not run the White House or, \nfrankly, have a working control over the Senate or the House. There are \nvery close margins here, and so they have to compromise. But this young \nfellow does not seem to have the word ``compromise'' in his vocabulary.\n  But I will tell you one thing he has in his pocket, he has his \npaycheck. He has his paycheck in his pocket. He can demagog this issue \nand never feel the pain. But the American people, who deserve to have \nthe parks open, who deserve to have the veterans checks sent out, who \ndeserve to have a functioning Government, deserve to be able to get a \npassport, if they need it.\n  They are getting hurt, inconvenienced. For what? For what? Newt \nGingrich has said several times he is going to vote to pay all these \npeople who are not going to work. What is going on here? What is going \non?\n  So there are Federal employees, despite Newt Gingrich's comments, who \nare not getting paid right now. Oh, but Members of Congress, we are \ngetting our pay. It is just fine and dandy. What a legislative \nrunaround my ``No Budget, No Pay'' bill has been given. And if I ever \ngo into the classroom to teach a course in Government, I am going to \nbring this chart with me. It says ``No Budget, No Pay. How a Bill Does \nNot Become a Law.'' I have never seen a runaround like it.\n\n  Three times--three times--Senators have passed this legislation. \nSenator Dole supports it, Senator Daschle supports it; Republicans and \nDemocrats alike--approved, approved, approved. Passed as an amendment \nto the D.C. appropriations bill. Unfortunately, the D.C. bill is stuck \nand we do not know the fate of ``No Budget, No Pay.'' But it does not \nlook promising.\n  Amendment to the reconciliation bill--knocked out.\n  Amendment to the ICC sunset bill, which may come up tomorrow --\nknocked out.\n  Who knocked it out? The Republican Congress.\n  Blocked in the House by the leadership-controlled Rules Committee \nwhich refuses to allow a vote on it.\n  Five times Congressman Dick Durbin tried to get a vote. It is real \nsimple. If Federal employees do not get their pay, neither should we. \nBlocked, stalled. And the President waits with his pen to sign it. He \nsupports this. His pay would be docked as well. So ``How a Bill Does \nNot Become a Law,'' a new chapter in the textbook of our children--a \nsad new chapter.\n  Newt Gingrich has consistently blocked a House vote on this bill. I \nhave to, again, say to my friends on the other side, they ought to read \nthe Constitution, Article I, Section 7, which says:\n\n       Every bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a \n     Law, be presented to the President of the United States. * * \n     * \n\n  Imagine, we have a President and he has to sign the bill. If he does \nnot like it and if he thinks it is harmful, if he thinks it cuts too \ndeeply into Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment, he \nwill not sign it, he will veto it. Then what happens? It does not say \nshut down the Government. It does not say that. It says that if two-\nthirds of those voting override him, the bill shall become law. \nEveryone should read the Constitution every once in a while--especially \nthe new freshmen over there. They do not control the President of the \nUnited States of America. Thank goodness. Thank goodness, or we would \nhave a mean-spirited country.\n  Now, this Government shutdown, while more limited than the first one, \nhas caused great hardship. National parks have closed; veterans \nbenefits checks, due next week, will not be sent; passport offices \nvirtually have closed, and the program for tracking deadbeat dads is \nnot operating.\n  Swell. Where are our family values? Family values. But shut down the \nprogram that tracks the deadbeat dads, and you, Members of Congress, \nkeep getting your pay.\n  Lovely. Great values. Great values for our kids.\n  Safety inspections of new toys have stopped. Great timing.\n  New FHA homeowner loans are not being processed for people who want \nto buy their first home.\n  I have talked, on this floor, about the individuals who work for the \nFederal Government, who went to work for their country because they are \nproud to work for their country, and they cannot even buy their kids \nChristmas gifts. But Members of Congress, oh, we can get our kids \ngifts--Hanukkah gifts, Christmas gifts. It is OK because we are so \nimportant that we set ourselves above the other working men and women \nof the Federal Government.\n  A lot of our Federal employees are not independently wealthy. They \nlive from paycheck to paycheck. Some families have two workers in them \nthat both work for the Federal Government, like Larry Drake and his \nwife Joan. Larry works for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Joan \nworks at the Public Health Service. Both have been furloughed. Their \nfamily has lost 100 percent of its income. They do not know if \n\n[[Page S19023]]\nthey will get it back or when they will get it back. They hope they \nwill get it back. They want to go to work. If this shutdown lasts long, \nthey may not be able to make their mortgage payment.\n\n  Ray Montgomery works for the Census Bureau in Los Angeles. He is \nclassified as an intermittent employee even though he works 40 hours a \nweek, but he will not ever recover his back pay. Ray told my office he \nis so worried about the second shutdown he has not bought any Christmas \npresents for his family. Ray wrote to me,\n\n       For heavens sakes, I am one paycheck away from being \n     homeless. I work hard to be a credit for my country. I try to \n     be a good representative of Government employees for the \n     American people.\n\n  It is absolutely embarrassing that the greatest country in the world \ncannot keep services going. If we want to argue about whether these \nservices are important, that is a legitimate argument. Some of us might \nthink it is very important to have people tracking deadbeat dads. \nOthers might say, ``No, leave that to someone else, we should not do \nit.'' That is fair. That is the long-term discussion of what our \npriorities are. It should not mean that in the short run these hard-\nworking people are in limbo.\n  By the way, there are about 280,000 of them. That is 280,000 \nfamilies. My home county has about 215,000 people living in it. So \nthere is more unemployed tonight in this interim period than my entire \nhome county. It is unbelievable. You figure 280,000 workers, and many \nthem are married with children. You are talking half a million people \nwho are probably directly impacted by this.\n  Now, the Senator from Maine and I, Senator Snowe, have an excellent \nbill. It says Members of Congress should be treated the same way as the \nmost adversely impacted Federal employee. We had our efforts blocked \nhere also. This is a bipartisan effort here in the U.S. Senate. The \nSenator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, said put partisanship aside. \nI think that is very good advice. That is why I reached out to the \nSenator from Maine, Senator Snowe, and to Senator Dole, and brought \nSenator Dole and Senator Daschle both solidly behind this bill.\n  Over on the House, a Republican Congress has blocked it, blocked it, \nblocked it, blocked it, blocked it, blocked it, five times--stalled it. \nMembers of Congress who go on national television practically giggling \nwith joy at what they are doing, continue to bring home a pretty hefty \npaycheck. It is embarrassing.\n  Now, I have to say there is a show on CNN entitled ``Talk Back \nLive.'' A Member of the House leadership said that he opposed my bill, \nsaying--and this is directly from the transcript--``I am not a Federal \nemployee.'' Imagine--who pays his check? Some private corporation? No, \nthe Federal Government. But he does not consider himself a Federal \nemployee. He is more important. He said, ``I am not a Federal employee. \nI am a constitutional officer.''\n  Madam President, it is this kind of attitude that has led us to these \nunnecessary Government shutdowns. We are setting ourselves above \nothers, and that is dangerous. People who do that come down real hard. \nEver see people like that in life who set themselves apart, they think \nthey are so special? Well, some day, they will learn to be humble. God \nhas a way of doing that and so do the voters.\n  I continue to believe if we fail to do the most basic part of our \njob, then we do not deserve to be paid.\n  I want to read from this transcript from the show. Just so I put it \non the Record, this is Representative Thomas DeLay, who is the majority \nwhip over in the House of Representatives. Susan Rook, the MC, says, \n``I think Patty brings up a really good point * * * I want it go back \nto Representative Boxer in the Senate who cosponsored a bill, and it \nwas saying, `OK, we, the legislators, will not get paid' * * * Her \noffice said the bill passed unanimously in the Senate three times, but \nit was held up in the House because of Newt Gingrich. Your response?''\n  To which Representative Tom DeLay says, ``Look, Ms. Boxer''--he did \nnot say ``Senator,'' but that is OK--``Ms. Boxer is demagoguing this \nissue and trying to change the subject. Ask Ms. Boxer if she voted for \na balanced budget. She did not. She does not want a balanced budget, \nand she's trying to change the subject.''\n  Now, No. 1, he had no idea what I voted for. I voted for two balanced \nbudgets. It is in the Record. One was written by Bill Bradley and one \nwritten by Kent Conrad, and I support another effort by the Senate \nDemocrats, CBO scored, 7 years, balance the budget.\n  But, of course, he knows what I voted for, I guess. So he says I was \njust trying to change the subject. But the moderator does not buy it \nand says, ``Yeah, but if Federal employees are not getting their pay, \nor Marty--actually Cathy, right behind you. Marty you were telling us a \nstory. Now, you are a Federal employee but considered essential. What \nabout some of your supplies?''\n  Answer, ``Supplies aren't available. We work a 24-hour shift, so the \nfire department is our home for 24 hours. And you've got to basically \nration because the money is not in our budget, because there is no \nbudget * * * ''\n  This is someone in a fire department.\n  And then an audience member says--oh, and then she says, ``Marty, \nwould you feel better if they said, `OK, if you're not getting your \nsupplies, if they're not getting their paychecks, we won't get paid \neither'? Would that make you feel at least better toward all of them?'' \nMeaning us Members of Congress.\n  And the audience member says, ``Either that or else have them, you \nknow, cut back what they were making. They're making $100,000, I'm \nmaking, you know, 32.''\n  He is wrong, we are making $133,000. We are making $133,000 a year \nand we are getting our pay. And people making $32,000 and $24,000 are \ntrying to support their families.\n  Then another person said, ``Good ol' Newt. Pay him, but not the \ngovernment workers, by golly.''\n  So, people do not like this. And then it went on and on, people \nasking Mr. DeLay continually.\n  This is Tom DeLay, one of the leaders in the House. He says, ``Well, \nSusan, you can play all these games you want to change the subject. The \npoint here is that if the President was concerned about Federal \nemployees and their pay, he wouldn't have vetoed [all these bills].''\n  And she says, ``OK, but Marty's question * * * why don't you go ahead \nand take a pay cut? So would you support the Boxer bill or no?\"\n  And he says, ``No, I would not. I am not a Federal employee. I am a \nconstitutional officer. My job is in the Constitution. * * * ''\n  And then an audience member says, ``But why are you not a government \nemployee?\"\n  And he says, the leader, the majority whip over there, ``I am not a \ngovernment employee. I am in the Constitution.''\n  ``You are, sir,'' says another audience member.\n  And then the audience member says, ``Where is your ethics at? You're \na government employee. All of you are government. All of you fall into \nthe Federal Government * * * everybody gets paid by the Government.''\n  And then he says, Susan, why is it all you want to do is talk about \nsalaries, et cetera.\n  So, here you have a situation where the leadership of the Republican \nHouse of Representatives is thrilled and delighted to shut this \nGovernment down. They object to a very clean CR, that is a continuing \nresolution, to in fact keep this Government running. They want to put a \ngun to the President's head and hold this Government hostage. And he is \nnot going to do it. And that is where we stand tonight.\n  Madam President, I am going to complete my remarks, could I have just \nan additional 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Absolutely.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much. I just hope that Members who might \nhave heard me talk tonight will begin to feel a little bit embarrassed \nthemselves about the situation, a little bit ashamed about the \nsituation, and that they will not continue, over there on the House \nside, to block the bipartisan ``No Budget, No Pay'' bill. But more \nimportant, that we get this Government rolling and we sit down like \ngrown-ups, men and women, Republicans and Democrats, to debate the \nlong-term issues.\n  I know we can resolve the long-term issues. I know that we can. There \nis a lot of room for compromise. The Constitution wants us to \ncompromise. Our \n\n[[Page S19024]]\nfounders envisioned something like this. That is why they have \nsomething called a veto, and a two-thirds override. If you cannot get \nthat, my friends, you compromise to make it happen.\n  So I am prayerful and I am hopeful that we will all grow up around \nhere, start working together, and solve this crisis.\n  Madam President, thank you for your generosity. I yield the floor.\n \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/20/senate-section/article/S19022-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}]
